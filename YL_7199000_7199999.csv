This set up has a carbine buffer tube on it so you can attach ANY carbine stock to this buffer tube or remove it for a pistol grip only cruiser style shotgun which is how I currently have it set up. It has the buffer tube and stock on it in the photo but I have more photos, including photos of the cruiser set up if you want to see them. I can only post 4MB or less in images so you only get one on the ad. This gun is in overall good condition. It functions perfectly with no issues at all. Has no mechanical defects that I could find. Loads, shoots and ejects spent shells perfectly! The looks are this guns downside. It has lived a long life of being hauled around as a defensive shotgun. That just means it has seen little use but has a lot of wear. The finish is wearing, there are some scratches and dings, the bluing on the reciever is holding up nicely for the most part, the bolt and interior of the reciever are worn from repeated safety checks, it was left in a truck for a while and has some surface rust. This would be a perfect gun for someone looking to grab a Mossberg 500 to clean up and refinish or for someone that is just getting into shotgunning and needs something they can beat the hell out of and expect to keep shooting. This item is only for the Mossberg 500A 12 gauge shotgun with 18.5"" cut barrel and the two additional barrels.One - 28"" Accu-Choke smooth bore barrel with vented rib and dual bead sight chambered for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells purchased in ""never put on a gun, never fired"" condition and I have never fired it or put it on a shotgun but it does have a very small amount of wear from storage without a caseOne - 24"" Cylinder bore smooth bore barrel with semi-buckhorn rear sight and step elevation front blade sight chambered for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells in good condition with a small amount of wear and surface rustOne - 28"" modified choke smooth bore barrel cut down to 18-1/2"" cylinder bore (not cut down by me! I bought it this way without knowing it was cut down...) with no sights chambered for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells in fair condition with some surface rust and scratches and dings Note: cutting the barrel down is perfectly legal as long as it is over 18"" from the closed bolt, which this isThis was my first Mossberg 500 and I have decided to change platforms to the Remington 870 so this has got to go. The M500A in this condition would go for about $200 and the barrels go for over $100 each. I am asking $350 OR BEST OFFER for everything.The case in the photos is not included. You MUST provide your own case to legally travel with a long gun (it can be a $5 gun sock or a $250 Pelican case but MI law says it has to be in a container).When buying or selling long guns I will ALWAYS complete a proper bill of sale for both parties records which will include personal information from BOTH parties. I am a CPL holder and I prefer to deal with other CPL holders when possible. If you are not comfortable with this level of security and protection for the buyer and the seller, there is no reason to contact me about buying a firearm from me. I understand that this step is not a legal neccesity but I do it with every private sale and every private purchase to protect myself and to protect the person I am dealing with. You should welcome this and practice it with all firearms transactions.

Has only had about 30 rounds fired through it. In excellent shape. Comes with 2 magazines, and a light attachment. Message me if interested.Introduced in 2009, the CZ P-07 was the first handgun to feature the convertible Omega trigger system. A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools.The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa.The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before. Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year. May ship with or without a lanyard loop."
