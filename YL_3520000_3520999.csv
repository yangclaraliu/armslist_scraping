This is an excellent rifle and never gave me any malfunctions or other problems. Includes a Magpul FDE 30 rd magazine as well as rear MBUS and Magpul vertical foregrip. I have also installed a polymer Magpul picatinny rail on the handguard to accommodate for additions. 

The Burris Fastfire 3 with AR Mount (Absolute Co-Witness) can be added for an extra $200.

This gun is from before the Savage buyout of Stevens in 1920.  No serial number or date, other than the patent date of 7/2/1907. 

The finish is lacking, but this is a 100 year old rifle.  It's been used, obviously, but no damage.  The stock is as good as I've seen one one.  The buttplate appears original, not the flatter styles you see on some.  I'm sure the bore has some wear, but plenty of rifling intact and it's in good shape.

I've shot this gun on several occasions without issue.  As a disclaimer, if you are not familiar with these older falling blocks do NOT shoot high velocity ammunition out of it.  I'd recommend care shooting even standard velocity.  I've shot Federal AutoMatch out of it without any issues, but some others have resulted in bulging cases or backing out of the breach block.

For Sale:

Smith & Wesson Safety Hammerless New Departure or nicknamed by collectors as the Lemon Squeezer in .38 S&W CTG.

History: 32 and 38 Safety Hammerless models

The Smith & Wesson 38 Safety Hammerless models were produced from 1887 (1888 for the 32) to just before World War 2. They were chambered in either .32 S&W or .38 S&W with a five-shot cylinder. They were most often produced with a 2-inch, 3-inch, or 3.5-inch barrels; but some 6"" barrelled versions are known to exist.

These top-break revolvers were designed for fast reloading and concealed carry as the hammer was internal and would not snag when dragging the revolver from a pocket. They were known as ""The New Departure"" to reflect the company's new approach to designing revolvers. Minor design changes were made to these revolvers over the years, resulting in several different design models, as termed by collectors. The first model was manufactured between 1887-1902. 

This is a family pass down Smith & Wesson .38 safety hammerless 5th model made from 1907 to 1940. Serial number 255XXX indicates this gun was made around 1915 and sports a 4"" barrel. This gun retains literally all of the finish. The cylinder, barrel, bore, grips and frame are without visible wear. The mechanical action is tight. There is a small area of minor surface rust which is reflected in the price. Included in the sale is an antique paper box and documentation for a .22/32 Smith & Wesson Kit gun Model number 34. This was the result of another family Smith & Wesson .22 cal revolver paper box being mix up and switched over the years. There are some tools with the pistol that were used to clean a .38 cal Included is a half of a box of .38 CTG for test firing this gun and a leather clip-on holster. If you look at any internet firearm web site you will see this type of pistol being sold for well over $500.00.
Picture shows handgun with .22lr cal, .25 cal, 9 mm, .38 CTG and .38 Special.

The buyer must have a FOID card.
Show a form of identification such as a driver’s license.
Will sign a bill of sale.

I've shot about 300 rounds through it and never had a single problem with the original magazine, ran like a typewriter every time. The extended aftermarket mags are notorious for jamming and misfeeding (without minor modifications to accommodate the specific model of rifle). I recommend sticking to the internal 10, unless you know how to do the right mods or know a proffesional who can.

I'll be in town for late September and most of October before I start work and have to move.

One belt is in perfect shape and the other is also in great shape, but the vertical buckle bar will come out of you turn it to an angle while the belt is OFF. When the belt is on and fastened, everything is secure. That being the case, I'll basically throw it in for free!

It comes with a polished 3.5 lbs Ghost connector.

High vis sights.

Cerakote OD Green.

Extended mag release.

Stippled grip.

I bought this about 3 months ago along with 1000 rounds of 9mm ammo to practice with. My intent was to start shooting competitions. But this grip is just too small for my hands and as a result I keep shooting low and to the left. A friend of mine that shoots IDPA with a G34 can shoot the bullseye out with this gun , so it's not the gun it's me.

So, I want to sell it and get the Glock 41 or a Ruger 22/45 Lite that I can add a Tac-lite or Volquartsen receiver to. I would be willing to work out a trade for either or both. 

I've put about 300 rounds through it. No scratches, dings, blemishes, failure to feed or failure to fire.

I also have 700 rounds of 9mm target ammo that I would like to sell with it.

$650 for the G34 and $150 for the ammo. That's 21 cents a round. Or $750 for both.

No phone calls please.

It has been shown nothing but TLC. Was going to be a project gun but when once the optic was put on the receiver and the barrel was properly broken in... this barrel was just to good (Ive had good and bad barrels from Ruger on 10/22s) for me to bastardize this gun. So this has been a safe gun and taken out only to compare against my other builds.

The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged. KEY FEATURES: *Action design based on the venerable Model 870 – ultra-smooth and reliable *Rugged ArmorLokt coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces *SuperCell recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% *Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics *Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably *Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels *28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes *Sling swivel studs built-in *Includes Modified Rem Choke

One of them has a small I believe 2"" handlebar riser on it as well as a cargo rack and comes with a cover. Along with the purchase of both sleds I will include a set of garage dollies and a set of sure grip steerable dollies. Both machines run amazing and are extremely fast and great in any type of snow.

"" Features

This new lightweight drop-in from Boyds' is the first truly ambidextrous thumbhole stock and one that is sure to turn heads. For all its futuristic looks, however, the SS Evolution® is a purely functional stock. The grip angle allows the hand to assume the most natural position, and the palm swell on either side provides the most comfortable grip possible. Also, there is no forend contact with the barrel, so this stock will accept all barrel contours whether lightweight, sporter, or varmint weight. 

SS Evolution® Features: 
Lightweight ambidextrous thumbhole stock
Made of Stratabond Laminate for stability, strength and beauty
1/2"" leather-look rubber recoil pad for non-slip shouldering
Laboratory acid based satin finish proven to resist chemical and harsh weather conditions
The length of pull on this stock is 13 3/4""
The overall length is approximately 27""
The weight is approximately 2 Lbs. ""

With FFL fees etc, I have OVER $500.00 into this build. I would like $375.00 cash, FTF in the Grand Rapids area OR a Smith and Wesson M&P9 Shield.

So why would you want to buy this from me and not a dealer? Well number one, it's ALL quality parts and a GOOD deal. Number two, face to face transfer, no paperwork to fill out. 

If things ever go as far as registration, here is one no one has to know you have! 

I would prefer to sell this as a FTF but if you really want it shipped to your FFL, we can work something out.

Neat old gun and fun to shoot, but it doesn't fit in my collection anymore.

This gun is from before the Savage buyout of Stevens in 1920.  No serial number or date, other than the patent date of 7/2/1907. 

The finish is lacking, but this is a 100 year old rifle.  It's been used, obviously, but no damage.  The stock is as good as I've seen one one.  The buttplate appears original, not the flatter styles you see on some.  I'm sure the bore has some wear, but plenty of rifling intact and it's in good shape.

I've shot this gun on several occasions without issue.  As a disclaimer, if you are not familiar with these older falling blocks do NOT shoot high velocity ammunition out of it.  I'd recommend care shooting even standard velocity.  I've shot Federal AutoMatch out of it without any issues, but some others have resulted in bulging cases or backing out of the breach block.

I can send more pictures upon request.

I have a C&R FFL, so I will need a bill of sale with appropriate information for my bound book.  I am open to shipping to a C&R or FFL on your dime (actual shipping cost).  Open to offers if you think price is high.  Worst I can say is no thank you.

Open to trades.  Milsurps are what interest me most; Finn rifles, Enfields, Arisaka, Mausers, Swiss in particular, but will consider others.  I'll only consider modern firearms for local FTF trades only; bolt or lever 22's, 22 pistols, larger caliber rifles/pistols, you never know what might catch my eye."

It is currently my EDC, but I recently acquired another Glock 19 (gen 3) and considering parting with this one if the offer is right. At this time I'd rather trade for something of similar size and capacity, but offer away. Worst I can say is ""No thanks, not interested."" I'm very easy going so don't hesitate to let me know what you have. **I understand this is no $1000 dollar pistol, but I will ignore the $400 offers simply because of its condition and overall value. While it is not brand new, between the pistol, sights, and laser, it's value is around $900. THAT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECT TO GET, but it is why I won't sell it for the price of some SR9 or Sigma, or things of that nature. And don't even tell me I can keep my laser or sights because they don't fit the Gen 3, therefore I will have no use or want for them at that point. Also, the barrel in the pictures is not the stock barrel, but the original will be going back in. The nickel one in the pictures is from my NiB-X Gen 3 and is serialized for that pistol.**
So now, onto the firearm itself. It was purchased brand new by me about 4 years or so ago if I remember correctly. I've put around 800 or so rounds through her, and cleaned her after every range visit and periodically to keep lint buildup out of it. Slide and frame finish are basically immaculate. It currently has Trijicon Night Sights installed and a Crimson Trace laser grip. I have the OEM sights still and the 2 additional back straps that came with it. I have the original case and paper work with spent casing, and the 3 mags. Because I have my other 19, I am going to be keeping my hoster. It's nothing special anyway. 
I also have the paperwork and box for the CT grip with cleaning tips and allens for adjusting windage and elevation, as well as the OEM pin that the CT replaces in the grip. In short, I have everything needed in case you wanted to return it completely to stock. I have never done any trigger work or springs or anything, and never had a failure in any way. The only thing I did was the paint in the engravings to add a bit of contrast. Any questions, feel free to email me!
