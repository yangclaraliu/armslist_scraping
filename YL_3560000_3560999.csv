With the 18 1/2"" barrel you can maneuver around the doors and hallway of your home. Protect Yourself. Don't expect anyone else to protect your home, property or family in a break-in situation, as the response time for assistance takes too long. I very recently had about $1000 worth of stuff stolen by my garage. I figured I would just call the insurance company and they would take care of my loss. NOPE, The theft deductible is 1% of the value of your home. So if you have a $150,000 home, the 1st $1500 comes out of your pocket, so I got nothing back for my loss. I will tell you that if someone breaks into my home, I will shoot to kill....not shoot to wound. I don't want them coming back later. A shotgun shell is less than 50 cents and that is now my new insurance policy against theft.
STEVENS SAVAGE ARMS MODEL 320 12G PUMP SHOTGUN WITH PISTOL GRIP, GHOST RING SIGHTS- NEW IN UNOPENED BOX $240.00. The pictures I have attached are only stock pictures. The box is sealed and whoever buys it will be the first to open the box since manufacturing and it will look just like the ones in the pictures. Walmart sells a version of this shotgun with the inexpensive bead sights for $207.00 + tax ($226.49) with background check. The Ghost Ring Sights model runs an additional $35.00 + over the bead sight model and is favored. This model is not carried by Walmart as they only sell the cheaper model. Be legal to buy a shotgun and have your FL drivers license with you. I will fill out a bill of sale.

The Savage Stevens 320 12 Gauge Pump-Action Shotgun features a carbon steel barrel and a synthetic stock, both with a matte black finish. The shotgun is designed with a pistol grip, a rotary bolt, dual slide bars and a Ghost Ring Sight. Tube magazine. 5-round capacity.

Simple, economical, functional, the 12 Gauge Stevens 320 Security is a capable home defense shotgun. Incorporating dual action bars and proven rotary bolt design this shotgun has an 18.5"" barrel with ghost ring sights. Additionally the 320 utilizes a 3"" chamber and fixed cylinder bore.

Works the best with 2 3/4 high velocity shells. I was told not to use 3"" shells because the gas system could not handle it. I've done it a few times with no issue, but I would recommend not using 3"" shells for safety reasons. Using anything less than high velocity will cause ejection issues with the shells. I am not trying to get out of it, what I have into it. It's a fun gun to play around with, bump fire, destroy things with, street sweeper, etc...

Light weight with little to no recoil. Compact for maneuverability. This is a high quality firearm that I purchased a couple years ago. Due to the rarity of the ammo following the ammo shortages I have shot only about 200 rounds through the gun. It functions perfectly and is truly one of the best crafted firearms one can own. Included in the purchase will be all the original contents of the box (including the box itself), plus 6 clips (These were still $60 each when I bought them) and 9 unused boxes of 50 rounds of HP ammo each. That's a total of 750 rounds of HP ammo! This ammo is hard to find right now (in my area anyway), and is fairly unique to this and the FN Five-Seven handgun. I will throw in a partial box with about 20-30 rounds left in it.

If you’re considering this rifle you are probably aware of the many revolutionary traits of this civilian version of infamous P90. Below are some of the many features of this weapon platform.

•	Closed bolt, blowback operation
•	Hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel w/ ported muzzle brake
•	Bottom ejection port
•	Blowback operated action
•	Alloy upper receiver and barrel support
•	Synthetic thumbhole bullpup design w/ forward handstop
•	Molded-in rear sling attachment point
•	Ambidextrous Charging Handles
•	Ambidextrous safety switch inside trigger guard
•	Enlarged trigger guard
•	Ambidextrous magazine release
•	Translucent polymer body available in 10, 30, or 50-round capacity
•	MIL-STD 1913 accessory rail with integrated back-up iron sight
•	Includes (1) 30 round magazine. Colorado residents receive a complete magazine parts repair kit. Know any magazine capacity limiting laws for your area. 

I will sell everything for $1600. This is a fair deal, as far as I can tell, based on the pricing I'm seeing on other firearms of this type.

http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/dial-seven-six-two-smith-wesson-mp10-review/

The rifles are going for $1300 new with plastic hand guards. This is a nice rifle that has been done right.  Built and only shot enough to zero scope and text function. This rifle is brand new and all you could ever want out of custom 308 ar platform.  S&W uses an 18 inch light barrel with 5R Rifling in their lineup which is the same rifling used in M24 sniper rifles.  This thing is a tack driver and actually light weight for a 308 platform.  Asking $2300 – absolutely firm on this price so please no lowball offers, I’m in no rush or “have to sell” situation. Will break the package apart if requested as such: Stock Rifle , +pmag, factory trigger, troy rail and low pro gas block- factory buttstock and grip for $1500.  

Will consider trades for: Hk p30’s, HK 45 and 45C, HK VP9, HK 45 tactical and 45 Tactical compact, FN 45 tactical, High End 1911’s, 300BLK AR Pistol, FN Scar."

If the rifle isn't sold or traded in a couple of weeks I'm going to order myself a nice Boyd's stock for the rifle and keep it. Will trade for larger caliber rifle of like value, 1911's, Glocks, AR's etc. as long as they aren't junk and again, of like value. New this rifle alone retails for $1000. Then add the risers, rings and optics. I think my price is fair. Again, I don't NEED to sell it. Just don't really need another 270. Thanks!"

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

From the Kel-Tec Website: The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

The 9mm SUB-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK17, GLK19, S&W59, BERETTA92,  SIG226.

The .40 SUB-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK22, GLK23, BERETTA96, S&W4006, SIG226."

Now all the features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first and only single-stack XD® from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 or 4.0 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it, and pretty soon you’ll forget it’s even there.

The XD-S® Single Stack consistently astonishes and delights shooters on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The trigger on the XD-S® Single Stack feels more like it belongs on a target pistol than a carry piece. Shooters who are used to difficult, heavy triggers on deep concealment pistols will be astounded at the smooth, crisp XD-S® Single Stack trigger.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."

Trade Value: $500 for Glock 26 and $350 for Kah CW380

I have two items for trade:

Glock 26 Gen 3 in great shape with a low round count of 75. My 26 will come with everything it did new and a Pierce Pinky Ext to give one mag a plus 2 ability. I am looking to trade for a few items and depending on what you have I have kydex gear for a 26 / ammo / mags / Lee Hand Reloading Setup ready for 9mm / cash. I would be interested in the following,
Mossberg MVP Patrol
Entry Level AR-15
AK-47 Variant
Ruger Mini 14 
Ruger Mini 30
Glock 19 Gen 3 or Gen 4

Kahr CW380 Recent Production Model in great shape with zero issues. This Kahr has roughly 150 rounds through it and fires true and accurate for such a small package. My Kahr has been sent to Kahr to have the feed ramp polished and all rounds including hollow points run like butter. This CW380 is my wife's and she has went back to the S&W442 so I am looking to trade it for a Glock 42 due to me having larger hands. My CW380 will come with everything it did new along with a Kydex IWB Tuckable Holster. Depending on trade I do have extra magazines / ammo / kydex mag carriers for the CW as well. If you haven't looked at the CW380/P380 you should if looking for a small pocket pistol around the size of a LCP but much better quality and trigger in my personal opinion. 
Looking for: 
Glock 42"

Altamont rosewood Magna grips with Tyler grip adapter

This is the nicest S&W revolver I've ever owned.  Trigger action is light, slick, original.  
Lock up is the tightest I've ever seen.  Might have been carried a bit, but seldom fired.
EXTREMELY accurate, and easier to shoot well than most anything you might compare it to.
It did not have the original ""diamond"" grips when I bought it at Trail Creek Trading ten years ago, but the Altamonts are close and attractive in their own right.  Combined with the Tyler grip adapter, they maintain the classic original appearance.  I hate to sell it, but I have a chance to buy an original Vega Whyte Laydie banjo, and I need the cash.

Cash only.

I do not have the ability to post pictures, but will drive a reasonable distance to allow buyer to examine it.  Will even meet at a local range so you can shoot it, if seriously interested.  You pay your range fee, I will bring ammo."

The Glock 23 Gen4 introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol
with compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry and minimum
weight despite its large magazine capacity. The modular backstrap design
lets the user adapt the grip to hand size, and the frame surface exhibits
the scientifically-designed Gen4 rough textured technology. This model
features a dual-recoil spring assembly that substantially increases the
life of the system, and the reversible magazine catch easily accommodates
left- or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the Glock accessory
rail for accessory attachment.

their centerfire handguns for the P22 rimfire pistol. Standard P22 models
have a threaded barrel for easy addition of a suppressor or to change
to/from a 5"" target barrel. The Picatinny rail makes it a snap to mount a
light or laser. Low profile three-dot polymer combat sights won t snag

slide serrations for a non-slip surface with distinctive Walther styling.
It has a loaded chamber indicator for quick status inspection, an external
slide stop locks back on empty and three safeties - manual external,
magazine disconnect, automatic firing pin block safety. Double/single

trigger pull for single action. CA compliant models are available in 3.4""

*****I originally put this gun up as a standard then I thought it was a loaded so i changed the listing and THEN i realized it was a standard after having my local shop in hackettstown look at it. I bought this gun privately and was told it was a loaded. I realized the paperwork doesnt say its a loaded and I also realized if you put a standard and a loaded next to eachother both in green they're the exact same gun. Anyways I have original receipts for this gun bought this year in may and 1540 was paid for it. Ill provide original receipts too*****"

But still keeps the weapon safe and secure. The action and trigger drop into the mechanism guard and the lock clamps around the handguard. The action cannot be cycled while it is in the rack. This is basically the same kind of setup as you see in many police vehicles. It's a great solution for hunters and sportsman who want to keep their rifle handy but don't want to have to worry about it if they step away from their vehicle for a bit. 
It can also be an awesome home defense solution as well. You can keep a loaded weapon within reach and not have to worry about the kids messing with it or somebody walking off with it.  Just provide 12volt power through a hidden momentary switch and it can unlock with the touch of a button that only you know where is.

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record  keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."

Only 90% the size of a P226, the Mosquito, chambered in 22LR, is the ideal
choice for hours of shooting fun. Its wear-resistant polymer frame and
integral accessory rail is ergonomically designed to enhance accuracy and
provide a better all-around shooting experience. Additional features
include a rugged blowback system, fixed barrel and adjustable rear sight.
It's also loaded with safety features including a decocking lever and the
automatic drop safety you'd expect in a Sig Sauer pistol. It is further
enhanced with an ambidextrous manual slide mounted safety, magazine safety
and internal locking device. This model features a wear-resistant color
finish over the polymer frame and a stainless steel slide with a blued
finish. The frame finish, while wear resistant, is a decorative coating
that can be expected to experience wear from holstering or accessory
mounting. Contact with bore solvents or similar cleaning agents should be
avoided.

But still keeps the weapon safe and secure. The action and trigger drop into the mechanism guard and the lock clamps around the handguard. The action cannot be cycled while it is in the rack. This is basically the same kind of setup as you see in many police vehicles. It's a great solution for hunters and sportsman who want to keep their rifle handy but don't want to have to worry about it if they step away from their vehicle for a bit. 
It can also be an awesome home defense solution as well. You can keep a loaded weapon within reach and not have to worry about the kids messing with it or somebody walking off with it.  Just provide 12volt power through a hidden momentary switch and it can unlock with the touch of a button that only you know where is.

The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. The exclusive ArmorLokt construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that's barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it's time for action, the revolutionary SuperCell recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is the softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

So I picked this up on a trade yesterday and I'm not 100% sure its for me.  Ill list the pros and cons of this rifle.
Pros:
-Good looking wood furniture.  
-Pretty clean inside and out.
-STRAIGHT FRONT SIGHT
-Comes with four 30 round magazines and one 10 round magazine
-Come with approx 400 rounds of Wolf Ammo.

Cons:
-The grip had a small amount of damage as well as the bolt and the block so I just threw it all away.  Most people upgrade these parts anyways and a new grip bolt and block can be purchased for 6.00 from Midway USA.  

Not really set on a price, willing to accept reasonable offers and trades.  Would love to move this rifle today / tonight."
