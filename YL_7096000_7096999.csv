It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."

This one is a Winchester Model 1892. Gun is in very good condition. The wood shows typical marks from years of use, but is looks good still. The action works smoothly. Have not test fired it, but no reason why it shouldn't work after being cleaned and checked. Riffling looks good down the barrel with very light surface rust near the tip of the gun. I'm not a big collecter myself, so any questions ask. It's a really nice old gun, and its priced to sell quick. Call Jon at REDACTED, calls only please.

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."

I need help with $120 and I'm losing hope, I never lose my faith in G0d but I wont have a roof over our heads for my 2 year old if we don't come up with the money by tonight and this has broken me down more than you will ever know, we have been sleeping in my truck and I dont get paid till next Friday July 28th to pay the rest of the rent, my number is 615-439-8899, I would be more than glad to talk with someone and tell them our story and how we got here or please pray for me and my family as I'm just needing some help or a loan and anything that points me in the right direction, I dont care what it takes to save my family and will write a contract and sign it, let you hold my bank card or the registration to my truck I would do it or help would be something I would never forget, I'm really scared and have prayed and prayed and prayed and ask G0d to take care of this thank you and G0d Bless ANYTHING HELPS I'm only doing this for my 2 year old, if you can't help just please send me a message saying you will pray for me and my son thank you so much, I don't care what I have to do to keep this roof over our heads, if its a loan then I can give some collateral to hold, or I can do whatever to work it off I just need help, if its not the full $120 then anything helps even if its a little! Thank you and g0d bless, just a simple message saying I will pray for you helps as well PLEASE I need some assistance and just a friend to talk to that can help ANYTHING HELPS I ALMOST HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED please let me know if I can do anything to earn it or a loan would have written terms and I will sign it, I really need help and prayer as I am starting to panic and I can't find any help, I have a 2 year old and I just want the help for him please I can meet with anyone to prove I'm not a fake or a bad person I'm just in a tough spot, for some reason my cry for help is going unnoticed and don't know what to do, the reason he was able to make us leave until i pay that is due to me not being on the lease as I took over the payments for another person so I wouldn't have to pay a down payment and he is being really unfair, I will even let you call and talk to him cause I don't want people to think I'm not a real person that needs help, PLEASE JUST A SIMPLE MESSAGE SAYING YOU WILL PRAY MEANS ALOT, cause I can't find the last bit of help I desperately need, , I posted this as my last resort so if someone could please explain why I can't get help or if there is something I should do to make people know that I am real person in need of help, , well to prove I'm really in need I will meet at a police station or anywhere that makes you comfortable, this has been the hardest thing we have ever been through, G0d bless ANYONE who takes the time to message me and say they will pray for us THANKS The only reason I am posting here is cause I am running out of options and losing hope so I know it will most likely be flagged but I just need a friend, still haven't found any help and I'm facing the toughest decision I have ever faced and need guidance thank you"

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. Check out Tim from the Military Arms Channel as he puts it through its paces:  First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. Designed to minimize creep and stacking, the P-10’s trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5 lbs and rebounds with a short, positive reset, meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1.Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

It has a C/H frame and 1-pc walnut grip. This is the steel (not brass) model. 5.5 inch barrel.It is quite beautiful. I have only only shot mine on two occassions, putting a total of eighteen 22 Mag rounds through it and just under fifty 22 LR rounds through it. It is in excellent condition, but not quite collector's condition (there's one small scuff on the 22LR cyliner).To swap calibers, all you need to do is change the cylinder which can be done in 20 seconds without tools. 22 mag really barks out of this gun. Both calibers have proven accurate. The sight system is the old cowboy style groove and blade, not adjustable. The trigger pull is crisp and light.Very fun to shoot. The weight of it makes 22LR feel recoilless. And like I said, accurate...I can pick off small fruit all day at 50 yards.I will include with the firearm the original box, owner's manual, both cylinders, a black leather Galco holster, and 32 22mag bullets (remainder of box I never finished).
