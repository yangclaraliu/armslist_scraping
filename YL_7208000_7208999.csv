There was quite a bit of money invested into this Rifle to try and make an accurate AK-47. The previous owner had a gunsmith who worked exclusively on AK's install a two stage trigger, lighter hammer and hammer springs, extremely sturdy railed top cover that is very different from most that you see as this one has a small lip at the front that secures under the rear sight and also features Allen head screws in the rear of the top cover to give it an incredibly tight fit so there is no movement of the scope during firing. It currently has a leapers 3x9x40 mounted and it's actually pretty dang accurate with that scope but if a better scope was mounted I think it may achieve even greater accuracy. Also the great thing about this Rifle is all you need is another top cover and you can remove the one with the mounted scope pop a regular top cover on and you have aRegular Norinco AK with a longer barrel as there are NO holes drilled into the receiver to mount the scope and you can essentially have two guns in one. Heck If you throw a 75 Rd or 100 Rd drum in it and a bipod on the front (which is another nice thing about this Rifle as it has the bipod ring for mounting of a standard bipod on the front of the barrel behind the front sight) you have a nice RPK support weapon and a sniper in one. This is a very good price for the amount of money that was put into this Rifle and the end product is actually quite nice. This also has a threaded barrel and Dragunov Type Muzzle Break which reduces recoil to almost nothing. If you would like another muzzle attactmemt just let me know as I have standard thread protectors and slant muzzle breaks. Will ship to any FFL holder in the lower 48 for $40. If shipping is required I prefer PayPal send money to family and friends as payment. Email, Call, or text REDACTED."

Rarely shot, but it works like a champ!  For it's age, its in great shape, although it just got the fresh LONG scratch on it, but if you buy some gun stock scratch repair, Birchwood Casey's Blue solution, Boiled Linseed Oil, or any number of wood stock scratch repair solutions, it'll be a easy fix.  Youtube will help you if your not sure...  Research it, and get back with me.  $350 cash or maybe I'll trade, but I'm not adding cash to any trade, my trade value needs to be at least $600.  Price is firm, thanks for your time."

This would be one of those packages. You are looking at everything you need to hit sub MOA groupings at practically any distance. This is a complete package and ready to go. Absolutely no expense was spared, this is the best of the best.
 
First we have a Barrett MRAD in Sniper grey (the single best color they make). She is chambered in a 22 inch fluted 308 barre. I’ve put about 500 rounds down range with this barrel and she is an absolute dream girl. $6000
http://www.eurooptic.com/barrett-mrad-308-win-rifle-system-grey-cerakote-receiver-22-black-fluted-barrel-14370.aspx
 
She has a Nightforce ATACR 7-35x56 scope. I tried everything on the market and this thing is so crystal clear. You can count the hairs on an ant’s head at 1000 yards. $3500
 
http://www.eurooptic.com/Nightforce-ATACR-7-35x56-F1-ZS-1mrad-Illum-PTL-Mil-R-C570.aspx
There is only one correct way to mount a scope and that is with Spuhr mounts. There is no substitute for the Spuhr ISMS SP-4006. $410
http://www.eurooptic.com/spuhr-unimounts-34mm-height-34-mm-135-length-121mm-476-0-mil-0-moa.aspx
 
For exact range finder, the Silencerco Radius is spot on and comes in handy if your hunting or not at a range with designated yardage. $1000
 
http://www.eurooptic.com/SC-Radius-SilencerCo-Radius.aspx
Along the lines of Silencerco products, she is whisper quiet thanks to the Silencerco Big Bore Harvester. $1500
 
http://www.eurooptic.com/silencerco-harvester-big-bore-no-mount-suppressor.aspx
To make sure you never see a mirage, the suppressor is wrapped in a hi-temp Armageddon Gear suppressor cover. $80

Each barrel has the Silencerco Big Bore Muzzle Brake. $100 each
 
http://www.eurooptic.com/silencerco-harvester-big-bore-3-4-x-24-hbb-muzzle-brake-mpn-sc-ac858.aspx
Speaking of barrels, she comes with a brand new 26 inch 338 Lapua heavy barrel. $1350
 
http://www.eurooptic.com/barrett-mrad-338-lapua-conversion-kit-26-heavy-14277.aspx
A brand new 24 inch 6.5 Creedmoor heavy barrel. $1350
 
http://www.eurooptic.com/barrett-mrad-65-creedmoor-conversion-kit-24-heavy-barrel-14289.aspx
One magazine per barrel isn’t enough so she comes with an extra 338 magazine. $75

An extra 6.5 Creedmoor magazine. $75
http://www.eurooptic.com/barrett-mrad-308-win-10-round-magazine-black-12885.aspx
 
If you know anything about the MRAD, you know that it is about as simply to change barrels as it gets, the hardest part is swapping out bolt heads. Well you don’t need to do that with this setup, It comes with a designated complete bolt for each barrel. It is literally the easiest route you could possibly go. $375 each
http://www.eurooptic.com/barrett-mrad-mrad-breech-conversion-kit-14674.aspx
 
Of course, you can’t have the best rifle without the best bipod. The super strong Atlas 5H is the correct way to go. $450
http://www.eurooptic.com/BT35-LW17-Atlas-5-H-Bipod-BT35-LW17.aspx
 
Bringing up the rear she has an Accushot BT monopod. $100
http://www.accu-shot.com/catalog_new/accu-shot-monopods/63-bt13-qk-prm-precision-rail-monopod-mid-range-with-qk02-quick-knob.html
 
Not shown in the pictures but included are both the standard pelican hard case she comes from the factory with as well as the optional but super nice Barrett soft case. $250
https://store.barrett.net/p-2657-soft-case-blk.aspx
 
Every gun shop carries high quality 308 and 6.5 ammo, but finding premium 338 Lapua ammo is a little harder so lets go the extra mile and include 200 rounds of Black Hills 300 grain (20 rounds are in the two magazines). $120 per box, $1200
https://www.midwayusa.com/product/REDACTED/black-hills-ammunition-338-lapua-magnum-300-grain-sierra-matchking-hollow-point-boat-tail-box-of-20
 
But 200 rounds just is not enough. This gun is too fun to shoot. So another 400 rounds of the incredibly accurate Hornady 338 Lapua 285 grain A-Max rounds are also included.  $95 per box. $1900
https://www.midwayusa.com/product/REDACTED/hornady-match-ammunition-338-lapua-magnum-285-grain-eld-match-box-of-20
 
Between the price of everything above, shipping, gunsmith time, and taxes,  I have over $23,000 into this rifle. If she goes to the right home, I’m willing to see her off for $18,000. This is less than Barrett Deployment package but includes so much more. 
 
Lastly, yes the suppressor is included. All NFA rules apply and if you do not own any suppressors, we can discuss further how the transfer on that would have to take place (there is a waiting period). Other wise everything else you could have the same day. i’d prefer a face to face in the state of FL but willing to ship if out of state."

Chambered in .45 ACP. and fires 'semi-auto' from 'Open Bolt' positionHere's what comes in my bundle:* The gun itself w/ nylon grip support & low original serial number (Serial # 0003660)* Barrel extension with shroud* 8 - 35 round mags (all original grease gun style in great shape)* 1 - 16 round mag* 1 Magazine loader* Original nylon/canvas bag (w/ multiple compartments)* 2 original nylon/canvas/leather magazine pouches w/ shoulder slings (each pouch holds 4 - 35 round mags)* Shoulder sling for the gun itself* Book 'Full Auto Volume Three'. This is the bundle topper. It's a book on how to convert your semi-auto M10 into a Full-Auto M10. It shows many different ways it can be done though I personally do not condone doing it, as doing so would be a Federal crime if caught. Book is completely legal as is the knowledge of the mods and is meant to be for novelty/collection only.This gun is 100% LEGAL.$1650 or no trade."

It is covered and hidden from view under the rear of the slide. This allowed the pistol to be carried in, and withdrawn from a pocket quickly and smoothly without snagging.This pistol was actually fired by action of a hammer striking and driving a firing pin into a center-fire cartridge's primer. The hammer was covered by the rear of the slide. The ""hammerless"" designation was merely an advertising designation pointing out the pistol's particular suitability for concealed carry. Special features include a serrated slide to prevent slippage during manual cycling of the slide, and two safety mechanisms (a grip safety and a manual safety). The grip safety is a spring-loaded piece making up the back strap of the pistol. The grip safety, though not solely restricted to them, was a typical feature of Colt automatic pistols. A magazine safety was added on later models; this feature prevents the pistol from being fired with a round in the chamber and the magazine removed.[2]"
