I've started carrying Glocks pretty much exclusively, so this pistol has kind've fallen out of the rotation. This is a perfect all-in-one turnkey carry setup. This Comp-Tac holster is probably the best and most comfortable holster I have for any gun I own, the thing absolutely disappears when you wear it. Pistol has very limited carry wear from probably 6 months of cumulative carry use over the course of 3 years. Round count is roughly 400, although I stopped keeping range records for it around 250 so I don't know the exact total. It's a very slick shooter though. Comes with 2 8-round mags and very bright Night Sights, as well as the original box. Please contact me with any further questions, but only if you're a serious buyer. Thanks!"

Its open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows one cartridge at a time to be loaded should the magazine be lost or damaged. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or door.

I have put maybe 1000 rounds probably more like 800. These billet receivers are a great set, with a very tight fit. Finger grooves are cut into the lower for easier and better grip in cqb type training or competition. I took off my Noveske 14.5 Barrel so I did not have to worry about NFA/SBR stuff.  I have replaced it with 16 inch Satern/Liberty Barrel 1/8 twist .223 WYLDE.   For those out there that do not know the difference with 5.56/.223 & WYLDE, please see below...Enter Bill Wylde. Bill had the idea to create a chamber that would serve the 5.56 and the .223 Remington equally well. The .223 Wylde has the same chamber angling as the standard 5.56 chamber, so there’s no problem with pressures, and it also has a .2240 freebore diameter. The result? You have a chamber that is sufficient to handle the hotter 5.56 load without concerns about pressure and you get the gilt-edge accuracy that’s common in many quality .223 rifles. Is there a compelling reason to switch to a Wylde chamber? Well, the most obvious reason is that you can fire .223 ammo without giving up accuracy and 5.56 ammo without worrying about excess pressure.  Better accuracy, more versatility with ammo—so what’s the downside? Well, right now that can be cost and availability. The gains that the .223 Wylde provides haven’t prompted a whole bunch of companies to swap to that chamber.Differing from a milspec AR lower, Loki’s Biller features an integrated, oversized triggerguard and what they call a CQB magwell grip.Loki also changed up the magazine well and frontstrap. The well is reshaped and enlarged, which helps speed a rapid reload.What you get:*Burnt Bronze Cerakote Job by Jared Harsh of Harsh Firearms Norman*LOKI AR15 UPPER/LOWER BILLET 7075-T6 Aluminum Burnt Bronze*16inch Double Fluted Satern Barrel .223 WYLDE****BRAND NEW**** Never had a round pass through it.*Samson Evolution 12.37""*Bravo Company BCG*Griffin M4SD II Compensator ****Brand NEW********Barrel Nut*.750 Low Profile Gas Block and Tube*Bravo Company/Vltor Chargin Handle* ACE M4 SOCOM Stock 5-Positin Collapsible Aluminum Black & Burnt Bronze Stock*Lower has JP Red Spring trigger 4 1/2 lbs*KNS Precision Non-Rotate Anti-Rotate Trigger/Hammer Pins*Standard Buffer Tube and Spring.*Forward assist and Dust Cover"

I stumbled across this 9mm version at Gander Mountain after a Sig rep told me they were only making them in .40/.357. When I called back, he said it was a “very limited production run” of the 9mm model. Only reason I’m selling is because I bought the same pistol in .40 SAS for carry, so this one’s available.

I believe it was made sometime before 1963. Overall condition is serviceable... This rifle was neglected and left to rust, however I managed to clean up the rust the best I could. Bore is good, and the bluing is fair to good. The action is smooth, and the trigger is amazing.This will make a great shooter. Want a SAKO and not have to worry if it gets banged up? This is your rifle!I've seen these rifles going between $1,000-3,000. I understand this rifle isn't perfect, so I'm willing to be pretty flexible on pricing, however, SERIOUS OFFERS ONLY."

Front sight has been changed out to a fiber optic sight but original is included. Comes with manual, hard case and gun lock. 4” barrel is in excellent condition as well with sharp rifling intact. $579 Ruger® GP100 is a rugged and reliable Double-Action Revolver that serves equally well for field carry in the outdoors, home defense, law enforcement, and target shooting. The Blued GP100 is built on a robust, medium/heavy frame of premium carbon steel. To withstand recoil from heavy 357 loads, a triple-locking cylinder is locked into the frame at the front, rear, and bottom so it stays aligned without getting sloppy over time. A full-length rib along the top of the barrel adds weight, and provides ample steel to dovetail the front sight, making the sight easily replaceable. The rear sight is fully adjustable for windage and elevation, and the factory ramp front sight is easily seen, while providing minimal interference when drawing the sidearm from a holster. The angle of the GP100's peg-style grip frame, and the recoil cushioning Hogue® Monogrip®, greatly absorb recoil and allow the shooter to stay on target while firing the revolver in double-action mode. A full-length ejector rod shroud puts extra weight out front to reduce muzzle flip, allowing for faster sight acquisition on follow up shots. The Ruger GP100 has a smooth double-action trigger pull, and a clean, crisp break in single-action. The solid frame of the GP100 has no side plate, and the revolver disassembles into large subassemblies with no tools, aiding to ease maintenance in the field. As with all Ruger Double-Action Revolvers, the GP100 features the patented Ruger transfer bar mechanism that provides an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge—the revolver can be dropped directly on its hammer and will not fire without the trigger being pulled all the way to the back. The Ruger GP100 Double-Action Revolver is solidly built sidearm that will serve a lifetime of hard use. Made in USA.The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432REDACTEDwww.Lincolnpawnshop.com"

This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.

Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Despite the small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety. Variant 1 has HK's enhanced double action only LEM ""Law Enforcement Modification"" trigger configured with a ""light strike V1"" setup - requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.

The gun has different numbers but the the year stamped on the barrel is 1912 which is pretty rare to see. I fired the luger it was fun but you have to appriciate a gun that is over 100 years old the history behind it. The gun has been sitting on my desk for a year and it's time to let someone to really appreciate.  I am willing to ship the gun but same rules apply. With the paper work behind this gun has to be FFL dealer. If you have a FFL that make paper work so much easier for both parties. It's the law for hand gun seales. So please do not email me asking to meet up to do a under the table transaction becuse I will not do it.Ok a few rules I have please read first all all I know what the gun is worth so do not send me a low ball offer and giving a bs story. I won't respond to it and will not sell it to you. I'm not interested in trade and sorry your 22 is not worth a lot of money. Also don't come to me with a old story or add in a paper saying German Lugers sell for only $600 and show me a ridiculous add from the early 80's the year is 2017 not the 80's.Another thing to be clear on. If you do not have the money to buy any German Luger stop ask for a deal. I do not care if you can only pay $400 it won't happen and I will not buy into your sad story. Please just respect my rules and not try to scam me. Thank you

Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with 5R Rifling at minimum bore and groove dimensions, minimum headspace and centralized chamber.   20 MOA Picatinny rail secured with four, #8-40 screws for increased long-range elevation capabilities.

In-line recoil path manages recoil directly from the rear of the receiver to the buttstock, not through a traditional bedding system, providing maximum accuracy potential.

Magazine well front is contoured for a positive grip for bracing against shooting supports.   Oversized bolt handle for positive bolt manipulation, with 5/16""-24 thread for easy replacement. Bolt disassembly tool is stored in the bolt shroud for easy striker channel cleaning.   ""Lower"" magazine well halves are precision machined from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum and are Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.

Ruger Marksman Adjustable™ trigger is externally adjustable with a pull weight range of 2.25 to 5.0 lbs.; wrench is stored in the bolt shroud.   Extended trigger-reach AR-style grip and 45° reversible safety selector. May be configured with any AR-style grip and selector.

The upper is the CQB MRP® Piston Top End from Lewis Machine and Tool in 5.56. This upper, called their Monolithic Rail Platform, is made so that by loosening one small bolt and removing the other you can slide the barrel out and replace it with the 300 Blackout barrel. That barrel is direct gas impingement so a second bold carrier group for DGI is also included. The 5.56 barrel piston barrel is brand new with absolutely zero rounds other than those fired at LMT and the piston has two settings, semi-auto and suppressed. The 300 Blackout barrel has around 600 rounds downrange but the BCG is brand new. This upper alone sells for $1939 and the 300 barrel is another $459 (not including the additional BCG).The lower is a brand new build using a Spikes Crusader multi-caliber with BAD takedown and pivot pins, Timney drop-in trigger group, KNS anti-rotate pins, Griffin Armament AR-SOB buffer, JP Enterprises polished buffer spring, POF buffer tube, Radian Talon safety selector, Strike bolt release, Odin Works extended mag release button, ERGO Grip and B5 SOPMOD buttstock. There is over $500 invested in this lower!Included are one black and one FDE PMags so you can keep your calibers straight. The YHM flip-up sights shown are not included in the price but can be added for an additional $150. I am not interested in parting any of it out, thanks."

This glock is truly one-of-a-kind…you won’t see another like it anywhere. The pics don't do it justice...the color is actually darker than it appears in the pics (almost an exact match of ford raptor blue)
Slide: lightening cuts to reduce weight on the highest points of reciprocating mass for reduced muzzle flip and faster follow-up shots. Front chamfer cut, Dawson Precision competition sights…fiber optic front, serrated flat blade rear. Glock OEM extended slide release.
Frame: Permanently attached/blended beavertail, grip width reduced and re-profiled for improved comfort and ergonomics. Mag release relief cut, ghost extended mag release and Dawson Precision Ice magwelll. Undercut trigger guard . Custom stippling for improved grip with unique tribal dragon design
Trigger: Keneti-tech flat aluminum trigger with polished trigger bar, Ghost Pro 3.3 connector, Zev competition springs (6lb trigger spring, reduced power safety plunger spring, 2-3-4-5.5-6lb striker springs (has 3lb spring installed). All internal polished to mirror finish. Sear/striker relationship checked with dyechem and stoned to perfection for clean, crisp break. This is the best glock trigger I’ve ever felt... just under 3lbs, light, smooth pull with no mush or creep, and absolutely no pre-travel or over-travel, while retaining the firm, tactile reset glock triggers are known for (trigger pull can be reduced to under 2lbs by simply installing 2lb striker spring). Cerakoted a custom blended color: kel-tech navy blue mixed with tungsten to produce a dark metallic blue
This gun was built from a brand new glock 17 Gen 4 and is in MINT condition...has been to the range twice with @100 rds down the pipe
Comes with 3 OEM mags with +2 baseplates, all original parts, and everything from factory.
