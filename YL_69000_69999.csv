Caliber: .44MAG/.44SP
Capacity: 6 Rounds
Barrel Length: approximately 6""
Front Sight: Red Ramp
Rear Sight: Adjustable
Grip: Plastic Pachmayr & Wood Factory 
Frame: Large (N-frame)
Finish: Blue
Overall Length: 12""
Material: Carbon Steel Frame and Cylinder
Weight Empty: 48.5 oz.

Revolver is used, in good condition - I've put about 10 boxes of ammo through it but I purchased it in used, so it has seen a fair amount of action. Still functions perfectly. There is some wear to the finish where you'd expect (front of the cylinder where lead accumulates), not quite as much as it looks in the picture. There's also some minor wear to the top strap due to scope mounting (see below). The rest of the blue still looks nice.

It's pictured with Pachmayr grips (ugly but cover the backstrap, hurt less to shoot) but I also have wood (walnut?) factory grips. Still have the rear sight assembly, but I had a scope mounted on it for awhile, and when i went to replace the rear sight the small mounting screw had gone missing......you might need a new rear sight assembly but more likely you'll just need one screw.

Edit: I purchased the revolver around 2000, and I'm pretty confident it is 90's manufacture but if you want more info about serial #'s etc. I'll try to accomodate you.

Sold for 280 dollars. And none of you tire kickers offered me more money for it. Unbelievable :P"

It uses a precision micro-textured reflector and a SureFire incandescent lamp to produce a smooth, brilliant beam with enough power to temporarily blind and disorient an aggressor by impairing his night-adapted vision. Output is either 65 or 120 lumens, depending on which easy-to-install lamp you use—high-output or ultra high-output. The tactically-correct pushbutton tailcap switch provides secure, ergonomic activation control: press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on. The Z2's patented CombatGrip™ body improves performance with various flashlight/handgun techniques, such as the Rogers/SureFire technique, and provides a secure hold in wet or cold conditions or while wearing gloves.

This car belonged to my ex-stepdaughter who nolonger has a need for it. I just did a tune up and oil change on it and don't need two cars myself. I am interested in selling it out right or trading it plus cash. Runs and drives great. The car is mechanically solid as she had to have reliable transportation between Newton and Wichita for school. There is some wear on the interior and the black exterior has some scratches and dents so the car is not perfect for having 190K miles on it. I am currently driving it daily between Newton and Wichita as it is getting nearly 22mph. This vehicle also has the heads up display which projects the current speed onto the windshield. The engine does have a very small oil leak.

These guns are able to be converted into four different calibers including .22, .25, .32 and .380 this particular one only comes with .32 caliber but you can often find other conversions on the web.

-O.D. green PS90 with factory fresh optic

-7/50 round FNH mags (not the cheap Korean knock offs and some still in box unused)

-Mag coupler

It is now DISCONTINUED. The IOM has a M1913 accessory rail, serrated slide and trigger guard, and fully adjustable rear sight. It also incorporated magazine safety mechanism to prevent the weapon from being fired without a magazine inserted. IOM’s have the rounded trigger guard for gloved finger. The IOM Model use to be only available for agency purchase. Yeah, this is the REAL DEAL. Gun dealers are saying USG IOM. Or IOM with conventional square trigger guard. These are not IOM, but are USG. USG’s are NOT nearly as valuable. This is a REAL IOM model, not a standard USG that sellers MISREPRESENT as IOM's. The differences between the IOM and USG models are: IOM's have only sold about 4700 pieces. IOM's have a rounded trigger guard instead of a square one. IOM's have a smoother grip than the harsh checkered USG grips. 
 Shooting one of these are best described as an AR-15 5.56 round coming out of a pistol with a recoil of a .22 long rifle. These pistols are very accurate too. IOM’s aren't made anymore and have become highly collectible. It comes with one 20 round magazine and a box (not the original box). Unknown round count. Gun is in excellent condition. Bargain priced for rare collection gun. ----$1000 firm-----. Can’t find one on the internet cheaper if at all. Especially local.

Bear in mind that I am not interested in trading for any less than what I am asking for.  I am not interested in any other guns, cars, dogs, stamp collections, washing machines, workout videos, waffles, or anything that is not an AR-15.  I will also accept $1200 cash firm.

--------------------------------------------
First, let me say what I need in an AR.  
--------------------------------------------
I need an AR-15 from a reliable manufacturer (RRA, S&W, Bushmaster, etc).  Let me know what you've got, and please have a picture.  I would prefer a 20"" barrel, 5.56, and some extra mags.

--------------------------------------------
Now, let me get on to what I'm offering.
--------------------------------------------
I have a PSL-54c manufactured by Romarm and imported by Century International Arms in 7.62x54r.  I bought it about two years ago, and I probably have 2000 rounds down the pipe.  I have done a lot of work to this weapon, and had more planned.  There are a couple of things that I have left unfinished to my regret, but it will make a great project for you to finish.  All the serials match except the scopes, but you almost never find matching scopes.

* I replaced the stock (crappy) trigger group with a Tapco G2 with a 4# sharp break.  There is almost no play to this trigger, just a slight squeeze and... SNAP.  
* I have done considerable work to the furnature, including sanding off 2oz of wood for a cleaner look, and completely refinishing it with a beautiful kingwood color.  
* The barrel and receiver have been cryo-treated.
* Replaced the original LPS 4x6 scope with a Russian PSOP 6x24, (both scopes are included), and replaced the red light with blue, which is easier on the eyes.  Something in the light isnt making correct contact with either the original bulb or the new one, so the light is unreliable.  I cleaned most of the contacts, but something still isnt right.
* Mounted a Harris HBRM-S bipod.

Now for the two things I started but never finished.  I started polisihing the bolt carrier, but only made it about half way.  looks great until you take the weapon apart.  And, I was started stripping and bluing the metal, but only finished the receiver cover, but I don't think I like the color, so... I stopped to consider other options.

The feed ramp needs a good polishing.  Occasionally a round fails to feed correctly.  Re-racking fixes the problem 99% of the time, and polishing the ramp should fix it permenantly.

------------------------------------------
So now, what it comes with.
------------------------------------------
8 magazines in various conditions.  All of them work well.  Properly fitting magazines for PSLs are really hit or miss, so good ones can be tough to find.  Four of the magazines have been cleaned up and painted, but two of them have chips and scratches in the paint. (I was in the market for a bake-on finish, but never got around to getting it.  Three of them are beginning to show a little rust, but I have cleaned them up pretty well.  They were the next in line to be refinished.  One magazine has stayed in my cabinet and is in original factory condition.

440 rounds of silver-tipped Russian steel core ammo in the can.
~200 rounds of Yugo light ball.  I didn't actually count, this is just an estimate.

Both scopes and bipod.  Covers for both scopes.
Original sling.
4 pocket mag pouch
Original three piece cleaning rod & cleaning kit, and oil bottle.

Aluminum rolling case in rough condition.  It's seen better days, but it still works.

-------------------------------------------
Conclusion
-------------------------------------------
Wow, I wrote a lot.  Guess it's a good time to wrap it up.  I have a lot of time and money in this gun, and really, only half of my heart is into trading it.  But... it's time for a new toy.

I have a dozen or so other photos.  MSG me with your email address if you would like to see them.

Face-to-Face ONLY in the North Dallas area.  I need a straight trade only, I have no money to throw in no matter how good the deal is.  You must be over 21 and have a valid Texas drivers license, ID, or CHL (prefered)

It has a 2-1/2"" barrel, which I have been unable to confirm if it is factory or not. The finish has seen better days(including scratches in several places), so I am not certain on the serial number, but the batch numbers are quite clear. The grips are Ivory, but I do not believe they are original as the fit is not great. Due to other markings, I'm lead to believe that it is later in the 2nd edition run of the New Navy 38s, likely around 1902. The action locks up tight and I would not be afraid to fire it with period specific loads, but I have not done so. Because of the condition of the finish, I see this as a perfect opportunity to get a great rare gun, and have it refinished to your liking. I'd be glad to hear from any one who might offer any more information after seeing the photos. Feel free to ask any questions and I'll do my best to answer them.

If you are wondering about availability of ammo… 7.5x55 Swiss was the standard infantry cartridge of Switzerland until the 1990s. They are currently selling it off. It is called GP-11 and available from gunshows and online companies like Sportsmans’ guide. It is excellent quality and non-corrosive—a real bargin. PrviPartizan also loads 7.5x55 Swiss in reloadable brass cases for prices that beat Remington, Winchester, Federal, etc. The bullet diameter is nominally .308, so bullets appropriate for .308 Winchester, 30-30, and .30-’06 also work in the 7.5x55. The reloader will never run out of ammo. With the number of K-31s imported to the US, I am confident ammo will be produced for them for years to come. 

There are also gunsmiths who can covert them to accept .308 Winchester or any of its descendents (.260 Rem, etc.). One can also buy an excellent scope mount from a company called RockSolid Industries or SwissProducts if one is considering turing this into a true hunting rifle. The 7.5x55 is nearly identical to the .308 Winchester. The barrels on K-31s are very high quality, too. I have a semi-inlet fancy Claro Walnut monte-carlo stock for $125 if you want it. Send this thing to E.R. Shaw or some similar outfit and I am sure they could turn it into a world-class hunting rifle. I have $50 Mojo aperture sights if you want them. 

I greatly prefer FTF deals as close to the West side of Cincinnati as possible. My prices are fair. I will trade for things I am looking for: Ithaca M37, S&W 44 Mag revolver, Ruger No. 1 or 3, f, T/C Encore, Finnish Mosin-Nagants, a nice little S&W or Ruger Revolver for my wife's purse.

Brilliant fire-blued sight-spring. Stock a bit rough but no crack or spilts even in the handguard. The arsenal disk indicates almost a perfect barrel/throat condition, which is somewhat unusual. Barrel does indeed look excellent and it shoots very well. Around 1.5 MOA with quality handloads.

6.5x55 is available just about anywhere a good selection of rifle ammunition is found (BassPro). Remington loads it as does PrviPartizan of which I can sell you all you want for $13 per 20 round box. 

The sights are calibrated for 300 meters, so I bought a taller front post and filed it down so its on a 100 yards. They are very good adjustable sights. The overall quality and condition of this rifle is very good. No rust, though a lot of blueing has worn away. Trigger is a somewhat heavy 2-stage. The Swedes made these during peacetime with the greatest attention to quality and condition. No other Mauser is made as well, is as smooth, or is chambered in as good a caliber. I have the very basic carrying strap, sight hood, cleaning rod, stripper-clips ($1 ea), and bayonet ($35) for it as well. 

The small ring Mausers make superlative sporterizing candidates for Eastern game like Whitetails. 6.5x55 is a truly superlative cartridge with excellent range, great accuracy, and moderate recoil. Off-the-shelf parts are available for this rifle which can lead you anywhere you want to go. 

I have Mojo Aperture rear sight for this rifle for $50.

Appears to be choked in what today would be called modified from the patterning I have done. Nice steel lever to open action (not cheesy pot-metal button like that found on the H&Rs and NEFs). No plastic or pot-metal anywhere on this shotgun! Only walnut and steel. Nice case-coloring on receiver. Trigger is about the best shotgun trigger I have every felt. Hammer has nice knurling to help grip it in the cold. There is some light rust in places (negligent previous owners), but I have thoroughly cleaned it and found that keeping it oiled down prevents further oxidation. Inside of barrel is clean and shiny. Can’t be beat for a new hunter tagging along. Great rabbit rig, too.

Ithaca Model 37 Featherlight 12ga-2 3/4 Full Choke, 30"" barrel

IMHO the gun is in great shape for the age...shoots great too.
Little rust pitting, not much, cleaned and oiled
Blueing is Fair, not sure how to judge
Some wood scratches shown in pic, but thats it.


I emailed Ithaca, they replied back about the age, although most of the documentation has been lost over the years, she did confirm the age to be 1949........but I believe I recall them saying 1954 a few years back when I first got the gun.

I think $250 FIRM sounds like a good price, might consider a TRADE...(.22 Pistol, .410 Pump)

Is on a form 4 and will be less painful to transfer to another WI resident. Pretty much if you can walk in a gun store and legally buy a handgun, you are eligible to own this. Civilian Machine guns could of not been manufactured after may 19 1986 that's why they come with a heavy price tag but is a good investment. Buyer required to file a form 4(I will assist) and I will pay the 200 dollar tax stamp to ATF. No Class 3 dealer is needed if buyer is a WI resident. The Link is registered not the rifle, which can be picked up or delivered upon payment. And yes the rifle can have any barrel length when link is installed but must be removed when link is removed if it does not meet the 16 inch legal length. All NFA rules apply, No trades at this time.
