Good rifle, comes with a 3-9x40 scope.The Mosin is a rare hex receiver from 1928. Also good condition. Barrel is straight and bore is good. Very accurate. Only problem is the finish is starting to come off on top hand guard. Doesn't effect use of rifle and isn't very noticeable. Rifle comes with bayonet and other varied accessories. All serial numbers match.I'm looking to trade for other old rifles, especially WW2, so send me your offers. I'll look at most all old military rifles, especially ones in original condition, but sporterized ones will be considered. The ones I'm most interested in are Swiss K31 or Model 1911old Mausers in 8mmLee-EnfieldsSpringfieldsM1917 EnfieldsTrade only. Text or email only please. Thank you."

It was made with the best quality US made and German parts. The receiver was a new special weapons receiver this is NOT AN HK MADE receiver. I had to list it as HK because there was no option for other. The barrel is a stainless hammer forged 3 lug 1/2x28 tpi PDW barrel so you can screw on a suppressor or fake suppressor. It was made with a heavy duty machined SD shroud and new rubber hand guard. The trigge pack is a genuine FBI safe semi trigger housing that was bought and clipped and pinned by HK Parts dot net. It includes 3 never shot made in Germany 30 round magazines. This was a new receiver and is built as a pistol but you can add a stock if you register it as a SBR. The pictures US made A4 stock is NoT included but can be added for the right price. I was about to permanently fix it in the closed position to use it on this pistol. Price is pretty firm. This is FTF in Ohio only all ridiculous offers and scams are ignored.*****NO INTEREST IN AR15 TRADE *****

There is some rust on the reciever, and some near the muzzle. Bore is ok, at best. There is some pitting, but that is to be expected in these guns. Im sure it will still provide years of service to come. Included in the sale is a box with a few darts, some .22 blanks, and the blank firing insert. Also, I recently found out that Fiocchi still makes 32ga shells, so it could also be used as a normal gun. Price is OBO, but please, no crazy low balls. I can be contacted via email, or by calling REDACTED. As this is still considered a firearm, a background check would be required for me to transfer the gun to a buyer."

The stock is in wonderful condition. It comes with an attached  bayonet that doesn't have a scratch on it. The gun looks brand new. In 1947 only 120,000 rifles were made, and all production by Izhvesk stopped after 1948. All numbers are matching. The stock is a transitional stock which is why it's light in color. War rifles had dark stocks, commercially made rifles had these lighter color stocks. I will throw in 30 rounds of ammo Bore shiny maybe never shot.
