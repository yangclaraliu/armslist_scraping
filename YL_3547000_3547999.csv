Pistol was originally all black but previous owner had frame coated OD Green and added grip tape material to handle. This is how I received it in a trade. Pistol is as pictured so please ask any questions prior to bidding. Pistol includes original box, Protec Nebo Weaponlight (regular & strobe settings) and two (2) 30rd kel-tec magazines. Sadly, no manual was present when I got it. Buyer should be able to aquire a copy of manual from Kel-Tec. It is the buyer's responsibility to know if firearm is legal in your state. Payment must be made with a U.S. Postal Service Money Order (NO Personal Checks, Credit Cards, or Non-USPS MO's. If you try to pay with anything other than a USPS Money Order than this will DELAY shipment until funds are determined cleared by my bank.)

This is my full-size Glock 22 Gen 3 pistol. It has a Streamligth TRL1 and a Talon gun grip on it. It does have Glock's night sights on it. This is an excellent shooting firearm, it has a low round count right around 500. 

It has been through several tactical rifle manipulation courses, so the handgun and flashlight do have some holster wear on them. However, that is to be expected on any firearm being used in the field. 

I'm really looking for a Glock 23, I want to have something that I can conceal better than a full-size frame. 

As you can see in the pictures I have an older Bladetech non-light bearing
holster with a dual magazine carrier that I could let go with also. This is an excellent holster for an beginner or moderate shooter looking for something for 3 gun, or range use. 

If I was to sell this is what I'll be looking for as far as price:

Glock 22 w/ Night sights and 2 mags - $550
Glock 22 w/ Night sights, 2 mags, and Streamlight - $625
Glock 22 w/ Night sights, 2 mags, Streamlight, and holster package - $700

The Talon grip can be taken off with no residual effect; However if you haven't used one I suggest you give it a shot! It cost me less than $20
and it is worth 10x that. Give it a go, I promise you'll like the grip texture-- or we could take it off. Ether way. YouTube host Hickok 45 turned me on to them and I've been using them ever since. 

I'm not opposed to parting things out, or open offers. Like I said, I'm really looking for a Glock 23, a 19 would be okay also. ONLY GEN 3. No gen 1, 2, or 4."

With this revolver you can shoot .357 Magnum and .38 special. I have fired maybe 30 rounds through this gun. very low recoil for a .357, as this thing is made right- check out the reviews. .38 special through it feels like a .22  .... A beautiful gun, but i just dont find myself carrying it or shooting it, so i could use the cash. I am looking for $700 for everything- to include gun, holster, and ammo. If you do your research this is a very good price. I am firm on the price- but REASONABLE offers will be considered.  If i was forced into a trade i would be looking for a Glock 34, 36, 41 or an AK rifle and or maybe a Tavor plus cash on my end.  questions just ask. thanks for looking."

This UZi is made off an Israeli receiver, It has the  Star that has the center defaced by Norinco which signifies it was an Israeli platform converted by Norinco. It shoots great, action is smooth, all parts are fit correctly, no rattles. 

This rilfe is extremely accurate. The stock is easy to collapse and also deploys with a slap of your hand. The barrel shroud is purpose built, not just a tube of metal. It replaces the barrel nut which is also inculded. Uzi;s have some heft to them which makes them extremely low recoiling and improves accuracy. They are notorious for dependaility, ruggedness and reliability. The sight radius is long, and the sight picture is amazing. It has a rear peep sight that just works perfectly you can see the front post clearly with both eyes open or with one eye open, very fast target aquisition. I was very impressed, much better than most iron sights i have viewed on various weapon platforms. 

I really like this gun but I still need cash to pay some bills. Otherwise it would be staying in my collection.

Bought this for concealed carry about 2 years ago but never carried. I found another gun I liked better in a different caliber and sold most of my 9mm ammo so the Taurus has just been sitting around doing nothing. I've only put 50 rounds through it and I've taken it out for cleaning and oiling a couple of times. This is a great gun for concealed carry as its got a glock style trigger safety as well as an external slide safety which I always felt better having since this gun is small enough to just slip into your back pocket. (Shooting yourself in the ass will ruin your day in a hurry) Asking $300 and that's firm but I've also got 40 hollow point rounds that go with it at no extra cost. I've already been burnt a couple of times so I will not hold the gun for anyone or any reason. The first person to put the cash in my hand walks away with it. If interested you can respond to the ad through email or text me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking.

I'm a recently ets'd army staff sergeant with a kid going to school full time. My schedule is fucking packed and I assume yours is too.   This is a badass rifle that weighs close to what an m14EBR does, with a bullet four times heavier. Awesome.

I've got ammo for sale as well. Four boxes of quality factory FMJ. If you take it with the rifle you can have it for 4.00 (160) a round. If not it's 5.00 a round (200). A buddy of mine sits at the range all day and charges people ten bucks to shoot his once - while I think that's douchey and prefer to let people enjoy everything American for free, the possibility to pay for itself exists. 

Oh and don't show up with fake ass money, because I bring counterfeit gear and you'll go home with less than you showed you with. Don't know why people make life hard. 

My cell is 253-330-7545. Please don't call. I'm in school and have a kid, text and I will respond. I can send shooting videos of my recent up north trip.
