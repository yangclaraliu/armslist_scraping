Heres a little more info on it

The M22 is the ideal range pistol. The M22 brings you handling and 
performance that is closer to the modern defensive handgun than any other rimfire pistol. Designed for inexpensive high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate rapid fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut for modern pistol practice.
The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a Lothar Walther match barrel, standard on all models, an extremely crisp, 4-lb single-action trigger and adjustable sights.
Each M22 comes with a 10-shot magazine, manual, training target and tools to adjust the front sight and lock the trigger in place."

The slide is marked with two lines and reads ""EJERCITO ARGENTINO SIST.COLT.CAL. 11.25mm MOD.1927"" which means Army of Argentina.  These guns were made in Argentina under license from Colt, with Colt machinery, and with help & supervision from Colt engineers, and are known as ""Model 1927 Sistema Colt"" or Colt system. 

This particular ""Sistema Colt"" has matching serial numbers on the frame, slide, barrel and every single part is original with the exception of the grips and the finish. I have added NEW very nice custom Cocobolo wood grips and will include a Wilson Combat magazine. Other than that, it is still in its original collector state! 

The gun is fully functional, however, has collector value since it has all matching serial numbered parts and is NOT an ""import"" which devalues the guns. This is a GENUINE Federal Government ISSUED Colt 1911-A1 made in Argentina by Colt machinery and Engineers. The military crest is clear and not rubbed off or worn down which also adds to its value.

This would make an AMAZING showpiece as well as a carry gun since it is fully functional 1911! I had this checked out & cleaned by a professional gunsmith specializing in 1911s.

These medium frame pistols deliver .380 ACP power in a personal size package and maintain the reliability, safety and performance features of Beretta's legendary 92FS. The Cheetah pistols feature an open slide design that increases the reliability of the firearm. The frame is made from an aluminum alloy that delivers the strength and durability of steel, but with 65% less weight. The automatic firing pin block (FS models) prevents the gun from firing in case of inadvertent drops or strikes against hard surfaces. Features such as these, and the built in reliability and quality, make the Cheetah a natural for personal defense and an ideal back up pistol. I have had no feed problems with either FMJ or HP, and never an FTF. I have had no feed problems with either FMJ or HP, and never an FTF. Excelent for womens hands if there smaller and dont like allot of recoil.

I'm selling some ammo for a buddy who is about to go to Germany and can't take it with him. For those of you unfamiliar with Georgia Arms, they are a company that does high quality factory reloads. I have shot a little over 1000 rnds of their .45 ACP and had 0 malfunctions. I have found it shoots at least as well as WWB and CCI's low cost ammo. He shoots alot, so all of the ammo is very fresh (less than 2 months old). Also, for all of you frugal pistoleros out there, keep in mind that I won't make YOU pay shipping or sales tax on this good deal. I don't have any problem breaking all of this up, so send me a message and let me know what you want."

Description:
Ruger Model Security Six 357 Mag. The introduction of the Security Six and its variants marked Sturm Ruger’s first attempt to enter the double action revolver market. The corporation's earlier designs had been Colt Peacemaker style single action revolvers. Ruger used investment casting for most parts in an effort to hold down production costs.

 As with all Ruger firearms, the Security Six revolvers were robustly designed with large, heavy-duty parts for durability and to allow for investment casting. The ""six series"" line enjoyed sales success because of their basic features, and solid construction. This SA/DA revolver sports a 4” barrel with a front pined iron sight. It features an adjustable rear sight, six-shot flip-out fluted cylinder, case extractor, checkered hammer, and a pair of Pachmayr black grips."

I still have the factory night sights if you so choose to switch them out. I may just have my gunsmith take out the TFOs and reinstall the factory night sights so that I can use the TFOs on another 1911.

If anyone is interested in doing some trading, here is what I am interested in; Desert Eagle 1911 G, Kimber Pro SIS 1911 Models, Springfield Operator 1911, other high end name brand 1911s, or will consider two gun trades for my Kimber; for example: I will accept Beretta, Glock, Springfield, Sig, Walther, Smith & Wesson, but with those type guns, it will have to be a 2 for 1 deal because the Kimber costed me $1250 out the door, thats with a military discount! So please don't waste my time.

If I get no offers by the end of November, I will keep the Kimber. Thanks for looking.

Heres a little more info on it

The M22 is the ideal range pistol. The M22 brings you handling and 
performance that is closer to the modern defensive handgun than any other rimfire pistol. Designed for inexpensive high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate rapid fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut for modern pistol practice.
The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a Lothar Walther match barrel, standard on all models, an extremely crisp, 4-lb single-action trigger and adjustable sights.
Each M22 comes with a 10-shot magazine, manual, training target and tools to adjust the front sight and lock the trigger in place.

Both come with the original case, all of the screw in chokes, and all of the shims for the stocks. Both were used to shoot sporting clays and have never been in the field. Great condition. Asking $800 each or buy them both for $1500. Makes a great his/hers or father/son combo.  Sorry for the crappy cell phone pics but its all I have to use right now. I live in Wellington but work in Wichita, so can meet either place or anywhere in between.

The rifle sits in a stock made by Remington for the russians way back in 1916 or 1917. You can see where at one time it had a Finnish Army unit disk in the buttstock. The handguard appears to be from another russian rifle at some point in time. The receiver also appears to be Remington. It has mostly been scrubbed by the Finns, but there is still a R within a circle stamped on it. That seems to be all I can tell about the history  of this particular rifle.

The bluing is about 90%. The bore is bright with strong rifiling (should make a good shooter) The numbers are Finn matching meaning the bolt and barrel shank match. The floor plate is lined out. It has a cleaning rod and sling."

I have shot 30 rounds through this gun and it is very accurate, as they used a 1911 style Bushing System on the barrel insuring tight lockup. It looks as if the trigger pull is adjustable as well from a look at it field striped. 

I say this gun was manufactured in 1976 because there is a warranty card that Indicated the gun had a one year warranty from 1976...I  also have the original Wax Paper, Instruction manual etc...
This Gun was made to be used because the top of the gun has a satin finish vesus shiny nickel, so the shooter did not get blinded by the reflective nickel in sunlight. I would guess that less than 200 rounds have gone through this gun because it does not feel broken in yet. This gun is in Mint condition when you consider its age... I am trying to prep for the hollidays, in case you are wondering why I am selling

I bought this scope for my AR15 but I want to get an Eotech. I really like this scope but I need to cut back on my rifles weight hence why I am selling this scope to put the money towards an Eotech or Aimpoint.

This scope is awesome. It has a red illuminated doughnut reticule which also acts as a range finder once you memorize the MOA of each line and circle (which is covered in the included manual). It is adjustable from 1X to 4X power. The glass is great and it also has a cross-hair focus adjustment ring. It takes 1 CR2032 batter to power the illumination although you DO NOT need the illumination on to use the scope. 

I have only shot 60 rounds with this scope. It has held a zero perfectly and I have been pleased with its accuracy. I have a little over $260 in the whole setup, but I will sell it for $200. Of course if you are not able to meet me to pick it up then you will have to pay an extra $10 for shipping. I will deal face to face cash transaction or money order then ship transaction only. I am able to meet within reasonable distances.

EMAIL ADDRESS:   REDACTED

I will sell outright or trade plus cash for Eotech or Aimpoint or Adams Arms Gas Piston Conversion Kit for a carbine length gas system.
