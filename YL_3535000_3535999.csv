This is a pre-crossbolt safety model.  It is in very good condition.  The wood to metal fit is perfect.  The bluing is deep and shows very few minor flaws, same as the wood (let's see you go 36 years without any imperfections).  Even the screws and high wear areas look great.

It currently has a fixed power 4x32 scope installed with a set of see-through rings so you can still use the iron sights.  I will also include a set of brand new receiver plug/screws if you want to take the scope off.

The action is slick and the gun is accurate.  Also included is a partial box (40 of 50) of PPU 240 grain JHP moving at a blistering 1,542 fps.  That puts this round on par with Buffalo Bore's Deer Grenade offering.  The once spent brass is also included for the reloader.

There are way too many great pictures of this rifle to just be limited to three, so please see the link for a dozen more photos.  Sorry for the random patches of matte and shiny areas, my lighting isn't the best.  The finish is uniform over all the blue and wood.

Comes with Magpul bad lever, Magpul 6 position stock w/sling mount, Blackhawk single point sling. I had the lower on a 6.8 and maybe ran 50 rds through it. Super clean.

Next I have a TacCon 3MR complete trigger system new in the package if you haven't seen one do some research this if the Ferrari of drop in trigger systems with 3 diff modes. Here is the description straight from TacCon website.

The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™’s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

Closest to full auto you can get and completely legal to own again do a little research you will be amazed there one bad system. 

I will sell the complete lower alone for 475$
I will sell the TacCon 3MR trigger alone for 425$

This is a non recall model. It is chambered in .300 Win Mag and is mounted on a Choate Sniper System synthetic stock, free floating barrel. As for the sights i have a Leupold Rifleman I 4x12x40mm mounted on Leupold rings.

I picked up the rifle and stock together about 3 years ago for sport shooting and big game. It's been solid, reliable, and fun. Never had one issue with it. Always fired and was accurate the entire time. I have put a fair share of rounds through it. First day for sighting it in i ran 120 rounds through it with no temp issues or accuracy. The stock on it is great and well balanced. The shock pad is adjustable and takes alot off the recoil. I mean if i can put 120 .300WM shells through it and still shoulder it that should speak for itself.

It's always been maintained well and cleaned after every use and treated very well. I hate to see it go but college is a first priority. I bought this rifle for 650 with just the action and stock and added the rings and scope myself. So what i'm letting it go for is a pretty good price and hopefully it goes to a good owner who will show her alot of love.

If I knew this full size .45 shoots as softly as my 9mm compact, I would be upset that I sold it!  The rotating barrel concept does work significantly to reduce recoil, plus the gun is highly accurate.  I actually think the full size is not too big to carry (I did put the low profile levers/decocker kit on my compact 9mm, which I would suggest doing for carry).  So why I am selling?  I keep telling myself...STOP buying guns!  I have too many and if anyone knows of a ""Gun Buyers Anonymous"" group, please forward info. :-). I want to sell, not trade.  I have priced it very fairly, so please don't ask for a lower price.  I can keep it and have plenty of .45 ammo to put through it.  Thanks.  All Illinois laws followed for in-state transfers."

Massachusetts Compliant
Glock 22 .40 cal Gen 2
Professionally Cerakoted is by Connecticut Liberty Coatings in FDE - Flat Dark Earth
Serial Number: CBZ832
Approximated manufactured date: November 1996 (prior to The Massachusetts Gun Control Act of October 1998)
Two ten-rounds Glock original mags (1 brand new)
One Glock original Tupperware box
One Glock original manual
One Glock original mag loader
One Glock original cleaning rod

WOW!!! A complete set!!! Very rare and desirable. 

And just to sweetened the deal, I'm throwing a brand new holster for this G22, for free. That's right: A brand new Blackhawk SERPA Concealment with belt loop and paddle platform.   

Condition:
This pistol is used but in outstanding shape. It looks and operates as a brand new G22. I would say 98%, but look closely at the high definition photos and make your own assessment. Always cleaned after range shooting. About 400 to 500 rounds through. Never had a FTL or a FTF. It will eat any kind of commercial ammo.  No reloads. Great accuracy. This pistol had recently been professionally inspected and cleaned by A Glock gunsmith prior to this sale, and this Glock got a perfect bill of health.

The only ""bad"" news about this sale is that this G22 is going to be shipped to Glock in Smyrna, GA for refinishing of the barrel and slide in the next few weeks and as you probably know, they will also replace all internals of this pistol and refurbish the old magazine. So this G22 will be in Georgia for 4 to 6 weeks. But when it comes back, it will be near perfect condition!!

Of course, all this care and love is not cheap... It will cost you $860, plus transfer fees. By the way, if you're looking for a cheap Mass Compliant Glock, please move along. There're many $450 to $550 G22 available around, and most of them will include the pistol and only one magazine and sometimes the box, if you're lucky. But MY G22 includes a complete set of ORIGINAL Glock parts and accessories, plus a brand new holster. That's why my price is $860.00. But my G22 is the type of pistol you will keep in your home and pass it to family members and will certainly become a collectors' piece one day, because it is immaculate!!

Think about it: You're getting two magazines ($55); Tupperware box ($30); mag loader ($10); cleaning kit ($20); manual ($15); Cerakote finish ($100); visit to Smyrna ($80) = $310. Plus the market price for a well taken care G22 = $550. And let's don't forget the brand new Blackhawk holster, a $50 value, for free!! 

So, what're you waiting? Hit ""contact seller"" now and let's make an arrangement for you to see this pistol, when it comes back from Georgia.

Small Print:
Sold AS-IS. No trades. No refunds or returns. Price is firm. Cash only. Buyer responsible for shipping and transfer fees. No exception. Shipping will be via UPS or FEDEX. I will send this pistol to your FFL either directly or via my FFL. Your choice, but buyer will also pay my FFL fees (usually $35). If you don't like or disagree with these terms, please move on to the next pistol and don't waste your time with my G22. I will not reply back if you want to change these terms. But if you like what you see, hit ""contact seller"" and if you're serious about purchasing this weapon, we can meet at Hoffman Gun Center in Enfield, CT for you to inspect it. They will ship it to your FFL if you're out of state resident and you'll have it right away."

Up for sale is a brand new, never fired, still-in-the-box ATI Firepower Xtreme GI 1911 chambered in 45ACP (4.25"" barrel).  Manufactured in the Philippines like Rock Island Arsenal 1911s, these guns have great reviews and are rock solid bargains.  The GI version has a nice bonus beaver tail grip.  Perfect for carry, range shooting, or for a BOB or truck gun.  Only selling because I am looking for a full-sized 1911 (already have one this size).

Check the specs at: http://www.americantactical.us/940/detail.html

Must be a VA resident age 21 or over in order to purchase face to face.  For face-to-face sales, I request a copy of the buyer's driver's license, concealed carry permit (preferred) or some form of official ID--I will provide the same in return.  Cash only.  No Sunday sales.  

Willing to ship at buyers expense to buyer's FFL dealer (payment via PMO only)--that will probably add about $40-60 to the price since I need to have my FFL ship it out.  If wanting to ship, contact me for the price--not gouging on shipping, just need to get the pricing from my FFL dealer.  Buyer is responsible for knowing the laws of his/her jurisdiction.  If you cannot legally own the gun in your state, I will not refund you any of the costs associated with shipping.

I apologize for the stock photo, but it looks just the same.  Happy to send pics of the actual gun in the box if you want to see them, or just check it out in person!"

It comes with: 3 holsters (mikes vertical scoped, mikes vertical w/o scope, and drop leg tactical), 5-star speedloader, speedloader pouch, boresnake, mostly full box of 325 grain 454 bear load ammo, mostly full box of 45 colt ammo, speedloader full (so just 5 shots) of 454 hollow point ammo, rail attachment, quick detach scope rings, weaver 2x fixed handgun scope. Below I have everything and about what it would cost to buy new. So to pick all this up new it would cost about $1300 dollars or so plus tax and transfer fee. Of course I know since it's used I won't get quite that but considering Taurus firearms come with a lifetime warranty (doesn't matter if you're the first owner) you can't go wrong with this gun. Also, if you are unfamiliar with the raging bull just so you're not surprised this a really heavy gun and with some of the more potent 454 rounds can have a pretty snappy and disorienting recoil... but I guess you might just be looking for that.

It's not an all matching Mosin but still interesting enough. I haven't seen many like mine so last time it was appraised it's value was $450. This appraisal was 5 years ago so I'm sure everyone knows from guns to bullets things have skyrocketed. I think it would be smart to hold onto a mosin like this because it's almost reached it's 100th birthday which coincidentally is the same year someone leaves office. So two reasons to celebrate. Anyway I'm just seeing what else is out there and will consider any offer.

Product Description: For the infantryman, target ranges vary in ever-changing battlefield conditions. The HHS provides a solution for engaging threats in CQB situations, then quickly transitioning to a 500m targeting or surveillance situation, and then quickly back to a 25m room clearing exercise. Instant transition is achieved through a quick Switch-to Side (STS) mount that offers a simple, quick disconnect feature to remove the magnifier and base. This durable, night vision compatible system offers wide field optical performance with superior light transmission for visibility in extreme low light conditions.The EXPS3-4 is configured with a new ballistic matching reticle image for the M4 carbine. The battle tested circle/dot reticle will be offered along with a series of 1 MOA aiming dots that are vertically aligned and calibrated specifically for the ballistic drop of .223 caliber ammunition. The reticle provides 4 aiming dots for target distances of 0-300m, 400m, 500m, and 600m. The use of a magnifier is stongly recommended. Aiming dots may not be distinguishable from each other without magnifcation.Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight lengthBallistic reticle specific to .223 caliber munitionsCompatible with Gen I-III+ Night Vision Systems (tandem operation)Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail spaceBattery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achievedAverage battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hoursSide buttons, NV compatible with an adjustable, locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removalFeatures of EOTech EXPS3-4 Red Dot Sight:1x magnification, 1.2 x 0.85"" display windowUnlimited eye reliefParallax free illuminated reticle, NVD compatibleTransmission holography heads up reticle display20-level adjustable reticle brightness with scrolling functionReticle pattern: 65 MOA red circle with four 1 MOA red aiming pointsBullet drop compensated aiming points (up to 600m) for .223 caliber ammo1/8"" solid glass front window, 3/16"" shatter-resistant rear windowAnti-glare coated window surfaces1/2 MOA impact point correction±40 MOA adjustment rangeReturn to zero within 2 MOAIntegrated quick-release Picatinny / Weaver mount."

693,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3535693,"For Sale:  Black Powder Collection - Varied Armaments for Sale - Rifles, Pistols, Cannon","NE Portland, Portland, Oregon",$ 150,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 3, 2015",Muzzle,Remington,no type,no type,no type,"Hello Armslist,



        I have a few odd duckling black powder guns that don't fit with my standard calibers, so I'm putting them up for sale. They've all been awesome to shoot, but I just don't have room for dozens of different kinds of ammunition and powder.


    First, I have my pride and joy; a CVA Hawken Percussion Rifle, .54 Caliber with iron sights and ramrod. Also included is roughly 100 .54 balls, as well as roughly 100 percussion caps. This gun is pretty but has some dings and normal wear-and-tear from my hunting trips. The picture shows my brass Hawken; the grip is steel(or painted brass) on this one. Asking price: $320

    Next, I have a Jukar Percussion Pistol, .45 Caliber with iron sights and ramrod. Also included is small powder horn on a leather strap, still about half full of FFFFg powder. Asking price: $140.00


    There are two Pietta revolvers, all brand-new, never-fired. Pictures will follow soon, but you can feel free to google them, as they are all new in the box. Details:

-1858 New Army Remington, Steel Frame, .44 cal                              -     $320
-1858 New Army Remington, Stainless Steel, .44 cal                           -     $420



      These are beautiful revolvers, brand new in their boxes with all the paperwork, and can be had without an FFL transfer, as they are technically 'antiques' instead of 'firearms' under BATFE regulations. Once you pick one up, all you need is some powder, shot and wadding, and you're ready for the range. These revolvers, unlike their original counterparts, are rifled for better accuracy. I personally love that Pietta does this; it makes hitting a man-sized target possible past 20 yards, unlike the true 'smoothbore' revolvers. I highly recommend 'baby pumpkins' as the best targets this time of year. They explode quite dramatically when a lead ball zips through them.


     I also have a small 1-pounder 'frontier cannon'. Barrel was cast in 2001. Slight surface rust along muzzle area, but nothing to worry over. The carriage is pretty rough; it was a stop-gap measure until we completed the sleigh carriage that these cannon were originally coupled with. But this little beauty will launch a solid shot over a hill, or mulch a piece of plywood with a canister round. Aside from my Parrott Rifled cannon, this one has been by far the most fun to shoot. In terms of scale, the barrel is 4ft long, bore diameter is 1 3/8""; this cannon is the type you would have found on Lewis & Clark's launches, or really any trading launches throughout the 19th century, to give them an added advantage over the native populations. The weld marks are still visible, I work on grinding them down and removing surface rust almost daily. Asking price: $340.00


        Finally, a small derringer from the 1850's, created somewhere in London. The markings have been worn down significantly so it's hard to tell, this information is from a professional appraisal. It is the third pistol down, in the third picture. Asking price: $180.00


     Keep an eye on this ad; I have several un-appraised pistols and rifles that will be up as soon as I have them professionally appraised. And I am always trading and collecting more black powder and old guns, so the list can change daily.


Contact me anytime via email with questions or comments. I am always open to offers or trades, and my prices can be flexible. Don't hesitate to contact me; the worst I can say is 'no'.



Regards,
   Thomas"

The Rural King store in Waterloo, IL has the SAR K2P 9mm on sale this week for $249. I'm picking mine up today. I've researched the gun and it's all over the internet for sale from $350 to as high as $550.
     I have found nothing but great reviews this gun. SAR is a well made Turkish gun and as it's popularity rises, so will the price. Extra mags and holsters can be found on the internet. Mags are as low as $23.
   I'm not affiliated with Rural King in any way. I just watch for their gun sales and I get the best deals from them."

It is a fantastic carry gun as it actually has 3 safety positions! Comes with case, speed loader, extended mag and regular mag. It is basically 2 sized guns in one. Using the regular mag, it makes for a nice concealed carry weapon. Also comes with an extended mag to make it full size. Be legal and I will do a bill of sale.
The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.
The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber.
Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

Made in Italy.  When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959.  Bore is in excellent shape.  I don't think it was shot much, as the magazine release wasn't working right (actually the problem was with the magazine).  10 seconds of dremel work to the magazine only, and now she functions perfectly.  Has a tip up barrel.  Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...).  You never rack the slide to shot this gun.  You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round.  For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity.  Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action).  The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger).  Very nice aged look.  It looks much better than the photos indicate (horrible contrast and hard light).  Nice, and small for concealed carry.  Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one.  Own a classic Beretta for only $235. Private sale.   Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm.  Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor.  Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license.  If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $140.00.  I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."
