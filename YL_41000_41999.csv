Near as I can tell it was assembled at the end of WW2 and brought back by a G.I. as a war trophy. It has mismatched serial numbers and no nazi or import marks. The finish is thin on the grip and has some wear you'd expect of a pistol this old. The only issues it has is you have to push the mag release to install a mag and sometimes the hammer will follow the slide when shooting, being double action it's not too big a problem. I have six magazines for the pistol, 2 are Walther banner mags that one appears older than the other. Any questions or offers don't hesitate to send me a reply. Price too hi? make an offer. All replies will be responded to. Thanks."

I have 2 Lee dies for $15 each. One is a 444 Marlin and the other is a 30-06. I also have a 2 pound coffee can of 38 special brass. I have not emptied it out so there may be brass cases underneath it. I'll be honest with you there could be anything in there. I'm not dumping it out to find out. I want $10 for the 38 special brass. I also have a box of s Sierra Pro Hunter 140 grain Spitzer bullets. This box is opened so it's up to you to weigh these to make sure they are the grain the box says. I want $10 for these also. These prices are dirt cheap so they are firm. The only way I will reduce the price is if you take all of it. If you take all of it it is yours for $45. That's about the price for just one of the dies if you were buying it new. I will meet face to face at Bass Pro Shop for the trade. If someone wants all of it. They will take priority over someone wanting just part of it. Thanks for looking. Darrin

Item description from Barrett's website:  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Model 82A1. For more than two decades, this short-recoil, semi-automatic series rifle has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so impossibly precise, it's hard to believe it's man-made.  Unlike other semi-automatic .50 BMG rifles, the Model 82A1 is completely reliable. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it's transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute by simply inserting two assembly pins through both receivers. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. The rifle's M1913 optics rail is tapered 27 MOA to take full advantage of the scope's elevation travel.

Military Ballistics Industries (MBI) specializes in custom ammunition and ordinance products for use by the military, law enforcement agencies, and training facilities in the United States.

This particular product is custom remanufactured (reloaded in a factory) using once-fired brass casings. Each round is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, reloadable, and packaged in 100-round sealed plasti-packs. It is both economical and precision manufactured by an established American cartridge producer. 

Custom ammunition has been around for decades. Some of the world's best shooters use only custom manufactured ammunition to achieve a level of consistency and optimal ballistics performance that cannot be achieved with mass-manufactured ammunition. 

This product is made by assembling carefully selected components to include specialty bullets, propellants, primers, and remanufactured brass casings. Each component of this ammunition is brand new except for the once-fired brass. 

This MBI product is manufactured using only the highest quality products available to ensure consistent ballistics and firing performance. The propellant is manufactured by Hodgdon, the bullets are manufactured at either the Lake City military manufacturing facilities or by Hornady, and the primers are manufactured by either CCI or Winchester. In addition to using only the best available components, MBI ammunition assembles each round using some of the most modern electronic press equipment available. Because exceptional consistency is a major factor in creating accurate ammunition, a production facility that uses finely calibrated electronic press technology is key to ensuring that each shooter is well-pleased with the performance of their ammunition.

Here is a real beauty This Ruger Security Six .357 Mag revolver is in super shape on this 4"" six shot revolver. The gun is the perfect size in my opinion, not too small and not too big..... PERFECT size for carry and for target shooting. The gun's bore is clean and bright with strong rifling. The rear sight is adjustable and the double and single action trigger pull is fantastic in both modes. The gun shows only slight bluing wear and it is simply fantastic. These are very strong revolvers and this one is the one to get if you want a great .357 Mag. The gun will shoot .38 Special loads as well even the hot .38 Special +P loads that are so popular.

* Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. 
* Integral MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories 
* Slim-line grip profile with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference 
* 8-round metal magazine is standard for the HK45C, common high-capacity (10 rounds) that fit both the HK45 and HK45C also available 
* Ambidextrous controls with enlarged magazine release 
* Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system 
* O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and better accuracy 
* Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and increased accuracy 
* Low profile drift adjustable 3-dot sights 
* Contoured and radiused slide with forward slide (grasping) grooves and anti-glare longitudinal ribs"

    * Produces quantifiable crimp pressure in Foot Pounds
    * Makes specific crimp pressures repeatable load after load
    * Allows you to return to any specific crimp pressure even after die adjustment or die swap.
    * Saves you money
    * If you are not using our Consistent Crimp- you are just guessing.


            Consistency is Accuracy


            The problem. : How do we answer the questions we have all been asking:
            How much crimp is a good crimp?
            How do I crimp my bullets?
            How Do I crimp my brass?
            Is there a secret correct cartridge reloading crimp?


            The above similar questions can be distilled to one question, ""What is a good brass to bullet crimp?"" However as soon as we ask this question we jump to the next question, ""if the correct crimp is discovered, how does one repeat this bullet crimp each time one returns to this load recipe, makes a die adjustment or even a die swap?"" Put in other words, ""What is the secret to finding the best crimp and consistently repeating this brass to bullet crimp?""


            We've all been there, we've spent the money for the tools and components, we've spent the time preparing the cases, made careful powder and bullet selection and then for the final step we are told to ""put a good crimp on it."" . Everything else is meticulously measured and consistent so why shouldn't the same emphasis be placed on the crimp?


            The solution: The Consistent Crimp

            What is it?

            The Consistent Crimp is a specifically designed Micro-Click torque wrench with a patent pending adapter that enables the Consistent Crimp to be attached to to a single stage reloading press, instantly converting the press into a calibrated measuring device. When joined these two tools become more than their separate parts enabling the reloader to quantify the amount of crimp pressure being applied to form a crimp.

            How it works?

            The Consistent Crimp allows the reloader to select and repeat specific crimp pressures in foot pounds, for any given load. The reloader simply selects the desired amount of crimp pressure by setting the Micro Click Torque wrench and using the Consistent Crimp as the press handle during the crimping operation. The Micro Click torque wrench alerts the reloader both audibly and by ""feel"" when the desired crimp pressure has been reached. The Consistent Crimp can be set in as little as .2 FtPd increments!

            Some of the benefits

            The Consistent Crimp allows the reloader to eliminate the guessing game of ""How much crimp?"" or ""What is a good crimp"" in several ways:


                + Quantifies the input pressure: The Consistent Crimp measures the input pressure being applied during the crimping process. This means the reloader can select the an exact amount of input pressure, test for results and return to the reloading bench to either repeat a successful crimp pressure or systematically alter the amount of crimp until the desired results have been achieved.
                + Improves Accuracy, the reloader is able to ""move the groups around the face of the target"" by altering the crimp.Yes, you will be astonished to watch your group average Point of Impact ""move"" across and around the target face as you alter the crimp pressure
                + Improves Precision, the reloader is able to reduce the size of the groups for a given load by altering the crimp pressure and by repeating the exact same crimp pressure for each bullet made in a given product run.
                  The Consistent Crimp allows the reloader to repeat or return to an exact crimp pressure even after switching or adjusting dies.
                + Determines the right amount of crimp pressure that will hold the bullet in place under recoil forces for any given load.
                + Saves you money because you can systematically discover the best crimp pressure for your favorite load.
                + Saves you money because you can return to the correct crimp pressure even after a die swap


                        In summary, just as different bullets or powder change the Point of Impact at the range so variances in crimp pressure change the Point of Impact. The Consistent Crimp enables the reloader to discover what crimp is best for a given load and gun and to return to this crimp at will. Whether you roll crimp or taper crimp or use the Lee Factory crimp dies, the Consistent crimp will dramatically improve your results.

I will provide all applicable ballistics info to give you the best opportunity to shoot sub moa after our transaction is complete....not everyone will understand the value of this rifle, but i dont need them to."

The USC
Derived from the HK UMP, the USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge. Matched with the simple and ultra-reliable blowback operating system, the HK USC is a radical departure from traditional firearms designs. Extensive use of the same durable, reinforced polymers used on HK's line of military and police arms ensures lightweight and durability. And the highest grade of weapons steel is used where it matters-in the cold hammer forged target barrel and the solidly constructed bolt mechanism. User ergonomics are not sacrificed. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. The web of the pistol grip is open for a comfortable shooting handhold. Hard points located on the top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails easy, allowing almost any kind of sighting system or accessory to be mounted.

Features:
.Tough, light weight, corrosion proof polymer construction
.Molded-in hard points for mounting accessories
.Accessory Picatinny rails for easy mounting of optical sights, lights, and aiming devices
.Rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation
.Easy disassembly for simple cleaning and maintenance
.Ambidextrous safety/selector lever
.Open, skeletonized buttstock for better grip
.Oversized trigger guard for easy operation while wearing gloves
.Sixteen inch cold-hammer forged target barrel
.Rubber cheek rest and buttstock recoil pad
.Polymer 10-round magazine
.Lifetime warranty"
