Included with the rifle is all of the accessories that came with it when I bought it. The rifle did not come with a second fastening loop for the sling, however. I hand picked this rifle due to the great bore and incredibly smooth bolt. It has been refinished due to the process I used to remove the cosmoline initially. The wood has about 10 or more coats of a linseed oil/ plant resin/ beeswax mixture I made. Great shooter, personally I have only ran about 100 rounds through it, and always thoroughly cleaned to prevent corrosion. I am selling this rifle to fund a few other things, and would like somebody else to get to experience the joy of a mosin nagant rifle, whether you be a collector or first-time buyer, I think anyone could appreciate this rifle. If you want any more pictures, I'm more than willing to e-mail or text some to you. Feel free to call, or text Five6Three-Four5One-Seven9Seven4 anytime with any questions. I live in Loveland, and would be willing to travel a 30-minute radius from Loveland. Buyer is responsible to determine FFL outside of Loveland. I have determined Foundation Pawn in town is cheapest at $10 for the rifle and 7$ for the background check buyer is also responsible to pay the transfer and background check fee."
