For those not familiar with this rifle, it was originally used as a trainer rifle for the military.  It has a 27”, 1.0” bull barrel and is outfitted with lyman peep and hooded sights.  The front sight has interchangeable inserts.  The receiver is also grooved for a scope.  This rifle is incredibly accurate.  I have shot ½ inch groups at 50 yards and I’m generally terrible without a scope.  One other thing – the 27” barrel and bolt action makes this incredibly quiet to shoot.
Included in the sale is the original owners manual, 2 clips, several front sight inserts, and the gun.

EAA Witness .45 with 2, 10rnd double stack mags and hard case. 

This gun is in great shape with a low round count. 
The Witness .45 has a stout recoil that, like the 1911 series, comes straight back into your hand with a minimum of muzzle flip The fit of the slide to frame is tight and the slide sits inside the frame, making it very accurate.

54,http://www.armslist.com/posts/85054,For Trade:  Japanese Type 26 (1893) revolver,"Northwest Florida, Pensacola, Florida",Offer,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 11, 2011",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Revolver,"""Japanese Type 26 (1893) revolver, some of which were still in use during WWII. That one may have been captured, but more likely was taken from a depot in Japan at the end of the war. The engraving is typical Japanese, so it is reasonable to suppose that either the first American owner or a subsequent one was stationed in Japan and had the engraving done there. After the war, the Japanese economy was in bad shape and Japanese engravers did such work at modest cost. In fact, that kind of engraving was often called ""carton of cigarettes"" engraving because that was the usual cost. Perhaps the grip work earned the Japanese workman another carton!

It is hard to tell the quality of the engraving, but it doesn't look bad. I suspect those grips may be real ivory. I think that grip could be repaired, but I would want to consult an expert in that area. My WAG is that the gun could easily bring $1000 or more, but I would defer to anyone who may be more expert in that area."""

Overview:
The speed with which they zip out rounds is rivaled only by the striking appearances of our new additions to this venerable, semi-auto rimfire lineup. Easily the most advanced rimfire rifle ever built, the Model 597™ represents the first technological breakthrough in the category in 35 years. 
The Model 597 FLX™ leads the way in concealment with a FLX Digital camo stock. To game, the pattern assumes the detail and definition of surrounding limbs, leaves and shadows for near invisibility.

Bolt-guidance system features twin, tool-steel guide rails 
Offered in textured finish synthetic 
Non-glare matte finish 
Patented, 10-shot metal detachable magazine 
Last-shot, hold-open bolt for added safety

To be honest and fair, this gun model is part of a factory recall even though the recall was due to gross operator negligence.  Apparantly, the owner cleaned the gun and forgot to put the bolt retaining screw back in.  He pulled out the bolt (unloaded mind you) and whacked himself in the face.  I encourage you to research this recall as you desire.

Chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO (223 Rem.), the FN FS2000 Series are semi-auto only variants of the proven F2000 selective-fire bullpup carbines. The FS2000 Tactical offers an integrated MIL-STD 1913 top mounting rail and emergency backup folding sights. The FS2000 carbines are gas operated and use a rotating bolt lockup for reliability and greater accuracy. Both variants have 17.44"" cold hammer-forged MIL -SPEC barrels and muzzle brakes. Fired cases are ejected through a forward port away from the operator. Models with 10- or 30-round detachable box magazines (DBM) are available. The polymer stock is fully-ambidextrous.

...This rifle has only had around 200 rounds through it (one good range sesssion), and has been exceptional.  I am only looking to see what else is out there and try new things.  This is an exceptional rifle that has a barrel longer than an M-4 to keep great ballistics yet the whole rifle is under 30"".

This gun is great. It packs a good punch for a gun that weighs under 11 oz. I purchased the gun, in preparation for attaining my CCW permit but have not had time to get it done. Ive fired about 50 rounds through the gun and thats about it. I did purchase a wallet holster, for $50. It is a shoot-thru and can be fired in the holster. It leaves the print of a wallet when its in your pocket. I purchased the gun new in the summer and paid $300 plus tax. I have $350 plus in it, and really have done nothing with it. So $250 it is.

I have had this pistol in my closet for a number of years now. I used to shoot it a little bit when I was in my early 20's. I liked it fine but I eventually moved to more powerful calibers. When I go shooting now I take my Beretta 92 FS or something like that. Anyway, I am now selling this gun.

SORRY, THIS GUN HAS BEEN SOLD - it did not stay up for long, it did not make it a full day

GUN INFO:
Maker:    LORCIN
Model:    L-25 Auto
Caliber:  .25 AUTO

SORRY, THIS GUN HAS BEEN SOLD

It comes with a hand made box which also holds 36 rounds of .25 cal ammunition neatly stored(6 magazines worth). The ammunition comes with the gun. I made the box myself out of an old Cigar box, I think it works well. When closed the box can be tilted or turned upsidedown or shook and the gun and contents will stay in thier place. It is nice because it does not look like a gun box so you have the ability to keep it hidden more easily.

I am a private seller in Minnesota, so I may only sell to those in MN with proper ID. I will make a private recipt with both our signatures of which we will both have a copy. I would also be more comfortable if you have either a permit to purchase handguns(FREE from police deptartment) or a concealed carry permit. Send me a message and we can figure something out."

The LCP, which stands for Lightweight Compact Pistol, is a new type of auto pistol for Ruger. Sturm, Ruger, and Company was founded upon their excellent .22 Auto Pistol, and they have produced several other auto pistol designs since, but the new LCP is Ruger’s first true pocket auto. Chambered for the .380 ACP cartridge, it is squarely aimed at the concealed carry market. Having a lightweight glass-filled nylon frame and a steel slide, the baby Ruger weighs in at just 9.42 ounces empty on my scale. The LCP is a very lightweight little pocket pistol.

I have a 1958 P.BERETTA model 948 semiautomatic handgun I would like to sell, this is a 22LR caliber pistol made in Italy and is in good working and cosmetic condition.  The Beretta is all-original except for the clip, which is a 10 round aftermarket clip, I have fired several clips of ammunition through the weapon and the aftermarket clip cycles rounds smoothly and fits the pistol perfectly.  I would like to get $285.00 plus shipping for the pistol, but reasonable offers are always welcome, more photos are available upon request. 
P.S. I am including a Ruger hard-shell pistol case I have been using for the Beretta; the pistol fits nicely in the case and will be of good use for shipping.
