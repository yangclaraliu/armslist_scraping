The Zhukov has right-side folding for compatibility with side-mounted optics. Designed to fit most common stamped AK receivers without modification via a unique wedge block, the durable injection molded polymer Zhukov-S Stock redefines the human interface with the AK platform.

The Zhukov Hand Guard casts aside traditional AK forearm shortcomings and offers an extended option for modern shooting techniques, an aluminum chassis for strength and heat dispersion, a comfortable injection molded exterior for superior ergonomics, and M-LOK slots for optimized accessory attachment. Compatible with the Ultimak gas tube rail for optics mounting, the Zhukov Hand Guard redefines functionality for the modern AK platform. Installation requires removal of the hand guard retainer.
A drop-in upgrade for AK-pattern pistol grips, the MOE AK Grip is compatible with reinforced and un-reinforced receivers.

I haven't been able to give it the time or attention it deserves and I feel bad about such a beautiful rifle gathering dust in the back of my safe. I hate to let it go, but the time has come, unfortunately. The rifle is built on a Palmetto receiver set with a PSA BCG and basic charging handle. It is equipped with an 18"" Rainier 1x11 stainless steel barrel, an ODIN Works freefloat keymod handguard, a Magpul rubberized grip, and a PSA single stage trigger. Additionally, it has a great-fitting B5 SOPMOD stock, which has no wobble whatsoever. 
The rifle is extremely solid from muzzle to buttpad with no wobble to speak of. It does, however, have a small amount of minor surface rust on the exterior of the barrel near the muzzle. The bore is sparkly clean and sharp with fewer than 100 rounds through it. Included with the rifle will be one empty and one loaded 20-round steel magazine, as well as one loaded 20-round PMAG. Additionally, the rifle will come with roughly 35 PPU match cartridges. Also available are the pictured Primary Arms ACSS HUD DMR scope calibrated for .223/.308, a cantilever scope mount, and a flip-down bipod with a picatinny rail mount for an additional $200."

At 100 yards the target looks like it is right up against the scope and can easily put an inch spread. This gun is easily a 1,000+ yard gun and with the features of the scope I'm asking 1,000 cash.

Features a standard Front sight base and flash hider. The upper and lower fit together nice and tight. I have decided to through in a used Titanium Nitride (Tin) of mine. I bought it a year ago and shot it a bit, I just don't care for the look anymore. It is definately more smooth and cleans easier. Comes with 3 30 round GI style mags as well as 5 assorted magazines I no longer have a use for. .223/5.56 caliber.I have many more pictures upon request."

This original started as a Factory Stock Remington 700 Long Range. It has a Leupold Mark 4 LR/T 4.5-14x50. Since then, I've done a fair amount to it:
 
1. Christ it kicks hard... first upgrade was a german made Roedale C21 .30 Muzzle Brake. Excellent ""tank"" brake that clamps over the barrell. Really cuts down on recoil.
2. The factory trigger was garbage. Replaced it with a Timney Remington 700 trigger. Crisp.
3. Not feeling the stock. Replaced it with an H&S Precision Pro Series stock in dark grey.
 
Original gun was $880.0
Muzzle brake was  $200.0
Trigger $150.0
Stock was $450?
Leupold Mark 4 was: $1200
Pelican Long Case: $350
Lock: $15, lol.
 
I'm asking $2400 for the whole package."

Recoil is quite mild for a compact .45 and it shoots straight, fair priced mags, takes anything I feed it. It would make a good carry gun but be warned: It doesn't look perfect. A refinishing job, though, and it's a really nice looking pistol. Acetone and a bottle of cold blue should be all you need. Comes with two full mags, standard ball."
