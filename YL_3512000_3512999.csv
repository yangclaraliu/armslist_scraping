Made in the Slovak Republic by Grand Power, the K100 Mk7 is a modern, fully ambidextrous 9mm semi automatic pistol that features an external hammer and interchangeable grip panels. The frame is made from steel reinforced GF-30 polymer which reduces the overall weight of the gun without compromising strength, function or reliability. Grand Power pistols are all made on 4140 steel reinforced polymer frames with a significant design emphasis on ergonomics and ease of function. Each pistol has an integral Picatinny rail in the frame and comes with four interchangeable backstraps.

Each pistol is fully ambidextrous, the slide lock, mag. release and safety are fully functional on both sides of the frame. All of the barrels are high quality stainless steel and use a patented rotating lock, rather than tilting, during cycling for super smooth work at the range. The trigger has a very short reset, so accurate and fast follow up shots are a breeze. The slide and the steel reinforcing in the frame is finished by nitrocarburizing.

SSAR-15 SBS - Standard Battle Stock	
Designed to resemble current combat rifle stocks and is for use on all AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube. To install remove the factory pistol grip and replace it with the provided Interface Block. SSAR-15 replaces the factory adjustable stock by sliding onto the buffer tube. All tools required to install are provided. Shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward. As a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction. Constructed of premium reinforced high strength polymer. Compatible with Mil-Spec and commercial buffer tubes. Includes SSAR-15 SBS, interface block, hex key and instructions.

208,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3512208,For Sale:  Fiocchi .223 45gr frangible non-toxic SinterFire ammo (223SFNT),"Lynnwood, Seattle, Washington",$ 1,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 24, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Want to shoot your AR-15 at the reactive steel targets at Shooting Sports Northwest in Bothell? This is what you need! Professionally reloaded .223 45gr frangible SinterFire non-toxic ammo for much less than retail. This ammo is required at SSNW on the steel targets because it disintegrates upon impact without filling the air with lead particles. If you have your own steel targets, this stuff will extend the life of your targets while allowing you to train at very close ranges. You can safely shoot this within a few feet of steel targets (with proper eye protection, of course). In a retail environment, it's $35 for a box of 50 rounds. With sales tax, that's nearly $0.77/round! You can buy mine for $0.60/round and it comes loaded on mil-spec 10-rd stripper clips to boot! If you are seriously interested, email me with how much you want and when you can meet in Lynnwood."

I converted the sight system to Tech Sights http://www.tech-sights.com/ and modified the tech sight cover to be easier to remove and still hold secure. The rifle shoots great and I have had no issues with it. I did cut the rear sight mount down to give a better sight picture with the tech sights, so you can't use a standard rear sight without replacing the sight housing. Also included are 6 Eastern European steel 30 round mags, 5 Tapco 30 round mags, and a Korean style 75 round drum. They all work well and the drum even comes loaded. You can remove the spring tension to leave the drum loaded, then just wind it up and you're good to go.

Will also come with a couple of Magpul P Mags and 20 rounds of M193 5.56 depending on trade. Have around $900 invested in it. Shoots exceptionally well and with the longer barrel, muzzle brake, and cheek riser stock it would make an excellent long range rifle with a good scope, however I'm more interested in a .30 caliber rifle right now. Primarily interested in a .308/7.62 battle rifle like a PTR 91 or FAL, possibly a Cetme+Cash. Would also be interested in a nice AK47 in 7.62X39mm (NO WASR'S). Not interested in SKS's, I already have one.

While I'm primarily interested in these rifles, I'm also looking for an HD/Tactical style 12 gauge shotgun, no more than a 20 inch barrel with a cylinder bore such as a Mossberg 500, Remington 870, Benelli Nova Tactical, just about any of the new Turkish import pump guns, etc.. I already have a nice field gun, so not looking for a hunting shotgun. Would be interested in a two gun trade for one along with a semi auto .223/5.56 or 7.62X39mm rifle such as a basic AR (M&P Sport, similar) or AK (would allow WASR's if including a shotgun), or maybe even a Kel Tec SU-16.

More info from Browning:
With a timeless beauty that’s more than skin deep, the BLR Lightweight ’81 is ready and waiting to be your next lever-action hunting rifle. The gloss finish on the Walnut straight grip stock contrasts beautifully with the deeply polished blue finish on the receiver and the barrel. This is what a serious lever-action rifle should be, and what every other lever-action wishes it was.
 • The button-rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and interior finish and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore’s length.
• Every BLR barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace.
• The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
• The barrel’s standard sights include a Low-Profile adjustable square notch rear sight and a high-visibility front blade with gold bead fitted on a raised ramp-style base.?
• The richly blued steel finish on all external surfaces is a stunning reflection of the gunmaker’s art.
• The aircraft grade alloy receiver is precision machined to provide outstanding reliability and years of dependable service.
• The slick-sided receiver houses the BLR’s lightning fast, glass-smooth rack and pinion lever action.
• The BLR has a rotating multi-lug bolt head that locks into the barrel extension to produce bolt-action accuracy and magnum-level strength.
• The BLR is one of the few lever-action rifle designs that is strong enough to use today’s most popular magnum cartridges, giving you the extended reach and flat bullet trajectory other lever-action owners can only dream of.
• The BLR has a recessed bolt face that surrounds the cartridge head for added strength and lasting dependability.
• The BLR’s generously-sized side ejection port allows fired cases to instantly clear the action without hitting you or your scope and bouncing back onto the receiver, potentially creating a jam.
• The folding hammer on the BLR provides an added measure of safety when the hammer is at half-cock, having two positions in that mode so the status of the rifle can be instantly seen and felt.
• The folding hammer on the BLR has four basic positions; Full-cock, half-cock, folded hammer position and the dropped or fired position.
• The BLR’s trigger is unique in that it travels along with the lever as it’s cycled, meaning that pinching your fingers between the lever and trigger on closing the action is a thing of the past.
• The fingerpiece on the BLR’s trigger is nice and wide with vertical friction ribs to prevent your finger from slipping, giving you more precise trigger control for those demanding long-range shots.
• The detachable steel box magazine makes for quick reloading, both in the field and on the range.
• Unlike lever actions with tubular magazines, the BLR’s detachable steel box magazine lets you use aerodynamically-superior pointed bullets, which opens up a whole new world of ballistic performance that is usually found in bolt-action and autoloading rifles.
• Magazine capacity is 3 rounds in the magnum calibers and 4 rounds in standard calibers.
• The BLR’s stock is sculpted from fine Walnut and the cut checkering in the grip and fore-end is crisply executed for lasting good looks and a more solid grip.
• The straight grip BLR stock is true to the classic lines of the lever action rifle and has a traditional carbine strap at the fore-end.
• The BLR’s stock has a deep, glossy finish that brings out every nuance of the wood’s warm color and grain.
• The well-formed recoil pad helps reduce felt recoil and flinching.
• Steel sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling or bipod.

I had this scope for a little over a month (still have box). Reason Im selling is that I was planning on doing more long range shooting than I actually have time for (or the money). This scope was going to be used as duel use for long range shooting and (long range) hunting. I did not try and cheap out on this scope. I bought what would be best for the scope. Also I put in a lot of time lapping the rings so there would be equal pressure around the body of the scope. 

The scope is in like brand new condition. It is currently held by Burris extreme tactical rings (low), that have been lapped. 

The anti-cant is a Holland Signature Series. Best in my opinion. 

I paid:
Scope $1400
Rings $63
Anti cant $65
----------------------------
Total $1528

Asking $1250 for all or trade (look below) 
This is a package deal My loss is your gain!

You are more than welcome to check out the scope but only serious inquiries. 

Will only trade for Glock 20 with or without red dot (RMR or Deltapoint only) depending on what you have I'll decide how much cash on your end. NO TRADES FOR RIFLES, SCOPES, ACCESSORIES, ETC!

The only problem is that the butt stock apparently has been sanded, so when mounted on the gun, the surface of the stock is somewhat lower than the metal mounts.  Its purely a cosmetic issue.  This does not effect the function or fit to the mounts. If your stock is broken, this would be a very cheap way to get out and shooting again.

Also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

 SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum magazines, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines."

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition  is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

 SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum magazines, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 100-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines."
