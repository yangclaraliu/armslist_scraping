The clear coat on the aluminum frame is peeling, I had thought about having it refinished with a color Cerakote job, but I thought I'd see if anyone wanted it as-is first.  Apparently this isn't unheard of with the Airweight frames. In reality, I really don't have the time or the desire to strip the gun down to the frame and put it back together after having a coating applied. The gun was likely made in January of 2015, as that's the date on the sample spent cartridge that comes with a new gun.  I shot it a few times and I thought the trigger was pretty smooth and crisp for a newer J-frame. We have another Model 60LS that had to have a $110 trigger job right out of the box to get all of the bumps and burrs smoothed out.  This one isn't too bad.  If you don't know the model, these are a 5-shot .38 Special revolver. They've been in production since 1950, typically as a backup gun for LEO's.  They are rated to handle +P ammunition, but the .357 Magnum cartridge must not be used in the 637 Airweight. The frame is aluminum; the cylinder, barrel, and internals are steel. This is the Single/Double Action variant with an exposed hammer.  These revolvers are the right size to fit in a coat pocket or purse if you so choose. They also conceal nicely under clothing without the caveats of carrying a semiautomatic.  I'm not really looking for firearm trades, but if you have something interesting we could talk about it.  I'm in the market for a quality long-range rifle scope (Vortex strongly preferred); if you happen to have one to offer I can add cash to make a deal. Buyers must present an Ohio ID and be 21 or over to purchase a handgun.
If you're going to send me a scam offer, at least have a native English speaker proofread your work. You guys make it too easy."

Also, a TechnaClip is preinstalled to make IWB, pocket, or even boot carry ready out of the box. If this wasn’t enough packed into this offer, we are also adding an additional magazine with the DB9 at no extra cost!From Diamondback:“Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAAMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAAMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.”Specifications:Caliber: 9mmLength: 5.6”Width: 0.8”Height: 4.0”Barrel: 3.0”Weight: 11oz (empty)Trigger pull: ~5.5#"
