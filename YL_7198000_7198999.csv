This firearm is great for entry level shooters and veterans alike that want a reliable firearm that will hold its value and never fail you. Seriously, these guys can take a beating. This particular firearm has already had stippling job on grip, slide, and under trigger guard. The mag release has been scalloped as well as under the trigger guard for extra comfort and maneuverability. Don't miss out on this great firearm. I am looking for $500 OBO and am also interested in trades. In particular, just about anything Sig, 1911, KelTec KSG, or a quality RMR. Would do even trade for a Trijicon and possibly add cash if the deal is right. Will even trade for a Burris or a Vortex if you add cash to make it fair. Please don't hesitate to send me any and all offers. Worst I can do is say I'm not interested. Happy hunting and have a great day!"
