I am selling my beloved 1973 Ruger 10/22. Serial number puts it to 73-74. These older Rugers are getting harder to find. This is the ""pre-warning"" barreled rifles that is highly sought after! I purchased this rifle a while ago and unfortunately it sits in my case. I'll pass it on to the community in effort to save money for my tuition. As you can see from the pictures the gun is definitely in used condition however the barrel rifling is still very strong and the bore is BRIGHT!Shoots 22LR and will include the ORIGINAL FACTORY BOXED 10/22 MAGAZINE THAT IS PERIOD CORRECT TO THE EARLIER MODELS *VERY HARD TO FIND ALSO*THIS IS A GREAT SHOOTER THAT YOU CAN PASS DOWN! GET A VINTAGE 10/22 FOR NEARLY THE SAME PRICE OF A NEW MODEL. (WHICH LACKS THE METAL HARDWARE PARTS)THIS ONE WILL GO QUICK PEOPLE! 175.00 FIRM. NO TRADES!!I will give you a gauge of what I think the condition of the gun is below:Walnut wood stock condition: 7 *it is a vintage rifle, what more do you expect?* expect dings/scratches but NO CRACKS.Mechanical condition: 9 - has not failed to fire or ejected in the last 500 rounds! Recently function tested.Bluing: 7.5 retains most of its original bluing!At one point this rifle had a scope, the top of the receiver will show indications of the stock ruger 10/22 factory scope mount in place. However this is completely normal. Older Ruger 10/22's anodized receivers often chip/scratch very easily.That being said the rifle is all original except for the rear folding sight. I had lost the sliding aperture that goes up and down for elevation a while ago and replaced it with a new factory ruger 10/22 rear iron sight. Will need to be sighted in properly!This is a steal for a vintage rifle! Please give me a text and we can schedule a meet. MY NUMBER IS FOUR ZERO FOUR 3 FOUR 8 693 FIVEPOLICY:MY PRICE IS FIRM AND I DO NOT WISH FOR ANY TRADES!I WILL ONLY MEET IN CONYERS, GA - I WILL NOT DRIVE TO YOU.

This came from the CMP and is a Service Grade which was a better grade rifle than their Rack or Field grades. Those that are familiar with their codes will see   in one pic I have of the certificate and grade tag.  I have many other pics  other than those shown that I’ll be happy to email upon request. Though I do not have TE or MW gauges I do have a pic of “ the muzzle test “ which it passes with flying colors with a round of  Spec .30 Ball.  The bore is shiny with strong rifling. The rifle was rebuilt by Govt. Arsenal in the middle ‘60’s  ( written on a receiver leg as I recall but due to my age disassembly and reassembly is difficult for me and I will no longer do it so what pics of parts you see will be it ) . The metal parkerizing is in very good cond. The parts pics that I could capture indicate some SA and it has “ NM “ ( National Match ? ) stamped on the Op rod. The front sight / gas cylinder was never removed  since leaving the CMP , is snug on the BBL. so the splines should be pristine.  The wood is strong and solid but has numerous scratches, dings, dents, etc.  The stock has several cartouches.  Though I have had it for several years I did not shoot it much but I can give you my word that it never malfunctioned in any way for me and is very accurate. It was always used with top quality, CMP sold, .30 Ball ammo.  It was always disassembled, cleaned and lubed per spec after every shooting session. I do strongly suggest that the new owner do this upon ownership before firing as it hasn’t been fired in a few years. Feel free to ask me any questions. I may or may not be able to answer them but they will be honest.  I do however pretty much know this rifle inside and out. Again.. I have more pics I can email upon request with an E address. Comes with CMP Certificate, tag and manual. Ad says no shipping but I will ship. No local pickup.   Many online sales references available.
 
This must go to an FFL  ( It is C&R eligible )  . No PO boxes and only to those locations that can legally be shipped to. No Exceptions.  So know your laws prior to buying. No local pickup. Payment must me made by USPS money order ONLY.  Shipping will be $40 which includes insurance, Adult Signature and a UPS tracking #.   I strive to pack things very well with lots of protection and where possible to double the cardboard but if you want to ship me your hard case to pack it in that’s up to you.  I communicate throughout and ship promptly.

I personally paid about 50-70 dollars each for the front and rear pop up sights and 350 for the micro Roni kit. the stock can be used as a normal stock or I have a brace that you can use to attach it to your arm which allows for easy one hand firing with barely any recoil. The stock folds for easy concealment. I'm also including a 50 round 9mm drum if the buyer happens to have a 9mm. It fits a Glock 19, Glock 23, and Glock 32. Also it takes literally 5-10 seconds to put your Glock into or take it out of the Roni. It's super easy to use and super effective. I'd only want 350 for the micro roni and another 50 for the 50 round magazine which I've takin to the range and never had one problem with. REDACTED (Glock not included)"
