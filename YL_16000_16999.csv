This AR is not for everyone. It is a collectors item. There are a few people out there who understand what an early issue pre-ban is and understand my price for this AR. Serious inquiries only.

Upper: Colt 20-inch barrel 1:9 twist w/ bayonet lug. Barrel marked ""C MP Chrome Bore""; C for the manufacturer Colt, MP stamp means the barrel was magnafluxed and proofed, chrome bore and chamber. Bolt Carrier manufacturer stamp ""Shield (8 sided octagon) and SE""; Smith Enterprise.

Lower: PWA (Pac West Arms, Milan, Ill.; this was the early LMT company I believe and Rock River Arms bought out PWA. From everything that I have heard they are excellent lowers!) 5.56mm Commando. This is a forged lower not cast. Serial# 11174. (PWA post-ban have a year prefix in the serial number. The serial # cutoff was 35222 for preban status).

Standard two point sling.
Has a new AR-16 cleaning kit (Small Arms Maintenance Equipment Case 8465-00-781-9564).
A1 stock w/ butt storage compartment. 
Have one USA 30 round AR-15 .223 magazine by O'Kay Industries, Inc., New Britain, Conn.

This AR is in great shape and supreme working order. I had it fully serviced (new parts, fired & cleaned) by a gunsmith at Anderson's Gun Repair Shop here in Springfield, MO before putting it up for sale; new extractor spring & gas tube (had a dent in the tube which slowed the gas pressure). I also run some 40 rounds through it and cleaned it. It was flawless.

It is all black with synthetic stock.  A simmons 3-9x40 Scope is mounted and sighted in.  I also added a folding tripod and 9 shot Ammo sleeve.  This is a really good rifle, took it out and shot it at the range and it is deadly accurate, even for a novice rifle shooter like me.  The rifle has a 4+1 shot capacity, full floating barrel. All in all, it is just a really good hunting rifle.  Thanks for your interest, the price is $400 o.b.o. or hit me up with a trade im interested in almost anything.  Worst I can do is say no, right?"

The gun was manufactured in Italy under contract from FN Herstal (Belgium) and marketed as FN model 140DA (in Europe) or Browning BDA 380 (in USA). Some sources said that BDA 380 is a copy of Beretta 84, but close inspection shows some differences (i.e. Beretta 84 has frame mounted safety while BDA 380 has slide mounted safety). The manufacture of the BDA 380 was ceased circa 1997. It was adopted by Belgian police.

The BDA 380 is a blowback operated, double action semi automatic pistol. It has aluminium alloy frame and steel slide. Ambidextrous slide mounted safety switch disconnects the trigger from the hammer when engaged. The pistol featured low profile fixed sightst and was available in either polished steel or blued finish, with wooden grip panels.

The gun deserved good reputation as reliable and comfortable to fire.

Here is the description from the website:

Based on the legendary original Colt M4, this .22 Long Rifle carbine sports German quality & craftsmanship.

The Colt M4 .22 looks and feels like an actual M4, creating one of the most exciting .22 caliber firearms available.  Engineered from the ground up as a dedicated .22 rimfire, this AR style Colt features a 16.2-inch barrel, collapsible stock, flat-top receiver with detachable carry handle, CAR handguards, flash hider, A2 pistol grip, and 30-round magazine.

A tactical .22 rifle like this Colt is ideal for new shooters who are learning handling and operation. A gun like this Colt .22 M4, M4 Ops, as well as the Colt M16 .22 can have many uses-plinking, target practice and small-game hunting where allowed....all of which offer an economical shooting option.

For those of you unfamiliar with the XD pistol, it is a modern semi-automatic pistol that is generally considered a very reliable and accurate weapon.

You should do your own due diligence as this is a popular pistol and widely documented on the internet, but here are two links to a torture test and stress test: 
http://springfield-armory.primediaoutdoors.com/SPstory11.php
http://springfield-armory.primediaoutdoors.com/SPstory02.php

I am selling everything below as a complete package:

XD40sc pistol
XD gear (holster, magazine loader, double magazine pouch)
original box (manual, lock, test fired cartridge, test fire date is 10-2008)
2 magazines (9rd, 12rd with grip extension)

Other comments: This pistol has had 400 rounds fired through it.  No malfunctions or failures.  It has been cleaned and lubricated as recommended after each range trip, hopefully it shows (see photos and feel welcome to inspect it thoroughly).  The finish is excellent; after range trips it is cleaned, wiped down with a silicone cloth, and stored in a dry safe. At least around here, it is still relatively straightforward to find 40 caliber ammunition (not so for 9mm), so that's another plus.

I'd like to keep it, but I could use the cash more (just had a baby in Oct and Christmas coming up soon).  This would make a terrific concealed carry gun and is a great shooter.

Happy hunting! The usual rules apply: face-to-face, cash only, meet in neutral location for exchange, serious inquiries only please."

Cryogenic treatment is great way to improve your firearm. Cajun Cryogenics uses ultra-cold (-300°f) temperatures to condense the micro structure of an item to an aligned composition. The uniform micro structure increases strength while eliminating the loss of accuracy due to uneven heat dissipation better known as the ""walking effect"".

Century Arms Cetme .308 Winchester semi-auto rifle.  This is the HKG3, HK91, PTR91 clone.
This particular rifle is one of the higher quality rifles Century produced in the 1980's when they actually had stainless steel receivers and not the crappy stamped receivers.

Comes with (1) 20rnd Cetme steel mag, (4) 20rnd HKG3 mags, (2) dual mag pouches, cleaning kit.

$500  phone: REDACTED
Not accepting trades as I need to fund another rifle purchase and wouldn't part with this if it weren't in-line with the price of the other rifle.  This ad will be pulled after today, this is a 1-day sale only.

This is a very low serial numbered rifle, upping the desireability (lower than 000900...you read it right, lower than 900!).
The front handguard screw had been broken prior to my ownership and I have since removed the broken part so it can be replaced.  Apex has these screws for just $3 or you can take the broken piece to the hardware store and get a temporary substitute to get you buy.

Blued steel with a nice walnut stock - I bought her in 1997 or so.  A few nicks and dings, but very nice looking and clean.  Very light trigger work done by a PA gun shop.  She's an awesome rifle, but I never get out to PA to hunt any more. 

I used to shoot her on the 1000 meter range and the club that I belonged to in Parkesburg.  It's not a target rifle (barrels too light) but it can shoot like a house on fire.

Believe it or not, this is a great combination. A 30-30 with Lever-revolution rounds shoots pretty flat out to 300 yards, and the Aries Generation II night -scope sits very close to the bore. A better fit than on any other rifles I mounted it on. The Aries both amplifies ambient light as well as illuminating with infrared to see in complete darkness. This combination makes a great night-time varmint gun. I'll sell them separately, or together for $950.

1. Old Dell laptop computer. Screen is bad, but will include 19"" flat screen with it. Otherwise, it's ok. Will give you discs with it. If you want to go the whole route, I've got a P4 HP desktop computer with 1.5 GB of RAM and a pro-calibre CRT monitor that I'll include.

2. A full Canon A-1 35mm camera rig, including hard case, 3 lenses, Sunpak flash and misc. accessories. Camera was recently serviced, and has no issues whatsoever.

3. A LOT of ""old school"" audio equipment---too much to name it all, but I've got receivers, turntables, amps, quad amps (REALLY old school), CD and cassette decks, and speakers by OHM (Walsh 7's) and Pioneer (HPM-100's that need a LOT of work), plus brands like NAD, Pioneer, Nakamichi, Kenwood and more. You could get a full, nice-sounding rig in exchange for your rifle, and I wouldn't trade you something I wouldn't keep otherwise!

4. A 1960's-vintage Coke machine, in very good condition, clean and undamaged, but inoperable due to lack of a compressor.

I'm open to negotiations for some combination of the above. I must state here that I'm a disabled vet and my wife usually has the one running car, so to trade and/or look at what I have to offer, you'd have to come to Norman. I'll give you directions if it's a serious offer.

Thanks in advance for your time, and I hope we can strike a deal that will make both of us happy!
