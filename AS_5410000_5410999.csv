This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. Payment will be made with Postal Money Order."

With a little elbow grease I have removed 99% of the paint. There is still a little in some of the groves but it comes off. There is also a couple scratches on the tube. The glass appears to be in great condition. Looking in several different web sites trying to find a value...the cheapest I have found is $550. I am taking in to consideration the fact that it had been painted and the deep scratch on the tube. I believe the scope ring would/could cover it up.

He never fired it even once and just bought some custom Glock for over $1,000 and gave this one back to me to sell.  Absolutely nothing wrong with it.
Black grip. Satin finish.
If you purchase and do a transfer through FFL, I will sell it to you for $150 and you pay the transfer fee. If you choose this option, I can meet you at Gander Mountain Opelika. You walk away with a brand new gun.
If you don't want to do an FFL transfer, you have to sign a waiver for me stating that you are legally able to purchase a handgun and provide me with a copy of your Alabama driver's license for my records, and sign a waiver of all liability.  If you choose this option, the gun is $230.00.  I will meet you in front of the police station and you can purchase from me there."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4″ up to the 3″.This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Features:Gauge: 12 GACapacity: 6Barrel Length: 18.5""Finish: Tactical GrayAction: PumpHeight: 7""Chamber: 3"""
