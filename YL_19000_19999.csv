Must have a CCW or permit to buy

Mine is 1961 AT

The Ernst Thaelman factory in Suhl, Thueringen made what are considered by some to be the finest pre-fall-of-the-Berlin Wall Makarovs. The finish is nice, the fit and machining is of quality you'd expect from a German shop, and they shoot like a dream. Almost all that came into this country had already seen service, so their quality varies by how they were treated by the person who carried them. Nonetheless, most have more holster wear than bore wear. They occasionally still pop up at dealers and at gun shows. If you can get them for a good price, these are the ones to buy.
Markings on them include a letter 'y' with a circle of dots, which some Russian folks think stands for for uchebneii or ""training"". This would be strange for a German pistol, but we haven't heard any other explanations.

Please. No low ballers and no SKS rifles. I will give about $150 for an SKS. I have never had one that would shoot without jamming and I can buy one new for $229 here in town.
I do not need to sell this and could care less if I do or dont. If you are looking for a ""snaptight"" AR then you can find one cheap. Not trying to be rude. Just tired of the same low ballers hitting every add.

Henry Repeating Arms has tooled up to manufacture a new and improved version of the famous U.S. Air Force AR-7, now known as the Henry U.S. Survival rifle. This compact and lightweight sportsman's rifle is ideal for all outdoorsmen, including campers, backpackers, hunters, fishermen, boat owners and target shooters. And it can still serve its original purpose as a survival rifle for pilots.


The Henry U.S. Survival rifle is ultra-lightweight, weighing in at a scant 2.5 pounds. The unique design allows the rifle to break down easily into three pieces in seconds. This enables the barrel, action and two 8-round magazines to fit comfortably into the tough ABS synthetic waterproof stock. No tools are needed to assemble or disassemble. Once disassembled and stowed, it is only an incredible 16 inches long. Carry it in your backpack with room to spare.

To assemble, simply attach the receiver to the stock, insert the barrel, screw on the barrel nut and you're ready to fire. In seconds, you'll have the security of a semi-automatic rifle without the bulk and weight of a full size firearm.

The Henry U.S. Survival rifle features a steel barrel that is covered in a tough ABS plastic and then coated in Teflon. This unique barrel design allows the gun to balance properly and remain lightweight, yet withstand tens of thousands of rounds. The entire receiver is also coated in Teflon, making the Henry U.S. Survival rifle the most weather-resistant of any AR-7 ever made. As an added feature, the receiver rib is now grooved for easy installation of a scope.

The rifle is capable of feeding both standard and high velocity .22 Long Rifle ammunition. Available in black, silver or camouflage finishes.


The Henry US Survival comes in black cardboard case with plastic carrying handle.

These guns were used by the German army because you can field strip them, clean and reassemble in less than 3 min. It was still in the box when I bought it a few years back.

I added Pearce grips (Larger) and the original ones are included. Must have Permit or CCW

The info on this gun is below. Mine is 61 AT Version. A great collectible or carry gun.

The Ernst Thaelman factory in Suhl, Thueringen made what are considered by some to be the finest pre-fall-of-the-Berlin Wall Makarovs. The finish is nice, the fit and machining is of quality you'd expect from a German shop, and they shoot like a dream. Almost all that came into this country had already seen service, so their quality varies by how they were treated by the person who carried them. Nonetheless, most have more holster wear than bore wear. They occasionally still pop up at dealers and at gun shows. If you can get them for a good price, these are the ones to buy.
Markings on them include a letter 'y' with a circle of dots, which some Russian folks think stands for for uchebneii or ""training"". This would be strange for a German pistol, but we haven't heard any other explanations. 
Note that this table is not complete and there appears to be a sequential pattern, so don't panic if yours doesn't fit into the ones listed.

Even have 150 rounds of winchester 9mm luger 115gr full metal jacket rounds that I'll throw in (will have to check shipping of course).

Just a bit of background. I originally purchased the gun after I received a job offer that would see me have to live for a time in some 3rd world country. I decided to change my mind and instead go back to school for a graduate degree, but it was in DC and obviously they have some of the strictest laws and I really didn't want to chance anything. It has never been fired. I considered giving it to my brother but one already has a .45, and the other has small children. I have now accepted a job in Chicago (another anti gun hotbed) and would like to hand it off to someone who will be able to appreciate it.

My digital camera is out of batteries so these pics are with my phone, but I can send you better pics once it is charged. 

Would like $500

The rifle started as a sportical then i bought the complete upper reciver which makes it a panther lite i think. the reason iam selling it is i want a dpms in the 6.8 but cant justify buying one when i have one already. so cash buyers only that r realy lookin to buy and if u want for another 300 bucks i will give u all the 556 i have which is around 800 rounds which cost me over 400 bucks but i think i have more when we talk i will double check. The price for the ammo wont change if i have more then 800 rounds only if there is less. Will consider messin with price but not by much as i paid 7 for the rifle 160 for the upper 65 for the houge grip on it and 80 for the buttstock and 60 for the quad rail . I think this is a fair price so hit me up but only if u have the cash i realy want my new rifle. and just forgot will need to come to me and need a id for the background check will split the cost of that if there is one and if u reload at all i will give u the reloadind dies i have for the gun never used. One last thing the scope light and foregrip dont go with the gun just didnt feel like taking them off

It is my understanding that these are all the parts you can get from SA, last time I checked, you can't buy the extractor yet.  The numbers correspond to the part # in the XD manual, if you don't have one handy, you can check out the diagram at http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/FIREARMS/springfieldarmory_xd.pdf.

Unfortunately, I had to sell my pistol earlier this year and am hoping to find a good home for these brand new parts.  These are great to have on hand for backup for a competition or HD pistol (don't want to have to wait for parts) or as a complete set of what's available from SA for a preparedness-minded individual.  Here is a spare parts thread from xdtalk.com that may be helpful: http://www.xdtalk.com/forums/general-sa-xd-xd-m-talk/94824-xd-spare-parts.html.

I purchased everything for $130.09, will sell everything together for $100 (about 25% off)

I bought the russian stuff back when it was being imported in on accident by the russians and was quickly cut off to the united states do to the fact it was their 7n1 sniper load. This is not the machine gun ammo that u find out on the market but was designed to be a mild armor piercing round that was more accurate than the normal loadings. This stuff is expensive now and hard to find. I could probably get more for it on gunbroker but i would like to keep this local. The price is firm on the ammo and is more than fair for this type of ammo as it is not as cheap as it once was. The only real trade i would like to do is to trade this for some 30 30 win ammo but again all trades are welcome. Email is at REDACTED and cell is 522-5498 again thanks and make me a offer that i cant refuse. oh ps the red ammo box is included in purchase ;)

The gun was manufactured in Italy under contract from FN Herstal (Belgium) and marketed as FN model 140DA (in Europe) or Browning BDA 380 (in USA). Some sources said that BDA 380 is a copy of Beretta 84, but close inspection shows some differences (i.e. Beretta 84 has frame mounted safety while BDA 380 has slide mounted safety). The manufacture of the BDA 380 was ceased circa 1997. It was adopted by Belgian police.

The BDA 380 is a blowback operated, double action semi automatic pistol. It has aluminium alloy frame and steel slide. Ambidextrous slide mounted safety switch disconnects the trigger from the hammer when engaged. The pistol featured low profile fixed sightst and was available in either polished steel or blued finish, with wooden grip panels.

The gun deserved good reputation as reliable and comfortable to fire.

FROM SIGSAUER.COM--
The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.
