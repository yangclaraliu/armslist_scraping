Comes with 3-15 rd. magazines, Blackhawk (R-hand) Serpa Holster (belt or paddle), Fobus double-mag holder; there's a Jentra Plug in the grip, which plugs the hole adjacent to the magazine well.  The trigger pull's been reduced to 3.5 lbs., using a Scherer 3.5 lb. connector, which in no way compromises ANY of the pistol's safety features.  The original connector will be provided as well, and can be swapped very easily if desired.   Also included is the original box & all of its contents.  My price is firm.  It's a package deal.  I will not sell ""...just the gun,"" or any other part of the pkg. by itself.  Face-to face transaction, locally, and I will require a valid photo I.D. in order to prove that you're at least 21.

125,http://www.armslist.com/posts/25125,"For Sale:  WTS: 10.5"" AR pistol Milled lower armalite upper","Lexington, Lexington, Kentucky",$ 625,"Listed On: Monday, March 8, 2010",Handguns,Armalite,no type,no type,no type,"Big price drop. I have a bill to pay.

This is built on one of Centerfire's milled lowers. It has an Armalite a2 upper (has the AR and cross hairs forged in). The barrel is 10.5"", the flashider is an a1 style I slapped on there just to protect the threads (yes, I know it is not timed correctly, like I said slapped it on just to protect the threads). The pistol receiver extension is from Rock River Arms. everything is pretty close to new, though apparently I bumped the receiver extension on something as seen in the pics, one could hit it with a sharpy and probably never notice it again. 

This pistol shoots AMAZINGLY! I assembled it on a whim expecting it to be a toy, but I can actually hit with it almost as good as a carbine at reasonable range.

Magpul mag not included.

374,http://www.armslist.com/posts/25374,For Sale:  Cold Steel :::   Steel Tiger,"North OKC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 75,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 10, 2010",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is called the Steel Tiger knife by Cold Steel.  It's in very good condition.  I had to turn off flash cause I got too much glare from the blade so pics are a little darker than I like.  There are a few scratches on the blade...I think from taking it out of the sheath.

Comes with a Kydex sheath.  Here's some info on it from Cold Steel.

Cold Steel has always contended that the Karambit is a specialized style of knife with unique but limited uses. It is also, however, quite popular. So, in response to the many requests from our customers, and with the help of custom knife maker, Steven Likarich, we proudly introduce the Steel Tiger®, our interpretation of this ancient Indonesian knife. 

It possesses all the best features of the classic Karambit and unites them with modern styling and materials, and, best of all; we've kept it very affordable. 

The broadly curved AUS 8A stainless blade is beautifully polished, taper ground, and vacuum heat-treated and sub zero quenched, for maximum strength, cutting power and edge retention. 

But it's the grip that really distinguishes it from the competition. Designed for comfort, strength and ease of use, it features a tough Grivory® core that encapsulates the tang, emerging as the bolster/thumbshelf and distinctive finger ring. This core is then overmolded with Kraton®, which yields more to hand pressure than Grivory, and, in turn, creates a superb, non-slip grip. 

For safety, convenience and quick access, the Steel Tiger® comes with a sturdy Secure-Ex® sheath that you can lash to your gear or retain on your person via the removable boot/belt clip.

I'm willing to sell or trade. It'll have to be a pretty interesting trade thou.
I've put between 400 and 700 shots through this gun. It's sort of finicky, and really only shoots Stingers well. Luckily all the Wal marts are starting to have them pretty readily available. 

I'm not hard up for money right now. The reason I'm selling is b/c I recently got into reloading and my fascination for accuracy has over taken my shooting on the cheap. 


These are retailing for around $369 now. Obviously I dont expect retail but I'm not going to take a hell of a hit. Any low ball offers wont even be acknowledged. 

You've got to be 21+ to purchase and ID. I bought this gun from a store, so we'll have to do the transfer sheet simply stating I no longer own it. I'm not selling to any G dogs or hoodrats.

I'm willing to sell or trade. It'll have to be a pretty interesting trade thou.
I've put between 700 and 1000 shots through this gun. It's not finicky, it likes bulk 550 round value packs as much as the nicer stinger stuff. 

I'm not hard up for money right now. The reason I'm selling is b/c I recently got into reloading and my fascination for accuracy has over taken my shooting on the cheap. 


These are retailing for around $210 now and dont include the scope or extra magazine. Obviously I dont expect retail but I'm not going to take a hell of a hit. Any low ball offers wont even be acknowledged. 

The scope picture does not do the actual scope any justice. Its quality sucks b/c I was irritated and on my 5th to 15th attempt to get a decent picture. This setup, from a rest @ 50 yards will punch under 1.25 groups w/ bulk ammo. Its a real good plinking gun and is excellent for a enthusiast who has not quite turned gun nut yet.

You've got to be 18+ to purchase and ID. I bought this gun from a store, so we'll have to do the transfer sheet simply stating I no longer own it. I'm not selling to any G dogs or hoodrats. CHL holders, LEOs and other firearm enthusiast need apply. I'm willing to meet you at the Middletown Sportsman clubhouse and take you down to the rifle range to test fire it for $10.

This is the pre-cross bolt safety model (more desirable for most shooters as you can do cowboy action with it and also they were better built imo) and for the most part it is in good condition. the bluing has started to come off but its got no rust spots or pitting and the bore is PRISTINE looks like it was carried more than shot. The bluing isnt much of a issue as i intended to blue it or possibly parkerize it myself but i never had the time to get to due it. it shoots great and is a awesome deer gun. The uses for this type of rifle is endless hunting, plinking, sass comp, and even a decent home defense gun. This gun also includes  around 19 rounds of ammo and a nylon cartridge holder that allows you to carry more ammo on the gun. 6 shot capacity rifle not carbine and is factory drilled and tapped to allow you to mount a scope on it if you so desire. My name is andrew and my phone number is 522-5498 i will only ftf deals no shipping and would prefer to either do the transaction in the ozark/nixa or south springfield area i dont want to drive any further but im willing to work with you. id like to get 250 out of it as i really need this money to pay for bills but again u work with me i work with you. thank you

This 22 is in decent working order.  Stock looks great and the barrel & bolt is in excellent condition.  I acquired it trading guns as a throw-in to complete a deal.  Took it to the range and made sure it works fine. I believe they quit making this model 750 in 1983. This should be a 70's model 22.

McMillan Stock
McMillan Action
McMillan Muzzle Brake
Jewel Trigger
J.D. Hart Hand Hammer Match Barrel (Less that 100 rds through it)

This is a sub MOA rifle, and will shoot as tight as you are capable of shooting. Barrel is 34"" with muzzle brake, 30"" without.
I have no way of weighing this rifle, as I dont think my broken bathroom scale would do very good. It is pretty heavy. Again, it is NOT a tactical rifle.

Comes with a Springfield Armory 6-20x56 scope with illuminated mil dot reticle. Reticle etched in first focal plane. Also comes with bipods and soft case.

The tolerances on this rifle are very tight, and it will not chamber all surplus ammo, but it will chamber some. Normal production ammo is best, with match grade obviously producing the best results.

Price with optics is $5000, $4500 without......OBO, might trade for ????

Understandably, this rifle is not for everyone. If you are seriously interested, we can set up a time for you to come shoot it,(you provide ammo) or I will come to you within reason if you have a safe place to shoot it.

Would consider a straight trade on a SAKO TRG (you keep your optics, I keep mine)

 the first riffle i have is a KOWA ( which is made by weatherby ) 300 win mag. it has a 3 x 9 x 50 bushnell scope and a harris bipod attached. also has riffle sling. i have the original box and about 5-6 boxes of ammo. it has the camo print with a stainless barrel it has only been shot maybe 10 times.

 second riffle .. is a german k98 mauser.8mm  it has the german stamps on it. at one point the riffle stock has been upgraded. or so i have been told. for it's age it is a fairly clean gun.it does have a riffle sling. and a 3 x 9 x 40 scope.( not sure of brand off top of my head) i have maybe 230-250 rounds for it.

third.. remington 1917 30.06...... it has a tasco 3x9x40 scope. custom thumbhole stock. beautiful riffle. the blueing is in fair condition for it's ageall the actions is tight. i might have 3-5 boxes  of ammo.

fourth .. is a raven 25acp. chrome plated two clips.. this gun shot very little.small enough to stick in pocket and no one would know. clean little pistol

5th..glock 19 with box. one 30 round clip.. 4 15 round clips. the 15 rounders have the 2 shot extenders. for finger extension. but i have all the original bases if you do not want the extra length  this is a first generation glock. i bought off buddy going through divorce. he has owned it for 20 years only fired 50 shots through  guns when i got. i have shot 200-300. just not much of a glock fan.

6th.. llama 45 acp.. this is a double stack 45. all blue. in really good condition. i bought for under my seat of my truck. but sold my truck. just do not need sitting in safe.


i have more but my mind if going blank. so let's start with these three. will post more later.

 now what am i looking for.  
i would really like to get a clean full length shotgun. name brand. no cheap chinese knock off shotgun. 12gauge  remington..browning.. mossberg.. let me know

i am a 9mm fan... also looking for some good 45's and always clean 22.. riffle of pistol.

i would also consider bulks of ammo in  9mm/45 acp/ 22/ 223./  500 mag and or 50 ae rounds

 i do not get to hunt. and would rather just reinvest my stock with stuff i can shoot or keep me shooting.lol..  i will also be trading some pistols. i will look in my safe later and get full list

 if you have some decent 9mm handguns. or 45 handguns  22 pistol of riffles. 12 gauge or even a ar-15  send me a email with what you have. in advance.  and when i get a full list of items i will trade, i will send this list to the people who email me first before i post them on here. outside of what i have posted here today.

This gun is already going up in value and will soon be hard to find.  I have recently seen 2 of these guns in used gun stores for between $900 and $1,000 and they did not include the extras that I am offering.  This gun comes with the 20 round clip that came with it along with an extra Ruger 5 round clip and 2 aftermarket 40 round clips.  It also comes with the original box with factory scope rings, the optional cheek rest, the gun lock, and the book.  As a special bonus I am also throwing in three 50 round boxes of Remington .223 ammo and a 20 round box of Federal hollowpoint .223 ammo.  This is a fantastic gun that shoots like an AR but won't cost you as much.  I hate to get rid of it but I have been out of work for over 2 months and need the cash.  I am asking $950 but will consider reasonable offers or interesting trades, perhaps a handgun and some cash but feel free to make me an offer."

Combining the alloy and titanium construction of the AirLites with an L-frame featuring the enclosed ""Centennial"" hammer (the only non-J-frame Centennials Smith has ever made), the new revolvers were offered in both 7-shot .38 Special (Model 242) and 5-shot .44 Special (Model 296) flavors. Weighing only 18.9 ounces, the 2"" round-butt .44 Special Model 296 offered big-bore punch, medium frame size, snag-free carryability, and was lighter than a steel J-frame. It seemed to be a recipe for success in a time when liberalized CCW laws were sweeping the country. The new revolvers were still fairly complex to make; the complexity of the two-piece barrel and the machining of the titanium cylinder translated to an MSRP of $754.00

Smith discontinue the revolver after the 2001 model year. The few who purchased one found out, that pretty is as pretty does and if you're looking for an easy-to-carry big-bore wheelgun, they don't come much prettier than the 296 Ti.

Given their unique configuration and short production run it seems safe to say that these will probably achieve at least minor collectible status in the future.

I would say this gun is about 90 percent and a great shooter. It has no problems ejecting even light target loads and the point of aim is perfect. I took this to Quail Ridge and shoot a 71 my first time there. Bore is bright and shiny. This gun is a Special Purpose not express with matte black finish and matte wood finish. It has a 28 inch VR barrel with Rem choke. I have a flush IC , Carlon's  extended mod sporting clays, flush FC and a XX Full ported turkey tube. I'm only interested in a O/U 12ga and may put down some more cash for the right gun. If your looking for a turkey gun this is it I wouldn't think twice about shooting a turkey at 55 yards with this gun and it's gas operated there's not much recoil.  Call REDACTED Tim. Cash price $600 with all chokes may take less without chokes"

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/25998,For Sale:  LIKE NEW BEAR GUN/FIRE SAFE,"SW OKC, Oklahoma, United States","$ 1,550","Listed On: Sunday, March 14, 2010",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I bought this in 2008 and I'm only selling it to move up to a bigger (taller) safe. I don't remember the model number of it, but it's deeper than what Bear sells now. It's 60"" tall, 36"" wide, and 24"" deep. ALL of Bear's safes being built now are only 22"" deep. It's a big black box with no pinstripes, nothing fancy or frilly. Bear safes are about the most secure safes on the market today. The lock design prevents it from being pryed open like the you tube videos you see. The key lock is drill and pick proof, making it inpenatrable. You will sleep like a baby. It also has 2 full hours of fire protection up to 1400 degrees. I've owned 2 other brands of safes, and will NEVER own anything but a Bear for the rest of my days.

I think I paid around $1800 for this safe (wife says $1900), plus I paid $200 to have it delivered and bolted to the floor. Looking to get $1550 cash for it AND YOU MOVE IT. I will help you get it loaded on your truck, but then you are on your own. This thing weighs around 900-950 pounds. No trades on it as I'm putting the cash towards my new Bear safe. Located off of 149th and Santa Fe in SW OKC.

SAFE IS SOLD PENDING FUNDS"
