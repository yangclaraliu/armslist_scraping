And this is the modern classic body armor currently issued to both regular French Army and the elite French Foreign Legion. Though most modern world armies have transitioned to Molle webbing system, this vest is still a favorite of the French Foreign Legion. These soldiers are often the first troops sent into dangerous spots around the world, both in and out of former French territories. It's no surprise that the equipment used by these elite fighters needs to be the very best in the world. The French really thought of everything when they designed this vest. It has room for soft armor, hard armor plates, a combat belt, pouches, and more, you'll find this assault vest has everything you could want. The camouflage pattern is French CCE which is very close to USGI Woodland. Thanks its modular design, the integrated pistol that comes with the vest can accept Alice pouches as well as Molle pouches that can be tailored to your personal needs. You can spend hundreds of your hard earned dollars on a vest that made in China or some third world country but it can't even match up to the quality of a bomb-proof authentic French made vest that can be had for a fraction of the price. The size is large but can be adjusted to fit most. REDACTED text only"
