""Looking for law abiding citizens who believe that the constitution is your Right not Your privilege .we are excepting application from all walks of life that love the outdoors ,tactical shooting , ect ect . Please have yr own gear (kit) would like to patrol the boarder (Canadian )""

""Looking for law-abiding citizens who believe the constitution is a right, not a privilege"" is probably better than what you've got but still conveys your message. Remember though, the Constitution and the subsequent Bill of Rights are actually what define our rights. They are not rights, they are documents. Also, since the Constitution and Bill of Rights are proper nouns they need to be capitalized. ""We are accepting (not ""excepting"") applications from all walks of life, looking for people interested in the outdoors, tactical shooting, etc..."" is an improvement as well. For future reference commas come directly after the word, with no space in between the word and the comma. The same applies to periods. Also ""etcetera"" is abbreviated ""etc"", not ""ect"". ""Please have your own equipment. I would like to patrol the Canadian border (not 'boarder')"" sounds a little better. The problem comes when you put the whole message together...
 
  ""Looking for law-abiding citizens who believe the Constitution is a right, not a privilege. We are accepting applications from all walks of life, looking for people interested in the outdoors, tactical shooting, etc... Please have your own equipment. I would like to patrol the Canadian border.""
   
     Now don't get me wrong. I support your right to do this, and to recruit, and freedom of speech. What bugs me is you're basically saying (in poor English)...

""Folks with guns wanted from all walks of life to form a group to defend the state with the least need of civil defense from a country that has less hostile intent than the Principality of Monaco. We would wander the woods with assorted gear in potentially bad weather (you want to get started before next June right?) where the border isn't clearly marked, putting ourselves at repeated risk of civil, criminal, and federal charges in 2 sovereign nations for no particularly good reason."" 
    
 Hell, I even support the idea of a ""well regulated militia"" composed of people not under federal jurisdiction; but this is not how to go about it. If you want to get people with half a brain on your side you have to sound like you have at least 3/4s of one. Nice flag though."

It's difficult to let go of, but i'm hoping to find a home that will make good use of it. 

 It's an excellent first pistol.  Easy to seat the magazine, and rack with a pinch grip (overhand is difficult due to the design).  as long as the feed lip is wiped between range trips, it'll run without issues.  Spring is still very strong (you can verify for yourself while inspecting).

Please have a concealed carry permit OR a handgun permit at the ready.  I'll be glad to help guide you in obtaining such documents, and recommend a basic handgun class (I have several instructors you can contact).  

Please take some time to research the Ruger 22/45 and their entire series of pistols before making an offer.  In addition, I am fully anticipating a complete inspection by any potential buyer.

Once i finish typing and doing some chores, i'll upload some photos.  First come first serve, i don't use offers to bump up the price to the current potential buyer.  I reserve the right to refuse to sale to anyone I don't feel comfortable selling to.

This rifle has a crisp trigger, no breaks or cracks in the stock with the regular imported dings and bumps to be expected. Side folding bayonet is extremely tight and rock solid when it swings out. A very cool design feature. Produced in Slovania prior to the Russian push to adopt 7.62x39, this is a VZ52 chambered in 7.62x45. Both of those cigar boxes are full of ammo - one in boxes, the other loose.

I really like to even pull this rifle out to look at, and it is a hit with enthusiasts and people who know nothing. It just has a great feel. Some have compared it to the SKS, but I feel like it is further upstream with a feeling more like an M1 variant. Definitely could be a stock refinishing project."

Also, for those sellers that require the sale to be done at a gun shop or the purchaser needs to be over 21 and has to have a CCW, you are FUCKING retarded.

Chambered in 9x18mm Makarov, which is similar to 380 acp but ballistically superior. This is a solid milled steel, military grade firearm with a chrome lined barrel. Cosmetically similar to the Walther PPK, it will fit in holsters designed for the PPK. DA/SA with a decocker and loaded chamber indicator.
This is a 1968 model with a rounded hammer for snagless drawing. The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is very hard wearing. This was done about a month ago, and the weapon looks like it is in brand-new never issued condition now. I have also added custom walnut grips that give a more ergonomic fit than the originals. Comes with two magazines, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I have ground down the finger rest on the non matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady xtp defense rounds and the original grips.
With the gun, refinishing service, and grips, I have just over $500 into this pistol and that is the basis I will use for any trades.
Looking to trade for a Sig P938 plus cash on my end. Offering an additional $100 for a basic model, more for a higher end model (SAS, Blackwood, Equinox) and/or additional mags.
Would also be interested in a trade for a Sig p238.
Would also consider a quality snub revolver.
I will consider other trades for CCW style pistols but these are the ones I'm primarily interested in.

Also, for those sellers that require the sale to be done at a gun shop or the purchaser needs to be over 21 and has to have a CCW, you are FUCKING retarded. A person wanting to buy a pistol from a private seller only needs to be a non felon 18 year old; buyers are not required to have CCW to legally by a pistol through a private sale or to even be 21, that is only through purchase from an FFL dealer.

864,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3521864,For Sale:  TPS 20 MOA Steel Scope Base for Savage 10 thru 16 or Axis Rifles,"NE Dallas, Dallas, Texas",$ 50,"Listed On: Sunday, September 21, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I purchased this rail brand new for my Savage 10 Precision Carbine, only to discover that it will not work with my particular scope. It was mounted very briefly and then removed. I ordered a new set of mounting screws from TPS, so it'll come with both the original (used) screws and four brand new screws. This is a very high-quality precision STEEL rail and is basically new with the original packaging. Asking $50 OBO, pickup only in Dallas, either downtown or near the Arboretum.

This rail is elevated by a 20 MOA cant. So when you mount your scope, you will have to adjust the reticle 20 MOA lower than you otherwise would in order to zero it in. This means that you'll have an extra 20 MOA of upward adjustment, allowing you to adjust the reticle to shoot longer distances. This rail will work on all Savage models 10 through 16 with the round rear receiver, for both the regular short action receivers, as well as the Axis receivers. Manufacturer's description follows:

The TPS XP 1-Piece Picatinny-Style Scope Base provides a standard in quality that only Tactical Precision Systems can deliver. The XP scope rail features a integral recoil shoulder to eliminate the base from moving under heavy recoil. It has a full length Mil-STD 1913 (Picatinny) rail, built to military specifications, as well as being fully compatible with Weaver-style rings. The entire scope rail is CNC machined, with the same standards and quality as all of the products from TPS. The scope rail is machined from a solid billet of 1215 alloy steel. The steel rail is finished in a matte black oxide finish to Mil-C-13924 standards. The XP bases are supplied with four 6-48 Torx screws and wrench for reliable and trouble-free installation.

Taurus 44 Magnum, 6.5 inch ported barrel, 6 shot cylinder. This gun, in my opinion, is extremely fun if you like shooting big calibers and is a manageable 44 mag. I'd say that if handguns in 45acp or 357 mag don't phase you then the kick from this shouldn't be a problem. That said, I wouldn't recommend this for beginners.

I'm in no rush to give this away and would be happy keeping it. I got it in what I think was a great trade for both myself and the other person. I'm just looking to see if I can trade straight up for other firearms that have been at the top of my wanted list, shown below. I've seen how much a factory new Model 44 costs and while this one has been used I can say that, after putting 100 rds of 44 mag through it myself, it's good as new and performs brilliantly. I wouldn't put a gun up for sale or trade if it didn't.

A straight up trade is my goal as I'm not looking to add cash with mine, at least not too much. I could add some if what you offer REALLY interests me and we both agree on the amount. For those who want this and offer something that interests me but is maybe a couple hundred less than what the Taurus would be, I'm willing to work with you but please be prepared to add that amount with your trade. 

I'm in Navarre and will only drive as far west-northwest as the Pensacola, Cantonment or Milton areas and as far east as Fort Walton or Destin. I'd rather we meet at a halfway point but we can figure something out. Email or text only, no calls as I work different shifts. REDACTED. Thanks."
