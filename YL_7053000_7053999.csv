So its had a new barrel liner installed and been re-chambered to the 218 Bee caliber and the barrel has been cut back to 23 inches, this did away with the dove tail for the front sight and it has been drilled and tapped for a more modern front sight. The barrel liner is for the 223 diameter bullets and its in as new condition. The outside of the barrel looks like the old original Winchester Octagon barrel as for the markings and the flats are nice and sharp, it has most of the blued finish on the barrel like 95% but its probably an old re-blued finish at that. The barrel has been drilled and tapped for the Weaver scope mount that's on it. The scope was probably made by Weaver for Sears Co., its a 4x scope marked J.C.Higgins, all steel with standard crosshairs, its very clear and seems to work. The receiver would have originally been color case hardened but somewhere along the line it was re-blued too, not the same as the barrel, its a pale matte blue color, no rust or bad marks on any of the metal. The wood is nice looking and not under sanded but it has been lightly refinished and holes for the sling studs have been filled in with what looks like brown stock bedding epoxy. The butt stock has a chip out at the toe of the stock next to the Crescent Steel Butt plate."

Guy said it sat in safe and was never fired. Either it was never fired or he was really good at cleaning it, I'd like to beilve it was never fired before I got it lol. Ive put about 25 birdshot and 7 slug shells through it. I put a fairly cheap set of metal BUIS on it since it came with no sights however they appear to work pretty well. It is in excellent condition. It is a ton of fun though competely impractical. They apparently made some functions of the gun more difficult to require practice and training to use and I dont think ill ever shoot it enough to develop the skill to be reliable with it. By design you can rack it back ejecting the spent shell and midway through racking it forward you can pull the trigger and drop the hammer before the shell is chambered. The shell is never lined up until chambered so it wont prematurely fire but in that instance you would have to cycle a live round out and pull another in from the tube and apparently thats by design.It's fun and in pristine condition and the 2 times ive taken it to the range, everyone talks about it.Text josh at 614 four56 9329A bill of sale and valid state ID required. I thought I had better pics on my phone.

I purchased the rifle new in 2014 for small game hunting but now prefer using a 22 or 223. The rifle is in excellent condition with minimal wear. The rifle is very accurate and reliable with CCI ammunition, the other brands are less consistent. I can throw roughly 200 rounds of CCI ammo into the trade.The scope comes with the rifle. This is an offbrand scope that I purchased in a number of years ago. However, the scope is clear and holds well since the 17 hmr has no recoil. It is a 3-9x40 that will allow you to shoot MOA. On a calm day I have been able to shoot 1"" groups at 100 yards. The 17 HMR is very susceptible to wind so groupings are proportionally tighter at short distances."

The receiver retains a lot of it's bright original bluing with some scratches and areas losing bluing from handling. Lever and hammer still have original case colors intact, mostly in protected areas. Barrel and magazine tube have 90% bright original bluing with only minor handling marks. Gumwood butt stock and forend are free from any major damage or cracks. They have numerous dings and bruises as shown. Most gumwood carbine stocks will be found with heavy wear and bruises - gumwood is much softer than the usual black walnut found on rifles. Edges are sharp and wood to metal fit is great. An old added coat of varnish is present on both stocks, but looks fine. No sanding or refinishing has been done. The bore is stunning and mint; bright and shiny with very strong rifling. The action cycles smoothly and locks up tight. Corners are full of gunk, a good indication this gun has never been messed with or over cleaned. Shipping is also available."
