I had the stock HS Precision recoil pad which is nothing short of terrible replaced by a gunsmith with a Limb Saver recoil pad and 2lbs added to the butt stock to reduce recoil even more. 

It also comes with 8lbs of Accurate MagPro powder, 60 never fired Hornady brass (40 are loaded), 200ea Berger 300gr OTM bullets (40 are loaded), RCBS 338 Lapua Die Set, 200 Remington Magnum Rifle Primers, and a desert/khaki drag bag. The rifle came stock with the muzzle break, 5 round magazine, and 20 MOA rail. Bi-pod isn't included. 

$1,700 firm. That's cheaper than what it will cost you in a store and doesn't count the $300 gunsmith job. I am located in Klamath Falls but can meet somewhere closer. Text me: REDACTED, Marcus"

This is the medium frame version of Colt's very first rifle, chambered in .44-40. This rifle has serial number 18368, putting it manufactured in 1886. This rifle is 128 years old. Gun is all original, with a very understandable amount of bluing wear. The wood still looks great, with no cracks or repairs anywhere. You'll notice the open slot in front of the trigger guard. Colt stopped installing slide locks on the Lightning very early in production, but still used the receiver that had the slot for it. So many of the early Lightnings have the open slot, but never had a slide lock installed from the Colt factory. This rifle is in great mechanical condition, and I'm sure it would shoot just fine for anyone looking to buy this to use. Asking $3,999. We will ship this for anyone not local that is interested. Please message us for more detailed pictures."

Dimensions are: 60” x 30” x 23”   Currently set up for 11 guns with the side shelves. Could easily be changed to 20 gun without side shelves. External hinges allow the door to open a full 180 degrees. The interior shelves are adjustable. Side shelves can be removed to increase long gun capacity. It has some marks and scratches in the paint, only cosmetic. Call Craig 970-674-eight seven five five. No Texts Please! Emails with contact numbers only will be answered."

Because of its innovative design, the SRS takes up less rail space while maintaining the durability expected from Trijicon. The shorter housing eliminates the tube-effect typical of other sealed reflex sights. Featuring a large 28mm aperture, the Trijicon SRS provides a massive field of view for quicker target engagements. The 1.75 MOA dot is small enough for precision and with 10 brightness settings it can be bright enough for any speed. Finally, the Trijicon SRS features dual power sources.

Bigger, Better, Badder, The Russian Vepr shotgun is the Gold standard in imported 12 guage semi-autos.
In reference to The Gas System It differs from the Saiga and in my opinion is a very nice upgrade. The Saiga 12 has a gas system that can be manually adjusted to allow for the firing of different shells, i.e, Hi-Brass, Low Brass, Bird Shot, Buck Shot , etc.
Unlike the Saiga , The Vepr has a highly advanced self regulating gas system that automatically adjust to the recoil of the weapon allowing this weapon to feed virtually all types of shells without incident.

It has a tasteful two-tone finish with matte nickel cylinder, 5"" barrel, cylinder, cylinder release,  hammer, trigger, frame screws and rear site base while the frame of the gun is matte black.  He built a custom compensator into the barrel and did the nicest, smoothest trigger job you'll ever feel on a wheel gun with match grade action internal trigger overtravel stop.  He reset the cylinder/barrel gap and headspace, recut the barrel crown, and rounded the trigger.  The stocks are S&W Goncalo Alves I believe in Cocobolo. The final touch was some tritium three dot sights but, the glow has pretty much faded from them. There's more he did that I've forgotten.  The gun has a very slight amount of holster wear.  The gun functions flawlessly and is a joy to shoot.  I'll include the Ernie Hill Speedleather Fas-Trac Holster shown in the pictures.

A Diamondback like this one is what it is all about if you like Snake guns. I am still struck with the condition and beauty of this Colt. Gun has grease on it as the pictures show and went straight from purchase in 1978 to a safe until DCF purchase and is offering this to one lucky future owner. If you are s serious Colt person, it does not get any better than this Diamondback. Walk back into 1978 and purchase a new Colt Diamondback.

I feel confident in stating that this Para was shot very little, IF any. Locks up tight, bore is shiny and clean. Exterior finish better than 98%. Buy with confidence-you will not be disappointed.
Great Carry gun.
Para's are commonly used in competition shooting. You cannot beat Para's reliability and accuracy. I have personally shot hundreds and hundreds of rounds through Para's and NEVER had any kind of failure. Always amazed at the accuracy.
Highly sought after ""Made in Canada"" model.
P13's are very hard to find to start with and even tougher in this condition.
Comes with 2 high cap mags and original Para box.
 Considering the firepower AND the original cost new this is an Excellent buy!!!
***I do have quite a few other Para's that I'm selling but haven't listed yet.

 IF local then still must go through FFL for CBI.

The barrel is threaded and fluted. The Mark II FV-SR barrel material is made of carbon steel with a matte
black finish. Stock is matte black synthetic. Barrel length is 16.5"", weighs 5.5 lbs and capacity is 5+1. That's a lot of features for the price and it's a very, very quiet suppressor host.

The suppressor is a Thompson Machine Zephyr XL, which is also fluted for weight reduction. For those who demand the quiteset and most robust rimfire suppressor made, the Zephyr XL is quite possibly the perfect .22lr suppressor.  Thompson Machine purpose built the XL for rifle hosts (it looks perfectly in scale on bolt action or semi-auto .22 rifles), and .22lr machine guns, but it also makes a GREAT pistol can.  The XL is small enough in diameter to allow the user to see the sights on most pistols, but large enough to offer absolutely outstanding performance on any .22 host you choose to put it on.

Pricing for the rifle is $229 and $345 for the can. If you want both we'll do $550.
