It is designed to be used with both eyes open, providing the operator with maximum situational awareness. The large aperture and tapered light path maximizes the viewing area in such a small optic, allowing for fast target engagement – especially from non-standard shooting positions. Advanced lens coatings and electronics produce a crisp red dot. The brightness control dial on the MRO is specifically designed for ambidextrous usage. With a mid-adjustment “off” position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments. The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools. Hard-anodized, forged 7075-T6 housing is fully sealed and waterproof, providing durability in demanding conditions."

Also has a quad rail on it. Included is a Sig Tac scope and two 30 round Promag magazines and  i'll even throw in 60 rounds to fill those mags.  I've put probably 300 rounds through this and never had even a hiccup.  I am NOT desparate to sell this,  so don't bother lowballing.

Ultratech is Microtech’s original dual action out-the-front knife, and has been the foundation of our entire OTF line. Over the years, it has gone through several modifications, each time becoming more efficient and reliable. The ULTRATECH’s spring remains in an “at rest” position at all times except when deployed. This ensures that the compressed spring will not become fatigued, assuring users that when the knife is fired, it will operate effectively. Ultratech can take many different forms; it can be topped with a standard machined aluminum top or a piece of carbon fiber. The ULTRATECHS’ light weight, one handed open and close action, slim shape, and scalpel sharp blade make it a one of a kind knife, only available through Microtech. This knife has proven time and again that it can withstand any obstacle.

I am the second owner and the first owner (a friend of mine) never shot it. This rifle was purchased around the late 90's early 2000's and has literally 3 rounds down the barrel. If you know anything about Cetmes, they are the father of the H&K G3. They are not easy to obtain, especially an older one like this is in the condition its in.The barrel looks like a mirror and the rifling is very strong. Finish is around 99%. This is an older version so it does not have a pictinny rail on it. It is missing the bird cage flash hider. As i stated before the previous owner never shot it so when i took it out to fire the loose barrel device flew off and i could never find it hahaha. With that said the threads look great! She just needs a muzzle device. The original brakes are pretty cheap and can be bought on clear view investments for $7. The reason for me parting ways with this amazing firearms is due to me focusing more on kalishnikov platforms instead of the G3 style. I need the safe space and this rifle (while very collectible and reliable) doesnt fit my current interests. It comes with a mag holder and 2 mags. Mags for the cetme run around $4 and this cetme will take HK mags but they are a little higher in price. Not in a hurry to sell, price is firm"

Singularly unique and only one-of-a-kind, this firearm was custom fabricated using a Savage-Stevens side-by-side double-barrel 16 gauge shotgun. The stock and forend are checkered and made of premium Select American Walnut. The blueing on the barrel and all metal components is original and remains dark in color and free of any significant pitting. The receiver/frame is case color hardened still displaying iridescent hues. Installed on the solid barrel rib is a set of Truglo Gobble Magnum front and rear adjustable fiberoptic rifle sights. A new Limbsaver Precision-Fit Air Tech recoil pad was selected and installed on the butt stock. The barrel blank was fabricated to meet 32 caliber centerfire specifications as an Insert Barrel at Green Mountan Rifle Barrel Company using premium 4140 Chrome Moly bar stock steel. The Insert Barrel was cut, rifled and customized using state-of-the-art CNC Machining operations for 32 H&R Magnum specifications and then custom fit and finished for this application by Ace Dube of MCA Sports in Alaska. One barrel remains original with the 16 gauge shotgun (410 gauge insert adapter included) bore and the other barrel contains the 32 H&R Magnum Insert the full length of that barrel. This rifled barrel also chambers 32 S&W Short and 32 S&W Long.  Primarily a ""pistol"" cartridge, when fired through a long rifle barrel the 32 Centerfire bullet is faster, more powerful, more accurate, and also deadly quiet. The reloadable 32 S&W Long's are lethal for small game when using lead flat nose and wad cutter bullets and due to their non-expanding properties, minimize meat damage for tablefare. The 32 H&R Magnum is a more powerful cartridge and is more than capable of taking down medium ""coyote"" sized predators. The 16 gauge, using shot or slug, completes this gun as the perfect hunting partner."
