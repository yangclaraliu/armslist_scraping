I decided to sell the PPQ M2, 4"". .  I have been shooting for over 37 years, and the PPQ, is by far, the most accurate firearm I have ever owned. Just my opinion, of course.  I don't think I've fired more than 50 rounds through this gun. It is still brand new, original box and paperwork, 2-15 round mags.  Asking $525.  Florida Drivers required please.  IT'S GOT TO GO BEFORE AUG 26!  Please contact me with any questions.  Thank You!"

The guns are convertible so you can run the decocker or switch to a safety. I have plenty of handguns and love my full size CZ 75 so thats why I bought this. They are $620.00 new but I know since its used it will go for less. I also have a Galco paddle holster that will be included. Email with questions and I can meet most nights after 6p.

I will not trade for something that has been abused so please serious trades/inquiries only. Let me know what you have if interested and thank you for reading"

All factory  paperwork and accessories are included: original flat dark earth carrying bag, 3  15 round magazines, factory lock, extra back straps,sight mount and all the factory tools. ImprovingNP™-45 Tactical, developed for the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 Tactical was born and bred for battle. Like its legendary FN forefathers, this combat handgun was designed to not only survive the battlefield, but to emerge victorious. It is the latest in technological advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a host of unique features that no other handgun can match.
Its 15-round magazine is precisely engineered to take a dive to the prone position and naturally roll up toward the target. The checkered polymer frame has a low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil, enhanced operator control, and a grip angle that provides unmatched natural point of aim. Four interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The 5.3″ cold hammer-forged stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to accept sound suppressors, compensators, and other accessories. The stainless steel slide has high-profile combat night sights and includes two mounting bases to accept multiple styles of optional red-dot electronic sights."

Solidly built with a steel frame, slide and barrel. Completely of forged steel parts as it precedes the age of MIM. This gun represents the classic style of handguns with forged steel manufacturing, instead of stamped steel, alloy frames, plastic and polymer so common today.  This one is chambered for 9 mm like many Star pistols -- a little less recoil than the 45 ACP.
 
Performance and Handling: Recoil is light and still very controllable even with hot loads.   The weight soaks up what normally would be snappy recoil from a compact pistol. Love the accuracy and reliability shooting all kinds of ammo, JHP, etc.
 
 
Colt 1911 Commonalities:   The many similarities to the 1911 ACP make this pistol a favorite. First, the look and feel are squarely 1911. That very classic and natural pick up. Teed ramp design is the same as on the 1911.
 
 
Like the 1911, the Star using a Browning style lock up as is evidenced by the swinging link and locking lug on the barrel along with the removable barrel bushing.   
Action & Trigger: single-action with locked breech. Single action trigger break is excellent – very clean! Serrated finger pad for a sure grip.
 
 
PREMIUM FEATURES:
Checkering milled into the hammer for a sure feel.
Magazine well is beveled from the factory.
Throated from the factory.
Safeties: Thumb safety on left side like the Colt 1911. You can carry cocked and locked. Gun also has a Magazine Disconnect for additional safety.
Sights: notched rear blade and serrated front ramp. Easy to pick up at speed. The sight picture is easy to obtain in both slow and rapid-fire drills. The rear sight is drift adjustable for windage.
 
Grips: checkered brown
 
 Pivoting external claw extractor like the Browning Hi Power and other major semiautomatic brands.
Trigger has serrated finger pad.
Full-length guide rod with captive recoil spring.
Removable barrel bushing.
  
As a testament to their quality, Star firearms are still used by police, security and military agencies in Spain.   It reflects the reliability, durability and the quality of Spanish pistols and to the skill and workmanship of the workers of Star Firearms Bonifacio.
 
Conclusion:  The easy handling and resemblances to the classic Colt 1911 make this pistol a favorite among collectors, recreational shooters, or carry owners."

Only thing that I asked them not to do was round the trigger guard or shorten the barrel so it still has the classic 92fs profile. Not often one of these becomes available, especially with this amount of options and UNFIRED. Bought this gun new months ago and had it shipped directly to Wilson before firing a single shot. I have also not shot since taking delivery so it is BRAND NEW. Has the ""G"" decocker only feature which is highly desired and took months and lots of $$ to complete. If you are familiar with this gun you don’t need me to explain how perfect it is. This listing is not for everyone. You can order one yourself for about $2k total but you will have to wait months and months for it to be completed. Waiting was the hardest part. This is for someone who has extra money and does not want to wait. $2750 FIRM. Don't even offer me $2749 because I will only take $2750. Yes I know that's too much and you can get it cheaper, blah blah blah. I don't need the money and in no rush so please don’t offer me less than $2750. Only offers I will consider are other high end and expensive guns. Prefer to meet face to face so you don't have to pay extra fees but willing to ship if you need it. If you are reading this right now, the gun is still for sale."

It also has the factory cleaning brush & rod. It also has firm rubber grips for a more tactical feel and added recoil control, they make the pistol feel like it is part of your hand. It also comes with an autoloader so you don’t have pain in your fingers from loading clips.
The 1911A was Originally made for the Marine Corp by the Colt manufacturer and is renouned for its stopping power. It is ideal for home defence. Target the body mass of an intruder and fire, He’s going down and he won’t get up. When fired at test subjects wearing a bullet proof vest the subject suffered multiple broken ribs. You don’t jump up from that!
For those that know, the Chinese made Norinco 1911-A1 is a HIGH QUALITY weapon that is an exact replica of a USGI Colt 1911A1, with one exception. The steel on these Norinco 1911s are made from recycled Railroad Steel!! This steel is EXTREMELY strong (even stronger than the steel used by COLT, Springfield Armory and even Kimber) and makes this pistol perfect for any custom gunsmithing you may wish to have done.
As a rule I don’t like Chinese made products, but they knocked this one out of the park! You will never have a days trouble with this gun. Research for yourself to confirm everything I said here. You will find that these facts are accurate. DO NOT MISTAKE THIS FOR THE TURKISH-MADE NORINCO 1911. Those are junk! Look at the pictures, see the ""Made in China"" stamped on the frame. This is a HIGH QUALITY 1911 and it will probably out live you and any abuse you might give it.
$500.00 is the asking price for gun, 4 clips and clip loader. Make me a decent offer!
I also have 200 rounds of Remington & Federal 45 cal. ammo, and 100 rounds of Center Fire Hollow Point, 45 cal. ammo. That is 300 rounds for $50.00. Not interested in trades."

This revolver is hammer-forged for tough performance and confidence-boosting accuracy, and it comes with a hand-fitted action and a clean, crisp trigger right out of the box. The Model 44 features a ported barrel that reduces muzzle flip and felt-recoil, the Taurus Security System (TSS), and a transfer bar safety.
 Manufactured in 2011. I purchased this revolver in AZ and have enjoyed this revolver for 2 years but, think I'm getting over it. I havn't had any issues with the timing or cylinder lockup going out on me. The surface finish is a taurus surface finish so don't expect it to shine like a colt anaconda. It has wear on it and STILL looks good. This taurus is very accurate and has an excellent SA trigger....ok DA pull. The barrel porting does help with the recoil but so does weighing something like 45oz. I have Carried this revolver concealed for 2 winters and feel unstoppable when it's on me. this revolver is also extremly loud especially at an indoor range when the vectored muzzle blast reflects off the celing and resonates in your skull. I currently own S&W, Ruger, and Taurus revolvers and am a ruger fanboy when it comes to revolvers. With that said, Taurus REVOLVERS are still a great buy. with proper maintenence they should last forever."

It's a handsome pistol and if you're going to own a .380ACP, then Walther PPK would be the signature pistol to have. This is the same model pistol that James Bond carries in a lot of his movies. It is accurate, and a very manageable weight for a pocket .380, it is unfortunately two little for my large gorilla-hands. I really want to like it, and I really want to be able to reliably carry it on me, but I had to be so conscious of where my grip was during a range session that I am not willing to completely retrain myself to avoid slide-bite. I took it out for one shooting session of a single box of .380 and that was all I needed to make my decision. The lever on the side is a decocker/safety, and one of the two mags has the pinky extension which I very greatly preferred over the other mag that did not. Gun is in fantastic shape internally/externally, and will come with the two magazines mentioned , walther factory case, as well as the 6-magazine pouch, with embroidered label x2, that you see in the picture. It's how I keep all the spare mags for all my guns, but I have several laying around and don't need to keep the labels on a gun I'm getting rid of. Cash Price is $550 which appears to be fair internet pricing."
