Condition: I'd conservatively rate the finish at 80%+.  The laser etching is starting to fade, and the slide shows some holster wear.

Sights:  3-dot painted

This pistol comes with one factory magazine.

Pricing:  $400 + $20 FFL Fee.  I searched gunbroker and online retailers to get an estimate of value.  The lowest prices I found were around $450, after shipping/transfer..  Brick/mortar shops priced this pistol at $500+ retail, but obviously no educated buyer would pay that.  I believe my price is fair, and would like to politely decline trade-offers and negotiations below my asking price.

It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.  No cash would change hands until the actual time of transfer, after you've been able to see the actual firearm."

Pricing: $420 + $20 FFL Fee. I believe my price is fair, and would like to politely decline trade-offers and negotiations below my asking price.

It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.  No cash would change hands until the actual time of transfer, after you've been able to see the actual firearm."

Condition: I'd conservatively rate the finish at 65%+, as there are a few small scratches on the slide. The frame has a bit of wear, but as the pictures show, the firearm is in overall good shape. It's worth noting that this pistol was bought used, detail stripped, all major components evaluated, and rebuilt with a factory spurred hammer (costs around $45). I have a very similar pistol also listed for sale, and would sell both as a pair for $650.

Sights: 3-dot painted

This pistol comes with one factory magazine.

Pricing: $340 + $20 FFL Fee. I believe my price is fair, and would like to politely decline trade-offers and negotiations below my asking price."

It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.

I have a Remington 700 AAC-SD Tactical barreled action that has seen roughly 100 rounds. This rifle has been shot with a suppressor and as such I had Steve Baldwin cut the barrel back to 19.25"" and thread and crown. From the factory every AAC-SD that I have purchased has not had a crown and this along with concentric threads were the reasons for the job. Factory trigger has been tuned to 54oz and has performed very well. This action wears a Brownells 20 MOA steel picatinny scope base. This rifle for the short time I have owned it has produced very nice groups.

This is for the Barreled action and 20 MOA rail only.

I am asking $650 for this very nice barreled action. I am willing to ship to your ffl, but they must accept from an individual. Willing to meet people near the Yukon area for in person inspections. 

You will not be disappointed in this setup. If you have questions or want to see more pictures, please PM me and we can text or talk over the phone.

This flash hider is extremely effective at killing flash when shooting at dusk an added bonus is all the muzzle blast and noise is projected to the front of the muzzle making the 308 much more pleasant to shoot.

-Shotgun w/ 28"" barrel, Remington factory choke, Orange follower

130 rds. total: 
-80 rds. Sellier & Bellot Max Dram 2 3/4"" 12 pellet 00 Buckshot

-22 rds. Winchester Super-X 2 3/4"" 9 pellet 00 Buckshot 

Shotgun is un-modified except for swapping out the factory follower with an orange one for high visibility when the magazine tube is empty. Never fired exotic loads or slugs etc. barrel has only seen about 50 rds of buckshot. Functions reliably but it's spent too much time in a safe instead of out shooting for me to want to keep it any longer. Excellent platform for future modification to fit your needs with extensive aftermarket parts availability.

Works well, but I'm interested in trying something different. I'm interested in trading it for a different HD/Tactical style shotgun. Primarily looking for a Benelli Nova Tactical or a Winchester SXP Extreme Defender, but would consider other similar weapons. I already have a nice field gun so I am not interested in hunting shotguns.
Would consider less expensive model shotguns as well+cash, such as a base model Winchest SXP, any of the ASI shotguns on the market now, the IAC Hawk Remington 870 clones, and others.

While I'm primarily interested in another shotgun but I would also consider a mid or full sized 9mm of some sort or a .38 special snub revolver.  Not interested in rifles at this time.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

RIA has gained a solid reputation in the 1911 market where so many other manufactures are trying to compete. The RIA 1911A1 is a solid platform for entry level users with plenty of room for personalization or modification. If you are on a budget and looking for a 1911, then this is the one for you.

I received this Single Action Beauty as a plain ""GI"" model and added a few features that most find popular and seem to like. I am no gunsmith so, the parts I added are for the most part, and with a little finesse ""Drop In"".

Features include,
* Wilson Combat - High Hand, extended Beavertail (added)
* Wilson Combat - Commander Style Hammer (added)
* Flat Mainspring Housing
* Pachmayr - Finger Groove Grips (added)
* Wilson Combat - 18 lb. Recoil Spring (added)
* Polished Feed Ramp
* GI Style Short Trigger
* GI Style Blade Sights
* 2, 7 Round Single Stack Magazines

This Durable and proven 1911 comes with everything as it would come from the store with original plastic case, owners manual, test fire casings with Inspection Date of 3/29/12, and original wood grips. Also all original parts that I replaced will be included so you can decide on your own what direction you want to go with it. Put it back to it's original ""GI"" Configuration or, just leave it like it is.

It's still new in box, and has never been fired.  Comes with 1 magazine. Was for my wife, but we found the pink version of the same gun. It is common practice for others on ArmsList to sale guns that they have had issues with such as Failures to feed, Failures to Eject, stovepiping, ect. This one is still new in box and covered under warranty. You'll know it's history...

This is the most current generation of the TCP, i.e., the ""E"" series. I own the ""D"" series and carry and shoot it often.

Unlike the Kel Tec P3AT, the Ruger LCP, the DB380, and other .380 ACP pocket pistols in the same price point, the TCP has last round hold open. That is, after you fire the last shot, the slide will stay open making it easier for you to tell when the last shot is fired AND makes it easier and simpler to reload.

The reliability and fit and finish of the Taurus TCP is on pair if not better than it's competitors, but at a slightly lower price. That is why I chose it over all others. It's also made in the U.S.A.

PRICE IS FIRM. Must be 21 of age, VA ID, and sign Bill Of Sale.

The 738 TCP offers 6+1 shots of .380 ACP, a durable polymer frame and low-profile fixed sights. You have to feel it to believe it!

Super Shock Tip Bullets combine proven Hornady performance with a higher ballistic coefficient than available with most hunting bullets. The sharp, pointed polymer tip creates a faster, flatter shooting bullet. With its one-piece core and jacket strengthened in critical areas, the SST delivers much more controlled expansion and superior weight retention than other tipped bullets. Featuring Hornady's trade mark Interlock ring system, this bullet's core and jacket remain locked solid during expansion, creating massive wound channels. This is not loaded ammunition.

I recently picked up this LG G3 (AT&T) on trade and dont need it. I have sprint so an ATT phone isnt exactly helpful haha. This is in pretty good condition but has normal scratches and dings from light drops on edges. The screen is not cracked and the phone still operates great! I saw it operating before I got it in trade and the previous owner master reset it. Since then it has simply been sitting on my desk. I do not have AT&T so I dont have a way to ""reconfirm"" that it is working perfect, but I will have it charged up so you can see it running for yourself when you buy. I have to sell it ""as-is"" simply because it is a used phone, but you can see it working before you buy. Need to be able to meet up in Norman somewhere in town. To arrange a meet up shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there!

It comes with original case and one 15 round magazine.

From Diamondback:

This new 9mm pistol is a striker-fire designed platform that incorporates an ergonomically driven polymer double stack frame with a stainless steel slide.  With extensive research on the form and function of the tactile-enhanced grip, the operator will find the design enhances control, while providing consistent hand placement. The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine.

Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide.  Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user‚Äôs hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation.

The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75‚Äù Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25‚Äù sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition.
