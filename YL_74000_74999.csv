If interested let me know what you have.
 Model SP-10™ is the ultimate in lethality – from duck blinds to the turkey woods and everywhere in between. Its 3 1/2"" 10-gauge payloads are significantly superior in patterning efficiency to 12-gauge 3 1/2"" guns, and even produce less felt recoil. It features a corrosion-resistant gas-operated action in which a small cylinder – not the entire piston – moves, helping dampen rearward force. Ultra-reliable and smooth, it’s the only shotgun worthy of the ultimate bird-leveling payload."

It has never been shot or even handled. I would sell it for $120. If I can't get near that ill keep it for myself or give it as a gift. It would be a great gun for just about anyone. Great for plinking or hunting. Need to sell this week.

The metal is excellent and the wood is very nice. This AK has grenade launching capability and grenade launching sight as shown in the pictures.

The rifle shoots the popular 7.62x39 caliber. It is very accurate, features a threaded muzzle with a slant brake installed Two mil-surp metal 30 round mag's and Green canvas sling,compensator, bayonet lug,bayonet and scabbard (number matching) and heavy duty bipod with 200 rounds,upgraded Black fore end with UltiMAK M9 optic mount ( Wood Fore end Included ).Barrel: 16 1/4"", Overall: 34 1/4"".. Shot very little less then 100 rounds.

The rifle is a combination of original Yugoslavian rifle parts and U.S.-made compliance parts. The fit and finish of the rifle is more than acceptable, with an evenly applied Parkerized finish and an above-average-condition wood fore-end.

The M70B1 has some novel features that set it apart from the run-of-the-mill AK variant. First, it has the enlarged and reinforced area around the trunnion like the RPK on its stamped receiver. In addition, a unique grenade ladder sight located on the gas block, when rotated into its upward open position, provides meter range marks and cuts off the gas port in the gas block. Also, the rifle features front and rear flip-up night sights, although the luminous material has long since disappeared. Has a smooth and comfortable trigger.

I might be interested in trading for something of equal value."

Swiss K31 rifle, 7.5mm, metal in VG to excellent condition. It has some freckling but not rust on the receiver. The magazine has finish rubbed off from handling. Walnut stock, butt has signs of use and from being carried and stacked and some dents. There is a gouge on the right by the rear sight and on the left by the front band. This is a solid stock, not one of the cracked ones. Has import mark. The rifle and magazine are matching numbers. Bolt is not numbered. There is a soldier's tag, Fritz Frankenhauser, under the buttplate with the same rifle number.

These are accurate rifles with a trigger generally found on commercial rifles. A crisp 4 pounds!

It comes with a correct sling and I'm including 100 rounds of ammo. 60 are milsurp and 40 are Boxer, reloadable, all non corrosive.

Man's ring with four diamonds set in 14kt gold. The four diamonds are lined up and set large to small with the main stone (“I” color VS-2) at just under a quarter carat set by itself and the other three diamonds are matched for clarity and lined up together along side to complement the main stone. The total diamond carat weight is just about a half carat. For information purposes this ring was made locally in 1982 and the original appraisal at that time based on the then gold price of $350/Troy oz was just under $1,000. The ring is in excellent condition. A copy of the original appraisal is available upon request.

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The metal is excellent and the wood is very nice. This AK has grenade launching capability and grenade launching sight as shown in the pictures.

The rifle shoots the popular 7.62x39 caliber. It is very accurate, features a threaded muzzle with a slant brake installed Two mil-surp metal 30 round mag's and Green canvas sling,compensator, bayonet lug,bayonet and scabbard (number matching) and heavy duty bipod with 200 rounds,upgraded Black fore end with UltiMAK M9 optic mount ( Wood Fore end Included ).Barrel: 16 1/4"", Overall: 34 1/4"".. Shot very little less then 100 rounds.

The rifle is a combination of original Yugoslavian rifle parts and U.S.-made compliance parts. The fit and finish of the rifle is more than acceptable, with an evenly applied Parkerized finish and an above-average-condition wood fore-end.

The M70B1 has some novel features that set it apart from the run-of-the-mill AK variant. First, it has the enlarged and reinforced area around the trunnion like the RPK on its stamped receiver. In addition, a unique grenade ladder sight located on the gas block, when rotated into its upward open position, provides meter range marks and cuts off the gas port in the gas block. Also, the rifle features front and rear flip-up night sights, although the luminous material has long since disappeared. Has a smooth and comfortable trigger.

I might be interested in trading for something of equal value."

FAL, AK47 and Galil variants- Basic armoring, some custom on FAL and AK models

Roll Mark painting- anything, not stainless steel- Standard jobs- $25

Stippling Polymer frames and grips eg. M&P and Glock, (yes shot gun and AR15 grips are included) a permanent upgrade to the system, grip tape peels and rubber rips, whether its raining, icy, your blood or not your blood, you will not loose grip. Same style as Chris Costa and Travis Haley from magpul- Standard jobs $50, $100 for large areas or most of the frame on a pistol.
