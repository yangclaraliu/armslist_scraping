NOTE: I will sale to out-of-state people if you make the arrangements with a local gun dealer to me (you'll be responsible for their fees and shipping), I'll take the gun to them, hand it to them, we will be in contact at the dealer, you pay the $375 to my PayPal account, and they will ship the gun out to you.  This way you'll know you won't be cheated or anything.

Are you a fan of our nation’s Wild West era? Do you participate in Cowboy Action Shooting? Are you an avid big-game hunter? If you answered yes to any of those questions, you’re ready to step up to the new Henry Big Boys. Rooted in history, the .44 magnum version is the first American-made .44-caliber Henry lever action featuring a solid brass receiver since the original Henry rifle of 1860. Versions are also available in .357 magnum and .45 Long Colt. These guns are loaded with the adventure and romance of America’s Old West with distinctive octagonal barrels, straight-grip American walnut stocks with brass buttplates and brass barrel bands. A nice 19th-century touch is the use of fully adjustable Marble semi-buckhorn rear sights with white diamond inserts and brass-beaded front sights."

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY 
This listing is for ONE magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. Most of us who’ve been in the firearms business for any length of time came to know Triple K Manufacturing through their excellent leather gear. Triple K has been in business since 1946. Of all the manufacturers, Triple K is the only source left for magazines to fit many discontinued firearms. Photos show specimens of the Triple K #363M, their blue steel magazine to fit the Colt Junior and ancestor Astra Cub pistols chambered in .25 ACP caliber. Construction is all steel body, springs, cartridge follower, and floorplate. This magazine holds 7 rounds of .25 ACP or 6.35mm Browning ammunition, call it what you will, The .25 Auto round. This magazine fits only the Colt Junior pistols manufactured from about 1969 until about 1973; and the immediate ancestor Spanish Made Astra Cubs in .25 caliber. The Astras were the Colt Junior’s ancestors, produced in the 1950s and 1960s. These magazines will NOT work in a Colt 1908 Vest Pocket, will Not work in a pistol chambered for .22 caliber, Will Not Work as a nozzle clamp on a 1966 Fleet’s syringe bottle. They will only work on Colt Junior Pistols or Astra Cub pistols chambered in .25 ACP caliber. We’re offering these brand new Triple K magazines each	for only	$ 29.00.   Not for sale to residents of New York City.

With the advent of modern AR-15 accessories and technology, new concepts and old ideas live side by side. For instance, the CMMG MK3 CBR is a lightweight, modular carbine chambered in the trusted .308 Winchester cartridge. Normally, this caliber would be reserved for a heavy, long barreled battle rifle. CMMG created a carbine that handles like a lightweight .556 NATO, but packs the punch of the proven .308 Winchester cartridge.

The MK3 CBR can be made to fit shooters of all sizes, thanks to the adjustability of the Magpul stock. An ergonomic grip, also from Magpul, adds to the ergonomic features of this rifle. CMMG also includes a KeyMod rail system.

The KeyMod accessory mounting system is the new industry standard. KeyMod is a simple, low profile and comfortable mounting alternative to M1913 Picatinny Rail. The standardization of the system will allow direct attachment of accessories without the use of intermediate M1913 rails found on most modular hand guards.

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several
intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light
conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint
Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during
critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual
Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light
output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include
other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light
transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and
precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged
construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from
aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled
to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish
eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. It's water
resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging
hunting conditions.

Most miles since ownership have been highway (130k-170k).

 The Good:
 -New Engine (90k) professionally installed recently.
 -New Transmission (110k) AW4 professionally installed recently.
 -New Transmission Flex Plate installed by me recently.
 -New Exhaust bracket welded to frame to stop rattling on X-member.
 -Got over 23mpg Hwy on our trips.
 -Electronics all working including Hella Lamps with interior switch.
 -New Engine purrs like a kitten and new transmission shifts like a dream.
 -That Fire-Engine Red is very nice and holding up well.
 -Has hitch + connector.
 -Beefy Yokohama Tires 
 -Installed SkyJacker Lift Kit (unsure of type/size but at least front shocks need replace)

 The Bad:
 -Front shocks likely blown and need replace for more ground clearance.
 -RPM stumbles at 2300-2600 when under acceleration. This could be something extremely easy like the fuel filter, or plugs and wires, or something like that.
 -Vertical crack in windshield along rear view mirror. (I know a wonderful place that can replace it in FoCo for $99!
 -4WD shifter linkage underneath driver's seat needs to be re-bent or replaced. It is in 2WD right now and can be manually engaged into 4WD if you get out and push the lever, you'll understand what piece I mean if you're a JEEP person. (Another easy fix)

 Reason for selling: Poor college student seems to be a great reason these days, also need to free up parking space at apartment building since we go not go ""Jeeping"" anymore. Our loss is your gain, this is truly a fine example of that saying. We have put a TON of money into this JEEP to get her running again, nearly a new vehicle with the main components all being somewhat new. The parts came from insurance company vehicles that were totaled. Most paperwork will come with the JEEP that we have saved. Contact us to come check her out and go for a ""stumble-drive"" haha.

791,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3505791,For Sale:  1996 Bryant 212 Limited 21' and AirDock Boat Lift,"Manhattan, Kansas, United States","$ 8,500","Listed On: Saturday, October 4, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I purchased this boat 6 years ago, and I know the entire ownership history of this boat.   It has been very well cared for, and maintained.  Here is what is included:

1.  Boat/trailer NADA low to high value is $7500-8500

2.  Boat lift new price is around $2000-2500.   Used value placed at $1000-1300



The trailer axles were replaced last year, approx $900.   Has dated, but upgraded stereo with 12"" subwoofer under driver seat.   Will need new speakers over next few years, but had no plans for it this year or next.  Sounds great still.  Has new head unit for stereo.   Needs 2 new tires eventually.  Has a color matched bimini top, and an aftermarket complete boat cover.   

Mechanically sound.  Every year serviced by Bottgers marine in JC.  Last year I had them replace both batteries ($240), and they ran the stereo wiring to make sure it was good.   They also replaced the perco-switch.   Lower unit was serviced in '09.   It has a stainless steel HIGH FIVE prop.  Engine is a Alpha one, 5.7L.   I haven't looked at the hours, but can almost guarantee it's low for the age.  This boat mostly pulls a tube or skiers for a little while, then it's to the beach.   We can switch to battery one, and listen to the stereo turned up loud ALL DAY, and have no problems starting it to leave in the evening.  

Upholstery is in good condition with a few places that could use some TLC.   Overall interior in good condition.  Exterior color is burgundy.   There are a few scratches, the keel guard will need replaced eventually if you think it needs one, there is one gel coat scrape that is above the water line and not an issue other than cosmetic.  

This boat runs STRONG.  Pulls skiers, and mostly pulls a very large tube with 3 kids with absolutely NO problems.  It has been stored INSIDE most of its life.  

You will not find a more reliable, quality used boat than this one for the price.    I am selling it to upgrade to a 24' Bryant.  If I didn't need a boat for a family of 5 and some friends, I would NOT sell it, and put a little money into the interior and stereo in a few years. 

It will be at milford lake for another 2 weeks if you'd like to drive it.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask."

If you've never heard of these, check out Hickock45's review on YouTube. This 1911 has been an absolute blast to shoot. Its mil-spec, so great for a build gun. It eats any ammo you feed it flat nose or round nose. These are in the same bracket as RIA, and I've never had a problem in some 200+ rounds. Comes with one 8+1 mag (any 1911 mags fit this weapon) a really nice leather DeSantis holster, and 30 rounds or so of fmj. Nice crisp trigger pull with no slack at all. They sell for 400+tax, and this firearm is well worth every penny of that. Really wanting to trade because I can't afford to buy .45 ammo anymore for fun lol! Will like to see ID for age purposes, not recording any info. Shoot me an offer, worst I can do is respectfully decline!!

The rifle is in excellent condition. I shot this rifle very little, but when I did shoot for groups, it was quite accurate, putting down 1.5""-2"" groups consistently at 100 yards. If you are looking at this, it's likely that you are aware of the sanctions. That would also explain my asking price. I just searched GunBroker, and a bunch of other popular sites and could not find any of these for sale. These rifles are not very common. In fact, what I did find were a bunch of standard SGL31-68s with fixed stocks going for $1,500. This rifle has the AK100 series folding stock and that is why my price is higher. While not technically banned, these rifles are cut off from importation and there is no end in sight. For those reasons, my asking price is firm.

The rifle will ship out to you exactly as pictured. In lieu of the notched civilian stock is a more desirable, unissued Russian military non-notched stock. The rear trunnion pin for the folding stock is 5.5mm. This rifle is about as straight as an AK can get. It's pretty much perfect. The handguard retainer was modded (hardly noticeable and affects function in no way) and a new retainer will be included just in case you want to swap it out. The original Arsenal grip will be included. This is an awesome AK and the only reason I am selling it is to fund another purchase. This rifle is about as close as the average person will ever get to owning a real AK74."
