Its metal has been refinished nicely and its wood is in great shape. Luckily the markings on the metal are all intact. This is a nice, rare WWII rifle to add to the collection. Some basics from Wikipedia: “The M1941 Johnson Rifle was an American short-recoil operated semi-automatic rifle designed by Melvin Johnson prior to World War II. The M1941 competed unsuccessfully with the U.S. M1 Rifle…The M1941 rifle used the energy from recoil to operate the rifle. As the bullet and propellant gases moved down the barrel, they imparted a force on the bolt head that was locked to the barrel. The barrel, together with the bolt, moved a short distance rearward until the bullet left the barrel and pressure in the bore had dropped to safe levels. The barrel then stopped against a shoulder allowing the bolt carrier to continue rearward under the momentum imparted by the initial recoil stage. The rotating bolt, which had eight locking lugs, would then lock the bolt. Following, a cam arrangement then rotated and unlocked the bolt to continue the operating cycle. One disadvantage of this design was its impact on the use of a bayonet, as the complex movements of the barrel would be subject to unacceptable stress when a bayonet thrust was used. The Johnson rifle utilized a unique 10-round rotary magazine and a two-piece stock, the weapon using the same 5 round stripper clips used by the M1903 Rifle. This system had some advantages over the M1 Rifle, including less perceived recoil and greater magazine capacity. Unfortunately, the Johnson's recoiling barrel mechanism resulted in excessive vertical shot dispersion that was never fully cured during its production life, and was prone to malfunction when a bayonet was attached to the reciprocating barrel.

There is 1 minor thing wrong with it that i want you to know. One of the zipper eyelets that the red cord loops through broke off. It in no way affects the function of the zipper. (see pic) The zippers on the “handgun” compartment have padlock loops on them. They are too small. I added some steel cable loops in order to use a bigger padlock. They can be removed pretty easily if you don’t want them.(see pic) It has a built in rain cover that is not mentioned in the amazon description. This is is too big to ship economically so local pick up or I can meet you half way within 50 miles of Attleboro.

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected. The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors. By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 and HK45C can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required. Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45C is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system, providing an enhanced double action trigger pull. Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

The C-A1 is somewhat of a hybrid, combining the compact length of the Steyr S-A1 pistol with the full-size grip of the Steyr M-A1 pistol. The barrel of the C-A1 is 3.6” (91mm) long and provides a platform that is ideal for self-defense carry by offering a short overall weapon length while ensuring optimal grip control. An integrated Picatinny rail allows for simple mounting of a laser or light and slide-racking grooves on the back of the slide allow for a firm grip when manually operating the action."

I enjoyed this as a handy medium range deer rifle. The local deer enjoyed it much less. But I have nowhere to hunt this year so I am selling to make room in the safe for something else. You might find it useful for home defense or informal target shooting and plinking. .357 magnum frim a rifle has alomst as much energy as a 30-30 or 7.62x39  Also, it is convenient to have a rifle that takes the same ammo as your revolvers.  I have fired about 100 rounds.  It feeds and extracts .357 and .38 special without complaint.  There are some scratches on the stock, but otherwise it is in excellent condition.  I am a former Marine and I maintain my guns as if my life depends on it.  Two 5 round magazines included. Ruger factory 30mm and 1” scope rings are included. 
 
Also in the photos is a Weaver Classic Extreme 1.5-4.5x24.  It has a german #4 reticle with an illuminated dot in the center.  Perfect for low light hunting or tactical use.  I’d rather keep the scope, but it suits the rifle so for an additional $250 I will leave it mounted. 
 
I am located in downtown Winston-Salem.  I will drive up to half an hour to meet a buyer with cash.  As I understand the law, I am required to see identification proving that you are a NC resident over the age of 18."

This is the nice bottom spigot design, no messing with Ladels of molten metal.Lee .365 truncated cone 6 cavity bullet mold, seasoned and casts great and fastLee 00 Buckshot 6 Cavity moldLee Bullet mold handlesLee 9mm 4 piece carbide die set (the better version that wont jam, break, or require lubing the casings).Lee .365 bullet sizing/gas-check-crimping die (all in 1 action, gaurenteed sized correct).Frankford Arsenal Media TumblerFrankford Arsenal digital calipersFrankford Arsenal digital scale (as well as Lee Balance beam scale)Custom table strengthened for reloading. Metal table with metal legs and sheet of plywood bolted to metal top for added support.Extras:4 bottles (1 lb each) of smokeless powder, only 1 bottle was used from and still has more than half. Common powders too.2-400 CCI primers, new in package (left from what I didnt use)Lyman reloading bible Lee reloading biblePlenty of empty ammo boxes as well as casing holdersSmall tools, such as case trimmer die, cutter and lock stud
ALSO included will be well over 15 lbs of already cleaned lead. Most has already been cast into ingots. I also have a lot of casings that will be included. Most already cleaned, some already primed. There will also be other freebies that I am not remembering at this time such as, tube of bullet lube (goes a long way), package of over 500 gas checks for .365 bullets, and I am sure more.
 
I am mainly looking for cash.The few things that interest me as far as trading would be, AR15/AR10, hunting rifle (depending), running vehicle, dirtbike, atv, 35 inch tires, jeep wrangler JK parts.
 
I am going to put a cash value of $650 on the package deal or $750 trade.
That is a very fair yet firm price. Contact with serious questions [or to buy], and YES I STILL HAVE IT!"

Preferably the red fiber optic illuminator but I would consider the green one as well(I've never looked down a green one so I'm not actually set on if I like it or not). And I want a genuine ACOG, not some Chinese clone. Now as far as the AK, it's a yugo underfolder with a 1.5 mm receiver(most AK's only use a 1mm receiver I believe). Yugo's are set up to be able to fire rifle grenades and had a built in flip up grenade sight. It originally had a black plastic hand guard, that I was able to replace with a wood hand guard that was listed as being used in the ""Balkan wars"". Dunno how true it is, don't particularly care, but the wood already had a grove knocked where the underfolder stock met the wood(which I thought was cool and lucky, because that meant it came off an underfolder, and the previous owner had scorched the knock to harden the spot and prevent any damage to the stock. It comes with 16 misc 30 round mags(14 are currently loaded) a drum magazine(empty) and 2 ammo cans pretty full of ammo(I do not have a full count but there's got to be close to 600-800 rounds of steel case in one can pause a smaller can that has 400-500 Russian milsurp ammo and the 420 rounds loaded in mags).i am located in Vancouver WA, can travel a reasonable distance to meet, and this will require an ffl transfer. if you got what I want, I will pay the transfer fee"

Never fired!      Product Description Discontinued 2015, replaced with SKU 91361. The first civilian-legal form of our 805 Bren is the S1 Pistol, equipped with an 11″ barrel in .223/5.56. Utilizing the ubiquitous STANAG magazine used in the AR-15/M16, the 805’s action is housed in a one-piece aluminum upper receiver with a monolithic Picatinny rail. At the rear of the action is a multipurpose mounting point, fit from the factory with a single-point sling attachment. The addition of our accessory arm brace adapter coupled with the effective factory-equipped two-port brake makes the Bren impressively stable to shoot in pistol form. It shares the same low-profile sights as our Scorpion — an adjustable aperture rear and post front. The CZ 805 Bren S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ 805 Bren S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.            SPECIFICATIONS   CZ 805 Bren S1 Pistol        Product Name  CZ 805 Bren S1 Pistol  SKU  91360  Firearm Type  Handgun  Purpose  Home Defense  Chambering  .223/5.56  Magazine Capacity  30  Magazine Type  AR-15/M16  Frame  Aluminum  Grips  Polymer  Sights  Low-profile, adjustable, 4 rear aperture sizes  Barrel  Cold hammer forged, muzzle threaded 14x1 left-hand  Barrel Length  11 in  Weight  6.7 lbs  Overall Length  22.75 in  Safety  Ambidextrous thumb       Stop by the shop and check it out!"

Let me start by saying this is a factory finish  from remington and looks great in person. It is semi matte green with zombies, nuclear signs, and writing. The R1 is a shooter and i have no problem holding tight groups at 25 yards with it, also has eaten everything ive fed it and only had one jam its entire life. The sights have been painted orange and really stand out. The gun has been shot a fair amount of times but never abused. I have always kept this firearm  clean and oiled. The pistol does show some holster wear and tiny scrathes, but nothing major or anything  that takes from the looks. I am the original owner of the pistol. Only looking to trade at the moment unless a good cash offer comes through. I will include one magazine and a nice n8 tactical IWB holster. No original box. Can also get a bunch of pics on request please offer up.I ALSO HAVE A 22LR 1911 THAT I COULD INCLUDE FOR THE RIGHT TRADE. NOW YOU CAN HAVE ANOTHER 1911 FOR PRACTICE=)"
