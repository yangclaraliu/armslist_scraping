The fixed sight PT92 9mm pistol is based on the most extensively tested, duty proven, and widely used double action autoloading design in history. It has been refined and enhanced by Taurus to surpass the original. Most notable on the Taurus PT92 is the innovation of a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety which allows this gun to be carried in classic double action(cocked and locked) mode, as well as functioning as a double action decocking lever. Other features include choice of blued or stainless finishes, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and the Taurus security system."

If you are familiar with the IPSC or USPSA community and equipment then you know SV Inc. guns are among the, if not the, best hand built 2011 you can buy.

Pistol is a custom SV built Infinity, polymer framed 2011 in .40S&W. I am not the original owner and cannot give an accurate round count but it was well taken care of. The barrel shows little wear and has great rifling. Magazine capacity depends on what kind of mags you buy, 124mm, 140mm, what kind of followers, and base pads. Average capacity is 18-21 rounds.

Upgrades include a STI aluminum magwell (not pictured)
AFTEC hand fitted extractor that literally, runs anything you put in the gun.
Extened magazine release
Will include an extra fitted and tested extractor (standard design, not AFTEC)

It's a accurate and smooth running pistol, but Limited division is just not my thing. Looking to keep FTF for now, will advise if I decide to ship. Price is $2,200 for gun only.  If you are interested in mags as well let me know and we can work something out.  I'll be in Ohio Labor Day weekend and I occasionally am there during leave(military).

Once they are locked on, they don't move at all. But they can be easily removed for cleaning, unlike any other free float design. They are also skinnier width wise than any other rail so they don't feel bulky like most free float tubes. These are for a rifle length AR-15 and use the Delta ring to attach, however you can attach them to any lenght gas system with a low profile gas block. Below are pictures of an example of both ways, and a picture of the rails. Any questions please email me. Also go on daniel defense's website and look up omega 12.0 rails if you thing 250 dollars is to high."

 The AK has had the barrel threaded and a slant brake installed and a new gas block with bayonet lug.
Has original reddish stock set as well as a re-finished Bulgarian stock set, 2 steel 30rd mags.
This IS NOT a wasr10 and no sight cant. Functions perfectly and shoots great.Fired slightly less than 350 rounds.
 The SKS comes with original box,sling and cleaning kit. Has fired exactly 11 rounds and shoots and functions perfectly.

I am wanting to trade both for an AR15. I would prefer a DPMS with the bull barrel and lower without dustcover and brass deflector(the bargin bin rifles that CMMG had a couple years ago would be perfect!) but I will trade for any equal value AR15.
I am not looking for a high end AR,just a bargain bin or lower price rifle.
I am not looking to trade for anything but an AR 15.

I also got a complete spring kit for it. The gun had a weak firing pin spring, so i got the whole firing pin spring and recoil spring kit. The recoil springs are 14, 16.5, and 18 lbs so the recoil can be adjusted to your liking. The complete spring kit consists of 3 firing pin springs (one is installed), and the 3 recoil springs. This is a great concealed carry weapon. it shoots great and is very accurate. This thing just fits the hand like a glove. It does show some holster wear, but for being made around 1986, its not bad at all. I would love to trade it for a Walther P22, or a nice .22 target pistol, but im open to all trades. if you have somehting you think i might trade for, just email me with what you have to trade, the worst i can do is say no. I will also take $300 obo, but would prefer to trade for a walther p22 (or other target pistol). Im also open to trading for AR-15 parts, but the trade should equal what im asking for the gun.
This pistol qualifies as a C&R weapon, so if you have a C&R license i will need a copy of it, and you'll get a copy of mine.

Looking at some websites it looks like the manufacturing date is 1926 according to serial numbers (receiver and barrel) (serial # 461,XXX)

I've owned this gun for 20+yrs., I had some interested and some questions came up as to the modification of the chamber from a 2-9/16"" to a 2-3/4"". I detail stripped the gun to clean it and I measured the chamber, apparently it has been modified for the modern standard of 2-3/4"" shells. 
I realize for the collector this lessens the value as it's not 100% original, so I'm coming off my original price and I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to give it away so serious offers only please.

I'd prefer trades but for the right cash price I'd sell outright.

This Glock 30 short frame comes with night sights for locking on your target fast in low light. The short frame is designed to let you get more of your finger on the trigger, which is helpful for those with smaller hands. Chambered in .45 ACP, the model PF3050701 comes with two 10 round magazines, making it legal for sale in states that prohibit ""high capacity"" magazines. The California-approved short frame models like this one do not have ambidextrous safeties as do the non-CA approved slim frame models.

I have found a deal on another gun that I can't pass up, and I'm a bit short on cash. So the PX4 is up for sale. $450 OBO

I bought this gun as my glove box gun, and shot it very little. It has had between 200-300 problem free rounds through it.

This one comes with an extra mag ($40 value), for a total of three mags, interchangeable backstraps, magloader, box, manual, and I'm throwing in 120 rounds FMJ and a box of Hornady TAP JHP's ($50 value). I'm definitely taking a loss on this one, but I really need a new deer gun for this coming season.

It has the 16.5 inch barrel and collapsible stock. It comes with the removable carry handle, but mounted on it now is a Millet DMS scope (1-4 X adjustable power) on an American Defense Recon mount. Mounted to the front handguard is a Harris bipod (6-9 inch adjustable height). Jeff Cockrum from Rogersville did a trigger job on this gun less than a year ago. He installed a JP enterprises trigger and adjusted it to just over 3 pounds. It is a really sweet trigger. He also installed anti-walk trigger and hammer pins in it. I'll include with the rifle the hard plastic carry case, one stag arms 30 round aluminum magazine and 2 magpul polymer 30 round magazines, and the owner's manual. Its a great rifle, I've shot probably 500 rounds of factory federal ammo through it. Asking $1,200 obo, not interested in trades.

For sale is this AWESOME looking SIG556 SWAT PATROL RIFLE manufactured by SIG SAUER. This rifle is brand new and unfired. The SIG SAUER item number (SKU) for this rifle is SIG556-16B-PS-RD. This is the next generation in the evolution of the SIG556 platform, the SIG556 SWAT Patrol Rifle integrates the accuracy of a 16"" Military grade barrel that ensures accuracy and durability with the maneuverability and quick pointing ergonomics of the SIG556 Short in a compact, no nonsense package. The reduced length GAS PISTON operating rod system and forearms provide the ideal combination of functionality and light weight. The piston system reduces the fouling of the bolt and the associated moving parts. The gas tube vents gas through the numerous ports before the piston drives the rotating bolt. This venting is what reduces dirt, and ultimately reduces cleaning time. Should the system get dirty, the two-position adjustable gas piston of the SIG556 ensures that it will run in the worst of conditions. The SIG556 SWAT Patrol Rifle is the perfect solution for everything from three gun matches to patrol car deployment.

The 2488mkII is the follow-up to the best-selling, simple-to-use 24-track recording and mixing workstation for home studios. Like its predecessor, eight inputs can be simultaneously recorded into the XLR and 1/4"" inputs - enough for a whole band. 19 physical faders control mono and stereo channels without scrolling through pages for quick and easy mixing. Each channel has 3-band EQ with a parametric mid-band and access to three built-in effects processors, including reverb and multieffects. 

After the final mix is recorded to the dedicated stereo mater recorder, the built-in CD-RW drive can burn a CD master in addition to backing up the hard drive and importing and exporting WAV files. New features from the 2488 include a larger hard drive, an all-new LCD display, new guitar effects and improved CD mastering capabilities.

The New Innovations of the Springfield XD(M)

The Standards - In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its' customers, the firearm's industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features.  With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that..Loaded Chamber Indicator....Striker Status Indicator....Grip Safety....USA Trigger Safety....The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USAT) Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, reward pressure is applied.

So What's New??

Personalization - Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. The XD(M) gives you more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case....(M)ould-Tru Backstraps......(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System......(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case......With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.  A triple-position Picatinney rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position.  Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.

Innovations - The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M).  From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be....(M)aximum Reach Magazine Release......(M)inimal Error Disassembly......(M)ega Capacity Magazine......The modified contour of the new XD(M) grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.  Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during assembly, we've made the process easier and faster.

Technology - Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M) to a whole new level in precision.  With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches specification and precision engineering like Springfield Armory®....(M)elonite®......(M)atch Grade Barrel......(M)inimal Reset Trigger......Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance.  The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.  Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.  The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Design - Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) FactorT, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level....(M)odel Contour Frame.......(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations......(M)ega-Lock Texture......The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.  Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.  The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function.  The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

It's not quite as easy to come across.  
I am not in trouble or a hurry to sell it.
I did reduce it a little this AM to see if that was my issue, this is a freaking unreal firearm with tons of goodies. No other gun comes with mounts for Red Dot sights built in to the slide, WITH A BOLT ON COVER, their site has great info, if you need more photos just ask.

DA/SA/ you can carry down or Condition one (cocked and locked) It's a mean SOB

Or sights tall enough to use the threaded barrel with, Cans require tall sights.

The only gun FN makes now that comes with Night sights in .45 period.

Mags - 3   15 Round Magazines *The reason I bought it, no one else has that capacity with this quality.
The photos show the factory oil, the gun is beautiful for a rugged bastid.

 THE GUN IN BAG WITH EVERYTHING THAT CAME FROM THE FACTORY, new, fired only at the Factory, no holster time, no wear, nothing but sitting in the safe. I have not even taken it down yet, still in factory oil

Big bumpers on the 3 15 round mags, MADE to be used and dropped, they are tested to take the punishment.





If you are local and can do it soon I will offer a discount by email only. Cash only. don't ask unless you can do cash only

You need to make sure you can own it
you need an FFL, I am not into playing around. You will be legal and the deal will be. 

Shipping is on you, $40 will ship it to your FFL only.
FTF in NC will need a ccw and ID or a Paper permit and ID"
