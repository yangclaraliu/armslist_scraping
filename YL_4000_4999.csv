High capacity drum mag for ak-47. Opens from back and you put in the rounds. No top load where it kills your thumb. When you open it and put in the rounds then you close it and wind up the spring and you are ready to go. Nice thing about these is the fact that you can fully load it and not tighten the spring for long term storage so you can have it in your ""go bag"" ready to rock and roll and when you are ready to fire or need it just wind it up and shoot away. This way it will not wear out. This will be banned so get it while you can"

This one has a brand new, never-been-fired Criterion barrel and a new walnut stock.  The overall finish is a combination of original and new finish, which is done to balance out the overall appearance of the rifle.  This is not a collector piece (other then the cool S/N and manufacture date), it is meant to be a shooter.  I shoot in matches, and this was intended to be my next match rifle.

Price.  A plain-jane Garand will set you back about $700-1000, depending on a lot of things.  One thing this rifle has going for it is the fact that it's built on a WWII receiver, from 1942.  The reason it is not being sold as a collector is because the rest of the parts are not original to the rifle, and have been selected for fit since its' purpose was to be a match rifle.

I am in a position where I am primarily interested in silver or gold, and potential trades.  Trades could include, but are not limited to:  Ammo, rifles, rifle parts, reloading tools and (sealed) components, and metalworking equipment.  I shoot in a .22 pistol league, and could see me trading straight-up for the right high-end target pistol.  The price in silver is 42 ounces, payable in American Eagles."

The job appears to have been done quite some time ago, as the stock seems rather 'old school'.  The finish is very nice-looking, it's been reblued at some time.  Peep sights, sling swivels and a sling, and probably the smoothest bolt action ever made - this one is ready to go hunting.  I have some extras for this one.  I have a bunch of 30-40 brass and reloading dies that go with it - as well as a nice new walnut stock.  The new stock needs to be inletted.

Altogether, this represents a good solid $400+ worth of gear, easy.  The stock alone cost me $150, the dies $27.50 and the brass $25/100.  I am looking for trades mainly.  Long guns, pistols - let's talk.  In silver, the price is 15 ounces, payable in American Eagles.  If you were to buy silver today, that's a price of only $300.  Federal reserve notes pay 10% more."

This is a Winchester 98 Angle Eject, sold as the ""Ranger"" model.  It is a later production rifle that has seen fairly light use, but is not really a collector.  A good hunting rifle that's light, in a caliber that takes deer easily.  I have a hand reloading kit for this one, good for throwing in a pack and being self-sufficient for a while, as well as quite a bit of brass and some factory ammo.  Since the receiver was tapped for scope mounts, it also has a Leupold one-piece scope mount and a Bushnell scope on it that fits the rifle very well.

The bummer - the guy I bought it from tried to mount a peep sight on the left hand side of the receiver.  There is a hole there, but it does not in any way affect action or safety.  As a result, the price for this one is quite attractive.  Trades are always entertained.  The price in silver is 12 ounces, payable in American Eagles.  If you were to buy silver today, that would be $240.  Federal reserve notes pay 10% higher."

What you see is the actual rifle. This rifle is INVESTMENT GRADE and will NEVER decrease in value. You can reliably shoot tens of thousands of rounds through it, and not hurt the value. It IS 922 compliant with a US made trigger group, gas piston, and muzzle nut. The receiver was actually rebuilt IN the U.S.A. so although it's the original stubs, it is considered U.S. built. I'm only selling this rifle to fund another project, so I'm NOT looking for trades. This rifle has been converted to semi-auto so it's legal to own by anyone that can pass a NICS check, which IS required to own this piece of cold war history.
 The rifle comes with a NOS (new old stock) correct dated leather sling (shown), and a ARSONAL MATCHING 30 round magazine. Nothing else pictured, comes with the rifle. Shown by appointment only, please no tire kickers. Asking price is $2500.00"

The pistol was sent to Ron Mahovsky and the Metalife hard chrome finish was applied over the blackened stainless steel. The Metalife finish, otherwise known as SS Chromium M. Metalife looks like stainless steel, but has a hardness of about 71 on the Rockwell Scale, which is even harder than stainless steel. It is guaranteed not to chip, crack or peel when applied to metal in good condition, and it is highly rust resistant and holster-wear resistant. The Metalife process cost over $155.00 not including shipping. If you scratch this pistol, you can use a little water on a rag and MAKE THE SCRATCH GO AWAY. It's AWESOME!

What you see is the actual rifle. This rifle is INVESTMENT GRADE and will NEVER decrease in value. You can reliably shoot tens of thousands of rounds through it, and not hurt the value. It IS 922 compliant with a US made trigger group, gas piston, and muzzle nut. The receiver was actually rebuilt IN the U.S.A. so although it's the original stubs, it is considered U.S. built. I'm only selling this rifle to fund another project, so I'm NOT looking for trades. This rifle has been converted to semi-auto so it's legal to own by anyone that can pass a NICS check, which IS required to own this piece of cold war history.
 The rifle comes with a NOS (new old stock) correct dated leather sling (shown), and a  Ishmash Arsonal MATCHING 30 round magazine. Nothing else pictured, comes with the rifle. Shown by appointment only, please no tire kickers. Asking price is $2300.00"
