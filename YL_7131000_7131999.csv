You are buying a like new gun, absolutely flawless and I took it to the range only once and it ran like a champ, I didn't even plan on buying it but I walked into Scheels and saw it, when I felt the trigger I was sold, amazing trigger and everything else is awesome too, I couldn't say no but now I'm in a mess! Next time I will have to plan more carefully :) asking $450.00 firm. Obviously it will come just as it does New with the original box, paperwork, 2 mags, cleaning brushes, back straps, ETC.."

The rifle is in great shape, with the usual minimal flaking from the shellac on the stock. The rifle is stamped matching (including prefixes, which is somewhat uncommon) and ready to be your new favorite range toy, or a way to get into military surplus collecting.
 
The bore is great with strong shine and crisp lands and grooves. The import mark is small, unobtrusive and located on the barrel. This one is about as nice as the standard 91/30s come, and at this price I'll throw in 30 rounds of 7.62x54r to get you started."

It can do everything from plink, pick off a white tail, all the way op to knocking down Cape Buffalo. Plinking?? Absolutely! Loaded with 270 gr bullets you can plink all day long. With medium pills you can easily take white tails. If you want to hunt big north american bears, or go to africa, then load it up with 300 gr slugs and fill your boots. Or just about anything in between. The best thing about the vernerable hundred year old 375 Holland and Holland round is that the point of impact barely changes at all no matter what you feed it. This gun came from my father in laws home in central Maine where he used to hunt bear, dear and varmints. Being stainless, the bitter cold and snow of Maine had very little effect on it. This is no ""safe queen"" Weatherby. The synthetic stock shows it has been used hard. It will come with a front sight and rear aperature sight included. Mounted on it now is a brand new (just mounted it) Vortex Viper  HS-LR 4-16x50. $900 for gun only, $1200 if you want the Vortex with it. It also has a muzzle brake and that makes it a pussycat on recoil. Timney trigger has crisp, clean break."

Perfect factory solution to get almost any red dot on your Glock 17. Can mount Trijicon RMR, Vortex, Burris, Leupold, Eotech, Insight, Docter, Meopta, and C-More red dots. Bought this then decided to go another direction before even shooting it once. Comes with case, and 3 brand new magazines all in packaging. A Magpul 21 rounder, and two ETS clear mags, one for 22 rounds and one 17 round flush fit. 
 
Glock engineers have developed the Glock Modular Optic System (MOS) to simplify mounting of popular optics without costly custom machining of the pistol's slide. The MOS is offered with cover plate when no optic is mounted and four plates options to comply with the specifications of some of the most trusted optic manufacturers in the industry. MOS gives you the option of adding tall iron sights allowing the optic and the iron sights to co-witness.

(Simple barrel and spring swap)the magizine holds 18+1 rds of either caliber. And with an extended base pad it would hold aprox rds. It uses para ordinance 38 /9mm super mags as well as its own. It's like having a hand held ar-15. Armscor also makes a bolt action rifle that use the pistols mag for 22TCM. So it becomes a 18+ rd bull barrel target rifle. The 22 TCM round does aprox 1600 to 1800+ fps out of the pistol and in the rifle goes aprox 2600 to 2800+ fps.
