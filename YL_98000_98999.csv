I prefer a gun with an exposed hammer, but will consider something with a striker type firing pin.  The pistols I've owned in the past have all been exposed hammer types, and I'm just more comfortable being able to visually see if it's cocked.  I know this is mostly a psychological thing, so it's possible, I could be talked out of this.  The gun must be in good operating condition, but does not have to be cosmetically perfect.  Since it's for home defense, a small, concealed carry model is not necessary, but I would consider one.  I have a pistol permit, and do not wish to travel far outside the Triangle area.  Please email if interested, and with your phone number would be best.

This is a nice Yugo 59/66 SKS that shoots very well. The bore is dark as most of these are but the rifling is good and it shoots accurately. At least as accurate as my skills allow .  I am not a collector nor an expert so I am hesitant to state a grade of the condition. I have posted a few images but I have more images of higher resolution here ""http://www.flickr.com/photos/16292170@N00/REDACTED/"" or I can email images to interested parties. Included with the rifle are the ammo pouches shown and 1050 rounds of ammo. 960 rounds of wolf 124 GR HP military classic and 90 rounds of wolf black box 122 GR FMJ , 80 rounds being on stripper clips. Ammo can is not included in the sale. I have no other gun in 7.62x39 caliber so I want to sell the gun and ammo together rather than separate. For $500 this would make a nice combo to stash away. I live in northern Ashland County Ohio and could meet off of I-71 in Ashland and I also work close to the I-90 Detroit road exit for those in the Cleveland area. Reason for selling is because I have other firearms and I would like to replenish the funds recently spent on a Ruger Mark III.  I can be contacted at dmsprague at gmail dot com"

The antlers were collected near Flagstaff, Arizona, during the 1990's, and were professionally cleaned, coated, and assembled by a local artisan.  The tops are of 1/4"" tempered glass with beveled edges, and measure approximately 64"" by 40"", and 30"" by 30"", respectively; there are no scratches or chips on either of the tops, nor on the antlers themselves, and they are in excellent condition.  The glass surface of the larger table sits approximately 16.5"" above the floor; the smaller table approximately 19.5"".  These are beautiful pieces, and would make a fine addition to any living space.  We no longer need these, and they have been in climate controlled storage for several years instead of being appreciated as they should be.

The serial number, 64***, places its date of manufacture between 1889 and 1900, and it is a numbers-matching piece.  It was evaluated by Tucson Guns and Western Artifacts last year, who found that “the shotgun is in excellent mechanical condition but the barrels are corroded”; however, the lockwork is very tight.  The furniture is in good condition with scratches one would expect from 110+ year old piece, and the checkering is original and has not been re-cut.  The buttplate is the original hard rubber with the Remington Arms logo and all fasteners are original.  I would not consider firing this weapon without a thorough functional evaluation by a professional gunsmith, but it might make a good single action shooting piece.  $750.00."

I have the following RCBS Carbide dies

These dies are virtually brand new and have been used to reload less than 100 rounds each.  These dies are flawless and still have the original sticker from Graf's that shows they were 34.95 for the 9mm luger and $39.95 for the 40 S&W when brand new.  I am asking $30/each obo for these dies.  

If someone is interested in all of these dies together I would sell them all for $65.  I would also consider trading either of the RCBS die sets for either 40 S&W or 45 ACP Lee reloading dies with the powder through expanding die.  The reason I'm selling the RCBS is that I can't use them with my auto powder dispenser on my Lee progressive press.  Any trade would have to be for dies in new/virtually new condition as that is the condition of the RCBS dies I have listed here.

 I'm going a different way with my AR set up.

this is an excellent alternative to eotech reflex sites.
needs no batteries. perfect for law enforcement or CQB.
MSRP is over $600
i have the box and all paper work

heres the factory info:

The MEPRO 21 provides instant, all-light aiming capability, without batteries. Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the MEPRO M21 is battle proven, simple to use accurately and totally reliable.

MEPRO 21 offers a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open. This was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat, and it can be ordered with optional reticles – dot, triangle, open-x and bullseye.

Illumination of the aiming point is achieved by a fiber optic collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area.

The MEPRO 21 reflex sight offers users the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open.

Warning: I WILL check the street value of your firearm, I will not pay outrageous amounts of cash for anything I can find for cheaper just so you can turn a profit, I have been a gun collector for almost 5 years and I will have multiple questions about your firearm, so DO NOT attempt to scam me, do not be dishonest and don't contact me if you are not completely and absolutely serious about parting with your gun, you'll only succeed in wasting our time.

And if anyone knows of where I can get a civilian legal L85A2 or A1 or a parts kit that includes the receiver and lower (basically the body kit), whether it is stripped or has internals or not, or if you can direct me to someone who could create the receiver/body kit please let me know, I will pay almost ANY number in cash for one as I am originally from the UK and it would be wonderful to own the gun I held while I served in the forces.

You can buy them new for $100-$200 less than what people on here are wanting. And it really isn't hard to go through mail, I know an FFL in Columbus that will do transfers for $20 and shipping is usually around $25. And for those of you who think it's registered when you buy new, you are mistaken; just ask any FFL; it's only a sales receipt. And for those legally not permitted to own a firearm then your not welcome on this site or any other gun classified site anyway.

It has been tuned with a Cylinder & Slide target trigger set, which consists of new springs, a new sear to replace the cast one, and a chamfered no-bite ring hammer to eliminate slide bite and make cocking and decocking easier. The original parts will be included. This Hi-Power has also had its magazine disconnect removed by a previous owner, who managed to chip the finish next to the trigger pin on the right side of the frame in the process. This is the only notable wear on this gun - it was a range piece, not a carry piece, so any wear is just from general handling and is very minimal.



The gun comes with its stock 13 round magazine as well as two 15 round Mec-Gar magazines. It also comes with checkered cocobolo grips in addition to the factory stock hardened rubber grips.



Finally, I'm also including a .22LR conversion kit with 10-round magazine. This is a kit that I purchased brand new. I've fit it to the gun to test functions and fired exactly one round through it (a CCI Stinger) to ensure that it works, but it's new aside. This particular kit holds open on an empty magazine, which is a nice and relatively uncommon feature for .22 kits. It was made by MACS in Argentina.



In summary, everything that is included:
- Browning Hi-Power Mk III 9mm with C&S target trigger set
- Original parts that were replaced by C&S bits
- x3 9mm magazines: x1 13-rd, x2 15-rd Mec-Gar
- Checkered cocobolo grips
- New .22LR conversion with x1 10-rd magazine



I will consider partial trades for CZ-pattern handguns or a Beretta 92/M9 variant. A Beretta 92FS Inox would be ideal. Not interested in longarms unless you've got something truly special. Thanks!"

For Sale is a Smith & Wesson Walther PPK/S-1. I am the original owner, this gun has had very little actual use (fired about 300 times) although I did carry this firearm off and on over the last several years. There is some minor wear due to carry use but this is a very minor cosmetic issue if you want to consider it an issue at all. I purchased this firearm about 3 years ago and did send it to Smith & Wesson for the factory saftey upgrade. This will include the gun w/ 2 orginal mags (one w/ factory extended grip), the orgional box, all original documentation, packet w/ fired shell casings, saftey upgrade documentation, 3 holsters, 50 rnds Remington UMC, and a box of misc ammo (some Cor-Bon hollow points and some crappy range reload ammo I was going to throw way). This gun has never been fired w/ anything but factory ammo and has been 100% reliable. I carried Cor-Bon DPX in the gun for SD w/ no problems feeding/extracting. This is a very good quality, very reilable, and fun to shoot firearm that I've been debating over whether or not to sale. I really just need to thin out my collection and unfortunately this one is now up for sale. PM me if you want more info or pics. $500.00 firm or willing to consider a trade. FTF in the Manhattan/Topeka area but will consider to meet half way if needed; Bill of Sale required. If you can't walk into a gun shop and purchase a firearm don't bother contacting me.

The upper works flawlessly and cleanly. It has some handling marks, and has less than 600 rounds fired through it. I assembled it myself. The build specs are as follows:

Bravo Company M4 upper receiver
Chrome moly 16” barrel with standard front sight base, heavy profile
Magpul MOE handguard, buttstock, pistol grip, and vertical grip
DPMS lower receiver with DPMS hardware
Magpul MBUS rear sight
Magpul ASAP single point sling mount
Osprey Defense 416 gas piston conversion with bolt carrier
Les Baer bolt

With the piston setup, the rifle runs really clean (except for the barrel, of course). I modified the MOE handguard slightly so that I could use it with the gas piston kit, but I will be including the original Osprey Defense handguard (never used). I polished the trigger control group parts slightly, so the trigger is a little smoother. No magazine will be included because I do not have a Maryland-friendly one to sell. The rifle was cleaned and oiled after every visit to the range. It cost me close to $1200 build. I’m pricing it to sell at $925. Transfer must be completed through MSP.

EDIT: addendum to FT.

I would prefer to trade this handgun, as opposed to selling it.

If I were to sell it outright for $$, I MIGHT consider offers over $225

I am in no hurry to sell it, I just replaced the Recoil rod & put a new 8.5Lb trigger assembly on the Gun, and this baby shoots deadly true at the range.


Up for trade:

Kel-Tec P11, Excellent condition, comes with 2 10rd mags, each with Pinky extension & original flat plates. 

Purchased for CCW, but find it to be a bit too bulky for me, as I am a bit thick (fat) and do not like to wear a vest. 

I am interested in a 380, either a TCP, or LCP. 

I am also interested in the Taurus 709, am willing to throw some $$ in on my side to complete deal.

Will entertain other offers, so if you have something to trade, feel free to ask, the worst I can say is no ....

Charging handle
The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle offers two significant advantages.

1. Since the tiny roll pin is no longer the weak point - it is a much stronger system and tactical latch will stay intact even under repeated support side only manipulation.

2. With the force kept inside the body of the handle, when the handle is pulled directly to the rear, it moves directly to the rear and does not angle off to the outboard side. A much smoother operation."

heres the factory info:

The MEPRO 21 provides instant, all-light aiming capability, without batteries. Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the MEPRO M21 is battle proven, simple to use accurately and totally reliable.

MEPRO 21 offers a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open. This was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat, and it can be ordered with optional reticles – dot, triangle, open-x and bullseye.

Illumination of the aiming point is achieved by a fiber optic collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area.

The MEPRO 21 reflex sight offers users the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open."
