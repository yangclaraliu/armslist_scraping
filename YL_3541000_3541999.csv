Or are you trying to sell one of these guns? Well if so, PAY ATTENTION. None of those guns are worth more than $75 at the very most. And that is if it new in box and never been shot. Any of them that has been shot more than 100 times is worth $50 or less. Why? Simple, these guns break. They were crudely designed and cheaply built out of mostly pot metal. Usually, the only steel in the gun is the barrel and the springs. Any time you shoot one of them, it may be the last time it shoots. And if your lucky, the gun just stops working. If you are unlucky, it blows up in your hand. 

Look, I am not a rich man, and I understand needing to buy a gun while on a budget. But to buy one of the guns I listed above is not going to save you money in the long run. Shop around and find a used gun from a known manufacturer for the same money. When you can buy a new taurus .380 for under $180, paying good money for junk guns doesn't make sense."

For those who are unfamiliar with the 357 SIG round, it was designed to be the semi-auto equivalent of the famous 357 magnum revolver round.  It is a 9mm bullet in a necked-down 40 S&W casing, delivering super high velocities with little recoil and has more energy than a 45 ACP (energy = mass x velocity squared).

All fluids just changed this past weekend and the truck has a new Cat and muffler, and near new tires. Everything on the truck works as it should, there are no engine lights or anything mechanically wrong with the truck. We bought this truck for our daughter to have at College and she does not like it so we would like to trade or sell it for an economical car (Honda,Toyota, even a small SUV). The truck has bumps and bruises as you would expect for a 20 year old truck. The only thing it needs is seat belts (the clasp on the drivers side and the passenger side). The interior is ok, no rips or tears but a little worn and dirty. This would make a great truck for a student, a home improvement truck or for a small business. What you lack in power you gain in MPG (20 in town and 24-25 on the Hwy).

I just picked this up brand new last month from a local retail store here in bend and put 100 flawless rounds thru it but it's a little small for my taste. Kahr's owner's manual suggest a 200 round break-in period, so it's half-way there :)

Complete description of this firearm:
http://www.kahr.com/pistols/kahr-cm40.asp
MSRP: $460.00
Caliber: .40 S&W
Capacity: 5+1
Operation: Trigger cocking DAO; lock breech; ""Browning - type"" recoil lug; passive striker block; no magazine disconnect
Barrel: 3.1"", conventional rifling; 1 - 16 right-hand twist
Length O/A: 5.47""
Height: 4.0""
Slide Width: .94""
Weight: Pistol 15.8 ounces, Magazine 1.9 ounces
Grips: Textured polymer
Sights: Drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight, pinned in polymer front sight
Finish: Black polymer frame, matte stainless steel slide
Magazine: 1 - 5 rd flush floorplate

The CM Series, which debuted in spring 2011 with the CM9, takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel, 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM4043 has the same external dimensions as the PM4043, which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel.

The CM4043 is chambered in a .40 S&W caliber, has a 3.1"" barrel and an overall length of 5.47"", with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models include: the CM4043 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; and finally, the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses.

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today:
- The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds.
- Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design.
- Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols."

	This is a very nice AR-15. It has seen fewer than 100 rounds. It was built as a DMR type rifle for hunting (coyote), 3gun, and basically be an all-around gun. It was not built as a run it into the ground carbine and has not been treated as such. This gun has never seen a “mag dump” and has always been meticulously cleaned and after any outing whether shot or not. All the components on the rifle and accessories included have been very well thought out. I am asking $1200 for everything or $1000 for the rifle only (no sights, mags etc...). I am open to reasonable offers and will negotiate on prices and which accessories would be included for a given offer; I am not however parting out or trading the gun, cash only. The one and only exception to this would be for a 2004-2014 Honda TRX 450R ATV as this is the reason for selling the gun in the first place. I am going to sell this gun, but I am in no hurry to do it so please no low ball offers as they will not be considered. Buyer will have to be over 18 and be willing to show a valid government issued photo ID and sign a bill of sale, this will still be a private sale and no background check will be done I am not a dealer.

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. Barrel is 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, Over-sized tactical operating handle, Four position fore-grip. Premium muzzle brake, and extra butt pads, gives some length. with soft bag and 5 FAL mags. Shoots very well!!! well cared for, always clean. Includes new Aimpoint PRO reddot."

Every serial numbered part (that I can find) is matching EXCEPT FOR THE BOLT. The bolt SN is off by exactly 1000.

SN matching cruciform bayonet with excellent finish on it, too. It does not appear to have been refinished as many/most of them have. Finish appears to be the original blue/black (NOT the grey parkerized finish seen on most reworks) and is somewhat worn, but not pitted Smooth, solid stock with normal dings for an issued rifle. I think it is NOT import stamped, meaning it was in the US since before 1968 (I could not find an import stamp in the usual places). Bore is nice and shiny with maybe a bit of roughness in the grooves.

526,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3541526,For Trade:  Large dermestid beetle setup. Taxidermy skull cleaning ready to work,"Denton, Dallas, Texas",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, November 3, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm getting out of the dermestid business. I have one large colony left with proper enclosure for skull and bone cleaning. Don't be fooled by those auction sites that claim thousands of beetles in a small cheap container the reality of it is that there is no practical way to count these little guys. You can really only count their rate of consumption. They range from near microscopic to 1/2"". I do know that this colony is almost ready for whitetail and hog skulls. European mounts and skull cleaning is a big business. 

***update 10/17 this colony consumes 3.5 lbs of prepared flesh in approx 4hrs. This means it can clean a whitetail skull in approx 12 hrs or a hog in about 24****

Skull cleaning for whitetail runs $65 wholesale $90 retail; hogs run $125 wholesale $200 retail

Selling beetles alone will pay well. Just look at the beetles for sale and what they run. During hunting season the prices skyrocket. 

My last colony currently consumes 3lbs of cooked brisket in about 11hrs. That would mean they would clean a properly prepared whitetail skull in about a day.

You get a good sized colony, if I had to guess there's over 100,000 there, a converted chest freezer with built in vent fan plus whatever else I have left of the bedding and other supplies. 

I know I can double my money if I break up the colony. I don't have the time. I will keep feeding them and letting them multiply. My price will not go down over time. I have sold dermestid beetles for years and guaranty quality. 

I could be talked into cleaning skulls. I don't do skull whitening or sealing anymore but it's easy I will tell you how after I clean."

A little info on these products;
The Tactical Vest used by the US Army and US Marine Corps.  Exceeds the ballistic specifications for the soft Body Armor Interceptor IBAS / OTV (Outer Tactical Vest) 
Tested to stop 9mm FMJ from a sub-machine-gun at 1,400 fps with minimal backface deformation / blunt trauma impact.  (Technically can't be called a Level III-A vest as the mil-spec does not call for testing with .44 Magnum, but the 9mm test is identical to Level III-A) and very thoroughly tested for Fragmentation.

Mil Spec E-SAPI performance (with an Interceptor or Level III-A vest supporting).
E-SAPIs are made with the very expensive boron carbide material to meet the stringent weight limit in the mil spec. The E-SAPI test is very similar to the NIJ Level IV test, but just a little bit tougher. Mil-spec calls for the plate to stop one round of .30-06 AP(armor piercing), just like Level IV, but it must also stop a 'second round', 60% of the time (not 100% of the time - too much of a weight penalty).

This vest is in MINT CONDITION. Plates are in great condition but do look a little worn. Get at me with a serious offer. Cash only. $400 OBO
NO TRADES. If you just want the vest I'll take $200. I'm simply looking for cash. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have. Thanks for reading.

I have no plans to build more of these or do further modifications if these rifles, so get it while you can!

AR410 built from the last Safir parts kits available on high quality standard GWACS Armory Ultra Lightweight Composite AR lower. It will still accept a standard AR style upper so you can switch to .223, 300 Black or whatever AR caliber you prefer.

Great for shooting clays, home defense, and WOWing everyone at the range! 

Flat Dark Earth Tan (FDE) GWACS Armory one piece Multi Cal Ultra Lightweight Composite lower, built with standard military style sights, removable carry handle, and FDE Tan Magpul rifle length forearm.

Safir Arms flat top railed upper receiver, custom 410 gauge bolt, and smooth bore 410 gauge 18"" threaded barrel. It also includes three 10 round Lancer magazines that have been custom modified for the 410 shell. It has been ""tuned"" and checked out by a leading Gunsmith/Armorer and shoots great! The bolt will still accept the impossible to get Safir 410 magazine. I can make more modified Lancer magazines if you want them at $65 a piece.

Included is a manual and a list of the 410 shells that work best with this setup.

I'm asking $1800 or best offer, local sales prefer but with ship to FFL at your cost.

Handles and shoots like an AR-15, uses standard AR parts, way cooler than a Saiga, and is extremely unique and rare. The semi-auto operation is done through an ingenious hybrid gas piston ring blowback/recoil operated system, that is very reliable and keeps the chamber extremely clean. Only 50 rounds through the rifle for ""tuning"" and testing.

I bought four of these parts kits in a package from the importer and wanted to build them so others could enjoy them as much as I enjoy the two that I'm keeping.

Will trade for USC, SL8-6, ACR, Tavor 18"", SCAR 308, KZ-9mm, FNX-45, P227

I have had a lot of requests to do more conversions of rifles to use Lancer Magazines. Because of the costs of the custom parts and time involved I will not be doing any more of these conversions until this rifle has sold. 

If I did do more conversions you will need to send me your upper and a check for $850 for the labor and parts. The conversion includes 3 magazines, additional magazines are $65

It will still accept a standard AR style upper so you can switch to .223, 300 Black or whatever AR caliber you prefer.

Great for shooting clays, home defense, and WOWing everyone at the range! 

Rock River lower, built with standard military style sights, and Olive Drab Green (ODG) Magpul carbine length forearm, Magpul collapsible stock, Magpul trigger guard, and Magpul grip .

Safir Arms flat top railed upper receiver, custom 410 gauge bolt, and smooth bore 410 gauge 18"" threaded barrel. It also includes three 10 round Lancer magazines that have been custom modified for the 410 shell. It has been ""tuned"" and checked out by a leading Gunsmith/Armorer and shoots great! The bolt will still accept the impossible to get Safir 410 magazine. I can make more modified Lancer magazines if you want them at $65 a piece.

Included is a manual and a list of the 410 shells that work best with this setup.

I'm asking $1800 or best offer, local sales prefer but with ship to FFL at your cost.

Handles and shoots like an AR-15, uses standard AR parts, way cooler than a Saiga, and is extremely unique and rare. The semi-auto operation is done through an ingenious hybrid gas piston ring blowback/recoil operated system, that is very reliable and keeps the chamber extremely clean. Only 50 rounds through the rifle for ""tuning"" and testing.

I bought four of these parts kits in a package from the importer and wanted to build them so others could enjoy them as much as I enjoy the two that I'm keeping.

Will trade for USC, SL8-6, ACR, Tavor 18"", SCAR 308, KZ-9mm, FNX-45, P227

Are you looking to build an SBR?  Maybe you're purchasing your first suppressor?  A gun trust offers you a great deal of convenience when you own these items.

Hanna Law P.C. is a different kind of law firm, specializing in firearms trusts.  We do not operate on a normal business week schedule, but can accommodate your needs on your schedule.  We are available during the day and in the evening as well as weekends.

We understand that buying an NFA item can be a lengthy process, so we strive to offer great service with a short turnaround.

We offer two levels of trust:
Basic Gun Trust $225 - fast and easy, convenient for those who do not wish to speak at great lengths with the attorney.  If you e-mail your info and give us a call, everything can be handled in person very quickly.  Notary services provided at time of delivery.

Comprehensive Gun Trust $500 - Also fast, however, the attorney will meet with you and discuss all the provisions of the trust.  If you do not like specific provisions, need clarification on certain provisions, or would like to add or remove provisions, this is the level for you.  Generally it takes 1.5-2 hours of face time with the attorney to go over the entire document.  Notary services provided during meeting.  This is a good option for those who are unfamiliar with firearms trusts, and demand extensive clarification.  Some people are a bit nervous when starting their NFA item collection, and face-time with an informed attorney can put some of these concerns to rest.

For various reasons, you may wish to also put your Title I (regular) firearms into your trust as well.  We also offer this service.

We wish you the best on your journey into the land of SBR's, AOW's, SBS's, and suppressors.  They can be great home defense weapons, and sure are a whole lot of fun to shoot at the range.  We hope to hear from you soon.  Feel free to call at REDACTED.  Leave us a voicemail with your number and a good time to return your call, and we will get back to you promptly.  You can also e-mail us at REDACTED.

A rail has been added that attaches to the trigger guard for a light or laser. It comes off with two screws and the gun will be as it came from the factory. I have always heard that the Canadian made Paras were the best of the bunch. Para has had some trouble with the North Carolina made guns but the latest ones have been better. After shooting this gun here on our range I will say this gun runs very well and shoots great. The grip is long enough that I can get all of my fingers on the gun, the sights work well for me and I like the trigger. I have always preferred the four inch 1911's over the 3"" guns for reliability and control. This is the steel framed version of the P13 and weighs 35oz which makes it easy to shoot well even when something is trying to hurt you and you might not have the perfect grip. You can stuff 14 rounds of good .45acp hollow points in this thing and that's a real good thing during bad times. This pistol in a good holster would make a great companion. Condition is really nice with just a few light scratches and bore is bright and shiny. There is the gun and one factory 13 round mag, no box or paperwork.

Message me for pictures.


I have a Remington 700 AAC-SD Tactical barreled action that has seen roughly 100 rounds.  This rifle has been shot with a suppressor and as such I had Steve Baldwin cut the barrel back to 19.25"" and thread and crown. From the factory every AAC-SD that I have purchased has not had a crown and this along with concentric threads were the reasons for the job.  Factory trigger has been tuned to 54oz and has performed very well. This action wears a Brownells 20 MOA steel picatinny scope base. This rifle for the short time I have owned it has produced very nice groups.

This is for the Barreled action and 20 MOA rail only.

I am asking $650 for this very nice barreled action.  I am willing to ship to your ffl, but they must accept from an individual.  Willing to meet people near the Yukon area for in person inspections. 

You will not be disappointed in this setup. If you have questions or want to see more pictures, please PM me and we can text or talk over the phone.

I have a used Polytech Mak 90 for sale. It's a true Polytech, not a Norinco, and it has a 1.5mm reciever. It was one of those poor guns that had it's markings removed shortly after the ban, but it still retains its Factory 386 markings on the trunnion. Some yahoo who owned it prior to me took out the rear trunnion and then reinstalled it with screws rather than rivets, it works fine but it doesn't look very good. 

The good news is mechanically the gun is perfect, the BCG looks brand new despite the fact that the bluing on the gun has wear. The gun has one of the best actions of any AK I've ever seen, it's extremely slick, everything is perfectly aligned and it rivals some of the best AKs on the market. It's got some age and would be a fantastic shooter, but at heart it's a Polytech, which means quality. The gun is 922r compliant, it has a US PG nut, screw, PG, K-var US stock, G2 trigger, US gas tube and heat shield and will come with a tapco mag. I'll also throw in three chinese 30 round surplus mags and the original thumbhole stock if you so desire.

Let’s go back a few years and look at the decision to adopt the SIG 9mm pistol over the Beretta 92 for Navy use (in spite of Beretta getting the M9 contract). The SIG P226 is a high-capacity variant of the original SIG P220 9mm pistol. While military handguns, such as the Colt 1911, are sometimes adopted by civilians and the police, in this case, a purpose-designed police pistol became a military handgun. Without going into detail and opening a can of worms again, it seems that, in the original competition, the Navy chose the pistol with little consideration of ergonomics.

Needless to This has the fluted barrel, and all the other goodies and accuracy that you would expect from a Weatherby.  With it will come the box and all of the paperwork.
This gun typically sells for $1,450 new (MSRP is much higher).
I did notice the slightest beginning of surface rust in two places on the exterior of the barrel where I must have touched it and put it back in the safe for awhile without oiling.  That's been taken care of now.  Disappointing but you have to look in the right light to see it, there is no rust, and it does not effect the function of the rifle.  I've taken that into account already on the price.  Check the pictures to see the areas I am speaking to.
