Asking $700 each. Makes a great his/hers or father/son combo.  Sorry for the crappy cell phone pics but its all I have to use right now. I live in Wellington but work in Wichita, so can meet either place or anywhere in between."

I do not have any pics up at the moment, but will post them later. Has small handling marks, but glass is great as is the fiber optic rod. Has 5.5 power, with fiber optic collimation and tritium which creates a bright red chevron aiming point. Reticule is specifically calibrated for the trajectory of a 5.56. Look up these scopes online, they have possibly the best glass of all the ACOG's, and go for far more than asking price (even used in the same condition). Fairly firm on the asking price, and will entertain trades of the same value.

The second picture shows exterior flaws as best I could by manipulating the lighting. Under normal conditions it appears as it does in the other pics, I would just rather overstate any of the items flaws than understate them so we can deal with confidence. Also, I am aware that it the base says 3.5, however it is a TA55. From what I understand, Trijicon uses 3.5 (TA11) bases for these optics, as everyone else I know whom owns a TA55 has the same markings on the side. I have also called Trijicon to verify this, so no worries.

It comes with 4 magazines, two from EAA and two from kimber. It also has an assortment of springs to tune it to your gun and the 22LR ammo you use. It is used and does have a few marks on it. I had the best luck with cci minimags and the EAA magazines, but really never messed with this nearly as much as I thought, which is why I'm selling. I got it for some cheap shooting and to let my son get used to the 1911, but I never used it much and my son doesn't show interest in the 1911 unless he gets the 45ACP rounds ;) 

Let me know if you have any questions. Pictures are available at http://s916.photobucket.com/albums/ad4/sizemoremk/1911/ 

I am asking $300 or make offer. 
I am in huntsville, and can meet you wherever you want, or ship it, etc.

We are the second owners.  It was almost two years old when we bought it..  It has always been garage kept.  Just a little over a year ago I put over 2,000.00 dollars in it.  I replace the air conditioner, power antenna, new tires, power outlet, tune up, and other minor things.  Shortly after this it started giveing me trouble on my way to Indy.  I barely made it home or to a mechanic.  The mechanic had me replace the computer, fuel pump, and a few other things, but ended up costing a chunk and still didn't solve the problem.  About a month go I was told that it is a fuel sensor, however this is located behind the flywheel and it would need to be towed to a mechanic.  I done spending money on it, and we have four other vehicles.  This car has just a little over 100k and the interior is very good, stereo with cd, power window and everything works.  No rust and no major body damage.  It has a v6 motor wich does really good on gas, but also has plenty of power.  If interested please call REDACTED"

This is a very nice gun I bought it when I stopped reloading a few years ago. i sold my .44mag at the time to buy this since it is cheap to shoot and fun. But now I started reloading again and would really like another .44. The round count is 250 rounds down the barrel. if you have never shot a .17HMR this thing is a tack driver like a sniper rifle. I purchased the ruger because it has the feel of a big centerfire gun not a rimfire. I also have about half a box of rounds to go with it. This is a very nice gun. The gun alone sells for over $600 new plus the trigger kit, mag release extra magazine and scope I have over $800 in this gun.

Specs from Remington's website

Overview:

A fusion of our most advanced performance features in both tactical and varmint rifles, the Model 700™ Varmint-Tactical Rifle (VTR™) is a revolutionary system optimized for extended-range precision and mobility. Its triangular barrel contour is a product of years of rigorous research and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and promoting rapid heat dissipation.

To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this uniquely contoured 22"" barrel has an integral muzzle brake that’s machined-in during production. Along with the new barrel design, we brought together a host of other cutting-edge features on our super accurate Model 700 platform. The results are nothing short of astounding.
Key Features:

    * Green stock with black overmold grips
    * Tactical-style 1 in 12"" twist rate
    * 22"" barrel with integrated muzzle brake design and triangular barrel contour to enhance accuracy"

(The old .22 short , or the CB and BB cap rounds are nice for in-town tree rat control). The stock has been refinished in a nice, matte maple finish instead of the old, peeling varnish that was on it. It can be oiled up with Tung Oil if someone wanted it a bit shinier. These also had what was a very early attempt at a powder coat finish that looked like black Krylon spray paint. The barrelled action was stripped to bare metal, then cold blued to a nce dark finish. No pitting or rust. The refinishing job is by NO means a professional job, but looks pretty darn good, and a vast improvement over what they came like. The bore is good, with no pitting, the action is smooth. It has seen plenty of use, but is by no means worn out. I added a ""period correct"" Weaver 6 power scope (these bring pretty good bucks from the restoration minded folks, or so I am told), and it has a brand new factory Marlin replacement magazine. These are essentially the same rifle as the venerable Model 25. I'd like $125 out of it, or make me an offer, or trade. Selling it to fund some more projects for the winter, I had fun cleaning this old devil up. I can email a picture to interested folks."

It has a blued slide with a polymer frame, front post sight and gutter channel rear. Barrel length is 3.25 inches. Magazine capacity is 7 rounds. The trigger mechanism is double action only. Overall size is smaller than a Glock 26 and slightly larger than a PPK. 
This pistol comes with the original plastic case, one clip, disassembly tool and an inexpensive clip-on styled concealed carry holster. It is being sold for this price because it has some cosmetic wear and tear from concealed carry and had a few misfires on the last box of 50 that were shot and I have lost confidence in it as my conceled carry gun. The SW9M was introduced in 1995 and is now discontinued. The overall appearance is very sleek with no external safety, no slide release and no disassembly lever. The slide does not lock back on the last round. Disassembly requires use of a special tool which is supplied. Thanks for looking. Send me an email with your phone number and I'll call you back."

To be fair, this gun model is part of a factory recall even though the recall was due to gross operator error.  Apparantly, the owner cleaned the gun and forgot to put the bolt retaining screw back in.  He pulled out the bolt (unloaded mind you) and whacked himself in the face.  I encourage you to research this recall as you desire.

Here is a bit of the history behind the company that the gun was shipped to.

Hennes & Mauritz AB (operating as H&M), is a Swedish clothing company, known for its inexpensive and fashionable clothing offerings for women, men, teenagers and children. H&M has more than 1,400 stores in 28 different countries and has more than 60,000 employees. The company was established in VÃ¤sterÃ¥s, Sweden, in 1947 by Erling Persson, though at the time it only sold women's clothing and was called Hennes, Swedish for ""hers."" In 1968, Persson acquired the premises and inventory of a Stockholm hunting equipment store named Mauritz Widforss. Included in the inventory was a supply of men's clothing, prompting Persson to expand into menswear. Accordingly, he renamed the store Hennes & Mauritz, later abbreviated to H&M. Erling's son, became CEO in 1990 and Chairman of the Board in 1998."

I vaccumed sealed it in case i end up hanging on to it too long... Hopefully my loss is your gain. Paid $25 + tax i'll let it go for $20

From BuffaloBore website:

This 380 Auto+P ammo will better all American made 380 Auto ammo by 150 fps to 200 fps in all bullet weights we make. This is a serious improvement in this typically anemic cartridge. This 380 auto+P ammo is more powerful than the typical 38SPL ammo made by most American ammo makers and you'll get 7 shots of it in a small/flat/light weight 380 versus 5 shots out of a bulkier 38 SPL J frame revolver. Additionally, with the 380 you'll get much faster reloads and the little magazines are flatter than a speed-loader used for a J frame.

Item 27C/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet.  It is traveling over 1,200 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel. We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto +P loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads. So, if the first shot does not incapacitate the attacker, your magazine is full of ammo that will, if you can put the bullet in his spine or brain from any angle. Note my ""real world"" velocities from my personal ""real world"" pistols."
