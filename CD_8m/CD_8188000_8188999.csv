This means you can shoot 40S&W or 9mm. This gun does have carry marks but its a Glock, so for most that does not bother them. Round count is <1000 with no hiccups EVER, when using the conversion barrel I normally use 124 or 147 grain 9mm. This is to ensure that it cycles correctly, I am not a fan of 115 gr 9mm I have seen it give troubles with 9mm 1911's so I stay away.The handgun will come with Box, and a couple mags. Will try to ad pictures soon. FFL Transfer will occur at Eagle Armory in O'fallon MO, I will cover transfer fees, this is non-neogtiable! I don't care who you are, what your Security Clearence is, or the # of Victories in Fortnite you have, this is to assist with my record keeping. NO I will not go to another FFL. Please let me know if you have any questions, have a great day."

Conventional rifling consists of either 6 or 4 symmetrical lands and grooves; however, in a 5R barrel, the lands and grooves are opposite of each other and sloped.The improvement reduces projectile deformation as it passes through the bore during the firing sequence and the projectile stays uniform instead of squeezing material on opposite side grooves. Hence, the more uniform projectile, the better the accuracy.Nick REDACTED"

Rifle has typical wear of a Russian SKS from this ERA. I am not certain on the exact age of the rage but it will be from near around the end of WW2 to before 1956. No transfer fees as since this rifle is over 50 years old it will be cash and carry. My guess on age based off available data is post 1950 as the bayonet is a blade rather than spike and the gas block matches the 1952-1956 era of Russia rifles. The rifle has what appears to be the original sling, bayonet, and tool kit inside the buttstock. Bore is decent and its definitely a shooter. Only modification is the scope mount. If you want more pictures send me a message. Asking $450 OBO."

Reliability and simplicity have made GLOCK® semi-automatic pistols a favored sidearm for law enforcement, military, and civilian use all over the world. The GLOCK 17 is a mid-size pistol, shooting the 9x19mm pistol cartridge (9mm Parabellum), a standard military round that's easy to find ammo for anywhere. The Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol utilizes a dual recoil spring assembly that substantially increases service life of the pistol, and helps take the snap out of recoil, reducing muzzle flip for faster follow up shots. A modular back strap allows shooters to instantly customize the grip to an individual shooter's hand size, or to cold weather gloves. Rough grip texturing on the Gen4's polymer frame provides a sure hold on the pistol when hands are wet or sweaty, and the enlarged magazine catch is reversible, accommodating left- or right-handed shooters. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of a plethora of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The dovetailed rear sight is drift adjustable and has a white outline around its notch; the fixed front blade has a white dot. Sight acquisition is quick in any light. The GLOCK 17 Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be for concealed carry or at home. The model 17 Gen4 comes with three standard 15-round magazines or three 10-round magazines that comply with various city or state restrictions on magazine capacity.Free Shipping"

Manufacture date April 4 2016. Comes with case, 2 clips 15 rounds each, factory holster & 100 rounds of 9mm ammo. Used at gun range twice, very new. Balanced in your hand with a full clip, and very accurate.
The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of their popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm. You also can easily tell when the SP2022 is in single-action mode by looking at or feeling the hammer position, and it also is equipped with a decocker, thereby decreasing the risk of accidental discharge.
I would highly recommend the Sig Sauer SP2022 as a full-size carry, training or competition pistol. It is a near perfect combination of affordability and quality, and would be an ideal pistol for a new shooter to learn on. It is safe, simple to operate, affordable and is an accurate and dependable pistol that will present few roadblocks to learning good technique as many cheaper pistols do.
Sig-Sauer look and feel, natural shooting dynamics. Available factory night sights and optional DAO firing mechanism. Smooth, crisp trigger break and short reset make firing quick strings a breeze.
