It's in fantastic shape, and the serial number dates it to 1990 and is one of the rarer ones that's marked Heckler & Koch on the side of the receiver. What's unique about this gun is that you can run it in BOTH semi auto and pump action because of its unique design, and that allows you to run anything from blanks to full power 3' magnum buckshot with no hiccups. It's also in the 'law enforcement/military' configuration, which gives it the pistol grip stock, as well as the full length magazine tube. The tube holds 7 rounds, plus one in the chamber, plus one 'ghost loaded' by thumbing the round under the bolt, giving you a total of 9 rounds on tap. It comes with a standard shotgun stock, a tactical pistol grip stock, as well as a shotgun scabbard. Asking $1100, or I'm open for trades, although cash is preferred.

You don’t see them much now. They have all spurious markings as Mauser or FN had nothing to do with these pistols.

My price is $375 and I am firm on that.The barrel is threaded for 1/2 28 muzzle devices, thread protector included and attached.Fyi the laptop is only for scale, so that you might have an idea of how small for a rifle this gun is.The gun shoots great,I put 100 rounds through it to ensure function, the targets shown are my 100 round group, 50 rounds per target. I shot at 25 yards, the target with the larger groups was my rapid fire target,the other one was double taps. This gun is super accurate, and I'm sure in more skilled hands is capable of even better groups, I think I did pretty well considering I was shooting more for fun than anything else.One nice thing about this gun is that it will fit in a standard size backpack when folded. If you practice it is also very easy and fast to deploy from the folded position. As for trades, I am mostly interested in cash at the moment, but I will consider pistol trades which include cash.

This rifle comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It has only minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was well taken care of, and only lightly used/fired, despite having been previously owned. There are no major flaws/defects to be found, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, nicks, cuts, staining, rusting, or discoloration. There are some very light, very minor scrapes on the rifle's synthetic stock, as well as some minor discoloration near the end of the rifle's forearm. This rifle features a soft rubber butt to reduce impact from recoil, as well as an accu-trigger as a secondary safety mechanism. The primary safety switch for this rifle is set at the rear of the bolt, just below the round indicator. A bolt release is located on the side of the receiver, and allows the rifle's bolt to be completely removed for cleaning, and safe transportation. There are no iron sights on this rifle, although it does feature a Simmons 3-9x40 Hunting Scope to allow you a perfect view of what you're hunting. This is an excellent rifle, that would make a great addition to anybody's collection, and even comes with the original owner's manual! Please see our listing images, as well as available images on our website here, to see the EXACT condition of this firarm. And if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask!"

""The 5.56 Midlength Base 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the m4 style handguards. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own."" Off AA site.

Smith & Wesson 29-2 chambered in 44 magnum. Nice condition with original grips. Had it to the smith last month and he replaced a few springs so now it fires like new. Small signs of wear but overall is in 95-98%. I purcahsed this pistol with a pistol scope (since removed) thus the rear sight blade has not been put back on. Other than this its pristine. Due to missing sight blade (costs aprox $50 to replace) I'm valuing this at the lower end of its value spectrum. Open to all trades of similar value
