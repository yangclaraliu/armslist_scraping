The rifle features a 24 inch heavy fluted barrel with a muzzle break, a one piece picitinny rail, digital camo AccuStock, AccuTrigger, and an all steel construction 10 round detachable box magazine by Accurate Mag Company.  In addition to that, I have a 6-18 Vortex Crossfire II scope with a level attached, a cheek riser, and an imitation Harris bipod.  I zeroed the rifle at a hundred yards last August, cleaned it, oiled it, and put it away.  The only adjustment I never made to it is on the magazine feed lip.  I never bothered to buy the adjustment tool because I feed the ammo by hand one round at a time when I shoot long range.  The mag feed lip probably needs to be opened up about 3 thousandths or so to get the cartridges to feed more smoothly.  The adjustment tool costs about 25 bucks.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale.  1000 dollars gets everything I listed in the ad.  900 gets you everything but the optic.  Not looking for trades at this time.  And thanks for your interest."

The trigger guard has been undercut to allow for a higher grip. An extended mag release which is also stippled.  An extended slide release. All internals have had a polish job done on them as well as the feed ramp. And a 3.5 lb ghost connector installed.

Except for the $130 Cerakote Tungsten none of the modifications are permanent, no worthless home stippling job here. This firearm has only had 50 rounds down range and all those were when it was bone stock, the aftermarket components have seen zero use. Those mods include a $230 S3F Solutions TiN plated, threaded barrel and thread protector, full $255 ZEV Tech Fulcrum Ultimate Upgrade trigger group, $30 ZEV stainless steel guide rod, 15 and 12 pound recoil springs ($15 each), $120 Trijicon tritium suppressor height sights, $15 Ghost Inc. Maritime Turbo spring cups, $17 Ghost extended slide release and an $85 Sentinel magazine well.That's $928 in upgrades not including a virtually new Glock Model 17 but wait! There's more!! Also included are seven factory Glock magazines as well as one clear ETS mag. Three of the factory mags have Taran Tactical +6 round base pads and three more have Taran +4 base pads. Two of the +6 and two of the +4 base pads have been Cerokoted to match while the others have been left black. The +4 base pads cost $31 each ($93 total) and the +6 base pads cost $42 each ($126) because they include extra-power mag springs. The five extra factory mags were $125 and the ETS mag was $17.If the buyer wants I also have four 33 round factory Glock mags that I'll include for an additional $120. I'm not interested in selling them individually, that offer only applies to the buyer of my firearm. The +6 mags fit in the 140mm box for competition purposes. None of the ammo shown is included but all the original parts are here. All in there's $1775 invested."
