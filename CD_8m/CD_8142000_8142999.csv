First the bad, then the good.The bad: About once or twice every 50 rounds, the hammer strike will not set off the primer (leaves a dent, but doesn't set it off). I am unable to remove the stock screw to get at the internals of the receiver, but I did not try very hard for fear of damaging the screw head. Recently I did try cleaning out the receiver area with some lightweight oil and compressed air, and put 70 rounds (target rounds) through it without a single issue. I don't know if this fixed it, but thought t worth mentioning that maybe all it needs is some cleaning.The good: Everything else appears to be in very good condition. The stock has little nicks typical of an old gun, but it is still in good condition. The barrel is in very good condition, and is free from any dents/bulges. The barrel closes tight on the receiver. Feel free to ask any other questions you might have."

From Remington: ""5-R rifling is the same type of rifling used on the battle proven M-24 SWS. There are 5 lands as opposed to the normal 6 land configuration. Traditional lands are squared off at a 90 degree angle to the groove while the lands on 5-R rifling are tapered at 110 degrees which results in less bullet deformation. Also, none of the lands are directly across from one another. Both of these features lead to better accuracy and less fouling. 5-R also increases barrel life and accuracy, causes less friction and bullet deformation."""

Next it has the Streamlight M3 Tactical Weapon Light with factory case, extra bulb and batteries. Next it has the Blackhawk CQC Serpa holster and matching mag pouch with weapon light holder. Now for the internals. Factory barrel and Glock white dot and outline sights. Recoil spring and guide rod are aftermarket full length stainless steel rod with heavier recoil spring. VTAC “bullet forward” extended slide release which is extended, but it is more forward so your thumb doesn’t interfere with it and cause that frequent problem of either locking the slide back when you don’t want it to, or not locking the slide back when you do want it to lock back on the last round. Extended mag release.  3.5lb Ghost aftermarket trigger (I put the factory 5.5lb trigger back in for carry). Titanium firing pin safety with lighter firing pin safety spring. And lastly Vickers Tactical grip plug with built in pin removal tool. All factory parts come with it as well. Nothing wrong with this firearm, I am just getting out of the Glock market. This Glock has roughly 3,000 to 4,000 rounds through it but she has been well maintained and has never failed me. Not one single failure of any kind other than operator error (riding the slide lock etc etc). Package deal, no separating of anything. Available to meet on weekends only and would prefer to meet at an FFL to transfer paperwork. What you see is what you get minus the ammunition. Asking $800 firm.

It is evident that at one point in time there was some slight surface rust, but the gun has been reblued and is currently rust free. The original grips are missing and have been replaced with some custom (more than likely homemade) target grips. The stampings are light but still visible.The Llama functions well, I test fired it with 50rds of light 38 super loads (well within the firearms original designated chamber pressures) with no apparent failures. The safety is functional, and the gun is a good copy of a 1911, sans grip safety.The model IV was the first gun produced by Llama and were not produced for the American market. The caliber is 9mm largo or 38 acp. The 38 acp is the exact same dimensionally as the 38 super auto, albeit the 38 acp is lower powered than the super. With light 38 super loads, the gun functions marvelously and all internals, including the bore, are in very good shape. It has a 5 1/2” barrel, slightly longer than a standard 1911. Production of the Llama IV started in 1932, with this specific firearm being produced in 1941. If any reference material is needed on this firearm, please email me and I will forward you to where I have found all of my information. I can also send more pictures if needed. These are extremely scarce on the American market, and it is truly a collectible that you will not find anywhere else.Asking price is $700 obo, willing to meet relatively close to Salisbury, NC.Open to any trade offers. Looking for 9mm carbines of good quality, AKs, ARs, big bore revolvers, old revolvers, military firearms... really any decent offer will be considered."

This gun has been shot very little and is in like new condition. It comes with a second magazine which he purchased from CZ for $57 dollars. The rifle currently has a Leupold VX-2 3x9x40 LR duplex scope sitting atop. The .243 is now Indiana deer legal and makes the perfect crossover caliber for deer/coyote hunting. Asking $700 obo for the rifle without the scope or add $300 for the whole setup. Prefer to sell to an Indiana resident with a valid drivers license and concealed carry permit or voter registration card. Thanks for looking.
