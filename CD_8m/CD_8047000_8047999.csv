It has been developed for the use at short and medium distances. With a low magnification the Short-Dot may be used like a red dot sight. The red target dot is mirrored in the center of the reticle. Turned off the illuminated dot vanishes completely leaving the user with a normal reticle. The illuminating unit offers 5 illumination stages for the use in broad daylight. The red dot remains visible, even on snow or sand or in bright sunlight. The use in poor lighting conditions provides for 3 illuminated stages, while another 3 three stages permit the use in combination with night-vision goggles. An automatic locking function is used to secure elevation and windage as well as the illuminating unit against any involuntary adjustment."

It has some cosmetic wear and tear from being used in 3 gun competitions, but functions flawlessly. The 930 JM PRO is the 930 line produced specifically for tactical shooting competitions and has a super light trigger with crisp break and amazingly short reset, oversized charging handle, oversized bolt release, oversized safety, light weight polymer stock, factory extended magazine, etc... It's good to go for 3 Gun. This one has had some modifications made to enhance that further, the feed hole has been widened and flared for easier and faster reloads, and the back of the forearm has been shaved down to keep your thumb from catching when reloading quickly. It also has the additional shell holder attached for fast tactical reloads.These retail new for $680, and average about $600 on Armslist, so considering the usage marks and the modifications, I feel my price is fair."

Just Google thunder 5 revolver and grab whatever info you want on it and you'l see they are very hard to come by. Short description, a super ugly and very heavy revolver that shoots 45lc/410. I have shot it, the 45lc feels like a 22 and the 410 feels like a 9mm. It's huge also, I compared it to a judge that shoots 454 and it' about the same size. I am mainly looking to trade but for a really good cash price I'll sell it. Trade value is $500, cash will be more on this one. All laws apply, Raleigh Area only and won't ship. Photos upon request but only if they have a trade offer in the email. I haven't fully committed to getting rid of this unless something surprises me on a trade. I am an old shotgun nut but pump action only and they need to function. 357 mag or better revolvers and other rarer guns. I have a ton of glocks so no need for them unless it' a 32 in great shape."
