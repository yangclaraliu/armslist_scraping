Priorities being .45 caliber handguns, 12 gauge shotguns, bulk ammo in either .223/.556 or 9mm, or AR or AK parts."

85,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8230085,For Sale:  Big Dawg Wet Tumbler system,"Pittsfield, NH, New Hampshire, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Saturday, April 28, 2018",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a complete Commercial Wet Tumbler System for sale. This is for cleaning very high volumes of reloading brass. Using the system, one person can clean approximately one 55 Gallon drum of brass per day. I am trying to sell this as a complete unit. If I cannot, I may break it down to individual parts.
Here is what I have:
2 of the largest Big Dawg Double wet tumblers made. You can Google Big Dawg Tumblers if you are not familiar with them.
Each tumbler has a 1/3 HP motor and dual drums, however one of the drums is broken. They are made of PVC pipe, so it will not be difficult to make a replacement.
The Tumblers, complete with Stainless Steel Pins cost $1,200 each. However, they are not making them anymore, so the only way to get them is used. The motors, timers, bearings are all in excellent shape, and fully functional with the exception of the broken drum. They will come with 70 pounds (total) of Stainless Steel pins (not chips, or carbon steel, or any other cheap alternatives). But the top of the line .047 SS pins. The pins alone sell for $9.00 per pound, That's $630 in pins.
The pictured Stainless Steel Sink and attatched counter come with it, making about a 12 foot long system. There is a commercial overhead (restaraunt style) sprayer head on it as well. However, I have not ever plumbed it in, so I do not know wow well the faucet/sprayer work. All the Stainless is dirty, and could use a good polishing.
There are 2 drying screens that are about 1 foot high, and 4 feet by 4 feet each. These are for spreading the brass on to dry.
Also included are 2 large fans to circulate air over the drying brass.
And a rusty, but functional, Dillon rotary media seperator.
 
TOTAL Package price, with everything listed is $2,000.00 cash. And yes the price is FIRM. And this IS still available.
 
The gear is all located in Pittsfield, NH. I do not have a truck, or any way to transport this, so you will need to pick it up. I do not believe it will all fit in a pick up truck. So a car or utility trailer would be a good idea.
I would consider partial trades for revolvers, single shot rifles, or lever actions. But I am selling, because I could use the money, so some cash must be involved.
 
If you have any other interesting trades in mind, just ask. The worst I will do is say no.
Thank you for your time."

295,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8230295,For Sale:  Ultimate Sorter System,"Pittsfield, NH, New Hampshire, United States","$ 1,750","Listed On: Saturday, April 28, 2018",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling a dual Ultimate Sorter System, with an additional Single Sorter Base. If you are not familiar with The Ultimate Sorter, Google them, there are some great videos, and descriptions of the machines, and what they are capable of. These are for sorting reloading brass by caliber (size) prior to washing. They even seperate out the dirt and rimfire (.22) brass.
These machines are sold in packages. The single machine sells for $1,250.00 The second machine with double base is $1,499.00 plus shipping. These are both Generation 4, the most recent version design.
You will recieve a single base, so you can run one machine and the brass will feed into the supplied plastic shoebox sized bins, AND the double base, which allows you to run one or both machines, and it feeds into 5 gallon buckets.
There are also at least one of every caliber screen they make, and doubles of some.
Ultimate Sorter claims that you can sort a 5 gallon bucket in 10 minutes. In reality (my experience) it takes running both machines to get 5 gallons done in 10 minutes. And including scooping and emptying bins, it takes about 2 1/2 hours to run a full 55 gallon barrel.
The way the system works is you run your rough brass thru one time, it gets broken down into 3 groups. Group #1 is 9mm and smaller, including 380, 9mm Luger, 9mm Makarov, 223, 32 Auto, and the 32 revolver cases. Group #2 is everything above 9mm, and below 45, so it will have 40 S&W, 10mm, 38, 357, 357 Sig, etc. Group #3 is 45ACP and up, including 45 Colt, 44 Magnum, 308, 30-06, 243, 22-250 etc. Then by changing out the sorting screens (takes 2 minutes and 4 screws), you run the brass thru again. For example, the 380/9mm screen will seperate the 9mm and the 380/223 sizes. I personally always pulled the rifle cases as they went by, and had a 223 bucket, and a 30 caliber bucket going. Doing this, there are no rifles left by the time it goes thru the second time. The other screens seperate 40/10mm from 38/357, and so on.
This is a great time saving system, but it is not a $30,000 Camdex sorter. You still have to manually seperate 38 from 357, and .40 from 10mm etc. I do the manual seperation after wet tumbling. I just throw a handful of 38/357 (for example) into a loading block, and pick out the tall ones. Same with .40 S&W and 10mm, on down the line. It is much faster than it sounds.
So COMPLETELY sorting a 55 Gallon drum Down to each individual caliber can be done in a day. But you're going to build up a sweat. I run the sorters in between running (emptying and refilling) the wet tumblers. So it takes 2 days to go from dirty drum to cleaned and sorted drum. With less sweat.
So retail, this system was $2,750.00, plus shipping about a year ago. I am selling it for $1,750.00. The price is FIRM, and it IS still available.
 
This is located in Pittsfield, NH. I do not have a way to transport it. It will easily fit in a large trunk, small wagon, or SUV. It is very light, all aluminum, and uses very little electricity.
 
I will consider partial trades for revolvers, single shot rifles, or lever action guns. But I am selling, because I could use the money, so some cash must be involved.
I have LOTS of presses, and other reloading and sorting for sale as well.
Thank you for your time."

The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine.
 
Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide.  Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition.

The crossbow comes in a complete package including three carbon ProElite arrows, a quiver, a TenPoint ProView 2 Scope. It is a nice green and red illuminated scope.  This Renegade XLT is different from the Renegade you'll find at Cabelas, Bass Pro, or any other national chain. If you are comparing make sure you are comparing to the renegade XLT. This XLT version gets the same speed but in a more narrow package. The Renegade XLT feature's TenPoint's XLT limbs and is just 13.5"" axle to axle when cocked. That's compared to the regular Renegade at 18.5"" axle to axle when cocked. This crossbow reaches speeds up to 340 feet per second and is equipped with Ten Point's Fusion stock.  When it comes to safety features, the Renegade XLT is loaded. Safety wings on the stock keep your fingers safely below the flight rail. The Renegade also features an auto-engage safety and Ten Point's patented DFI (Dry-Fire-Inhibitor). The auto-engage safety moves from the ""fire"" position to the ""safety"" position as the string enters the trigger mechanism. So the crossbow must be in ""fire"" position before cocking it. When using the ACUdraw crank, watch the safety as the string approaches the trigger. When it moves into ""safety"" you know that you've cocked the crossbow fully and you can stop cranking. Speaking of the trigger, the Renegade has a three to 3.5 pound trigger with very little creep.
