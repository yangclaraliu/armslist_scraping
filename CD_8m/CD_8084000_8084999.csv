It is evident that at one point in time there was some slight surface rust, but the gun has been reblued and is currently rust free. The original grips are missing and have been replaced with some custom (more than likely homemade) target grips. The stampings are light but still visible.The Llama functions well, I test fired it with 50rds of light 38 super loads (well within the firearms original designated chamber pressures) with no apparent failures. The safety is functional, and the gun is a good copy of a 1911, sans grip safety.The model IV was the first gun produced by Llama and were not produced for the American market. The caliber is 9mm largo or 38 acp. The 38 acp is the exact same dimensionally as the 38 super auto, albeit the 38 acp is lower powered than the super. With light 38 super loads, the gun functions marvelously and all internals, including the bore, are in very good shape. It has a 5 1/2” barrel, slightly longer than a standard 1911. Production of the Llama IV started in 1932, with this specific firearm being produced in 1941. If any reference material is needed on this firearm, please email me and I will forward you to where I have found all of my information. I can also send more pictures if needed. These are extremely scarce on the American market, and it is truly a collectible that you will not find anywhere else.Asking price is $700 obo, willing to meet relatively close to Salisbury, NC."

The control layout on the XD-S is intuitive.   Mag release is ambidextrous. Nice, large slide release.
Fit and finish on the XD-S 9 are great. There are no visible machining marks on the slide, nor injection marks on the frame.

It is operationally perfect, it is only a cosmetic defect. As far as my asking price, I am asking $1000 for the lot. My rationale is this, if you bought this new online at current prices, you would be easily paying over $2000  or you can just buy mine for less than half the price.I have a violin case for it that is brand new in the box and unused. I will want an additional $150 for that. In also have 7 extra 30 round stick magazines. I will want $70 a piece for them.I am firm on my price and I will only sell to someone with a valid Florida Concealed Weapons License and you must be willing to do a bill of sale.

The Hi Point factory magazine holders carry two magazines, one on each side of the stock. Factory peep sights remain, but a red/green adjustable reticle scope has been added, along with a green laser and tactical light, both mounted with contact switches in front of the adjustable foregrip. A factory compensator tricks out the barrel end, and to keep you shooting instead of reloading, this one comes with 3 factory 9 round magazines and 4 Pro Mag 14 round magazines. All the above is fitted in a high-end tactical carry/backpack case that will hold another rifle, multiple handguns, and tons of other stuff you may want to take along. Look over the pictures and you will see that there is nothing missing here! On the case pic, the backpack straps are on the other side. More photos available if interested.A note on Hi Point, should you care: The handguns are absolute turds, and nothing could change my mind on this. After being badgered to shoot one of their carbines (in a .40 cal), I was shocked, and immediately started looking for one in my caliber, .45. I wanted something the gals and kids could shoot that was so simple, comfortable, fun, and from the first shot so deadly accurate, while using my very plentiful ammo. Everyone that has shot this has enjoyed it, but there has been a shift in direction and this has been sitting after about six months of action. If I had to make a guess, I would say the round count through this is probably around 300, and well cared for during and after."
