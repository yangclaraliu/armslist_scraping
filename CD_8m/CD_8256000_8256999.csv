The internal hammer of the 642 eliminates the risk of the hammer getting snagged on clothing, holsters, or purses when drawing the weapon in a self-defense situation. The low profile, ramp front sight and the fixed notch rear sight also aid in snag-free presentation of the weapon. The 642 is double-action only, making it an extremely fast personal-defensive handgun to deploy in stressful situations, as there is nothing to remember to do except point and pull the trigger. The synthetic grips and inherently ergonomic design afford natural pointability. The Model 642 is built on Smith & Wesson's famous J-Frame, it has a 5-shot cylinder rated for +P .38 Special ammunition. Stainless steel and alloy construction resist corrosion caused by humidity and perspiration when the revolver is carried close to the body. The Smith & Wesson 642 Airweight Double-Action Revolver carries easily, deploys rapidly, and has enough firepower to handle any self-defense scenario.• No-snag, concealed carry design• Internal hammer, double-action only• Stainless steel and alloy construction• Ramp front sight and fixed rear sight• Black synthetic grips• 5-shot, +P rated"

This is a rare Heckler Koch HK P7M13 9mm that was made in West Germany. The pistol comes complete with the matching factory box, one factory 13-round magazine, carbon scraper, and the piston brush. I am also including a later factory manual and disassembly tool. Also included are a set of brand-new, never installed wood Nill grips ordered from Germany.
This gun has a date code of ""II”, indicating it was manufactured in 1988, making these the last of the West German P7's, with the nice deep silver lettering and has no slide or frame warnings as seen on later models. Chantilly, VA import markings.
Transfer at FFL of your choice and expense in the Everett/Lynnwood area within reason.

As you can see he couldn’t resist putting target sights on it. Of course they can be replaced with the original style sight for authenticity purposes if you prefer.There is so much history behind this pistol it would fill a novel.As you can see from the excerpt from a Gun Collectors Magazine (below) these guns are highly collectable and going for quite a bit of money in the original box and in excellent condition.Some History from Gun Collectors Magazine""During WWII, Colt had orders for more pistols from the military than it could handle, so they set up Ithaca as subcontractors for the huge order. With tips, drawings, and help from Colt, Ithaca churned out no less than 369,129 pattern M1911 guns for Uncle Sam between 1943-1945. They got so good at making these guns in fact, that the military gave them a special letter of appreciation after the company improved the standard manufacturing procedure for the triggers. These guns today are a hit with collectors, running as high as $2600 a pop for guns still in excellent condition with the original cardboard shipping carton.""I have seen these historic firearms, like my dad’s, going for an average of $1685 and the most expensive I’ve seen on the market was $6899.Other than not having the original box and the target sight being installed, this gun is in excellent, original, as manufactured condition. You can see some machining marks on it, but that's from the original manufacturing process, Not after the fact, which some say adds to the historic value and provenance.I'm asking $1595 or best offer for this historic 45."

The Counter Point series represents the culmination of that research and development. The stiletto inspired spear point blades have a distinctively pronounced false edge and a lustrous satin finish, combining to make a blade that not only looks great, but delivers a show stopping performance! Cutting and piercing with equal ease, the Counter Point is both a functional and attractive EDC (Every Day Carry) knife and a steadfast resource in any rescue or emergency situation. The expertly designed handle simply has to be felt to be believed. Lightweight, but incredibly strong – made from GRIV-EX, a super plastic pioneered by Cold Steel, and reinforced with heat treated aluminum liners – the handle is comfortable and secure in almost any grip imaginable! Strong, light, versatile, concealable and above all functional, the Counter Point series takes the best features of a quality boot knife and redefines the potential of a high performance folder.

You will need to show me identification to enter details about yourself on the Bill of Sale. This Bill of Sale and it's information will be for my own personal records as a safeguard in the unlikely event the gun is stolen or lost and used illegally and traced back to me. I will also need you to show me an Idaho Concealed Weapons License OR be willing to conduct a FFL transfer at a local gun shop. Sorry, I won't budge on this. I don't know you and I want to make sure you are legally able to make this purchase. If we do a FFL transfer you will pay for the transfer fee to the FFL dealer (typically about $20-25) BUT I will deduct that cost from the sale price of the shotgun if you successfully pass the background check. Lastly, I will also choose the place of transfer. If you have a CWL the transfer will likely take place in the parking lot at the Meridian Police Station. I have confirmed with the police station that it is acceptable to conduct private gun sales in the police parking lot for safety with surveillance cameras. If we are doing an FFL transfer then the transaction will take place at a gun shop of my choosing somewhere in either Nampa or Meridian."

Because of the aforementioned, I would believe this example to be a WW1 souvenir (although no hard proof). The clearing rod is a reproduction. The finish has browned with age (see pictures). I have never taken it apart, and do not know of the markings / condition under the stock, nor the bore. Firm price is $395 face-to-face or $395 + $40 shipping.
