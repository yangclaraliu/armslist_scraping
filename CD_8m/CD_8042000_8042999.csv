It fires the same 7.62X39 ammunition as the AK-47. This particular rifle has problems cycling certain types of ammunition, meaning that at times the charging handle has to be operated manually between each shot. This is a relatively common problem with SKS rifles and is usually just a result of a dirty gas chamber and can easily be fixed. I honestly don't have the time or patience to do it myself, so I'm offering this one for a bit less than you'll find them at your local gun shop. Again, this is an easily fixable, inexpensive repair making this rifle a bit of a steal.

The rifle is just as it came from the factory late in the war. Not an Arsenal rework. Not an import. Excellent plus original condition.  $1150
There are two kinds of 30 Cal. carbines … . One that loses its value over time ( a commercially made rifle ), and one that is an investment….that is, it will at least HOLD its value, and likely INCREASE in value over time. ( a genuine U.S Carbine .Caliber 30 M1 rifle , made during WWII). You DO get what you pay for

As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   

The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…"
