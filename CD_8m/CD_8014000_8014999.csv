Chamber was cut with new match reamers to guarantee straightness and polished. Backbored the muzzle 3 inches to .375 and milled ports on sides and top to reduce recoil very effectively and eliminate muzzle rise. Surgeon stainless bolt knob installed. Optic is a Millett LRS 6-25X56mm with 35mm tube side focus 1/8 MOA adjustment and mil dot bar recticle. Millett steel tactical rings and Warne 20 MOA picattiny rail. Stock is a Choate Major John Plaster Ultimate Sniper with aluminum blocks. Trigger is factory Remington but had my gunsmith completely tear it down polish, and set to 1.25 lbs. Entire weapon is duracoated OD green with black tribal and barbed wire design. Over $2800 invested. Has fired around 200 rounds for break in and load development. Shoots extremely accurate, but I never had a chance to shoot a match with it due to heart surgery and tasked with raising three grandkids. Spent 13 years in the industry and am going through my collection and culling, as I have far too many guns to maintain. Ship to FFL only for interstate transfer. No sales to California. Your FFL must be willing to accept shipment from an individual. A copy of my ID will be included with firearm."
