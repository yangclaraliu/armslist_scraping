Item is new and uninstalled in the original sealed factory packaging. Works with the M&P Shield in 9MM or .40 Cal. NOT for use in the 2.0 or .45 ACP.
Features
•Limited pre-travel
•Limited over-travel
•Improved safety features make the Shield AETK a reliably safe trigger system
The Shield Action Enhancement Trigger Kit directly replaces the factory hinged trigger with a solid aluminum trigger body.  The trigger reduces Trigger pre-travel and over-travel by approximately 20%.  It features a flat face with a center mounted pivoting safety.  The center mounted pivoting safety bar prevents unintended operation by creating a trigger block that will not disengage unless the shooter places their finger directly on the trigger face.  The flat, smooth face trigger causes the shooter to place their finger on the center line of the trigger and encourages trigger manipulation directly in line with the bore axis.  The Shield Action Enhancement Trigger is perfect for use with the M&P Shield already equipped with the Apex Shield Carry Kit.
Notes:
NOT for use in the Shield 45 or the Shield 2.0"
