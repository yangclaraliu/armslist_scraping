I ordered this nearly a year ago because I love my SP01 Tactical, and it just recently arrived, but I have shifted over to shooting mainly 9mm so I suspect this will just sit in the safe. This is the version with the decocker and night sights. Very smooth action, trigger pull and finish overall. I’m certainly not in a rush to sell it, but I know I could use the funds to support other expensive gun projects.  Shot exactly 1 box of ammo through it.No trades please. Price listed OBO. Happy to answer any questions. Thanks for looking."

It’s basically a hopped up version of the standard 870 police. Much higher quality then the typical express models that they have out there right now, as I’m sure you are aware if you are looking at this shotgun. It comes from the factory with a Davis  Stock (no shell holder inside buttstock), scattergun technologies ghost ring sights, surefire forend, and a factory 2 shot extension. It’s a 1000 dollar shotgun brand new. It’s in great shape no rust/pitting or any major wear/tear. I’m only selling because I also have a mossberg 590a1 that I tend to prefer a little more and use it more often so I’m cleaning this one out of my safe.’all laws will be followed no exceptions. I’m out of personal transfers already so this will have to be done at an ffl shop. Thanks!"

I bought this pistol about 6 months ago and it has sat in the safe since. I did all the research and this is the one. It is the H&K P2000 V3, which means it is a DA/SA with decocker only. It is similar in size to a Glock 19. It came with 2-13rd factory mags and I ordered an additional factory mag for a total of 3. I also ordered H&K flat base plates for the magazines to facilitate easy carry and an H&K extended mag release lever, which I never installed. The pistol has sat in my safe completely un-fired since the day I brought it home(yes, not even 1 shot fired). I also ordered a Streamlight TLR-3 weapon light which is new, unopened in the package which will come with it. I have about $950.00 into this package. Please have NH ID and a P&R license.

It is an EXCELLENT optic. I far preferred this to the Mil 4x32 because the eye relief is significantly better. Glass is clear, comes with a flip up blizzard see thru cover, and the 4xDOS LaRue Quick throw lever mount. I might have the Trijicon box, and if I find it, that is yours, too. This optic was babied because I couldn’t bring myself to roughly treat it like I do my Aimpoint and EoTechs. Never dropped or banged around like it was designed to handle. My price is pretty much firm - they still run $1000-$1200 new and the mounts aren’t cheap either."

I Simply don't enjoy shooting it as much as i did when i got it, and am contemplating picking up a SCAR for the right price or maybe building an AR10.For Sale is my Tavor X95 in FDE. Purchased second hand, though it was barely used. It's in great shape and comes with some extras. A Timney Trigger was installed by the previous owner, along with a Midwest Industries (MI) Ejection Port Cover. The Original Trigger is included in the package, as well. It also has a Magpul AFG On it (Would like to keep it, but not a deal breaker if you want it). The Box for the Tavor is included, as well. As far as use, I put a few hundred rounds through it. The Original owner Put something like 200 through it, as well. I'd say overall round count is at 450-500. The EOTech Setup seen in the photo is included in the package price, but am certainly open to negotiating a deal without it if you want to go in another direction. It is in Great shape, dated 2015. I purchased it Brand New online from a dealer in the middle of nowhere who made a custom package for me (Not a typical HHS1 set), as i wanted a different reticle than what came with the HHS1 Set. It does come with an HHS1 Case (Not seen in photos, but i have it) and paperwork. Functions Flawlessly. Can sell JUST the EoTech if you happen to be interested in it.I Also have 9 HexMags going up for sale in another thread that can be included in a package deal, if you need mags. NONE are included. If you need ammo, i can provide some IMI 5.56 or other ammo to shoot with this, as well.Price for the setup:$2800Would Consider Trades/Partial Trades. Don't expect me to trade down. Yes, i realize i'm asking for a hell of a lot of money, if ya don't want it, don't buy it!I Can only post 3 photos on here so contact me for more. Pick up in East Brunswick NJ. Must have all paperwork. Cash is king."

They are as light and easily concealable as any auto. Revolvers don’t jam, don’t mis-feed, they can be fired single-action making them much more accurate, they are not ammunition sensitive, they shoot high-power ammo and bullet styles other than round-nose, just by looking or feeling you know the state of their safety, you never have to work a slide, and they can be fired without remembering how to work one.

Meaning, it doesn't have a safety - it has a decocker. Also, it's a distributor exclusive and comes in FDE! The firearm came with two magazines, but I purchased 2 additional. So you'll get 4 magazines. The firearm has never been shot.""So why do you want to sell if it's such a unicorn?""Honestly - I purchased it knowing I didn't have the money at the time.

Purchased this second hand and it was an absolute blast to shoot. I Took the sight that was on it (Nikon Monarch) and put it on my Ruger Precision, and am having issues with the Nikon M223 i purchased from a member on here a few months ago, and am just sick of the setup at this point. Going to sell the rifle and hope Nikon will replace the sight for me as i haven't heard back from the seller. Not really willing to spend another few hundred bucks for a piece of glass for this thing, so for sale it goes!Rifle only at the price. Sight not included, nor is bipod. Comes with the Magpul PRS Stock. If you want a discount on the rifle and have a stock of your own that you'd prefer, you are welcome to swap them and i will GLADLY keep the PRS Stock. The previous owner was older and hadn't shot it in a while. It is functionally in great condition, never had any issues with it. I Put 300-400 rounds through it. Minor scratches/scuffing towards bottom of hand guard from resting it on crap. Will likely be replacing it with a custom precision build at some point, but for now i want to clear some stuff out to prepare for an impending move to SNJ. Just in case, id rather have a bit more money in my pocket.. so, this is up for sale along with my TAVOR and some other goodies.Regarding the issue sighting it in with the M223, the issue is with the Optic, NOT the rifle. With the Monarch i had on it, i rang steel all day long; it held zero without issues and sighting it in was an absolute breeze. For Some reason, the M223 is simply not cooperating (Windage won't adjust enough to match POI with POA). Anyhow, $1,000 takes this one. Fairly firm as it's a great rifle and the stock costs an arm and a leg. Would rather keep the stock for a build but don't have one to put on it right now, so if you have one you want to put on let me know and we'll swap em!Pick up in East Brunswick or possibly Newark NJ. Cash is king, would consider trades/partial trades. Must have all proper paperwork!!"

This all metal gun eats the minimal recoil produced by a 9mm catridge. The nice thing about this gun, and why I want $1,200 for it (OBO) is that it's the tactical model. Meaning, it doesn't have a safety - it has a decocker. Also, it's a distributor exclusive and comes in FDE! The firearm came with two magazines, but I purchased 2 additional. So you'll get 4 magazines. The firearm has never been shot.""So why do you want to sell if it's such a unicorn?""Honestly - I purchased it knowing I didn't have the money at the time.

P226 22 Conversion Kit. Came as a package deal with the 226 Legion i purchased off of a member. I used it a few times including to introduce my little cousin to shooting handguns but can't justify keeping it for the once or twice a year i take a younger person with me, so i'd rather sell it if i can get a reasonable amount of money for it..Barely been shot, however it does appear to have been dropped onto concrete or something, note picture of damage at the rear. Purely cosmetic but it's there. As far as function, it's a 22.. Nowhere near as reliable as the 9mm but it does its job. Tends to stick a bit due to a lack of recoil. As stated, i really only used it to teach my little cousin the absolute basics (He's too small to really handle 9mm safely), and it's great for that as there is nearly zero recoil. I've only put 40-50 rounds thru it. Two 10-rd Mags included. 250$ Takes it.
 
Cash is king, would consider trades. Pick up in East Brunswick NJ. Proper documentation required (FID) EVEN for parts, don't need my fingerprints floating around in crime scenes!"
