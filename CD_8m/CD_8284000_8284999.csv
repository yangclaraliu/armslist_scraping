This gun is a really interesting piece of history.
This sale includes the pistol, some ammunition and one non matching magazine.I'd be interested in trades or cash offers.

An optional 12-round extended magazine allows you to bring the total capacity to 13 rounds. The new P365. Bring More. Everyday. The unique grip design and higher grip to bore axis reduces perceived recoil and makes the P365 as comfortable to shoot as many mid-sized pistols.

The stainless-steel slide comes standard with front and rear serrations for easier slide manipulation, as well as XRAY3 Day/Night sights for faster sight acquisition under all lighting conditions.

Finally took it to the range a couple of weeks ago. This gun is an absolute dream to shoot. Extremely accurate straight out of the box. I fired approximately 50 or 60 rounds of Winchester Ranger LE 230gr Bonded JHP and was very impressed with it. Not a single FTF or Misfeed, it went bang every single time. When I got back home, I completely tore it down and cleaned, oiled and greased it after polishing the feed ramp, and all internals. Has an excellent smooth trigger. The gun is a series 80 design with a bushingless 4 inch barrel, looks like a bull barrel. Single Action only as are all 1911's. Has Dove-Tail 3-dot white sights that are actually very nice (I had no trouble at all getting on target with my 55 year old eyes). Stainless frame, slide and barrel. Ambidextrious Safety. Very tight tolerances. Beautiful Checkered Wood Grips. Feels and handles great while shooting! Again, this thing in impressive all around.Comes with everything from the factory; Nice storage case, (3) 8-round Mec-Gar magazines, Gun Lock, Cleaning Brushes and Rod, Gun Oil And even a Cleaning Rag. I have also added 28 rounds of Winchester Ranger LE Ammo, 230 Gr Bonded JHP as this is what I used that day at the range.You won't be disappointed with this little gem of a gun. I also carry a Kimber Custom Shop Compact Ultra CDP II and this gun shot every bit as accurate as my Kimber!I'm only selling because I have decided I have too many 1911's and am venturing into other types of handguns.Asking $500 Cash but I would prefer to trade for something else in .45acp or 9mm.I live in Spring, close to Highway 99 and Kuykendahl and usually get home by 4PM thru the week. I work in Bellaire so I could meet up close to that area if it helps.I have plenty of good HD pictures I am happy to text to anyone interested so please send me a text.

While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of our competitors’ models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity.     A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why we’ve chosen to fit the Mod.2 Tactical Model with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul.   The slide takes most of the day to day wear and tear, so we’ve made sure to construct that from Melonite-treated carbon steel too. While we always recommend properly caring for your handgun, the Mod.2 Tactical isn’t one that will require babying. This combat-ready gun is designed to be used, not left in the safe.   Fast and accurate shooting requires control, so we’ve included all of the Mod.2 enhancements. Springfield High Hand grip near the beavertail and below the trigger guard allow you to put support close to the bore line to minimize muzzle flip. The new GripZone contours and texturing are specifically designed to provide maximum purchase at specific points where your hands and fingers require the most contact. Three different textures provide the friction needed without painful overkill.   SPECIFICATIONS CALIBER: 9mm RECOIL SYSTEM: One Piece Full Length Guide Rod SIGHTS: Fiber Optic Front and Low Profile Combat Rear (Steel) WEIGHT: 29 oz. w/ Empty Magazine HEIGHT: 5.5"" SLIDE: Forged Steel, Stainless Steel Finish BARREL: 5"" Hammer Forged, Carbon Steel, Melonite / 1:10 RH LENGTH: 8.3"" GRIP WIDTH: 1.20"" FRAME: Black Polymer MAGAZINES: 2 - 16 Round"
