The problem is they were also very expensive to produce for Ruger, so after only two years in production they were replaced with cheaper (and weaker) polyethylene stocks. S.S. Ruger barrel and action is only a few years old and in mint condition. Original Metal barrel band is included. These stocks are becoming extremely rare, I have no urgency to sell, just making room in the safe, so I am fair and firm on the price. Not interested in any lower offers, thanks.$425- CASH ONLY! 615-479-6314NO E-MAILS OR TEXTS PLEASE, I WILL NOT RESPOND!"

These guns are SUPER rare and top rate and only the best components are used to specific tolerances. There are only a few made by hand at the Performance Center not mass produced like most other manufacturers. You see lots of any other brand at any range or gun store but chances are you've never seen a Performance Center AR, that's because they're made for competition and accuracy.

Anyways this pistol is still in brand new condition as it is has always been carried in its case and still has never been fired. Its a very comfortable pistol with changeable grips. Comes with the Interchangeable grips, 2-15 Round magazines, a speed loader, Original HK case, and HK pistol lock and keys. Asking $600 OBO also am open to trades for equal to or greater in value firearms, I will add $ on my end if your firearm is greater in value to equal out trade. I am really looking for a compact Glock plus some $. Feel free to message me on here or via text @ REDACTED. Thanks, John."

The XPS2 is the shortest, smallest and lightest EOTech model holographic weapon sight available without night vision. Its size and weight make it convenient for hunters and law enforcement officers to carry.
It is also fast and runs on a single 123 battery. The compact, single-lithium-battery configuration leaves more rail space than ever for rear iron sights or magnifiers.

The factory original walnut magna grips are serial numbered to the gun. Not much else to say, the pistol is about as clean and solid as they get, externally and mechanically. And again, in a (probably) vain attempt to sidestep the scammers, I ask that you please try and sound like a legitimate local buyer, or I won't respond at all ( but also keep in mind that messages often just get lost here).  Buyer must be legal to own firearms, and be Ga resident over 21, with valid ID. As always, I'll show my Ga DL and carry permit. I'm ok with a bill-of-sale, or not. No checks, no shipping, no travel.  Price is $400 (hell, a friggin' Rossi or Taurus is gonna cost about that much ,LOL! These are typically in the $450-500 range, and not as vintage as this one.) No trade interests (unless it's something just crazy and irresistably in my favor! But, I might consider a clean, decent quality hardtail mountain bike.)Thanks for looking........M."
