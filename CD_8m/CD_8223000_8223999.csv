It has the U shaped notched rear sight, they've rounded out some of the sharper edges of a more traditional revolver, as well as the 2.5"" barrel.It would also come with a custom Simply Rugged pancake holster that can be worn OWB or IWB.I really dig this gun and set up. Just testing the waters for what trade offers may be out there.$650 paid for gun, $100 for the holster."
