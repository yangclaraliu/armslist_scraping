This custom-built modern sporting rifle features an 18"" nitrided alloy barrel with rifle-length gas system, Ruger's 15"" free-float handguard compatible with M-LOK® accessories, the Ruger® Elite 452™ AR-Trigger and ergonomic Magpul® furniture. The perfect rifle for a variety of uses, the AR-556 MPR is capable and versatile.Ruger's talented team of engineers worked carefully to develop the ideal custom package for the AR-556 platform that does it all, right out of the box. From plinking to competition shooting, the MPR is the perfect rifle for just about anything.The MPR's cold-hammer forged 18"" alloy barrel with 5R rifling is salt bath nitrided for corrosion resistance and durability. The barrel is contoured to minimize weight without sacrificing rigidity, leaving a 0.75"" journal for the low-profile gas block. The soft-shooting, rifle-length gas system paired with a Ruger® muzzle brake provides smoother operation and softens recoil to keep every shot on target.Ruger's 15"" free-float handguard is light, stiff and versatile, with Magpul M-LOK accessory attachment slots along the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions. Additional slots on the angled surfaces near the muzzle are perfect for mounting a light, laser or QD sling cup. Compared to a typical quad-rail forend, the 1.50"" diameter handguard makes the MPR's forend slim and controllable. M-LOK-compatible Picatinny rail sections can be easily added. The integral Picatinny rail at the 12:00 position is tightly controlled to the most current STANAG 4649 specification.The crisp 4.5 pound trigger pull of the Elite 452 two-stage trigger is a great addition to the MPR. The lower receiver is fitted with Magpul's MOE® grip and Mil-Spec MOE SL™ buttstock, making the rifle easy to handle, shoulder and shoot. The Mil-Spec compatible lower and upper receivers are CNC-machined from forgings and hard coat anodized. The MPR comes complete with dust cover, brass deflector and forward assist.Firearm Features:Lower receiver is fitted with Magpul® MOE® grip and MOE SL™ collapsible buttstock on the Mil-Spec buffer tube.Handguard is free-floating for accuracy and the slim, 15"" length provides enhanced ergonomics and support.Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.The Ruger® Elite 452™ AR-Trigger is a two-stage trigger that offers a smooth, crisp, 4.5 pound trigger pull. It features a full-strength hammer spring for consistent primer ignition and a lightweight hammer that enables a 30% faster lock time over standard MSR triggers.Rifle-length gas system provides smoother operation and reduces felt recoil.Magpul® M-LOK® accessory attachment slots along the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions with additional slots on the angled faces near the muzzle.Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black nitrided finish provides corrosion resistance.Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.Ruger® muzzle brake is a radial port design that significantly reduces felt recoil and muzzle movement. The 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.-I also just bought a brand new Nikon P-223 3-9x40 Scope and mount.-Custom Kryptek Banshee Cerakote."

The cosmetics on this 107-year-old rifle are in good condition. The bore is clean and bright. There are no cracks in the wood. It appears that the wood has long been protected by a period re-varnish; the age of which is unknown. It has a nice patina and just “looks right” for a rifle of this age.
 
I have test-fired this rifle (10 rounds) it functioned flawlessly except that the recoil would flip the rear sight down sometimes. I have not attempted to change that.
It was thoroughly cleaned immediately afterwards.
 
I have described this rifle to the best of my knowledge. Please examine the high resolution images that accompany this text, as they form an important part of the description.
I have many high-resolution photos available upon request. Please ask any questions that you may have. I will do my best to answer as quickly as possible.
Comes with a new plastic gun case, a new gun protective gun sock and a replacement saddle ring (complete with “aging” instructions) if you should choose to fit that.
 
 Will ship, by your preferred shipping method, in a new (and reusable) Uline box, to FFL supplied address (only) for $40"

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

The gun comes with some accessories and is in like new condition. It has had less than 200 rounds through it. It has been a complete safe queen once I picked up a new handgun. Since It’s been sitting in my safe for all this time, I figured I’d pass it onto someone else so they could get some use out of it. I originally bought this gun as a edc/competition gun.
The gun comes with talon grips installed, TFO green night sights (Less than 3 years old, still 12 years of life in them), a custom rolling pin, and a PRP titanium striker status indicator. I’m asking for $500 for all of this.If you would like to purchase the Custom IWB Appendix holster, or the Tungsten guide rod with the wolf spring, then here’s the break down. The Appendix Holster is from Concealment solutions. It’s incredibly comfortable, made with horse leather for a thinner and more durable holster. It comes with a lifetime warranty; it’s the only brand I carry. The Tungsten guide rod is custom made from Pistol Gear, with a 22lb wolf spring for faster follow up shots. If you want the holster its $50, and the guide rod set is $45. If you purchase the entire set for $600, I’ll throw in a maglula pistol loader.
I’m not interested in trades, I just want cash. Price is firm. I’m in the spring branch area, and will drive to meet you within a reasonable distance. I do require a bill of sale, and you must be a texas resident."
