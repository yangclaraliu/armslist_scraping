The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match. It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace.History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories."

This has the SA arsenal marking, but the finish is all original and looks very nice.  The barrel is a High Standard and is in solid condition with strong rifling. I am including the magazine that came with the pistol which is marked Colt 45 Auto. The leather holster is a Sears in very good condition and makes a great companion to the pistol. I will send additional photos to anyone interested. I am asking $1300 OBO for the pistol and holster, and the only trade I am interested in right now would be a Springfield M1A scout squad.

This carbine features Titanium Cerakote and ships with the good stuff—all of it—pre-installed. Like a free-floating M-LOK handguard, which promotes accuracy and handling. Or a quality grip and premium, 6-position buttstock with integral QD points. The Enhanced SIG Trigger on the M400 Elite enables the shooter to extract excellent accuracy from the rifle’s lightweight, 16” nitride barrel that is equipped with a SIG Micro-light Gas Block.
