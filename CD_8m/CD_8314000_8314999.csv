This is not a M38 but a rare unique rifle surrounded in controversy. Many historians say these rifles were modified to the current configuration in Bulgaria to help fight off a US invasion during the height of the cold war. These rifles are cut down M91/30's unlike their M38/M44 carbine cousins. They have a heavier barrel than the other carbines and lend to better accuracy. This rifle is a true all numbers matching example with no electro penciled parts including the stock. The original rifle was produced in 1943 at the Izhevsk factory. The fit & finish is outstanding and the rifle is in excellent condition. These are a must have for any Mosin collector & currently this is the only 91/59 listed on Armslist in the entire country.

Also comes with six mags (2-20rd CZ, 4-32rd Manticore PGS Hybrid), and extra parts (i.e., pistol grip, safety levers). Also comes with 1,200 rounds of assorted fmj ammo (all factory loads, 115 grains, ammo not pictured). Must have a CCDWL to buy/trade this gun. I do have a CCDWL if you need to check. Face to face deals only. No shipping. Meet within the surrounding counties only. Package sell or trade only. Will not separate the extra mags, ammo, and arm brace from the gun. $1,400 for all. Cash price is FIRM. No low ball please. The folding arm brace alone was $180. Low ball offers will not get a reply or will be ignored. No calls or texting (I’m not giving out my number to a total stranger). I need to know you first. There are too many scammers out there. I’ve been burned before. Corresponds via emails first, and then will exchange phone numbers when time to set up a meeting. Thanks for looking."

The cartridge offers significantly less wind drift and drop than other loads in its class, as well as less than half the recoil of cartridges with comparable ballistics. Loaded in an unmatched array of high-performance projectiles, 224 Valkyrie is a great choice for both long-range target shooters and hunters. These extraordinary loads combine the legendary Sierra MatchKing bullet with Federal’s proven quality standards and stringent manufacturing controls to create a round that is as accurate as a match load, but available from the factory. Sierra MatchKing bullets have very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight. Their accuracy has been acclaimed worldwide and they have been used to win more target competitions than all target bullets from other manufacturers combined. This ammunition is in production, non-corrosive, in boxer-primed, reloadable brass cases. Specifications: – Caliber: 224 Valkyrie – Quantity: 20 Rounds – Grain Weight: 90 Grains – Muzzle Velocity: 2700 Feet Per Second – Muzzle Energy: 1457 Foot Pounds – Bullet Style: Jacketed Hollow Point – Bullet Brand And Model: Sierra Matchking – Lead Free: No – Case Type: Brass – Primer: Boxer – Corrosive: No – Reloadable: Yes – Ballistic Coefficient: 0.504 – Sectional Density: 0.256 – Test Barrel Length: 24″"

Carbine system, MFT stock and BCM pistol grip, this gun has maybe seen 100 rounds. It is a pre-Healey ban gun, I do not have my copy of the FA10 because my last laptop decided to die with all my files on it. That being said, I'm not an asshole; selling you an illegal gun would be an asshole move. Everything is in great shape with the exception of one of the 8 screws in the handguard got stripped at one point and can't be used unless you buy a new advanced upper from Aero, but it doesn't affect anything. No trades and l'm pretty firm on the price! Thank you!"

The RMR is the 12.9 MOA triangle dual illumination, which I know sounds huge dot, but is awesome for outdoors and can be perfect for up close to 100 yards. 12.9 sounds big when you compare to other Red Dots out there, but for a pistol, for up close personal defense and accurate shots within 50 yards, I want a large quick dot. LOOKING FOR $700, If that price is met I will throw in a box of 350 rounds of Blazer 9mm.Will get good pictures if you are interested. Easiest to text picture from cell phone to cell phone. Sooner its sold, sooner I am happy to deal. I do not have the original Trijicon box at this time, with the tool and manual, and also I do not have the cover for when no RMR is installeed, but the RMR was bought at christmas from Cabelas, and has no range use. I will try to get the serial number off the bottom once i find the right size allen wrench to do so. All of these issues are why the price is so low. The RMR, unshot, is $388 new, and even though it is Gen 1, I don't see Gen 2 be much better, and its a $600 M&P. Looking to get it gone!  750 OBO.  Gun was ~$650 and RMR was $388.  Could be a very good deal.  Plus these M&Ps really are awesome, and there id huge after market, including easy ways to give it a perfect trigger pull and reset.  I have never found a Glock that shot as well as . the two M&Ps I have owned."

Please see our About page regarding restricted areas. One case/10 Boxes Federal, Gold Medal, 224 Valkyrie, 90 Grain, Boat tail Hollow Point Federal Premium has drawn from its 95 years of ammunition manufacturing excellence to develop a cartridge that transforms the MSR 15 platform, unleashes shooters’ long-range potential and shatters the boundaries of ballistic performance. The 224 Valkyrie provides extremely flat trajectories and match accuracy beyond 1,300 yards. The cartridge offers significantly less wind drift and drop than other loads in its class, as well as less than half the recoil of cartridges with comparable ballistics. Loaded in an unmatched array of high-performance projectiles, 224 Valkyrie is a great choice for both long-range target shooters and hunters. These extraordinary loads combine the legendary Sierra MatchKing bullet with Federal’s proven quality standards and stringent manufacturing controls to create a round that is as accurate as a match load, but available from the factory. Sierra MatchKing bullets have very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight. Their accuracy has been acclaimed worldwide and they have been used to win more target competitions than all target bullets from other manufacturers combined. This ammunition is in production, non-corrosive, in boxer-primed, reloadable brass cases. Specifications: – Caliber: 224 Valkyrie – Quantity: 20 Rounds – Grain Weight: 90 Grains – Muzzle Velocity: 2700 Feet Per Second – Muzzle Energy: 1457 Foot Pounds – Bullet Style: Jacketed Hollow Point – Bullet Brand And Model: Sierra Matchking – Lead Free: No – Case Type: Brass – Primer: Boxer – Corrosive: No – Reloadable: Yes – Ballistic Coefficient: 0.504 – Sectional Density: 0.256 – Test Barrel Length: 24″"

It’s somewhere between a “loaded” and a “range officer”. Got it in a trade and the previous owner gave it to me in the wrong box.. and virtually had no info. Lol.  It differs from other stainless Springfields in that it is a full satin finish, where as all others I’ve seen have polished flats. It also has an anti-glare serrated back on slide and checkered front strap. Again, I don’t know much about this particular guns history, or 1911’s in general, so I’m not sure what features are factory original and what features may be upgrades/custom work.   Comes with 2 sets of grips, 6 8-round trip research magazines (numbered 1-6), a gi style guide rod/plunger and a full length guide rod/plunger.   I also need to add I’ve put about 300 rounds of ammo through it (brass, steel, aluminum, hollow point) and it’s never jammed even once... which is apparently is a big deal with 1911’s I guess lolNot in a big hurry to trade, Just more or less seeing what’s out there. Don’t be afraid to shoot me cash offers... as long as they’re reasonable. If you’re considering offering me a shield, a “custom” m&p, a $300 snub nose, your maverick 88 with tactical stock, or any other garage sale gun, let me save you some time... the answer is no. Lol. If you offer a Glock, prepare to offer money on top. It’s a $450 gun new. I’m sorry you paid $900 for it. And the same goes for sigs.

CDI believes that this is an Israeli surplus police or military sidearm.I made some customizations/replacements myself:* Removed the magazine safety (old parts are included).* Replaced the hammer and sear with a pre-fit Cylinder & Slide kit that has the trigger pull at just about 5#, by my measure (old parts included).* Replaced and fitted the ambi-safety with a single-sided extended safety from Cylinder & Slide (old parts included).* Cut a reverse crown into the stock barrel.My local gunsmith cut the dovetails in the slide for a set of Novak front (red fiber optic) and rear (black notch) sights.Overall the pistol is in good condition. There are some dings, forging marks, and light scratches, but you can judge better from the attached pictures. The bore is bright with no corrosion and clean rifling."
