It works perfectly. It also has been shortened like the paratrooper model with a muzzle brake installed and all of the bayonet junk has been neatly removed. This makes it a fairly light and handy rifle. Everything works perfectly. Note - You loose the last-round hold-open function when you do this but most AKs notoriously do not have last round hold open either. This will group nicely with standard low-end steel cased Russian ammo. Of course it would be even better with good ammo and also an SKS will shoot more accurately than most AK47s.  BTW - At my age my eyes and iron sights are not a good thing anymore. This is an all numbers matching except the dust cover on rear which was replaced. The pictures do not show it but the receiver has 3 screw holes where a side mounted scope was installed once-upon-a-time. These holes have flush mounted screws with lock tight. Its a neat job but it is there and I don't want anyone to be surprised by this slight cosmetic issue. It comes with everything pictured. It has 2 good stocks and the black ""cheese grater"" gas tube cover works well for both. The colors of the camo in the picture did not come out true(base is coyote tan then OD green with some foliage green) but it is a nice three colors and the paracord braided sling matches it well. The camo stock has a slip on butt pad as pictured. The other stock has a pro installed slightly longer pad and comes with the standard SKS sling. These 1"" and 1""+ extensions just feel a little better as these chicomm stocks that are usually a little bit short. They both come up nice to your shoulder. This comes with a high quality case that holds everything. It also comes with the old mil surplus mag pouch pictured that has 2 more 20 round magazines in it making a total of 3 20s included in the sale. It takes 30s too of course. I just prefer 20s. It also comes with the maglula AK47 magazine loader still in package and one extra butt pad that - uh well I never liked it but you might find some use for?. I am asking $590 for all of it. Add it up. This is a great deal. I check email often. This will be available thru Saturday 5/12 only.  This will be FTF and green cash only probably in a parking lot somewhere around the 1200 N. Walton area in Bentonville. We'll work out details of a meet in email. I am pretty much getting out of 7.62x39 and for the purchaser only I will also sell a 1000r case of Wolf HP in a large Cabelas ammo can for $185.

The trigger guard and front of the grip area are checkered just the right amount to give one the control they need, but not dig into ones hand.

And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.
Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.
An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.
Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm."

The unique combination of both braking and compensating features inspire shooter confidence and allows the shooter to make very fast follow up shots. Its unique chamber geometries give it a very soft feel in the shoulder and the gas ports dimensions have been strenuously tested to give the utmost control to the muzzle.
