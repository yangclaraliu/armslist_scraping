The 1895SBL has a stainless steel barrel and receiver, and a laminate wood stock for ultimate durability against the elements. The barrel has Ballard style rifling to handle all types of bullets—cast or jacketed. The full-length magazine tube holds 6 rounds of powerful .45-70 cartridges, and an enlarged lever loop allows shooter to cycle the action with gloved hands. The Marlin 1895SBL features side ejection, which simplifies scope mounting, and the gun comes with the versatile Lever Rail that allows mounting a standard riflescope on top the receiver, or a scout-style scope mounted farther out on the barrel. For quick, close-range shooting the 1895SBL comes with an excellent XS ghost ring, rear aperture sight mounted to the rail, and a front post with white line up the center. These sights are extremely rugged and do not get knocked out of alignment easily. A Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad helps absorbs recoil from heavy .47-70 rounds, allowing shooter to stay on target for fast follow up shots. A receiver-mounted crossbolt safety effectively blocks the hammer from hitting the firing pin. Sling swivel studs allow for the attachment of a rifle sling for convenient carry in the field with the hands free. Marlin 1895SBL is a very quick-handling Lever-Action Rifle that shoots a cartridge powerful enough to knock down any species of game in North America. The 1895SBL is built to hold up to rugged use in harsh environments. Made in USA.Manufacturer model #: 70478.

With carefully considered insights from our pro-staff and veteran hunters, Benelli design engineers have spent nearly 10 years in development with a focus on three areas of critical importance to the serious waterfowler: Improved ergonomics, intuitive, flawless functionality and an updated design, style and feel for the latest in modern waterfowling reliability that’s all about the end game: Absolute superiority in the most unforgiving conditions. COMBTECH &COMFORT TECH 3 Comfort Tech™ was the first of its kind. By splitting the stock diagonally and utilizing shock-absorbing chevrons, the entire stock was essentially turned into a recoil pad. This chevron system, now 13 years old, is still the most efficient design possible, and was the basis for the SBE 3 stock. The chevron size and location has been optimized on Comfort Tech 3. Furthermore, Benelli engineers have developed a new cheek comb pad, Combtech, which greatly reduces facial impact and vibrations. EASY-LOADING SYSTEM A beveled loading port, redesigned carrier and a new two-piece carrier latch have all been incorporated into the new SBE 3 to make loading the magazine effortless INERTIA-DRIVEN SYSTEM The hallmark of Benelli strength and reliability, our clean-burning Inertia Driven System never requires adjusting, cycles consistently in conditions that border on the unfair and easily handles everything from light field loads to 3½"" magnums. From a cleanliness and speed perspective, gas systems simply cannot compete—whereas Inertia-Driven Benelli shotguns are known to fire 500,000+ rounds and still function without flaw. OVERSIZED BOLTHANDLE & SAFETY A larger bolt release and safety, along with an outward angled drop lever make the SBE 3 quicker and easier to operate–even with gloved hands."

This is a Strayer Voigt Infinity Custom Officers Model chambered in .45acp with a 3 1/2'' barrel. Strayer Voigt is a small custom company in Gordon Texas. Their pistols are made one at a time specified to the customers order. This one was made in 2015 and my consignee waited 2 years to have it built. It is new in the case with two magazines, the allen wrenches, and extra guide rod. You can still see the clear purple factory packing grease indise of the pistol and on the rails. These do not come with a manual as they are posted online. This is the first time I have handled one of these and it is impressive. The trigger is slicker than my Wilson. It has a Tiki sighting system that feaures 4 alignment points that are flush with the top of the slide. It has a match grade bull barrel. The rest of the custom features are as follows. Front and rear slide cut with 3 Xcelerator serrations, stainless steel with matte silver finish, hi capacity compact carry grip, right side magazine catch, double undercut traditional square trigger gaurd, triple Xcelerated SV hammer, extended dust cover with Xcererator flute 3 cut, wide body competition frame, titanium strut, ambidextrous tactical thumb safety, and much more. This is a fantastic custom pistol that will be great for the shooter or collector."

The 1895SBL has a stainless steel barrel and receiver, and a laminate wood stock for ultimate durability against the elements. The barrel has Ballard style rifling to handle all types of bullets—cast or jacketed. The full-length magazine tube holds 6 rounds of powerful .45-70 cartridges, and an enlarged lever loop allows shooter to cycle the action with gloved hands. The Marlin 1895SBL features side ejection, which simplifies scope mounting, and the gun comes with the versatile Lever Rail that allows mounting a standard riflescope on top the receiver, or a scout-style scope mounted farther out on the barrel. For quick, close-range shooting the 1895SBL comes with an excellent XS ghost ring, rear aperture sight mounted to the rail, and a front post with white line up the center. These sights are extremely rugged and do not get knocked out of alignment easily. A Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad helps absorbs recoil from heavy .47-70 rounds, allowing shooter to stay on target for fast follow up shots. A receiver-mounted crossbolt safety effectively blocks the hammer from hitting the firing pin. Sling swivel studs allow for the attachment of a rifle sling for convenient carry in the field with the hands free. Marlin 1895SBL is a very quick-handling Lever-Action Rifle that shoots a cartridge powerful enough to knock down any species of game in North America. The 1895SBL is built to hold up to rugged use in harsh environments.

As with the entire B-­14 Series, the Ridge Rifle brings Bergara Barrel accuracy to a line of affordably priced hunting and shooting rifles. The Ridge is built at their facility in Bergara Spain, at the same factory where all of their Bergara barrel blanks are manufactured. Like all of the Bergara B-­14 Series rifles, the Ridge features their own Bergara B-­14 Action, a Bergara barrel, and a Bergara adjustable trigger. The Bergara B-­14 Action is a two-­‐lug system with a sliding plate extractor, and a coned bolt nose and breech to ensure a smooth feeding and extraction of the cartridge. The B-­14 Action will accept standard Rem700 style bases. The barrel is made of 4140CrMo in a #5 contour. This makes it ideal for longer range big game hunting, varmint hunting, and target shooting, as well. The muzzle is threaded at 5/8x24”, so it’s ready for muzzle brake or suppressor installation. The Ridge features a molded synthetic stock made of a glass fiber reinforced polymer. Each stock is bedded with integral steel pillars for stability and enhanced accuracy. During the molding process, these solid steel pillars are inserted and permanently molded into place, providing a secure and stable bedding surface for the barreled action. The Ridge stock starts with black as the base color, with a grey flecking then applied on the top, giving the rifle a unique cosmetic appeal. It also features a SoftTouch coating to give the stock a soft, tacky feel that is easy to grip even in harsh weather.All B-­14 rifles are guaranteed capable of producing sub-­1.0 MOA groups or less at 100 yards using factory match grade ammunition.
