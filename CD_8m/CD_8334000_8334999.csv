This was my Main IDPA and USPSA gun for 2+ years, so she's no safe queen and has the small nicks and scratches you would expect. With that, shes absolutely reliable. This is a great gun for USPSA, IDPA, 3 gun, your truck, your nightstand, your breifcase, to concealcarry, to open carry, put in your car or your purse or even your cargo shorts pocket! It has a SMOOTH trigger pull and a clean single action break. When most folks switch to CZ, they never look back. 
 
I picked up a Shadow last April so this gun has turned into the safe queen she was never meant to be. She's begging to get back out and shoot, so she needs to move on. 
 
 
Comes with the original box, 3 magazines, and all original paperwork. Also comes with the following extras/upgrades: - CZ Custom Fiberoptic front sight- CZ Custom Serrated Competition Rear Sight- Cajun Gun Works Floating Trigger Pin- Cajun Gun Works Firing Pin Retaining pin.  
 
I'll even throw in a leather holster if you save us both time by avoiding lowballs and haggling. 
 
High resolution images can be emailed upon request. 
 
Trades you ask? CZ Firearms in general I like. I'm still on the hunt for a P01 Omega ( Non Suppressor) I can definetly be tempted by a Matte Stainless CZ75. If you have a CZ Czechmate, I'll add money. If you have the Czechmate Parrot I'll add my money along with my pride as I'll definitely be sleeping in the dog house. Outside of interesting CZ's  No, No other trades will be entertained. 
How Much will this well loved peice of Czech Steel set you back? $650 with everything mentioned above. You must be willing to sign a bill of sale and present your AL Drivers license. Having your CC permit is fantastic as well."

The gun has a rear adjustable sight and a orange front sight. The double and single action trigger pull is fabulous in each mode. The 3"" barrel is a hard to find version of the model 66 Pre Lock revolver and you still can eject the spent shells out 100% with no hang ups with this size ejector rod. The gun has factory wooden grips and the gun rates all of 99% in my opinion."

Bore is good and will clean up even better. The front end of the receiver and the takedown ring have been cleaned a little as seen. There is some protected blue on the receiver behind the sight mostly. Barrel and mag tube retain much more bluing than the receiver. This time frame was still noted with blueing issues on the receiver so thats probably one of the reasons for more loss.

The trap has some surface rust , but is quite sound.  A bit of black paint is in order.  The backside finish id good.  Papar targets (included) are hung in front of trap.  Cute little animal targets can be set in the trap , or anywhere else.  The trap would serve nicely in an indoor airgun range , or outdoor .22 pistol/rifle range. (Or .22 in your basement , if you have a VERY tolerant family...) New value of the trap alone is $65 + shipping.  $25 for everything.  Addendum -- The DANG picture rotated!  Here is a link to an image of a new identical trap :https://www.gricegunshop.com/out40801-outers-bullet-trap-22cal-only.html"
