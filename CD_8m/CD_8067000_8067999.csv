The firearm is practically new, I bought it Saturday and realized that I really don’t like it as I want something that really has a decent bit more kick. I’m pretty new to firearms but starting to learn that I seem to like larger calibers. It’s seen about 150 rounds through it, and has 150 rounds of Winchester FMJ 9mm that will be included. Ignore the sticker on the back in the picture, it’s no longer there was stuck on there from the manufacturer. I also have a Mossberg Plinkster .22lr that I could throw in a trade to sweeten the deal depending on what you have. That one is about 3 weeks old, seen 500 rounds and still have 500 rounds of federal to go with it as well. I’m not interested in selling either one of them for cash so please don’t email me asking for a cash price. I will trade either separate or an2 for 1 trade. I’m interested in just about anything that’s not a handgun as I’m 20 and can’t legally own one sadly. I really have a sweet spot for lever actions and bolt actions but am for sure interested in AKs/ARs etc. shoot me an offer worst I can say is no thanks."

It only ships with 1 magazine.EC9S is just like the LC9S except it comes with fixed sights. I put some of my daughter’s nail polish on the sights to make them standout. It’s a surprisingly accurate shooter, but I’ve ordered a 9mm with a laser sight.I was at Academy in Flowood the other day. I saw a guy looking at an LC9S. I told him what I always say, it’s great shooter, you won’t be disappointed. Whatever versions of the LC9S he wanted, they were out of. All I know for sure, this is a great price on a great gun. If you aren’t familiar with the LC9S / EC9S, this might help.

I have fired only 100 rounds thru this gun at the range and wanted a more accurate gun at the range than my concealed carry gun, it is certainly that.  But I decided that for the range I'd rather shoot 22 rounds that are far less expensive so I've bought a Ruger Mark IV for that purpose.  I'm not interested in any trades only a cash transaction.  Since I'm not going to shoot 9 mm at the range anymore I'm also including a sealed unopened range bucket of 350 rounds.  All this at Academy today would be over $750.
I will want to see your Texas drivers license to confirm your identity on the FFL transfer form I will require to complete this gun sale."

Gun shoots flawlessly and is in like new condition. Has Haley13 tritium night sights ($140). I have multiple holsters than will go with it as well. Leather Galco shoulder rig, hybrid inside the waistband, kydex appendix inside the waistband, kydex inside the waistband for TLR-1, kydex outside the waistband, and a kydex Blackhawk retention holster. I do have the TLR-1HL which can go with as well for the right deal. Obviously not interested in giving all of that up for a gun that cost $100+ less than a G19 even without the night sights so I’m looking for more of a package deal or cash on your end with an M&P. Make me an offer, worst I can say is no. Must have purchase permit or preferably CPL."
