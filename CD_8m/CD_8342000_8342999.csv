The gun has maybe 50-70 rounds through it. Chamber is in excellent condition and the rifle as a whole is very good. Fluted 29"" barrel. Glass is a U.S. Optics ER-25 scope with a LaRue tactical QD mount specifically made for 50 BMG rifles. It is an illuminated hashmark redicle scope with several bells and whistles and is very clear at distance. This scope is the real deal and very capable of long range shots. Rifle comes with a new 50 cal U.S. military cleaning kit, 50 BMG bore snake, bubble level mounted to the rail, and factory Pelican case.Included is a Hornady Lock-N-Load single stage 50 BMG reloading press. Includes all dies, case trimmer, case prep tool, misc. brass and AP heads, powder, primer packs, tumbler, media, neck brush w/ drill, lube, scale, brass holders, and a bunch of extras too much to list. I believe some of the brass is primed and ready for loading. Nearly everything you need to start reloading today.Also included is some reloaded ammo with load data as well as some factory ammo from American Eagle and Barrett. I would say you easily have 150 rounds at the ready to start firing. There is a mix of standard ball(with 620-700 grain rounds), Hornady A-Max 750 grain, and AP ammo.Round count(all reloads loaded to ""light"" spec specified in the Hornady loading manual):40 rounds American Eagle Ball 660 grain factory ammo10 rounds American Eagle Tracer 610 grain factory ammo15 rounds Barrett 661 grain factory ammo10 rounds Israeli military ammo22 rounds reloads using Hornady A-Max 750 grain bullet and H50 BMG powder10 rounds reloads using Hornady A-Max 750 grain bullet and 869 powder15 rounds reloads using 680 grain black-tip AP bullet and H50 BMG powder30 rounds reloads using M2 pulled bullets of varying weight and HG50 BMG powderI am open to partial firearms trades + cash but would prefer straight cash. My rifle is a high quality piece so your offering should be equal in quality. I'm not exactly sure what I want at this time so don't ask me what I am looking for in a trade. Send all trade offers in text or email. I am in zero rush and not desperate to sell in any way so all lowball offers will be ignored.Trades are limited in the following ways: No trap guns No hunting guns No cowboy action guns No black powder guns No wildcat caliber guns No non-firearms related trades No services  For now, this will be a package deal but I may consider keeping the scope and mount if its truly a deal breaker in the future. This is a fantastic turn-key setup if you want to get into 50 BMG and/or extreme range shooting. All legitimate questions about the rifle are welcome. PPI on your dime at Alaska Custom Firearms is also welcome. Text or email is much preferred to phone conversation. I also have much more pics to give upon request."

I know what it's worth. :) Anyway, I've owned Browning, Remington, Weatherby, Mossberg, Winchester, Armalite and just about every American made firearm you can name, but I've not been more impressed with a firearm more than this ATA.  It's a solid gun.  Did I mention, I hate to sell it?!  So, the first good and REASONABLE offer I get for this gun, gets it.  I'm selling for $349 (OBO).   A new one at Academy is $449.00 PLUS tax, which would cost you a total of $486.04.  You're already saving over $111.00.  All reasonable offers considered. Thanks,Ryan8zero1 - eight22 - two5fourtwo"

This was given to me years ago and I used it as my hike and camp sidearm.  No better weapon to have the .41 Magnum.  Due to injuries, I can no longer enjoy the outdoors as I once did.  Because of that, this beautifully thought out and crafted tool has not been used in a long time.  Total rounds down the pipe since 1986 is less than 500. If you have a 357 you will want this.  The recoil is the same and hits just about as hard as the overhyped 44MAG.  I also have 100 or more target rounds and another 80 or so of semi-wad cutters in 230g-250g range and some super fast defense 170g-210g HP rounds. If you want to package those up with this offering we can work something out.  I also have maybe 150 cases you can have as well if you reload.  I hate to see this go, but its time to pass her to somebody who appreciates a POWERFUL sic shooter."

It's in as-new shape (at least, for Soviet wartime production) with all numbers matching. The only cosmetic issues are some slight nicks and scratches from being handled over the last 75 years; overall, it's in beautiful shape, especially considering its purpose and history. This model was manufactured at the Izhevsk Arsenal with the shorter, 20-1/4"" barrel, without bayonet. This one was apparently arsenal refurbished after the war, as it has the counterbored muzzle which all of the refurbished rifles do. This particular model was only issued to second-line troops like combat engineers and such, and from its condition, probably saw no action. The fact that it was counterbored by the arsenal after the war means little, they did that to the vast majority of their rifles whether it was necessary or not. The bore of this gun is practically perfect, clean with well-defined rifling and no pitting or rust. If it was ever fired - particularly with the corrosive-primed Soviet military ammo - someone took great care to clean and preserve it. It's in exceptional shape.These M38's are the model you want if you're looking to make a sporter out of a Mosin and prefer the shorter barrel. The more common M91/30's have much longer barrels, and the M44 carbines all have a permanently affixed bayonet lug that has to be cut off or otherwise removed to fit a sporter-type stock. The nice thing about the M38 is, you can make most of the modifications necessary to turn it into a sporter while still preserving the ability to restore it to its original configuration.This rifle comes with the attached sling and cleaning rod, as well as 50 rounds of 7.62x54R ammunition. The ammo is the corrosive-primed Soviet standard issue, straight out of one of those metal ""tuna can"" ammo packs. The box you see in the photo originally belonged to a computer battery (I think), but it fits the ammo well and allows for safe storage (there's more ammo beneath the layer visible in the photo).I could only upload one photo for this listing, but I have many more high-resolution photos that I'd be happy to share upon request. This is an excellent example of a Mosin Nagant carbine, and if your'e looking for one of these you'll be very happy with it.This sale will be cash only. Local pickup only - no shipping."

Bought new in early 2014. This is one of the early L9-A1's that came into the US. Identical in every way, mechanically, to the M9-A1, except for the extra .5"" of barrel and frame. Likely has about 1200 rounds or so through the gun. The sights are a triangle-in-trapezoid configuration rather than a traditional 3-dot (replacements are vailable) that takes some getting used to, but work well. Grip angle is a little farther back than a Glock, which brings down the already very low bore axis. This is a very soft-shooting 9mm. It has had cycling issues with remanufactured RBS ammo, but has not had any problems with factory Federal or Winchester 115gr FMJ. I suspect the RBS isn't loaded quite as hot.No trades. New projects on the to-do list, this is on the chopping block to make room and free up funds. Gun will come with factory goodies, case, and three 17-rd magazines."
