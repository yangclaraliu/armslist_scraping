These are somewhat rare..... made for a handful of years in the early to mid 60's. The 256wm is a screamer.... it is necked down 357 mag so cases are easily made/available. This has the shortest stroke of any lever action Ive ever encountered. The blueing is worn and there is a old repaired crack in the stock (pictured) but never caused problem or issue. I will include 45 rounds of factory 256wm ammo in the sale as well. Asking $525. I live in Anderson and work on Indys westside for FTF sale.... and I will need to see a Indiana drivers license and would also like to see a LTCH as well with nothing recorded. THANKS"

The Steyr C-A1 striker-fired pistol is a compact, semi-automatic, double-action handgun available as the C9-A1 chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum (17-rounds) or the C40-A1 chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson (12-rounds).
The C-A1 is somewhat of a hybrid, combining the compact length of the Steyr S-A1 pistol with the full-size grip of the Steyr M-A1 pistol. The barrel of the C-A1 is 3.6” (92mm) long and provides a platform that is ideal for self-defense carry by offering a short overall weapon length while ensuring optimal grip control. An integrated Picatinny rail allows for simple mounting of a laser or light and slide-racking grooves on the back of the slide allow for a firm grip when manually operating the action."

he Steyr Pro THB offers a modern compliment to other traditional platforms. A durable synthetic stock resists weather and rough use and features removable spacers in the butt of the stock to adjust length of pull.
The Pro THB’s heavy barrel is available in 26"" with Mannox finish, and the rifle is chambered in 6.5 Creedmoor. The barrel comes with 5/8x24 right-hand thread and has a tactical bolt knob. The standard heavy barrel comes with a 20MOA picatinny rail, but a long picatinny rail is also available.
As in other high-performance long-guns offered by Steyr, the Pro THB features the Safe Bolt System (SBS), a unique 2+1 safety function that offers 3 settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The fire mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot; the first level of safe mode disables the firing mechanism and the second level of safe serves to lock the bolt down against the stock and also features a press-to-release tab that locks the SBS switch in the safe position.
Another feature is the 2-stage magazine securing mechanism that uses a first stage that locks the magazine in but allows the bolt to be operated while not engaging and chambering the rounds in the magazine, thereby providing the operator with the option of loading individual rounds by hand while maintaining a full magazine at the ready. One more tap to the bottom of the magazine then seats it in the second stage, which is ready for auto-loading."

Pick up is at the Madison Justice Complex (aka the Madison police department) public parking lot.Pick up is at the Madison Justice Complex (aka the Madison police department) public parking lot.No one seems to want the upper by itself, so I am going to list the gun complete the way that I bought it. 100% the way the OEM shipped it to me. This is a complete AR15 chambered in 7.62x39 rifle. I have another Radical Firearm upper 7.62x39 just like this, but in a pistol length that I am keeping… and I’m okay with keeping this one as well, but if you want it, you can buy it.So why 7.62x39? You get to shoot the somewhat equivalent of 300 blackout cheaper than you can shoot 223 / 5.56 or thereabouts…. As long as you aren’t trying to use a suppressor and shooting subsonic rounds, you will love this gun. And you get to shoot it in an AR15 platform that was made for optics. I’ve shot it about 60 times. It comes with the ASC magazine that came with the rifle. I have also used CPD mags in this rifle and my other Radical Firearms 7.62x39 upper.  When I went to sight in my scope on this upper, it came loose during a mag dump test to make sure it would cycle properly , so there are some marks on the upper receiver. This Radical Firearms 16” 7.62x39mm HBAR Rifle is based around their law enforcement grade upper receiver. Radical Firearms/Primary Arms Exclusive M-LOK Handguard, this MIL-SPEC upper is an outstanding choice for any budget. Just add your favorite sights or optic, then head for the range!The Radical Firearms/Primary Arms Exclusive M-LOK Handguard. Crafted from 6063-T6 aluminum and hardcoat anodized a deep black, this tough, durable rail offer a slim, modular profile. Large cooling holes along the rail reduce weight and aid in rapid cooling. Take advantage of M-LOK positions along the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock of the rail for all your favorite gear. An uninterrupted M1913 Picatinny top rail offers space to mount optics, sights, and other accessories with ease.Features:16"" 41V50 chrome moly vanadium steel HBAR barrelChambered in 7.62x39mm with 1:10 twist rate7.62x39mm bolt carrier group with nitrided finishBCG high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspectedStandard charging handle5/8x24 A2 flash hider15"" free float Radical Firearms/ Primary Arms Exclusive M-LOK RailBarrel Contour HBARBarrel Length16Barrel Lining Salt Bath NitrideBarrel Material41V50 Chrome Moly Vanadium SteelCaliber Gauge7.62X39mmGas System Length CarbineGas System Type Direct ImpingementHandguard15 in Primary Arms Exclusive M-LOK RailMuzzle DeviceA2 Flash HiderThread Pattern5/8 X 24Twist Rate1:10You must have a Mississippi driver’s license to buy this complete firearm.

The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case."

Both mags are packed with quality .45 rounds. I never got around to shooting it and now am glad i kept it new. this is a great price and thd only reason i am willing to take a loss is because i bid on an expensive guitar i want and need the funds. As we all know, a rifle with mags like this will increase in value and very possibly become scarce and grandfathered in if we have a democrat for president in the future. I will hate myself but will use a guitar more than a gun. Anyway, i paid 1400.00 not including shipping and ffl transfer fee. If u are from maine i need a drivers license. i am the original owner and only owner. Sorry for the lousy pics. youtube has many good videos of this nice quality made rifle. Great chance to get a tommy gun and save a few hundred dollars! Dont wait, if i dont pay for my auction in a few days, i lose out and will remove the ad. no trades please. tom. price is firm."

May also be interested in an SKS, but I need to look a bit more into the current going rate before I say how that trade would go. Any milsurp firearms, accessories, and parts will automatically have my interest. Though I am not just limited to that. I also have a ukranian made Strela flash suppressor. May be willing to part with that as well. The one I have is for the 7.62x39 ak 47 or AKM with 14-1 LH threaded muzzle. I would probably be willing to take $60 cash for it. I paid $75. Never used. Handguards and flash suppressor purchased from legion usa.  I also have three or four croatian magazines I may throw in. They do not fit well with my AK.  ALG lightning bow trigger is up for trade as well. Bought it with the intentions of throwing it in the same tacticool build I wanted the zenitco handguard and strela flash hider for. Ended up going a different direction with it. I may be willing to part with it for around $50 by its self.
