Began life as a virgin receiver, and has only ever been built into a pistol. Built out of all brand new parts by a professional US Army armorer. Has a 7.5” barrel with a 1:7 twist rate. Barrels with this faster twist rate are MUCH better at stabilizing heavier subsonic rounds, usually hard to find and extra expensive if you do. Measures 23.25” from muzzle device to end of buffer tube, and just 9” from the bottom of a standard 30-round PMAG to the top of the receiver, very compact - would make an excellent suppressor host. Barrel has never had a round through it, the entire firearm is brand new, never fired. Basically ended up building the same gun my wife bought as a surprise and we don’t need two guns so similar. Just trying to recover my expenses (excluding shipping and taxes) that I’ve got invested in this thing, and pretty much everything was bought with coupon codes, or on sale. Slightly flexible on price, not trying to make any money off this thing, just want to break even or at least minimize my loss. Willing to consider trades or partial trades, but primarily looking for $575 cash. Search the web for another brand new similarly configured AR pistol and you won’t find a deal like this. If you have a valid Georgia Weapons Carry License or military ID we can just do a bill of sale, otherwise I’d prefer we did the transfer at an FFL and I’ll cover that cost. If interested, email me through the link here, I check email constantly."

This gun is a great shooter and has never failed me, even with cheap steel cased ammo. Very accurate shooter and the bore is in pristine condition. 
Cosmetically, I would say the bluing is still around 85-90%. There are signs of wear here and there but overall the gun is still very shiny after a wipedown. All the laser etched arsenal markings are visible. Gun has always been kept clean.
I have swapped out the flimsy original rear adjustable sights for a set of fixed aluminum contrast sights from GunPartsWarehouse.com and it is sleek looking and awesome as far as accuracy. Even better than the military sights IMO. Threads are secured with blue loctite. The original sights are included as well.
 
Comes with:
IWB kydex holster & Uncle Mike's soft holster
5 eight round magazines. Three of them are Bulgarian and two are East German (380acp Makarovs use the same original 9x18 Makarov magazines)
 
Asking $300 cash only. No trades. No shipping. Price is FIRM and lower offers will be ignored as I don't need to sell this gun. I am available to meet weekday evenings after 5:30pm around Saint Paul (Midway area) or weekday mornings by schedule.

It comes with 5 mags, 2 of which are aftermarket and each mag holds 8 rounds. Also, you'll have a milsurp holster to go with it and at least 50 rounds of PPU ammo. The pistol looks hardly used, if at all as I personally have not shot it and do not believe it ever was as the barrel is in great condition. This is an older firearm, and as always be sure to thoroughly examine the pistol and use proper handling when firing... but that aside, you'll have the safety, fire and decocker functions. I have owned many of these pistols enough to say they are a lot of fun to target practice with. The only issue I know for them to have is when firing milsurp ammo, otherwise newly manufactured ammo runs great in them.If you are interested, feel free to text me (Eric) at 484-264-9160. I will only meet at any local FFL/gunstore in the area to do the transfer which you will pay the fee for. You must be 21 years of age or older, and you must be a legal U.S. citizen, no exceptions!"

I have kept these revolvers in just about every truck and SUV I own and have them loaded with rat shot because of the sheer number of rattlesnakes I encounter this time of year. The 38’s do a pretty good job on snakes but the .22’s are no match for the big western diamondbacks on my ranch and that’s why I’m looking to upgrade these to the Judge. No two ways about it - the Judge loaded with .410 #7 or #8 shot is just bad medicine for ol’ sneaky snake. These are not pretty guns. These are used for snake defense and get banged around inside my feed trucks and SUV’s, but they are functional and reliable.I have a few more pics of these items so just text me if you want to see something in particular.The prices are listed but if you want to do the dance, I’m up for a little good-natured negotiating but please - no beat downs LOL! Also I’m open to trading for the 2” barrel stainless steel Public Defender.To sweeten the deal (and help my position as well!), every buyer will receive permission for a one day rattlesnake hunt on my property located just south of Roosevelt. However, I assume no responsibility if you get bit!This listing will be updated if and when an item sells.Here they are. Ya’ll come and get ‘em!

New, never used.
Made by KCI (South Korea) and a quality replacement magazine for a Glock. These drop-free magazines have a hardened steel insert which is encased in a high tech polymer (fully metal lined). The polymer coating protects the gun magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from great heights.
Features:  -  Constructed from steel and polymer just like factory Glock mags.  -  Compatible with Glock 9mm pistols:  Glock 17, 18, 19, 26 & 34 models and other gun models using these magazines  -  Viewing holes to reveal how many rounds are left  -  Compatible with Glock Gen 1,2,3,4,5  9mm models
These quality replacement magazines for a Glock are constructed from steel and polymer just like the factory Glock mags. Each will work with all generations of Glock's including those with ambidextrous magazine releases & can be rebuilt using factory magazine parts.
Note: these have an extremely stiff spring from the factory. It may not be possible to initially load them to capacity.  Load half capacity and leave it loaded overnight, this will ease future loadings.

The Super Jagare is a single-stack 1911 with an ambidextrous thumb safety and an oversize beavertail grip safety. It comes with a long, 6-inch ported barrel and a Leupold DeltaPoint Pro reflex sight affixed to the rear of the slide. Six-inch barrels are pretty standard on hunting semi-auto pistols. They generate a bit more bullet velocity and help reduce felt recoil and muzzle flip. The porting on the Super Jagare does even more to tame the 10mm’s recoil, though at the cost of additional muzzle blast and noise.
