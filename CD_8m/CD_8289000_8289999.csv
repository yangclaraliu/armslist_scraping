181,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8289181,"For Sale:  DOUBLE BARREL, authentic, muzzle-loading SHOTGUN with DAMASCUS barrels","Monmouth, Oregon, Salem, Oregon",$ 600,"Listed On: Friday, April 27, 2018",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"A family member passed this shotgun onto me in 1962, 56 years ago. My heirs won't know what to do with it, so I must sell it. It is all original. Contact me for more photos. It looks to be 12 gauge but Alcan made me 2 boxes (500 each) of 14 gauge wads that fit easily, enough to hold down powder and shot nicely. A 12 gauge wad jams in tightly in my opinion, deforming on the edges of a card-wad.
Locks are good & solid with hammers locking in definite, positive, solid clicks; box springs; stored in low humidity so the wood is absolutely solid; twisted Damascus 30"" barrels, on top of the rib is stamped ""F I N E    T W I S T""; under one barrel is stamped an ""H"" and "" V I"" under the other barrel. There is a tiny cartouche near the breechblock with an ""F"" ""L"" and ""G"" inside and the proof mark is symbolic. Top of the right barrel 8.5"" from the muzzle, someone applied a spot of silver solder and polished it smooth. The inside of the barrel does not show this spot. Ramrod is solid with a very nice, reversible worm (corkscrew) on the end.
I cannot find a manufacturer name on it. In the late 1970's a supposed expert told me to tie it to an old tire and fire a double-charge out of it, which I did, but doing so broke the pistol grip, which I stuck back together with grey, industrial grade epoxy. In the photos one can see a line where some of the grey epoxy oozed out. The fix is very solid, but someone with young, steady hands needs to clean this line with a dental drill or dental tools. I fired it one time after that at some clay birds at a muzzle loading event and it won the event."

Comes with everything pictured as follows: One 10-round magazine, two 13-round magazines with Pearce base plates, two 15-round glock 19 magazines each with an X-Grip extension, two original base plates to convert the 13 round mags back to 10 rounds with relative ease, 4 original replacement backstraps, one extra Glock OEM recoil spring assembly, one extra +2 Pearce base plate, and original box and papers of course. I am only interested in selling all as one package just to unload my glock accessories. It is fairly difficult to sell this stuff, but It's all very useful if you own the gun. The gun is very lightly used with less than 300 rounds through it, but I have had some failures to feed and stovepipes using Blazer 115 grain recently. No malfunctions using Gold Dot 124 grain +p, but I can't afford to extensively test it using defensive ammo. I am sure any problem could be resolved easily by a competent gunsmith or Glock if it continues. Just want to be as thorough as possible here. I've never sold a gun to a private party before, so I would be most comfortable doing it at an FFL and prefer cash. Any FFL within about 80 miles of Newport, ME would be fine by me. Call or Text REDACTED any time to arrange a sale. Thanks for looking."

The jacketed, frangible projectile uses a copper/polymer composite core by coming apart upon impact with hard surfaces, even at oblique angles. It is designed specifically to prevent large fragments from coming back at the shooter when used against hardened targets. The MK255 specification calls for accuracy in the sub-2-MOA neighborhood but is often consistently under .75 MOA. This is a perfect choice for use as a defensive load in places where over-penetration or ricochet are concerns.Please do your research before making an offer.

LOL  Overall, I would say excellent condition and has a low round count, very clean.  Very handy pistol caliber carbine for home defense, to keep in your vehicle or even use for light short distance hunting as the 16"" barrel gets you 200-300fps more, depending on the load, which equals a lot more energy on your target.  Perfect addition if you have one of the Ruger pistols that use the same mags.  These were produced from 1997-2006, this is a '99 model.
$700 in cash.  Did a quick check and most of the current listings I found on GB and others are going from $700-$800, some higher, so price is firm at this time. Will trade for a clean basic model Sig P938 and $200 or another Chiappa Pak 9 with folding brace, extras, if just the pistol, I'll need $250 cash with it.Not interested in other trades, unless it's a worthwhile offer.  On trades, let me know what you have and EXACTLY what the deal is up front and I'll get back to you either way. Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX and have valid ID.Thanks for looking!"

No malfunctions using Gold Dot 124 grain +p, but I can't afford to extensively test it using defensive ammo. Might just be a magazine issue. Just want to be as thorough as possible here. Only selling the gun because I have other guns and could use the money. I've never sold a gun to a private party before, so I would be most comfortable doing it at an FFL and prefer cash.

I have no idea how parking and all that is going to go so we won't know when and where we can meet really until we've been there awhile I suppose. I'll probably just have the case and gun with me, but may leave it in my car's safe, won't know until I show up and see how crazy the parking is.I know there in big demand right now and was planning on having one with an aftermarket laser on it eventually and leave the other one stock. BUT since that is probably 9 to 12 months away, thought I'd offer this up to someone who could use it right away with warmer weather coming up. I currently have a Harry's Holster and it IS very comfortable for Appendix carry. Well I think my M&P M2.0 9 Compact is too (also AIWB), it's just smaller and less noticeable with shorts.__IF__ really needed I also have Two extra 12 round magazine for it, but I'd like to keep the other one since I do carry it. But my M&P9C M2.0 is also very nice and not too big of a deal to carry that for 7-21 days to order some more 12 rounders. Have other pocket pistols too if needed, so I'd be ok, but the 12 round ones ARE very nice.However those are going to be $55 each as I just ordered a fair amount of magazines from a vendor and don't need anymore so I won't save any money on shipping charges just replacing those two 12 round ones.MUST have Valid MN: Purchase Permit or Ideally PCP (CCW).

It features a three position selector that allows the user to switch from Mode 1 for Safe, Mode 2 for traditional Semiautomatic Mode, or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode, the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by simply moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Features: – Easy to installation. No custom fitting. – Better trigger pull. 4.5 pounds, +-.5 pound – The release phase now has a positive reset. – The design eliminates backup disconnector. – Stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. Specifications: – Works in every AR application: Ar10, AR15, MPX, etc. – Works in the F17 series in .17 WSM WITHOUT modification. – Works on .22LR uppers WITHOUT modification. – Works on 9mm uppers WITHOUT modification.

These Soviet Sniper Scopes are the last remaining items in the Russian Armory System (not still mounted to the rifles currently). The side rail is not included with the scope because it typically remained attached to the rifle after the scope was removed for storage purposes.
 
The scope comes with the original PU Mosin-Nagant Side Mount (Kochetov mount)  This scope is in excellent condition, especially when you consider its age and what it has seen along its journey. I think the exceptionally clear optics are simply amazing and one of its most sought-after features. Accompanying it when purchased is the original scope bag and the original leather lens covers as well. To wrap things up, the finish has maintained itself extremely well after all these years preserving the rich black color that makes this scope visually stunning."
