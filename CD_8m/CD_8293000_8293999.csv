Very nice trigger feel.  Comes with original box, instruction manual, and I even have the test fire target from the factory (in German, no less!).  Comes with 2 hi-capacity magazines. The price on new Sigs these days is crazy---most 226's are going for $900+, some up to $1400 depending on the model.  I am asking $540 for this one.  If you want to work a deal, I also have 3 metal, hi-capacity magazines (2 of which are factory original), in addition to the 2 that the pistol comes with.  Sig factory mags are selling for $40+ each, but depending on whether a buyer wants to negotiate the pistol price, I would gladly cut a deal on the mags.  So potentially, a buyer could walk away with a Sig 226 and 5 hi-capacity magazines for hundreds of dollars less than the cost of a base model new Sig.

In any event, it went somewhere because there’s a CAI re-import mark on the frame between the trigger and cylinder. Those grips are plastic.Bottom gun is a Model 15-3. I believe those grips are numbered to the gun, if that matters to you let me know and I’ll confirm.Best place to meet for me is Cabela's or somewhere to the west of there.  Prefer the recipient have a AZ CCW."

The Romanian receiver is dated 1988 but this rifle was purchased new in 2015 and in total there's been about 1,000 rounds put through it without a single malfunction. I have it equipped with a VLTOR buffer tube stock adapter, Magpul CTR telescoping stock, Magpul MOE Grip, LHV47 railed handguard and Tapco AK74 muzzle brake. However, it does come with all the original furniture too, including the slant brake and the older, better quality wood (New WASRs come with chunky blonde wood.) On top of all that, I've included another AK74 style lower handguard and NINE mags (3x30rd Magpul PMAG Gen2, 3x30rd Magpul PMAG Gen 3, 1x20rd Magpul PMAG, 1x30rd Tapco Bakelite mag, and original 30 rd Romanian steel mag, all in working order.)
So again, in this package you get:
-WASR 10/63 AKM with all original parts and furniture-VLTOR buffer tube stock adapter-Magpul CTR telescoping stock-Magpul MOE AK pistol grip-LHV47 railed handguard-US made AK74 handguard-Tapco AK74 muzzle brake-9 additional mags
The rifle is very fun to shoot and is pretty accurate too. No canting whatsoever. There's a little mag wobble with steel mags, but it doesn't affect reliability at all and any polymer/bakelite mags will fit nice and snug. It has a chrome lined barrel with no signs of wear on the rifling. The rifle also has a bayonet lug and threaded barrel. It's a great option for an entry level AK and with surplus parts, it can also be a tasteful collection piece. I'm selling it because I'm thinning out my collection and want to put the money toward other guns. All together, the rifle and the extras are $900-$1,000 in value, so I'm pretty firm on the $750 price because I honestly think it's a great deal as is.
Please feel free to email me if you're interested. As long as the listing is still up, this deal is still available."

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.   HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.   The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.   The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.   Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.   A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength.   The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.   The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.   The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.   HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.   The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.   VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.   Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. New for 2016 are Flat Dark Earth (FDE) models, VPs with special colorants added to the frame during the molding process creating the tan/brown color scheme increasing used by military and security units. The frame’s color is indestructible, permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change."

The rifle comes with forty plus aluminum magazines of varying conditions. All magazines are surplus, many of which are fifty plus years old, though look new. The rifle itself has been fired with (40x) rounds of Wolf steel cased ammo, (260x) rounds Malaysian surplus, & (800x) rounds of German DAG plastic ammo. These early rifles were built using both surplus and US made parts. Currently the rifles bolt gap is at .010"" or .254mm. For 922r compliance the US made parts are Wilson Combat barrel ten flute 16"" variant (15x1RH Thread), JLD hammer, JLD cocking handle, JLD receiver (A3xxx), G3K extended length M-Lok, JLD 2004 dated bolt head, & semi-auto sear. This rifle also comes with the converted metal lower, Magpul angled foregrip, German SG1 stock w/ G3 buffer, and Gander Mountain two-gun transport case. There is heavy finish damage from the midpoint of the underside of the barrel and mild finish damage around the trunnion; this occurred from excessive heat to the surplus wide forearm which melted to the rifle. Aside from the aesthetic damage, the rifle functions and fires flawlessly. To consider also is the FMP bolt carrier had been milled for semi-auto capabilities strictly. You will notice the difference in color between the forearm and grip, that had been unintentional at purchase whereby the stock images were not as representative of the purchased product. As for the case, it could use a new foam insert for the midsection as I had cut it to match several stock and forearm types; it still holds the rifle firmly in place and is lightly used. I also have another (640x) rounds of Malaysian ammo in their still sealed tins that can be added for another $200. Feel free to check my other listing as I would be happy to work something out for a multi-item purchase.If there is anything else you'd like to know about the rifle please do not hesitate to ask.Additional images will be delivered upon request, just ask for specific points of interest. I commonly answer e-mails between 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM Monday thru Friday, and 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM Saturday thru Sunday."

Some of you want almost new prices.....Everyone wants a fair price but when u list a firearm that lists for 1000 and you want 975 for it USED your insane. Glocks....guys please do some homework your glock isn't worth NEW prices used or is it equal in value to a 1911 other then some rock island crap or Taurus. Gotta love the hey I'll give you a Glock 17 for that 1200 Kimber email. Also research what a weapon is priced at. Just because you got hosed buying it from Cabellas or insert big box name doesn't mean that's what it's worth. There is a difference. Just because you over paid by $ 100-150 doesn't mean you pass that on to the next guy.

The stock is considered a precision Rifle/Sniper stock. The stock includes an adjustable length of pull and an adjustable cheek rest for customization to the operator's requirements. The adjustments are achieved via rotating dials that incrementally move the butt plate and cheek rest respectively back and forth or up and down. The stock features a rubber recoil pad with an aluminum core for reduced fatigue and stainless steel adjustment shafts for corrosion resistance. Molded from nylon reinforced polymer, the stock includes an adapter for sling mounting. It also comes stocked with a Heckler & Koch PSG1 style pistol grip. The grip is a target-type grip which contains an adjustable palm shelf. A hex bolt rather than a rotating dial tightens or loosens the palm shelf. Loosening the bolt allows for the palm rest to move up and down to accommodate the shooters hand size. Tightening the bolt locks the rest into a set position that is now customized to the shooters hand size"
