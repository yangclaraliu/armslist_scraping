The matching 6 pocket pants are XL as well, with take-ups on the waist. I'm snitch under 5'10"" and 186# and the jacket and pants are a generous fit - purposely to layer up underneath for cold weather. I normally buy 36""-30"" pants and these might fall down by themselves without a belt or suspenders (the waist has buttons attached for suspenders). I had the pants shortened and they're still almost an inch to long and there looks to be about 2"" left in the hems to lengthen if needed.Also included is a pair of lightweight cotton gloves, and a lightweight face mask type head cover, a Ricky Fowler type wide brim ball cap, and a heavy fleece beanie. $140 shipped and if you're not happy with it, just return everything and I'll refund your money minus any Paypal and original shipping cost.

This all-purpose flashlight is designed for the broadest range of lighting needs at the best value. The Streamlight Stinger DS LED is a rechargeable flashlight with a super-bright C4 LED that triples the brightness of a regular LED. The combination of durable and water-resistant materials for use in extreme conditions with the option of three different levels of intensity, make the rugged and compact Stinger DS LED flashlight ideal for use in law enforcement, the outdoors, security, fire and rescue, hardware/tool, automotive, industrial, the home, and more. Dual-switch technology with multiple lighting modes provides for easy single-handed operation. Designed for long life and tested at one million actuations, the multi-function, on/off push-button switches are located at the head and tail cap. Convenient and easy to use, each switch independently clicks through 3 microprocessor controlled intensity light modes, and strobe mode. Compact and extremely powerful, the Stinger DS LED rechargeable flashlight offers the latest in power LED technology.
 
Bright and Powerful LED
The Stinger DS LED Flashlight features a powerful LED that provides bright, long-lasting light. An LED is ideal for lights that are used often and over an extended period of time. You don't have to worry about breaking the light, since there is no glass or filament, and you rarely have to replace LEDs because they can last a lifetime. Save time and money on batteries as well, because they will last much longer with an LED than with a regular light bulb. The C4 LED is impervious to shock and has a 50,000-hour lifetime. With optimized electronics that provide regulated intensity, C4 technology provides powerful illumination. C4 Photonic Crystal technology almost triples the brightness and creates an intense beam that pierces darkness. Its specially engineered deep-dish parabolic reflector produces a tight beam with optimum peripheral illumination to aid in navigation.
 
Three Light Modes and Strobe
Streamlight’s Stinger DS LED Flashlight provides three lighting modes (high beam, medium beam, low beam) and a strobe: “High” for a bright super-bright beam, featuring 350 lumens, 24,000 candela peak beam intensity, 310-meter beam distance, and a run time of 2-hours. “Medium” for bright light and longer run times, featuring 175 lumens, 12,000 candela peak beam intensity, 219-meter beam distance, and a run time of 3.75-hours. “Low” for light without glare and extended run times, featuring 85 lumens, 6,000 candela peak beam intensity, 155-meter beam distance, and a run time of 7.25-hours. The strobe, for disorienting or signaling your location, runs 5.5-hours.
 
Durable Construction for Extended Use
Durably constructed for use in extreme conditions, the Stinger DS LED Flashlight is crafted from solid, 6000 series machined aircraft-grade aluminum. It is IPX4 water-resistant and 1-meter impact resistance tested, and features a nonslip, rubberized grip for increased comfort. Its unbreakable and scratch-resistant polycarbonate lens is o-ring sealed.
 
Dimensions and Weight
Weighing 12.8-ounces, the Streamlight Stinger DS LED Flashlight is 8.85-inches long, with a 1.17-inch body diameter, and a 1.62-inch head diameter.
 
 
Battery and Charging
The rechargeable three-cell, 3.6-volt sub-C nickel-cadmium battery (included with purchase) saves you time and money and can be recharged up to 1,000 times (charger included). It will steady charge in ten hours, or in two and a half hours on an optional fast, or PiggyBack, charger.
