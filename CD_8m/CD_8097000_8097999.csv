REDACTED LOCAL PICK UP
These sights fit the following Glocks Glock 17,19,26,34 22,23,27,35 all of the 9mm and .40 cal models but the 43 single stack
Trijicon HD yellow front sight .245 High 2017 brand new ( 98$ off optics planet )
10-8 rear Sight with .156 notch rear uninstalled brand new (60 $ shipped from 10-8 )
 
These are basically Trijicon HD's but with no tritium in the rear and in my opinion a carry friendly rear sight The HD's rear are RAZOR sharp and will cut you if you carry on the hip or appendix i've learned that the hard way after owning two different sets there are tons of pistol forums you can find about people complaining about HD's rear sight and reccomending this 10-8 set up
 
I have two weeks to return these but they are from seperate companys and I have to ship back both on my dime figured i'd try and put them on armslist and see if Ii can just sell both at once
I am selling them because I sold My 9mm Glocks"

There's a couple thousand in circulation but collectors will snatch them up quick. It's proofed to 130% in Austria for use by the Iraqi Army being trained by the US forces. It has special proof marks otherwise it's identical to American Glocks. These became surplus guns and sent back here. I have Talon grips on it. About 200 rounds fired by me. It was produced February 2007. I carry it occasionally but I use it predominantly as my nightstand gun. It has the Austrian Coat of Arms & was manufactured and proofed in Furloch Austria. The serial # gave that information. Glock Symra Georgia is is stamped under the trigger guard. Interesting to some. Others probably don’t give a crap. Nonetheless, I’ve had her and admired the cool factor. Shot it a little. Even carried it. It’s pure Glock, ready to work.So I’m looking for something unique maybe or even something not unique. Whatcha got to trade? I don’t need your money. Therefore Im trading. Different things are worth different things to those who want them. I’m thinking $550 is fair. Email or text REDACTED*google “Austrian proofed Glocks”*"

A sharper break has been achieved by polishing the engagement surfaces and coating the trigger with an electroless Nickel plating that provides a significant enhancement to surface hardness, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. The hammer, disconnector, and pins have been treated with Nickel Teflon for reduced friction and good wear resistance, with the trigger treated with Nickel Boron the harder surface and greater wear resistance. Like the QMS, the ACT has been designed to remain as close to the standard MIL-SPEC trigger as possible, maintaining a trigger pull that is not lighter than M4/M16 minimum spec of 5.5 lbs.https://www.spicetac.com/products/alg-defense-combat-trigger-actSee all AR15 parts here: AR15 Parts"
