It’s the lever that lets you take the slide off of the frame. I have an older W. German P228. The lever on it is pitted and the texturing is completely deformed. Fully functional, but cosmetically, it has seen better days. Looking for an exact replacement. I know that this is a common SIG Sauer part, but the newer style ones are MIM and all have a raised edge as far as I know, which I am not a fan of. Would like to keep the factory look on my gun anyway. So if you have a German takedown lever, let me know. The picture I’ll include is the best descriptor. I do not care if it is used, but it must be fully 100% functional and in excellent cosmetic condition. As far as I know, the one on the P228 is the same as the other West German P-series guns like the P220 and P226, so if you have one from one of those guns, let me know!

Chambered for the 7.62x39mm, this rifle has a 16-1/4"" chrome lined barrel with threaded muzzle brake and bayonet lug. The Chinese AK's are highly respected and are among the best available but thanks to the Clinton era import ban, they have been getting harder and harder to come by. The thicker 1.5mm stamped receivers are more durable than many of the 1mm thick Eastern block rifles, and the Chinese guns really are built to last. This rifle is in excellent original condition and I'd grade it about 99% overall. There is no rust or pitting. The stocks are in excellent condition with just a few tiny handling marks (these rifles seemed to ship new with a few handling marks). This rifle was a relatively early Sile import and has a blued bolt and the /66\ arsenal marking on the left side of the trunnion. The serial numbered parts are all properly matching, including the bayonet! The mechanics are in perfect working order (AK's are good for that!) and the bore is excellent. Internal inspection confirms that this rifle is absolutely unfired since it left the factory! It comes in the original box that numbers to the gun and includes all three 30-round mags, cleaning rod, bayonet with scabbard, sling (still sealed in plastic), buttstock cleaning kit, port cleaning tool, oil bottle, and owner's manual. They just don't get any better!I CAN BE REACHED DIRECTLY VIA      REDACTED"

SKU 91735 if like to look up for yourself, a notch above the standard accu shadow. This is an amazing gun, laser accurate.  Gun has been cleaned after every use, and low round count. Used briefly for Uspsa production, until got my limited gun.  All the features of the shadow with the added barrel bushing make this the ultimate CZ, this is the new improved style bushing that’s threaded to the slide, much improved over the original. Smooth and crisp 2.5lb trigger with CZC SRTS (short reset). Difference over regular Accu is the CZC stainless hand fit match barrel. Also, fiber optic front sight, fixed CZC competition rear, FLDC with integrated rail. Added SSI blue scales grips and the slim safeties. This gun will produce 1” groups, can perform well beyond most peoples skill level. One of the finest pistols I’ve owned. Every bit as good as my custom STI, and much cheaper. Very easy to strip for cleaning, most of the time I don’t even have to use the bushing wrench. Comes with 6 magazines, 4 recoil springs from 10lb - 15lb, bushing wrench, case, original CZC grips and safeties/parts. Also have a AA competition belt w boss hanger holster and 5 AA speed pouches that could be included for a full ready to go competition package. Or padded scorpion belt w 3 speed pouches, or a combination of any the above could be worked out if desired. You could buy this and be ready to go tomorrow for production or limited !!!You know you want this rare and amazing pistol.  Prefer to do local sale in AZ.  MSRP is over $2100 if you can even get one. $100 cheaper than anything on gunbroker, plus $300+ in extras (mags,safeties,grips,extra parts).Im really on the fence about letting this hard to find work of art go, so please no crazy low ball offers or “I have this custom G19 w a ghost trigger worth 900” trades."

I purchased in November and have shot just 75 rounds through this gun. It works perfectly, never had a single malfunction.
 
I installed the following parts (worth around $150)

MCARBO Aluminum Curved Target Trigger

and
 
Tacticool Bolt Tube Cover
https://www.amazon.com/Tacticool-Products-Cover-Kel-Tec-SUB-2000/dp/B01IQHWLT6
 
These upgrades greatly enhance the quality and feel of the firearm. MCARBO makes very high quality parts and there is a large MCARBO community of Sub2k customers who have tried and tested all of their aftermarket parts which hold a lifetime warranty.
 
All in all, this is a great firearm. I loved its uniqueness and versatility. It shoots just fine. For me, I just decided I wanted something different so I'm selling this to buy something else (wife won't let me keep both or  I would!).
