What you're looking at is a Ruger SR556 adjustable gas piston rifle chambered in 5.56/.223. I have had this gun for several years and it's in good shape, although not mint. It has some blemishes which I tried to capture in pictures. It has a full length top rail for you to mount your iron sights or scope on. With a Nikon P223 scope, this rifle proved to be very accurate for me. It has a free-floating aluminum hand guard with rail mounting positions at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock. I'm only getting rid of it because I have a lighter rifle which I favor over this one due to a wrist injury. I will include the factory 10 round magazine and bipod as well with a Ruger box. Local sales only and must have matching NJ Driver's License and FID card to complete person to person COE transfer form. Asking $1250 cash or will consider trades for other firearms, dual sport motorcycles, or maybe even a nice dirt bike. Apparently, I can only post one picture here, but I'd be happy to send you more through email. Thanks for looking."

Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30. Like the P30, the P30L was designed as a modern police and security pistol and combines optimal function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstraps inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases, magazine release levers, and a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame (for applicable variants). A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator providing a reminder of a loaded chamber that can be subtly seen and felt. The standard P30L is a 9 mm “Variant 3 (V3)” with a conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with a serrated decocking button on the rear of the slide. P30LS models have the features of the “L” model with the addition of an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. LS models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with decocking button (“V3S” 9 mm and .40 S&W) and with HK’s enhanced double action only “V2” Law Enforcement Modification trigger. A special “V1” lightweight trigger pull model of the Law Enforcement Modification is also available. Extensively tested, P30L and P30LS models have been adopted by several international police and security agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30L naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

I am also including a very nice, barely worn Alien gear holster as well as an OWB Uncle Mikes I used at the range. I'll also throw in a box of 50 target rounds and a box of Hornady Custom to get you started. This is an excellent gun for a beginner or anyone looking for something that can do it all.
