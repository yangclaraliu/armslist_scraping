It has had 600 rounds shot through it and will shoot sub MOA with the handloads I have developed for it. I can include the load data for the rifle to whomever decides to purchase it. I have used this rifle to shoot 1000 yard steel silhouette targets and is very capable of consecutive impacts at this range. The price I have posted is more than fair but am willing to negotiate within reason. Before contacting me, I recommend gathering a list of prices for all of the components installed and included + gunsmithing and shipping costs for each part. You will come to find that the price is very reasonable especially for a lightly used rifle of this configuration. Serious buyers only. If you see this post then yes, it is still available.

This is a made in Belgium and assembled in portugual gun (i think all the newer ones are this way).  It is in very very good shape. $750 is firm price. More pictures upon request.

This SX3 shotgun features a grade II/III Coco Bola oil finished stock with adjustable comb for a comfortable cheek fit and the ambidextrous cross-bolt safety makes it possible for left- or right-handed shooting. The chrome plated chamber and bore along with the nickel plated aluminum alloy receiver provides long-lasting protection and performance.

It features significant recoil reduction over other .50 BMG rifles through intelligent modifications to the internal mechanism. The rifle was designed to be compact, lightweight, accurate, portable and easily deployable for immediate use. Most rifles chambered in .50 BMG are heavy, long, bulky and operate much slower using bolt action.        In the bullpup configuration, most of the weight is distributed to the rear of the rifle allowing for the possibility of off hand firing. This is nearly impossible with most other .50 BMG rifles as the length and forward weight make this more difficult. Utilizing unique barrel recoil technology, the rifle's recoil is  noticeably less than the other rifles in the same category.       This design also allows the rifle to be transported at a length of only 36"". It operates with standard .50 BMG rounds intended for semi-auto rifles. Each GM6 Lynx is given a match grade Lothar Walther barrel which is capable of sub-MOA accuracy with match ammunition. What's in the Pelican Rifle Case: (2) 5 Round magazines  (2) 34mm .50 BMG scope rings (scope not included)   (1) Spare barrel spring (1) Bi-pod  (1) Cleaning kit  (1) Operators Manual           Additional Options:   Custom green finish: $500  Spare Magazine: $375  Spare/Replacement Barrel: $1650              Features  Durable mil-spec design and construction Unique barrel recoil technology dissipates most recoil energy Semi automatic design Magazine fed for ease of reloading Bullpup design for compact size and optimum weight distribution Sub-MOA with match grade ammunitionSpecifications:   Caliber: .50 BMG  Effective Range: 4921 ft  Magazine Capacity: 5  Method of Operation: Long Recoil Action Operating Length: 44.35""  Transportation Length: 36"" Barrel Length: 28.75""  Weight, Empty: 25lbs  *Special Order Item*   This rifle is made to order with a 6 month delivery time on average.

The FX-9  comes standard with a 33 rd double stack GlockÃ�Â® style 9mm  magazine. When we designed the FX-9 our goals were Reliability , Affordability, and familiar controls for the user.

The FX-9 is machined from billet material, anodized type III aluminum components . Steel components are full hard nitride and nickle boron nitirded including the barrel,bolt,ejector,last round hold open,feed ramp and extractor for extended wear properties and corrosion resistance.

The upper and lower receiver are more than 1.00Ã¢ï¿½Â³ shorter than a standard AR-15 upper and lower receiver making it more compact and lighter than a standard mil-spec AR-15 design.

Features Include-

LIMITED LIFE TIME WARRANTY

-7.375Ã¢ï¿½Â³ Free float M Lock Rail  With an 8.25 Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ barrel

-compatible with KNS precisionÃ�Â® AR-15 trigger pins. 

We do not recommend using aftermarket lighter weight triggers, if you wish to try an aftermarket trigger group we recommend keeping your factory supplied trigger group nearby for re-installation as it has more disconnector engagement built into it than a normal mil spec trigger group or after market trigger group  .

The FX-9 upholds Xtreme reliability with a wide range of ammo including many hollow point designs for self defense and full metal jacket .

We do not recommend the use of non jacketed ammunition as unprotected lead can cause fouling and buildups that plated and jacketed bullets do not.



Do Not use aluminum case ammunition in your FX-9 !!



We recommend starting with the following ammunition.

The GUARD is fed from factory Glock magazines and uses CMMG’s patent pending Radial Delayed Blowback operating system that easily handles the 9mm cartridge while simultaneously reducing the weight and felt recoil. It also features a new patent pending dual-pinned, fully machined bolt catch linkage, making operation both easy and intuitive. The GUARD is threaded to accept most common 9mm suppressors and is the perfect carbine for defending your home or enjoying a day at the range.BARREL: 8″, 1:10 twist, Medium Taper, 4140CM, SBNMUZZLE: CMMG A2 Comp, Threaded ½-28HAND GUARD: CMMG RKM7 KeyModFURNITURE: Magpul MOE Pistol Grip, KAK Shockwave Stabilizer and TubeRECEIVERS: Billet 7075-T6 AL Lower, Forged 7075-T6 AL UpperTRIGGER: CMMG Single Stage Mil-Spec style triggerMAGAZINE: Glock 9mm 33 RoundWEIGHT: 5.1 lbs (UNLOADED)LENGTH: 24″I purchased this gun earlier this year, and it's only been fired a couple hundred times. It is completely factory stock and is in excellent condition.It's really neat how it uses a variation of the standard AR-15 bolt and locking lugs. It negates the need for a super heavy bolt and buffer. This gun is over a pound lighter than another similar 9mm AR pistol I had that was a regular blow-back design!Additionally, the delayed-blowback design should allow it to be suppressed more easily than a standard blow-back AR.The bolt locks back on an empty magazine, and the forward assist actually works. These two features are often missing on other 9mm AR firearms.Comes with the following:KAK Shockwave Blade Brace/Stabilizer & KAK notched buffer tubeMagpul MOE pistol gripCMMG Keymod handguardOne 33rd factory Glock happy stick magazineThe original box, owners manual, warranty card, CMMG catalog/flyer, safety cable-lock, etc.Located in New Castle, Indiana.

Please click link below to purchase.https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/spyderco-assist-lightweight-black-black-blade-combinationedge-c79psbbk/ Description We named this knife after its principal job function, to assist. The Spyderco Assist Black Blade is a lightweight folder for emergency fire/rescue professionals and the well-equipped citizen who rely on knives to be straightforward in use and perform flawlessly. The blade is coated in non-reflective black carbon nitride with a patented lift-and-pry (blunt-nose) shape made from high-carbon VG-10 stainless steel and loaded with teeth. Most of its’ 3-3/8″ (86mm) cutting edge is serrated with the last inch at the tip left PlainEdged. Above the one-hand-open hole sits a feature called a Cobra Hood. It’s a metal cap that guides the thumb over the hole for quick, by-feel opening then doubles as a textured leveraging platform for your thumb during cutting. A wavy pattern cut out of the top of the blade and again along the handle is for controlled rope cutting. By placing a rope in the groove (between the partially open blade and handle) you can squeeze the blade shut, slicing and trimming rope in a controlled movement without fully exposing the cutting edge. The handle is black lightweight fiberglass reinforced nylon (FRN) with a survival whistle built into the butt end, shrill and high-pitched enough to get you noticed. A reinforced wire pocket clip attaches through the handle on either side for left- or right-hand use. A retractable and replaceable carbide-tip glass/ice breaker is housed inside the handle and is exposed when the closed blade is squeezed into the handle, retracting when pressure is released."

Looks better than a lot of BNIB, because I know the PVD finish is easy to get rail slide marks. Even pistols that haven't been fired will show the rail marks just from having the rail pulled back on demo. But mine wasn't a demo, so I know to clean it and grease it and have kept it greased and maintained in superb condition. If you're not sure what the Legion means, it's the top of the line for factory Sig P226s, and that's not even really the case. The Legion comes with the Graygun P-SAIT trigger and the SRT Kit - that makes for one of the best triggers you'll ever experience. Also comes with 'Electro Optics' X-Ray sights, which are a massive upgrade even compared to the Sig Nite Sights. THe frame is light weight and there's some extra checkering under the trigger guard for added grip. Amd fpr added grip. there's also the G-10 cutom Legion grips by Hogue. And don't forget the solid steel guide rod - putting weight where it matters! This is a DA/SA Legion.Why selling? I liked my P226 RX so much, I bought the P226 Legion RX, and I can't really justify having 2 Legions ... I mean 'I' can, but my wife can't. Everything is factory. SigSauer Lifetime Warranty applies. You will need to call SigSauer to register as a Legion owner and there are perks to that. Comes with Legion case and Challenge Coin and 3 15rd Sig magazines. Also comes with the hard shell SigSauer original case as well. I am either in Mount Pleasant or James Island and can usually meet from 1pm - 9pm. If you have further questions, feel free to ask. Price is non negotiable. Cash Only - No Trades.Must bring valid CWP or SCDL to purchase."

The blade is S30V stainless steel with non-reflective, black Tungsten DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating. S30V is extremely durable, corrosion resistant, and wear resistant. In addition to providing a non-reflective surface, the black Tungsten DLC coating offers additional blade hardness and reduces friction.

Will consider trades for many things but would prefer .223 rifles.308 rifles, 9mm carbines, even hi point carbines if it is a good working gun And worth it . 357 carbines and rifles Especially, I favor any and all of those sort of guns. Or Mosin nagants, yugo 8mms, sks, or another rifle or pistol carbine that ammo is cheap for for a personal beater, defense, deer, and do it all Budget gun. Even a beat to heck Taurus circuit judge would be cool.  Only considering getting rid of it because I got a single action .357 that I enjoy more. The gun works great, is playing card accurate at 25 yards with the sights and is in decent shape, no holster wear or anything. but will one day need a new ejector as the old one is a little worn in my opinion. i believe the Gun should accept holsters and some accessories for some other Taurus 600 series revolvers and kframe 686 S&w as most dimensions are the same or close."
