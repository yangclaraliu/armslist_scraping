Never carried, no wear marks or scratches.   I’m the original owner.I bought two brand new guns in January (01/18)...this one and a Glock 26.  I couldn’t decide which I liked better at the time so I bought both.  Deciding which one to keep was a tough decision, but since my other guns are Glocks, I’ve  decided to hang on to the G-26.  Consequently, this one is up for sale.The CPX-2 has a small profile that makes it excellent for concealed carry.  This one comes in the original factory box (the black box so you know it’s the new model) with everything else from the factory: all paperwork, the two 10-round mags with pinkie extension baseplates installed plus two extra flat baseplates, and childproof lock w/two keys.In addition to everything supplied by the factory, I am also including four extra factory mags (each w/pinkie and flat baseplates) and a very comfortable hybrid IWB holster (Kydex and leather with neoprene backing for comfort and sweat protection).The CPX-2 is an elegant but robust gun with a “no questions asked” lifetime warranty from SCCY which follows the gun, not just the original owner.  This is a very accurate gun (in addition to looking pretty sexy too!).I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TX driver’s license or carry permit.  I’m in College Station so anywhere in the Houston, Austin, DFW triangle will probably work.  Let’s meet half-way to minimize driving time.Cash only please.  I’m not really looking for a trade and low-ball offers will be respectfully ignored.  If I don't answer your email immediately, it just means I'm at work and I'll get back to you as soon as I get home.  If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.  Thanks!"

A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools. The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa. The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before."

It was manufactured by Česka Zbrojovka (CZ) in Prague (as displayed on a rib on the top of the slide “Česka Zbrojovka A.S. v Praze”). It has 97-98% of its original bright blue finish remaining with only minor holster wear at the muzzle. The trigger, hammer, and extractor retain about 90% of the original straw color. While similar looking, this is not a CZ 27 pistol. CZ 24 was an improved version of the CZ 22, which had been licensed from Mauser. Production of the CZ 24 started in August 1925. The original order for 20,000 pistols was completed in June 1926. Overall, approximately 200,000 CZ 24 pistols were made. An inventory on January 1, 1939, showed the Czechoslovak Army and Air Force had on hand 171,756 CZ 24 pistols. The regular serial number range for the CZ 24 pistol is: 12,000-190,000. The serial number of this pistol is 173,774. The pistol displays the 1937 acceptance “J, rampant lion, 37” mark of Czechoslovak Military. CZ 24 is a meticulously crafted, well-built, robust, and reliable pistol that was very highly thought of at the time. During the German occupation (March 1939 – May 1945), the Czechoslovak Armed Forces were disarmed, and all the weapons were utilized by Germany and its allies. The CZ 24 pistols were not marked by the Germans, in any way, except for those used by the German Navy. CZ 24 pistols were also issued to the German Air Force, and Waffen-SS. Magazine capacity is eight rounds, and a Mauser Model 1910-style safety switch is mounted to the left of the pistol. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts (straw color is generous). Unlike early CZ 24 pistols fitted with one-piece wood grips, our later (production) CZ 24 is fitted with original one-piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. The pistol is housed in an original Czech-manufactured leather flap holster. While CZ 24 pistols are quite common, it is difficult to find one in such exceptional condition. It would make a fine addition to any collection."

The CZ 27 pistol is broken down into three variations: “Ceska”, “Bohmische”, and the “fnh” variation. “Ceska” variation of pre-war CZ 27 pistols, with slide top inscription in the Czech language “ČESKA ZBROJOVKA A. S. v PRAZE”, is extremely rare. This inscription was only used on pre-World War II, early Occupation (1940), and post-War (1945/46) vz. 27 pistols. Beginning in early 1940, this slide top inscription bears the German wording “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” etc. The “Ceska” inscription is found on early CZ 27 pistols with serial numbers ranging from 16,000 to 21,400. Thus, only 5,400 of these pre-war pistols were manufactured! CZ pistol collectors, most likely you will never see this rare CZ 27 variation again. Note the four ANGLED slide grasping grooves on this rare CZ 27 pistol rather than the vertical grooves on CZ 27 pistols of (Nazi) German manufacture and post-World War II Czechoslovak manufacture! This is very rare. This CZ 27 pistol is one of three groupings of pistols that exhibit the letters “DR” in a circle on the left side upper web of the trigger guard. These three apparent groups fall between the serial number range of 16,000 to 34,000 and were manufactured between early 1940 and late 1941. They followed the GECO and AKAH (large German sporting goods dealers) contracts. Our CZ 27 is also a contract pistol and the letters “DR” stand for “Deutsche Reichsbahn”, the German railway system (German railway property marking). When the slide top markings were changed from “Ceska” to “Bohmische”, the German designation for the CZ 27 and the caliber were added to the left side of the slide (our pistol doesn’t have them). Magazine bottoms were marked P.MOD.27. NOTE: Our pistol has one flaw, without which it would have been priced at over $3,000. The previous owner of this pistol tampered with the original matching barrel (serial number 18,740) in an attempt to repair or modify it. This is nothing that a good gun smith cannot fix. The pistol is equipped with a Nazi-era replacement barrel (serial number 197,972) stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark. The original barrel that comes with the pistol is also stamped with the same proof mark. All the numbered parts are matching. In March 1939, Nazi Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500 (the serial number of our early pistol is 18,740). Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those.-"

Caliber: 9 mm
Condition: like new!Capacity:  8 + 1 for concealed carry
Includes TWO factory magazines, plastic factory case, owner’s manual, original paper work, etc.
 
Gun is built with all the quality and workmanship that Walther is famous for.
OPERATING SYSTEM: Accuracy, Low Recoil, SMOOTH FEEL!
A major differentiator is Walther’s “Soft Coil” technology, the gas-delayed blowback operation. A small gas port is in the barrel, just ahead of the chamber mouth. This premium operating system is best known from the Heckler & Koch P7 and the Steyr GB.   There are many advantages:A fixed barrel, with its concentric recoil spring, keeps the slide aligned with the frame. GREAT operation and accuracy!Gases from the fired cartridge help to hold the slide closed instead of relying on the weight of the slide or a heavy recoil spring, the slide is easy to operate.Slide is extremely easy to cycle compared to a standard, recoil-operated 9 mm pistol.Self-regulating for higher-pressure loads.Soft Coil system reduces muzzle flip, moderates recoil and makes the slide easier to operate for folks with less grip strength.
MORE FEATURES:
Reversible magazine catch.
Thumb safety and other controls fall readily to your hand.  It is activated the same as the 1911’s safety, a nice familiar feel that shooters appreciate.
Great-looking little gun. Sharp looking military green color.
ERGONOMICS
Walther did an excellent job of sizing the grip for easy concealment but it still feels great in large hands! Perfectly formed gripped contoured in just the right places for a firm grip. Nice texturing that’s not too rough and not too smooth.
It’s small, light and easy for a wide range of skill levels to run well. The thin size of the single-stack magazine makes carrying a spare easy since it’s smaller than a candy bar.

The CZ 38, also known as vz. 38 and P39(t), is a Semi-automatic pistol designed by František Myška and manufactured from 1939 until 1945. The barrel is attached to the frame by a hinge, allowing for very easy disassembly. CZ 38 is a very well built pistol with many great innovations. The frame slide and barrel have the Czechoslovak Military proof. Pushing the grooved latch below the factory marking forward allows the barrel and slide to pivot upward for disassembly. The pivot pin, unusually, is below the muzzle. This Czechoslovak Army contract CZ 38 pistol has the circled CZ, trademark of the Česká Zbrojovka factory, and Czechoslovak Military acceptance mark (E7 lion 39). E is the mark of the Ordnance Technical office, 7 is the location number of office (7 was at Česká Zbrojovka Factory in Strakonice), 39 was the year of acceptance. On June 14, 1938, the Ministry of Defense ordered from the Česká Zbrojovka 41,000 vz. 38 pistols with serial numbers ranging from 250,000 to 291,000 (our pistol’s serial number is 287,674). In March, 1939 Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia. Nazis allowed for the military contract to be completed, but the pistols would be issued to German units already armed with Czechoslovak weapons (most of the pistols saw service in Greater German police and security forces). The Czechoslovak Military never did receive any of their new vz. 38 pistols. Approximately 45,000 CZ 38 pistols were manufactured in total. The vz. 38 was designated by the Germans as P39(t), Pistole 39 Tschechoslowakei (the German spelling for Czechoslovakia). A German secret Military equipment list dated January 7, 1943, identifies the CZ 38 pistol as Military Equipment Number 2002. The serial number range is from 250,000 to 290,999 (our pistol’s serial number is 287,674). A hard-shell holster was issued to most of the P39(t) pistols. Some pistols (including ours), were issued a soft type German-made holster."

Caliber: 9 mm para (9x19)
Condition:  Excellent!
HISTORY
Perhaps the most successful military handgun of all time is the Browning High Power. The Browning Hi Power has saved the lives of many allied troops. In terms of sheer numbers the Browning stands alone. The pistol was adopted by over one hundred nations and remains on the front lines in many third world nations as well as a favorite of collectors, shooters and citizens.
Its origins began with manufacture in Belgium, then FEG cloned it using the high quality steel that Central Europe is famous for – the one I’m selling. 
FEATURES
The pistol has a reputation for excellent ergonomics and comfortable to handle as in the tradition of the Browning Hi Power.  The High Power settles into the hand as though it had been custom fitted.  It points naturally, and balances perfectly.
Extremely fun to shoot!  Comfortable, accurate, and have a tendency to make the shooter look good. 
As you might expect, recoil is very manageable.
Sights: Has the excellent and proven three dot high visibility sights offer a good sight picture and can be acquired quite quickly.
Diamond pattern grips by the well-respected Hogue grip manufacturing firm for a sure fitted feel and nice control.
Definitely a worthy gun on all counts.

The original box and choke wrench are included and a holster.  The G2 does not require you to re-cock (break open) if you drop the hammer without firing.  I just got this set up a few months ago, but inherited a little different set up that will suit me fine.  Gun was fired under 30 times.  I will not separate any of the components, this is a package deal only.  Will not ship.  Must be willing to meet in Hortonville, Shiocton, or New London.  Put a local phone number in email or I will not respond.  Must be willing to show a DL or CCP."

This item is a seldom seen Czech made double action only CZ 38 pistol chambered in .380 ACP. One magazine and an original Nazi hard-shell holster is included. CZ 38 pistol in excellent condition with excellent finish overall. This pistol includes a nice crisp 1940 dated holster. The CZ 38, also known as vz. 38 and P39(t), is a Semi-automatic pistol designed by František Myška and manufactured from 1939 until 1945. The barrel is attached to the frame by a hinge, allowing for very easy disassembly. CZ 38 is a very well built pistol with many great innovations. The frame slide and barrel have the Czechoslovak Military proof. Pushing the grooved latch below the factory marking forward allows the barrel and slide to pivot upward for disassembly. The pivot pin, unusually, is below the muzzle. This Czechoslovak Army contract CZ 38 pistol has the circled CZ, trademark of the Česká Zbrojovka factory, and Czechoslovak Military acceptance mark (E7 lion 39). E is the mark of the Ordnance Technical office, 7 is the location number of office (7 was at Česká Zbrojovka Factory in Strakonice), 39 was the year of acceptance (our pistol was accepted in September, 1939). On June 14, 1938, the Ministry of Defense ordered from the Česká Zbrojovka 41,000 vz 38 pistols with serial numbers ranging from 250,000 to 291,000 (our pistol’s serial number is 252,030). In March, 1939 Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia. Nazis allowed for the military contract to be completed, but the pistols would be issued to German units already armed with Czechoslovak weapons (most of the pistols saw service in Greater German police and security forces). The Czechoslovak Military never did receive any of their new vz 38 pistols. Approximately 45,000 CZ 38 pistols were manufactured in total. The vz 38 was designated by the Germans as P39(t), Pistole 39 Tschechoslowakei (the German spelling for Czechoslovakia). A German secret Military equipment list dated January 7, 1943, identifies the CZ 38 pistol as Military Equipment Number 2002. The serial number range is from 250,000 to 290,999 (our pistol’s serial number is 252,030). A hard-shell holster was issued and so marked for this pistol. Today collectors often mistake the holster for a P.38 holster as they are almost indistinguishable. Nearly all German-made holsters for the P39(t) are dated 1940. Our pistol comes with the original German-made black leather holster displaying marks “P39(t)” and “Aug. 1940”. It also comes with two magazines."

If you are not already familiar with these pistols, I encourage you to research them. They have been very popular on the C&R market for some years now, and comprehensive reviews are readily available. This gun makes an awesome collector's piece, a realiable historical shooter, and a viable defensive weapon. This is not a good handgun for a novice shooter.This particular P-64 came to me rated in surplus ""Very Good"" condition, and it is still in that condition. The pictures should tell the story, however additional images and information will be available on request. It's quite a gem. I have personally fired this gun approximately 400 times using a wide variety of 9x18mm casings, including: Tula, Brown Bear, Chinese Surplus, PPU brass, S&B brass, and Hornady Critical Defense. Like most every P-64 on the planet, my pistol is freakishly reliable. As long as you keep it clean, it will not let you down.Included with the pistol is original leather holster and 1 mag. Additional mags are available for 20 dollars each (up to 2).***Please note that because this firearm is specifically designated as a Curio and Relic by the ATF (27 CFR 478.11), the State of Colorado does not require a background check for its private sale (CRS 18-12-112 6(a)). As such, the buyer will not be subject to any transfer fees when purchasing this pistol. I will require a photo ID with proof of age (CO law requires 21+). Prospective buyers able to present valid CHP or other proof of recent background check will be given preference.***"

This pistol was shipped Nov. 3, 1944 in a shipment of 1,500 to the Transportation Officer at Springfield Armory. This pistol is 100% correct and original and in 93% condition. I grade it that way because of the tiny pits/finish imperfections shown clearly in the photographs and the high edge wear in different spots. You can clearly tell the finish is original because the metal shows through the tiny pits/finish imperfections. There is burnishment in the crossed cannon acceptance stamp. Colt had stopped stamping the serial number after finishing by this time, so no burnishment in the serial number is correct. I'm going to say that whoever this was issued to shot it VERY little, and it lived in a desk drawer or holster. Didn't clean it, as there is some very minor pitting in the rifling that does not affect accuracy. The barrel is beautiful. I don't know what else to say except this is just a gorgeous piece. I have photographed it at every angle and lighting I could. The pictures will show it to look worse than it is in person. That was my intention! I want $2,400 for it. I just saw 2 bring over $3,000 at auction that were about this shape or worse. One just sold the other day on Colt Forum for $1,900.00 with 10% finish! Came from an old collection. You can take this out and shoot it some and its not going to hurt the value. In this condition they go up in value rapidly! I have seen these go up $1,000 in just 2 years. What will the next 5 bring? Great investment piece.  $2,400.00 plus actual shipping. I NEVER charge more than it costs ME to ship! The first ""I'll take it"" posted here and followed up with an IMMEDIATE email to me at REDACTED gets it. That email must have your information, the way you want to pay, and a zip code of your shop it is going to. Must go to an 03 C&R FFL or better. MUST BE SHIPPED OVERNIGHT UPS IF GOING TO A C&R!!!
