I'm listing this gun at more than 40% off MSRP and it's a semi-custom that you can't just walk into any store and buy. I expect you to treat the value of your production gun available at any gun store similarly.

Includes a roll-up accessory bag, KAC four 11 Rib Rail covers, two 9 Rib Rail Covers, one 6 Rib Rail cover, two 5 Rib Rail covers, and a four Rib Rail Cover. The KAC M5 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military's M16A4, and with hundreds of thousands of rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M5 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories. Includes three KAC 11 Rib Rail Panels.Rifle Requirements: The M5 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, A2-type handguards. The rifle must have a rifle length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and either a round or triangular handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail. For AR-15/SR-15 based platforms only; not compatible with SR-25 variants."

It's a totally different style shotgun. It has an adjustable buttstock & heavy duty pistol grip. It takes 2 3/4"" rds via the drum magazine only, even though the barrel can shoot that & 3"" rds. Only put 2 3/4"" rds in the drum though. It comes with a 10rd drum magazine. You can also order more of them & it will also take a 10rd stick magazine too. It has a vertical grip in front to hold while shooting & racking the rounds out too. It can be for a left or right handed person, the grip can be adjusted to either side. It is dirty so it needs to be field stripped/cleaned as I'm working too much to do alot of things right now. I've shot it a few times on private property at steel targets & it's a beast to shoot. All in all, the price is $300 cash. I am willing to take slightly less, such as $260 & $40 worth of trade gear like blades, tools, etc, we can talk more about that."

This is a Savage Model 1899 or ""99"" rifle with a 26” barrel chambered for the .303 Savage cartridge. It is in very good mechanical condition with a good bore, a cartridge counter and a rectangular cocking indicator. The Schnabel forend is very good, but the straight “English style” buttstock has been cut down and repaired. The repair was done quite well.  The buttstock has cracks near the receiver which is not uncommon for this model. I found vintage replacement stocks at Numrich Gun Parts and on eBay for $60 - $86 if you chose to replace it with a vintage stock. Using Savage’s serial number look-up and leaving the decimal in, the manufacturing date comes up as 1895. Inputting the number (21.510) without the decimal puts the date as 1901 or 1902. In 1920 Savage shortened the model number to “99”. $350.

If you look online you will see that the ASA 15 typically sells in the $1400 range for the full-size rifle this is one of the rare pistols that was made by the company with LMT (Lewis machine and tool)  lowers. Not only that it has a stainless 7.5 inch match grade barrel and a very nice trigger with no take up! This pistol has a very retro look because it is an older A.R. pistol a better quality than most.  Blue book of guns has this particular A.R. pistol listed at $1220 MSRP.  I am willing to except a very reasonable offer for cash or trade this pistol has never been fired it is brand new in its original state with 99% condition. I have never seen an American spirit arms in this condition in this day  and age and it does fall under the pre-ban since it is a early first model. Thank you for looking!

Building on the lauded submachinegun platform that first hit the US civilian market in pistol form in 2015, the Carbine has a 16.2″ barrel fitted with either a compensating muzzle brake or a faux suppressor built specifically for CZ-USA by SilencerCo. Fit with the factory’s folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor. Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Carrying on the Scorpion’s reputation as a reliable pistol-caliber plinker without breaking the bank, the Carbine starts at just $999.LOG:51838"

The KAC M5 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military's M16A4, and with hundreds of thousands of rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M5 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical attachments such as weapons lights, vertical grips, aiming lasers, etc...Rifle Requirements: The M5 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, A2-type handguards. The rifle must have a rifle length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and either a round or triangular handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail.

Factory research lists as follows: Serial number applied May 22nd, 1896; Type: rifle; Caliber: .45-90; Barrel type: octagon; Barrel length: (We have researched this rifle with Jessica. There is a 28"" listed, which is 2"" longer than standard. The following entry is blank, which would indicate a standard 26"". This offered rifle is listed as a ditto mark. Question arose as the ditto followed the blank, which would indicate a 26"" barrel. The next 6 rifles in the order with seven leaf sights all list with 26"" barrels. It is obvious that this rifle is all original with a 26"" barrel with all proper measurements, and an actual copy of the shipping record will accompany rifle.) Trigger: Set; Sights: Seven leaf Express and Beach; Screw-eyes; Received in warehouse February 6th, 1897; shipped February 10th, 1897. The only feature not listed in factory letter is the full magazine, as this was standard issue. All other features of this rifle are as recorded. Standard finish for this era, which is not listed on letter, would be case colored. The barrel and tube are a lovely mix of soft blue with the patina blending, some light high edge wear with sharp edges and some usual minor age freckling. Barrel legend is sharp. Caliber legend stamped on left flat at breech due to special rear sight. Front sight is replaced. The frame colors have nickeled out with traces of origional case coloring.. The bolt retains approximately 80% of the original factory high polish blue. Express sights features the platinum center lines and are numbered one through six and the long range express sight has graduations from seven to ten. They are in excellent condition with no damage and the spring still exhibits fire blue finish. All screws are excellent with just some minor disfiguration. Loading gate spring has a replaced screw. It has the close set double triggers with the original sling eyes intact. The walnut stocks are excellent, all original, proud to metal with no cracks and usual surface abrasions, retaining generous amounts of the original factory finish with some minor age checking at comb. Action is perfect. Strong rifled bore with some very minor black powder abrasion. With the exception of the front sight and one replaced screw, the gun is all original, untouched, just as it left the factory in superb condition and is chambered for the second most popular caliber ever manufactured, the large .45-90. Probably the most difficult rifle to find today is the '86 with the 7 leaf rear sight. Please let me know if you have any questions on this piece.
