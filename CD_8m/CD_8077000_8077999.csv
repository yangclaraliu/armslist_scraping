This was done so it could be used on a standard G3/91 or a G3/HK91 that was converted into an HK11, using an early 21 or 21A1 shroud. The charging handles can only be latched into position when using these clubfoot stocks with early shrouds used on Vollmer conversions. This was caused by cocking support distance and bolt carrier being the wrong length to latch charging handle in hold open notch. The G3/HK91 had the same length issue if trying to use a 21E buffer in a clubfoot stock, bolt carrier bottoms out against the 21E buffer with the charging handle being about 3/4” before hold open latch is reached.  
 
Standard 21E buffers can be put back in just as easy as installing a buffer (wasn’t a permanent conversion, stock was not altered or modified in anyway (only the buffer was converted, stock was in no way molested).
 
If you wish to use a standard 91 op-rod, simply swap out the metal ferral from your standard 91 buttstock. The other option would be to use a modified op-rod from a 21E, we do this on all our cconvertions and is a very simple process!
 
I can walkyou through the process or do it for you at no charge other than return shipping via USPS priority mail. The condition of this item is new, although the G3 buffer is used.

It features an all-steel frame with ablack finish, straight-pull trigger, trigger safety, G10 VZ grip andinterchangeable grip panels, and an accessory rail for aftermarket lightsor lasers. The unconventional nose of the pistol allows for the barrel andrecoil spring to sit drastically lower and closer to the hand than heritagedesigns. This, coupled with its striker-fired design, creates an extremelylow bore axis which reduces torque about the wrist when firing andcontributes to unparalleled precision in the shot process. This modelincludes three 15-round 9mm magazines.

The price does include the iron sights and everything else pictured or discussed in the description.  It has been accessorized with a Firefield 1-4 x magnification scope with battery powered illuminating reticles which can be turned on if desired.  It also has flip up iron sights, and a light/laser with a push button.  The sights and laser are sighted in, although the laser is slightly off, at least a close distances.  It also comes with at least 100 rounds of ammo (enough to fill all of the mags) and the case pictured.   Willing to travel in Tippecanoe or Cass county, or counties surrounding Cass County.  Am willing to travel farther for extra cash.
