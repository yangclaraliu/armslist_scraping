This is a Savage Model 1899/99 rifle with a 26” barrel chambered for the .303 Savage cartridge. In 1920 Savage shortened the model number to “99”.  It has a very good bore, a cartridge counter and cocking indicator.  The Schnabel forend is very good.  The buttstock has been cut down and repaired – and a pretty decent job was done (see photos).  I found vintage replacement stocks at Numrich Gun Parts and on eBay for $60 - $86.  When dating the rifle using Savage’s serial number look-up without inputting the decimal (21510), the date of manufactures comes up as 1901 or 1902.  Leaving the decimal in (21.510), the date comes up as 1895.  $325 or trade for ?.  You may contact me with your private email for more pictures.  Reply to this ad or contact John at 2 5 3 five four nine 6 6 one six."

Stocked in OD green with ARMS 18 mount and Aimpoint PRO in a low Warne QD ring. Comes with the SA soft case, 5 CMI 20 round magazines and 1 factory 10 round magazine. Value-wise the rifle is about $1300 new online, ARMS 18 is $200 and PRO is about 400-450. Asking $1600 in trade value, can separate the mount and optic from the rifle if you wish. I have a can of PMC M80 ball (460 rounds) I can toss in, $200 value.Edit: I'm not interested in your AR build. Trades I'll consider include high end metal framed handguns (not in .40), Glock 20, military surplus rifles, single stack 9mm subcompacts.
