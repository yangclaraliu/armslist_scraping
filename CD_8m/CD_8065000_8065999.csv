The GLOCK 20 Gen4, with a magazine capacity of 15 rounds of powerful 10mm ammo, is the optimal balance of lightweight, concealable and controllable.With the flexibility to mount your choice of a light or laser to the integrated rail, the GLOCK 20 Gen4 is capable of handling any environment.The Gen4 pistols include a modular backstrap system that allows a shooter to tailor the rough textured grip of the pistol to their hand size for optimal ergonomics. GLOCK also introduced a reversible magazine catch on the Gen4 pistols to make it right- or left-hand accessible.To tame the recoil of the powerful 10mm cartridge, GLOCK has introduced a dual recoil spring system that significantly increases the service life of the pistol.GLOCK's Safe Action System (SAS) is a fully automatic three-point mechanical safety system. Once the trigger is pulled, each point sequentially and independently disengages, and then reengages. Together, these mechanisms greatly guard against misfires without increasing resistance in the trigger pull.Used by hunters, police officers and even elite military units operating in the Arctic, the GLOCK 20 Gen4 has all the features you need to be successful at targeting whatever you are aiming for.Features and Specifications:Glock 20 Gen4 P1205020310mm15 Round MagazineRough Texture PolymerBarrel Length 4.6""Standard GLOCK SightsTrigger Pull 5.5 lbsStriker FiredGLOCK Safe ActionLength 8.03""Height 5.47""Width 1.27""Weight 30.71 ozTwist 9.84Black Brand: GLOCK UPC: 764503802034 MFR #: PG2050203"

I was wrong. this thing made my teeth rattle. A true beast.Be aware that I did build this gun! It contains parts from several different sources. I may not be able to tell you what they are exactly! What I can tell you is that the vast majority of those parts are virtually brand new. The only component of this gun that has seen previous use on another platform is the bcg. Since building it I doubt ive put more than four full mags through it and throughout those four mags I did not experience any malfunctions.

SFx comes with many new features as modular for the shooter to enjoy more in target shooting. Equipped with front serrations, extended magazine catch and extended slide stop, the shooter’s control of the pistol is enhanced and sighting is improved thanks to the fiber-optic front sight. The tolerances are tightened; the trigger stroke is shortened therefore allowing for quicker firing rates with integrated trigger safety, an optic mount slot is introduced to facilitate the mounting of popular Red-Dot optical sights by installing interfaces that also enables cocking lever for smooth loading. Thanks to the weight reducing cuts on the slide, the weight of SFx is similar to the standard size TP Series Pistols."

Ventilated Rib. Browning Micro Midas firearms are designed specifically for smaller framed shooters. If you give a new shooter a long gun that is too large for them, they will develop bad habits in their form as they are doing everything they can just to hold the barrel up and get some kind of sight picture. The Micro Midas BPS shaves off weight and length (which can be adjusted with included stock spacers), creating a more compact and easy to handle package.As the name Micro Midas implies, this BPS is not another cheap ""junior model"" shotgun. The satin finish Walnut wood stock is as beautiful as it is functional, with detailed checkering on the pistol grip and fore arm. The vented rib barrel and the forged, machined steel receiver are gloss blued. The barrel is every bit the same quality as a full size Browning BPS.Call 406-371-6772."

A distressed finish on the stainless-steel slide includes patriotic engravings, such as 13 stars atop the slide and “WE THE PEOPLE” on the slide flats. Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.9 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly."

Since owning it I have made a point to run amonia/boiling down the barrel and over all the parts after shooting ANY ammo. In short, it is an old work horse that has been well maintained. The furniture was pretty beat up when I got it and some idiot or kindergardener had scratched their initials into the side of the stock. So, I popped it off and refinished it with a dark stain and some outdoor polyurethane. Of course I'm biased but I think it looks way better than the original lacquer.       The days of 75 dollar Mosins are gone and although I am sad to part with this one I shoot it so infrequently that it seems to be time for something else. 91/30s seem to be starting at 200 dollars these days (if you get lucky) and go far higher depending on the particular make. These arent the rarest but they are certainly not common either. This one is a Tula M38 carbine manufactured in 1944 at Tula arsenal, USSR. My understanding is that the m38 is very similar if not identical to the M44 but, being that it was manufactured for troops somewhat removed from the front lines (artillery, supply etc),the foldout bayonet was removed.              For this one I am asking 400 dollars cash. But that said, cash is always in shorter supply so I am willing to trade at a higher value.        If you have something fun, please dont hesitate to make an offer. I dont bite and I will most certainly not be a dick about it if I do not accept! Just no obvious lowball offers. I am not under any pressure to get rid of this and it just wastes the time of everyone involved."

A rotating bolt system fully locks the bolt closed for maximum safety, and the bolt and bolt carrier are coated with PVD for excellent wear and corrosion resistance. The Sig MCX semi-automatic rifle comes with a skeletonized, low profile, side-folding stock and integral QD sling points for ease of carry. A full-length 1913 Picatinny rail and an alloy Keymod handguard allow you to attach a wide array of aftermarket tactical accessories. The safety selector, charging handle, and magazine release are all ambidextrous. A beveled and flared mag well allows quick and unhindered mag changes.
