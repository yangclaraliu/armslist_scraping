I require an FFL to send to if it is out of state Arizona.     This has never been fired and is new in the box and has been stored in a temperature-controlled gun safe. 
 It's in mint NIB condition, I have simply decided to go a different way with other calibers/platforms and don't need it. Plus, I could use the money for my favorite charity – Phoenix Children’s Hospital Foundation.  They need it to support one heck of an effort in the Southwest. Serious offers only please as I am not hurting to sell this rifle. Sorry no trades as I really want to support PCHF
 A little about Hogan: It's a gas piston driven rifle made by one of the best. For those that don't know, Hogan used to build all of P.O.F.-U.S.A.’s rifles. They still do work for many companies, to include building GA Arms Precision's sniper rifles for them.   I'll include links for reviews done by world renowned and former world record longest shot U.S.M.C. MARSOC Sniper Steve Reichert.
