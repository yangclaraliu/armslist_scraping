The frame has been refinished at some point, but not by Sig. It's got the same color as the standard Sig frame though. This gun has been used, but is just as accurate as my other five Sigs. Would make a great carry piece or truck gun to keep you from worrying about messing up a pristine P228. Or if you want to find out what the P228 is all about without spending a lot of $$$. Comes with one original magazine (that has had it's finished stripped for some reason), one newer Sig magazine, and one unbranded mag.$550; no trades unless it's for a 9mm carbine. Valid NC concealed carry permit and bill of sale required for purchase."

Has interchangable reticle with 4 different options and has adjustable height picatinny mount.
4 Sights in 1. Shield have taken the incredible performance and strength of their military/LE proven red dot sight the CQB/CQS and made it even better. The fantastic performance, weight and durability have been given an extra dimension by the added convenience of 4 switchable reticules and brightness adjustment settings via the touch of a button. With the 3x Automatic levels, 12x manual levels and 4x Reticule options, you have the most advanced red dot reflex sight. The SIS CD (Center Dot) reticule was designed to offer the user the best of both worlds. With the touch of a button the dot can go from 8MOA down to 1MOA and back again. The 8MOA was found to be the best choice for UK Soldiers as it made them much faster and accurate in close quarter environments and the 1MOA now gives that same Soldier the ability to hit targets out to far greater distances than believe possible by a red dot.
Shield’s unique technology does not rely on moving parts within the sight meaning that each time you switch the reticule you know that your dot is still on target. The SIS was a next product step in their combat proven product line and has been designed by listening to customers and gaining real-world application feedback from Special Forces, Law Enforcement, Competition shooters and Military users across the world.
The SIS is packaged with a variable triple height polymer picatinny mount allowing the user to determine the most comfortable set-up"

If you do not know the history on this rifle, it was designed in the 1980's as a DMR rifle for European paratrooper units. The guy that designed and built these rifles later went on to become the lead product designer for Kel-Tec. The rifle uses a polymer chasis with an under-folding stock that locks in place with a twist knob in the underside of the stock. It is built around a SAKO short action chambered in .308/7.62x51 and it has a custom fluted barrel that is threaded for the attached muzzle brake. The muzzle brake is VERY effective on this gun, and if you're shooting from a bench, you can knock things off the tables to the right and left of you. The rifle has a 9-round internal box clip, so the total capacity is 10 rounds (9+1) but you have to hold down the top round in the clip to chamber the 10th round.It has a front post for a bipod and this rifle has had Leupold picatiny scope bases attached to the SAKO action by a professional gunsmith. These are removable, but have been attached in a way as to not move over time. Unloaded and without optics the rifle is 6.7lbs, so it's very light and is a great backpack or hunting gun because it's packable and easy to get into and out of the field plus being comfortable to carry all day.Original Gredel SRT .308 Win - 18"" barrelHarris Bipod AdapterHarris Short BipodLeupold Scope BaseLeupold Scope Rings - 30mmSWFA SS 10x42 with Paralax Adjustment - 30mmGG&G FastFire Offset MountBurris FastFire II20 Rounds of Colt .308 Win (it's actually Russian)20 rounds of Black Hills Hunting .308 Win10 Rounds of .308 Win hollow tip10 Rounds of Winchester Silver tip .308 WinI didn't count, but you get an entire .30 cal ammo can full of Lake City M80.

AMMO IS INCLUDED IN PRICE, I'M NOT LOOKING TO HANG ON TO THE AMMO SINCE THIS IS MY LAST .308 WIN GUN. This is a very rare rifle. The price is not going to reflect the ""blue book"" value on this gun, as these are very hard to put a price on. Chances are that this is the first time you've ever even heard of this rifle or seen one before. You won't be able to find these on Gunbroker.com or anywhere else. There are very few of these left and they don't move from private collections very often. Gun is probably actually worth way more than I am asking for it. I'm not in a hurry to move this, so low-ball offers will kindly be dismissed. If you need more detailed pictures I can send them.

This gun is almost brand new, I’m the original owner and have only shot this gun once. It has an XS Sight Systems Rail, Tasco Red Dot Sight, Williams Fire Sight Set (Rear Sight still needs to be fitted), Extra front sight, Sling, Big loop lever (Works fine but has some slack in it), also I will include the camo case, and 2 full boxes of ammo. All original parts are in a ziplock bag including the original lever. This rifle is somewhat of a project I was working on, but will never get around to finishing, plus I have too many guns as it is. This would be great for a young hunter, or compact rifle for home protection. Again, the rifle has been shot once, there are some wear marks on the hammer and front sight but can be fixed with some blueing, these occurred when fitting the sights and lever. Receiver is drilled and tapped. I will meet in a public place we can agree on and will bring a bill of sale with owners manual for the rifle and the owners manual for the sight. I can also bring the original receipt from where I purchased the rifle to prove I am the original owner. Please contact me at 2 5 1 4 5 4 6 2 3 8. Text preferred but you may call on weekends or after 430 on weekdays. Thank you."

623,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8291623,For Sale:  HK 94 / MP5 SBR Original H&K,"Lakeway, Austin, Texas","$ 7,400","Listed On: Saturday, April 28, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"MP5 in excellent condition with all HK internals as shipped. I’ve run her once in auto (both suppressd and unsuppressed) to verify function but this thing is so nice and I have other MP5 hosts so she has rested in the safe for nearly a decade. She had bright night sites when she arrived but those are now dim (easy enough to find online and replace or ignore as they are not necessary). Stock looks new and is tight with no wobbles. 3 lug works perfectly on HK IG date coded barrel with new appearing bore. Paddle mag release is as smooth as the one on my previous original post 86 machine gun. Carrier has been welded to allow auto function with an HK sear. The carrier looks factory original after the minor work done to accomplish the conversion.
HK 94 originally converted by Curtis Higgins at S&H Firearms to an MP5 form when married to one of his HK sears. Original HK made in W-Germany imported by HK Chantilly VA, 9mm and remarked MP5 and is an IG (1986) production. When the gun was transferring to me it was divorced from the sear and papered to as SBR by TSC LLC in Ruther Glen VA. The SBR marking is to ATF spec and discreetly located on the lower rear receiver rail. All maintenance parts are current to include new German HK recoil spring, extractor and extractor spring. Includes nice B&T forward rail.
You can now purchase some great Heckler & Koch clones but if you want an original in premium shape this is the one to have.
Cash preferred but willing to consider interesting trades. If asking about a trade please say exactly what you are considering including any cash offered or needed to make up a value difference. I have other items listed and can work a deal either way. A Desert Tech SRS and premium optic would go a long way to catching my attention. I'm located near Mansfield Dam on Lake Travis, nearest cross streets being Hudson Bend and RR620. I either work from home or at the Capital Complex during the week. I will want and happy to provide a bill of sale.
If the add is up the toy is available. I will not respond to questions asking “still available” or that do not show a person has read the listing. This gun will require an ATF F4 transfer. I live near Capitol Armory and Silencershop and happy to meet at either to complete paperwork if they already have your information and to speed the transfer."

654,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8291654,For Sale:  HK 94 / MP5 SBR real H&K,"Lakeway, Austin, Texas","$ 7,600","Listed On: Wednesday, May 9, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"MP5 in excellent condition with all HK internals as shipped. I’ve run her once in auto (both suppressd and unsuppressed) to verify function but this thing is so nice and I have other MP5 hosts so she has rested in the safe for nearly a decade. She had bright night sites when she arrived but those are now dim (easy enough to find online and replace or ignore as they are not necessary). Stock looks new and is tight with no wobbles. 3 lug works perfectly on HK IG date coded barrel with new appearing bore. Paddle mag release is as smooth as the one on my previous original post 86 machine gun. Carrier has been welded to allow auto function with an HK sear. The carrier looks factory original after the minor work done to accomplish the conversion.
HK 94 originally converted by Curtis Higgins at S&H Firearms to an MP5 form when married to one of his HK sears. Original HK made in W-Germany imported by HK Chantilly VA, 9mm and remarked MP5 and is an IG (1986) production. When the gun was transferring to me it was divorced from the sear and papered to as SBR by TSC LLC in Ruther Glen VA. The SBR marking is to ATF spec and discreetly located on the lower rear receiver rail. All maintenance parts are current to include new German HK recoil spring, extractor and extractor spring. Includes nice B&T forward rail.
You can now purchase some great Heckler & Koch clones but if you want an original in premium shape this is the one to have.
Cash preferred but willing to consider interesting trades. If asking about a trade please say exactly what you are considering including any cash offered or needed to make up a value difference. I have other items listed and can work a deal either way. A Desert Tech SRS and premium optic would go a long way to catching my attention. I'm located near Mansfield Dam on Lake Travis, nearest cross streets being Hudson Bend and RR620. I either work from home or at the Capital Complex during the week. I will want and happy to provide a bill of sale.

The jacketed, frangible projectile uses a copper/polymer composite core by coming apart upon impact with hard surfaces, even at oblique angles. It is designed specifically to prevent large fragments from coming back at the shooter when used against hardened targets. The MK255 specification calls for accuracy in the sub-2-MOA neighborhood but is often consistently under .75 MOA. This is a perfect choice for use as a defensive load in places where over-penetration or ricochet are concerns.

At the time the Remington Model 3200 was the only other quality American Made over-under, and it cost nearly twice as much. The Red Label soon proved a hit with the American shooting public for its affordability, reliability, and handling. It remained in production for over three decades. In 1979, Ruger began to offer the Red Label in 12 Gauge and eventually a scaled-down version in 28 Gauge available from 1994-2011. The design was born of William B. Ruger's desire to produce a quality US made over and under shotgun. In order to achieve this and put quality on par with hand-made European shotguns, Ruger invested in expensive machinery to do most of the work.



The Red Label originally came with a blued receiver but later models came standard with a stainless steel receiver and two hammer forged barrels. The shooter can determine which barrel to fire by means of a selector mounted on the tang. The front sight is typically a brass bead. The Red Label is primarily used as a sporting shotgun for waterfowling, upland game hunting as well as in skeet and sporting clays.


Also included is the Ruger 28 to .410 Conversion TubeSet manufactured by Briley specifically for the Red Label shotgun"
