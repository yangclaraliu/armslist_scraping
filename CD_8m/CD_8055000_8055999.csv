The improvement reduces projectile deformation as it passes through the bore during the firing sequence and the projectile stays uniform instead of squeezing material on opposite side grooves. Hence, the more uniform projectile, the better the accuracy.   All Finished Barrels go through a 100% Inspection Process.   Inspections Equipment includes CMMs and Air Gauges for the Bores.   Our expectations is that our Barrels, 16 inch or longer, will hold a 1.000"" MOA at 100 yards with appropriate ammo and shooting techniques.

All K series revolvers were fitted with plain walnut grips and were shipped from the factory with wood presentation cases lined with red fabric. The cases were marked on the outside with an impressed Colt logo in the center of the lid and were ""French-fitted"". This consisted of gluing a cardboard cutout of the revolver in the bottom of the case and covering it with red cloth.

I picked this thing up last year. Had planned on doing some long range shooting but just didn't have the time or a nearby place to really stretch it out to its full potential.

I am negotiable, but please no low ball offers or trades. Will throw in a really nice Midway USA padded case if purchased all together.

Colt machinery and tooling under Colt employees. Colt contracted this pistol out to the Argentine armed forces - this particular gun served in the Argentine coast guard, judging by the inventory/rack number on the slide and frame. These particular pistols were made with ALL forged and machined steel parts, according to 1927 Colt blueprints! It is an exact clone of a 1927-era Colt 1911, and has NO cast MIM parts or ugly modern rollmarks. This particular pistol was made in 1959. It has finish wear from being carried in the Argentine forces, but it was used VERY seldom. Aside from the finish wear, this pistol is in gorgeous condition with a MINT barrel. It is very accurate and shoots to point of aim with a 6 o'clock hold. I have owned this pistol for 2 years, and have shot 3 magazines through it in that time. The pistol has been professionally stripped to the mainspring, cleaned, and oiled. The bluing is original and at roughly 80%!Most of these Argentine contract 1911's that made it to the USA were shot-out, refinished with a parkerizing at Argentine arsenals, and were in generally very poor condition. This one was exported as government surplus to Germany and was part of a private collection being bought and imported by Simpson limited. If you look, you can see the German proof marks. It is one of VERY few Argentine 1911's that has a low round count and has the original bluing, and it has a lot of character! Good luck finding another one like this under $1400-$1500! This one comes with 1 magazine and a plastic carrying case. The grip panels are World War 2 early production Keyes grips. Virginia residents only!! Depending on where you are, I'm willing to drive. Text or call at 703-593- four zero three six, or contact me via this ad. Thank you"

This model has a 4.25"" barrel and is 45 colt only, not the 45/410 model you usually see. The 45 colt only model is fully rifled which will deliver better bullet performance and prevent the tumbling often seen on the 45/410 models which only feature 1/2 inch of rifling. The great thing about the Bond derringer however is how easy it is to change the barrel, it takes all of 30 seconds to switch out barrels which are available in a wide variety of lengths and calibers, with enough barrels this derringer can potentially shoot 22, 32, 357,380, 9mm, 40mm, 10mm, 45 colt, 410 shot, and 45 acp in barrels between 2"" to 6"" with less than a minute to switch out.Included with the sale is a carrying case, a black leather horizontal driving holster (made to wear on a belt or a seatbelt) 140 rounds of Hornady critical defense, 20 rounds of Hornady leverevolution, and 40 rounds of spent .45 colt brass. The derringer has had less than 100 rounds fired through it. In the carrying case are also two allen wrenches, one for changing the barrel and a much smaller one that can lock/unlock the safety in either position.I really like this gun, and I plan on getting another soon, but for the time being Ruger recently starting making 3"" .327 federal magnum SP101s again after a few years hiatus and I need some extra cash to get one."

The rifle has only had 3 mags ran through it and without one malfunction. It is optics ready, although Ill throw in a cheap little red dot sight I had lying around that I have no use for. It'll come in the box with 5 magazines, the red dot sight, and a lock for it. I also have a chamber flag somewhere which it'll come with if I can recall where I placed it. II'm really only interested in trading it for an AK rifle of which I can put boot with if needed, but money always talks. If interested just contact me through email. Thank you and have a nice day."
