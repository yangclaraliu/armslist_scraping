Has fired just over 1000 rds and you won’t find one better that has been taken out and shot.

This is an excellent gun that was purchased for my brother but never picked up because of family disagreements and frankly I just want to get rid of it. With the new grip this gun feels incredible. I used to not think of this gun as being a carry gun, but with the new grip, I can definitely see myself carrying this pistol.

Please click link below to purchase.https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/aimpoint-micro-t-2-2-moa-no-mount-200180/ Micro T-2 (2 MOA no mount) Description The Aimpoint Micro T-2 redefines everything you thought you knew about compact red dot sights. Cutting edge lens coatings radically improve the shape and clarity of the 2 MOA red dot and physical protection has been added for even more ruggedness. Inside the sight housing are advanced optical lenses that takes optical performance to a different level. Cutting edge lens coatings radically improve the shape and clarity of the 2 MOA red dot especially when used with an accessory magnifier. The Micro T-2 is a lightweight sight for extreme conditions. Built to offer the same battle-proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, the Micro T-2 performs reliably under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. The Aimpoint Micro T-2 is ideal as a stand-a-lone sight, and thanks to its small size, it can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics. The Micro T-2 has excellent night vision compatibility which can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility. The performance of the Micro T-2 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation Night Vision Technology. Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dots selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation night vision device (NVD) but also when used with Aimpoint 3XMag magnifier. With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-2 is ready for round the clock use."

James Williams is one of the most revered martial artists in America. He brings that discipline and unrivaled know-how to this sleek tactical knife. To round out its powerful capability, it’s privy to Field Strip technology and won’t slow down even in the grittiest conditions. This is what happens when a master takes to making. Most famous for his “System of Strategy,” James Williams of Encinitas, California is one who seriously knows his way around a tactical folding knife. Elegance and effectiveness are paramount in Japanese culture both when it comes to martial arts and classic weaponry. James’ expertise bridges the gap between the two and has inspired incredibly famous designs like the Hissatsu and the Otanashi Noh Ken. The Goken is aptly named—the Japanese word is reserved for only those that embody fortitude. This knife is a worthy addition to his tactical folding knife lineup with a classic James Williams modified Tanto blade style finished with a deep black powder coat. The 3.7” blade is deployed from its tough G10 handles with an inconspicuous flipper and held fast with a locking liner amid any dirty job it may confront."

Please click link below to purchase.https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/gerber-emerson-alliance-automatic-black-3-5-serrated-22-07158/ Description Ernie Emerson designed this awesome defender of freedom that offers fully automatic deployment. Ernie didn’t earn his reputation as a tactical knife expert by cranking out crap. He expects Gerber to use only primo materials and components in building his namesake knife, and we do. This knife is configured in such a way as to achieve the speed and might that tactical pros require, while still protecting the user with features like the patent pending safety pin, which prevents accidental deployments. The black oxide-coated blade is of the 154CM variety, with a Rockwell Hardness rating of HRC 59 to 62. The exotic-looking handle is machined out of 6061-T6 anodized aluminum, which is as hard as it is tactile. And its damned tactile. Built for the demands of the tactical user, this knife offers fully automatic deployment, a stealth black oxide-coated 154CM blade, and a 6061-T6 anodized aluminum handle."

This gun shoots as smooth as it looks. I have polished the barrel ramp and put about 300 rounds through it most of which were self defense rounds. It’s role for my wife’s first conceal carry so reliablity was paramount, no printing here. The coolest thing about this gun is it as comfortable to shoot on the range so practice is fun. Great gun for entry into conceal carry. Wife is moving up to 9mm and higher capacity, this gun built her confidence. This version may be the nicest that Sig makes in the 238 with the  polished and engraved slide and the Sig medallions in the grips and the Sig night sights. If you have any questions just email me. Included are 2 flush fitting magazines and one extended , a DeSantis IWB leather holster and the Sig OWB kydex holster, case,lock and paperwork."
