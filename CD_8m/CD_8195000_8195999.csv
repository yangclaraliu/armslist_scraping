Lower has a Larue MBT Trigger. Comes with 4 25Rnd Mags and 2 10 Rnd Mags + Extra Picatinny Rail Section and Some Wolf 6.5 Ammo (whatever I have left at the time of sale). This is an ultra reliable gun even with steel and it has a rifle length gas system. Grendel is the best AR round although ammo can be hard to find at times. I am planning on building a new ultra lightweight version of this + an AR 10 in 6.5 Creedmoor. Comes without Mount, Scope and Sling For the 1000. I will add the Mount in for $75 and the Scope in for S250. Sling + Mounts is $80."

This gun was made between 1936 and 1941, before serial numbers on guns existed. As you may know jc Higgins were a line of guns sold at sears and Roebuck and were actually manufactured by marlin. If you look it up this model 103.18 is the exact gun as a marlin model 100 because it is a marlin model 100 just stamped jc Higgins because sears and Roebuck at the time had a contract with marlin to produce guns for them. This gun is in excellent condition with almost no wear on the wood or barrel and the rifling is prestine. This gun was purchased at a gun show 11 years ago and has been fired less than 100 times. The only reason I’m am selling is because I want to put this money towards a nickel bolt carrier group for one of my ARs. Asking a firm $125, you will not find this gun anywhere in this condition and I don’t mind keeping it for less than this price. If interested TEXT me at 205-331-7764"

There were 2 things stolen, a gen4 Glock 19 and my new MacBook Air. The glock would be easy to spot, it has a very nice complete stipple on the frame, trijicon night sights and aftermarket internals all of which was held in a LAG inside the waist appendix holster. I have the serial numbers and pictures for both items, as do the police. I’ve seen a lot of posts looking for G19s and just wanted people to be aware and make sure you aren’t buying stolen property. They stole the pistol but were unable to find the magazines, so they’d have to buy them to shoot. My truck was broken into sometime between 9:28-10:25pm although I’m almost certain they were in it within the first 15 minutes. Possible reward if any information leads to the capture of these scumbags and the return of my property. If you have any questions or anything else please feel free to reply to the posting. Thanks for your time, Stay safe and stay vigilant."

Barrel assembly is a Ballistic Advantage 11.5” Modern Series. BCG is a Toolcraft Nitride. I forgot who made the handgusrds, but they’re skinny CAR guards Flash hider is a Delton 5.5”, pinned and welded to a legal non-NFA length. The upper has a nice retro look to it. New, these parts cost $450 unasswmbled and it’s in excellent condition. I took it to the range maybe twice last fall for function checking after building and it has maybe 100 rounds through it. And it’s been sitting in the closet ever since.Please note, during assembly the barrel nut teeth did not align with the gas tube within the specified 30-80ftLb. Rather than over or under torque the barrel nut, I opted to cleanly remove the offending tooth and blued the exposed metal before finally torquing to 80ftlb. This is entirely cosmetic in nature, the handguards fit rock solid, and function is unaffected - completely reliable. The work is actually rather clean (see dusty pic). It is not visible with the handguards installed.If the buyer wishes, I will include a new unadultered barrel nut for them to install themselves. Price: $400 or best offer gets it. I can meet in NE Ohio for face to face. Any shipping costs are extra. I can do cash or discrete PayPal.

Browning, the Model of 1895 Winchester was the first lever-action rifle with a box magazine. Until that time, most lever-actions had tubular magazines in which the nose of one bullet rested against the base of the cartridge in front of it. With the development of smokeless ammunition came radical changes in cartridge design and performance. High-power, smaller-caliber spitzer or pointed bullets became practical and highly sought after by sportsmen everywhere. In response, Browning designed a lever-action with a box magazine that stacked the ammunition to eliminate the danger of accidental discharge. The resulting 1895 lever-action has been a favorite of sportsmen ever since.The 1895 in .405 gained national prominence in October 1910 when Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “... the Winchester .405 is, at least for me personally, the ‘medicine gun’ for lions.” Written for Scribner’s magazine while he was touring Africa on a yearlong safari, sportsmen around the world began to clamor for Roosevelt’s “medicine gun.” The scramble for original 1895s in .405 began with a renewed vigor in 2002 when Hornady re-introduced the .405 Win. as a factory cartridge.Traditionally, the 1895 in .405 was available in a standard 24"" barrel with a shotgun-style buttplate. The crescent buttplate, which was actually standard on all models prior to 1904, could be special ordered for the .405, but few were produced, because as one customer wrote, “It kills at both ends.”"

In fact I have had it for a few years and never shot it. The gentleman that I got it from claims that he never shot it either, but since I cannot say with one hundred percent certainty that the gun was never fired we will just say that it has a verrrrrrrrry low round count on it. The gun is a POF Puritan 7.62x39 on the AR-15 platform. It has a 16 1/2in. 4150 chromoly steel barrel, that POF claims will shoot one MOA. The gas block has different settings, one is for suppressed, another for unsuppressed, and one that is off. It says that in the off selection that the gun basically performs like a bolt action. The bolt of the gun is chrome plated, the bolt carrier is nickel-plated. There are a bunch of different parts on the gun that actually make the gun corrosion-resistant. The trigger is a single stage, 5 1/2 pound pull. It has a brand new Leupold VX-1 2-7x33 with leupold rings for optics. Since I have never shot the gun, the optic is not sighted in. I did laser bore sight it, but it will need to be fine tuned on the range. The gun is also fully decked out with MAGPUL products. Buttstock, trigger guard, grip, and hand guard. Comes with one 28 round magazine and 100 rounds steel cased 7.62x39.Needless to say this is a good ""upper-class"" entry AR15. It is much better built that all of your cheaper rifles. This rifle is not in production anymore, but when it was they were asking $1499 for it. Don't low ball me with offers and I am not interested in any trades. $1200 as it sits, obo.Text two5four-913-one24nine"
