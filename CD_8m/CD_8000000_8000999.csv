This Luger is in great shape, I bought it from Bob Maddix and if you need any help with a Luger he is the guy to go to his card will be included.It does shoot well, I put 100 rounds through it to ensure it still works. Worked well, but I've realized I need a more practical handgun as more of my family members are becoming interested in shooting and the P08 Luger while an awesome piece of art and fun to shoot is not as newbie friendly for teaching beginners the basics of handguns. I am also more interested in other pistols at the moment namely a few revolvers mentioned below. I think this piece deserves to go to someone who isn't constantly tempted to get it refinished, I am worried about possibly rusting so trying to trade for stainless guns or ones with better rust resistance, also looking for guns with easier to find spare parts, and preferably still in production.
