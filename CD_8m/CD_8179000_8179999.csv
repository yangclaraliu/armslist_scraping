Hogue G10 AR grips will even fit any other firearm that uses standard AR15 / M16 grips. Our G10 AR grips have been specifically designed to work with our CMS (Cargo Management System) kits, as well as with Samson AR15 field kits. G10 grips are precision machined from the highest quality G10 material available to exacting specifications. G10 is a high-pressure thermoset plastic laminate consisting of multiple layers of woven fiberglass mesh cloth impregnated with an epoxy resin binder. It can be produced with many layers of the same color, or different colors to achieve a specific cosmetic look. Typical G10 is made of only flat layers. Hogue Inc. has a new patented method of producing G10 material called G-Mascus®. This method produces different patterns within the colored material which produces a unique look. Grips made in this style take on a similar look to Damascus steel, hence the name G-Mascus. Our G10 grips are designed for a lifetime of use. – Fits: AR15 / M16 Piranha Grip, G Mascus  – Color: Black/Gray"

Field armory repaired original buttstock and rarer reinforced joint splices on butt. Original wartime stock, I have known people who've had the uncracked basically new M39's and the stocks cracked because it's pretty normal for the series of rifle due to the nature of the grain pattern of wood - the armory repaired version is actually sturdier and better reinforced for shooting, finding them with original armory repairs is uncommon, and is considered higher end than an unrepaired one, or civilian repair. What makes this rifle more rare is that it was partially blued in the less common burgundy bluing color under the stock, I believe the rest was removed/polished by conscripts post-war to reblue the rifle. The rifle would have probably then gotten a post-war stock and reblued but didn't.This rifle also includes a very rare SKY civil guard marked sling."

The N-PAP DF has a custom fit slot muzzle break, wolf spring kit, Tapco G2 trigger and Hogue furniture with picatinny rails for adding accessories. This M85 pistol is “NOT” the M85 PV that’s commonly available and uses a proprietary steel magazine that’s heavy and expensive too boot. This is the very sought out version that excepts standard AR-15 magazines and drums. Also included is a brand new SBM-47 stabilizing brace from SB-Tactical, a $150 value. These are no longer being made anymore and becoming harder to find and quite collectible, especially in this condition. Not to mention they will only increase in value like the Chinese Mac 90s did. Both firearms are in “FACTORY BRAND NEW UNFIRED CONDITION”. The M85 is still in it’s original box with tags. This is a package deal and I will “NOT” split them up. I’m not interested in trades unless it’s an M1 Garand in very good condition with minimal throat & muzzle erosion and a pristine barrel with sharp rifling. Only reason I’m thinking of selling is because I would like to add an M1 Garand to my Collection. Asking price is $1700 and the price is firm. Bill of sale and FL drivers license required. All federal and state laws apply, not willing to deal with persons under the age of 21 or convicted felons. CWP holders preferred. I’ll only meet you FTF in a public place during the day light hours for your safety and mine, preferably @ my local gun range or something similar. Located in Melbourne FL.

The N-PAP DF has a custom fit slot muzzle break, wolf spring kit, Tapco G2 trigger and Hogue furniture with picatinny rails for adding accessories. This M85 pistol is “NOT” the M85 PV that’s commonly available and uses a proprietary steel magazine that’s heavy and expensive too boot. This is the very sought out version that excepts standard AR-15 magazines and drums. Also included is a brand new SBM-47 stabilizing brace from SB-Tactical, a $150 value. These are no longer being made anymore and becoming harder to find and quite collectible, especially in this condition. Not to mention they will only increase in value like the Chinese Mac 90s did. Both firearms are in “FACTORY BRAND NEW UNFIRED CONDITION”. The M85 is still in it’s original box with tags. This is a package deal and I will “NOT” split them up. I’m not interested in trades unless it’s an M1 Garand in very good condition, would make for a great shooter with minimal throat & muzzle erosion and a pristine barrel with sharp rifling would be ideal. Only reason I’m thinking of selling is because I would like to add an M1 Garand to my Collection. Asking price is $1700 and the price is firm. Bill of sale and FL drivers license required. All federal and state laws apply, not willing to deal with persons under the age of 21 or convicted felons. CWP holders preferred. I’ll only meet you FTF in a public place during the day light hours for your safety and mine, preferably @ my local gun range or something similar. Located in Melbourne FL.

This custom designed enhanced forging is machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and compatible with all mil-spec AR15 parts. Aside from the visual upgrades this custom engineered design provides that challenge much more expensive billet options, we have added several functional features to the lower receiver to simplify the assembly process for the at home builder. M4E1 Lower Receiver Improvements:  Threaded Bolt Catch Roll Pin - Allows for simple installation of the bolt catch and virtually eliminates the chance to damage the finish during installation (pin included). 1/16"" Hex Key required for assembly. Integrated Trigger Guard - Eliminates the possibility of breaking the trigger guard tabs by integrating the trigger guard into the lower, creating a stronger more rigid platform to build upon. Upper Tension Screw - Allows users to fine tune the fit of the upper and lower receiver using a nylon tipped tensioning set screw inserted in the grip tang of the lower receiver. This provides a tight fit with any standard AR15 upper receiver. Threaded Takedown Pin Detent Recess - Allows user to easily install the Takedown Pin detent and spring with the use of a 4-40 set screw (no more launching detents across the room). Increased Magwell Flare - Increased the flare of the Magwell to aid in quick and efficient magazine changes. Marked and milled to accept short-throw safety selectors, but will work with standard selectors as well.  Includes:  Stripped M4E1 Lower Receiver Nylon tipped tensioning set screw Threaded Bolt Catch Pin"

This Rifle did not come with the original magazine and has a magtech replacement magazine that works great. This rifle also from what I can tell stayed in service long after WW2 ended with it having a FR on the stock for Factory Repair and the buttplate has been replaced with a pewter one from a brass one which leads me to believe that it was in India for FR because it was common for the Indian workers to take the brass buttplates and sell it for scarp and replace it with a cheaper solution. The Rifle also still has rack numbers of 34 on the side of it."
