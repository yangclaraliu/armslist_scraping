I am uncertain of the manufacturer however it does appear to be the same reproduction that use to be sold on numerous reputable sights like Nurmrich which have since ""sold out.""  They claim it is manufactured using original drawings and high-tech optics machinery.  This came with a recent K43 that I purchased but I don't have any use for.  It appears to be fairly new, in great condition.  It does have some very faint scratches, mainly where it was mounted, however no dents or major cosmetic defects.  The optics are crystal clear without any dust, fog, haze or scratches.           *Scope includes 3-post German/European crosshairs, period markings featuring ""ZF K43 dow /_\""  and is collimated with a pre-setting of zero/300.  Elevation turret is marked in 50 meter increments from 100 to 800 meters.           *Windage turret includes nine hash marks consisting of a center mark with four marks on each side for left and right adjustment.  Of note, there are 3 flat-head screws holding end plates in place on the windage and elevation turrets.  These can be removed which reveal internal components used for crude adjustment of the sights to mechanical zero of the rifle.  Once roughly inline, they can be placed back on, then the knobs used for finer adjustment until zeroed.           *There are two clicks between each mark for half MOA movements. I allow SHIPPING to any of 48 continental US States and request 10$ for shipping.  I accept payments through PayPal or can meet for local pickup with cash.  Thank you for looking!"

This is a 2nd model with all of the correct early features such as; A screwed on dust cover rail, visible trigger pin, and tang retention screws on the receiver sides. Also notice the lack of a caliber designation marking on the barrel and carrier block. The 38-40 and 32-20 were not introduced until later in the 1882-1883 period, all early 44 caliber rifles were not labeled ""44 WCF"" as this was the default caliber. This is a fine and untouched rifle with only honest wear. The receiver retains a lot of bright original bluing with some corner wear and old finish loss.

It is made somewhere around 1880 so no FFL is required and it is not subject to normal firearm laws. It was more than likely carried by a bank teller in their vest. It has pretty neat engravings showing the craftsmanship that was put into this. Bought for $500 from Joe Salter a year or so ago. Can provide more pictures upon request and there is no rust on this pistol. If you can see this listing, it is still available. Open to offers."

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

This savage 308 wears a fine quality bushnell scope. The scope was $389 but can be found on EBay around $175-200 these days. The gun was $700 when new. They usually sell for more than that on auction sites these days. In fact, they pop up on gunbroker about 1-2 times a year in 308, and sell for an average of $875 with no scope (last 5 years of ended auctions).  I have seen one go for as high as $1150 with no scope.  Still, by my calculator, Roughly an $1100 package.  Definately something you won't see often.Nearly all Savage bolt rifles have the same threading and barrel nut too, so you can take any old beat up woods gun, cut the barrel down, swap barrel and bolt face and change calibers. 308 strikers are pretty rare though.  Most 308 strikers are guns converted TO 308 and wont have the stainless barrel and muzzle break. Still fun as he'll though."

However, there is a chip in the barrel at the forcing cone and as is, I would not fire it. Additionally, I have a civilian model of the exact same thing. A colt DA 38. It is fully functional but could be refinished. Finally i have a 4.5"" barrel. I considered putting the barrel from the civilian gun on the army, and the short barrel on the civilian gun. If that were done the pair would be worth around $1500. Maybe more. They could be parted out on eBay for more than that...if you are ok with tearing apart pieces of history.

This is the same rifle issued to the Italian military due to it's accuracy and compatability. Selling because I really have no use for it. Would prefer to sell it to someone who wil enjoy this fun rifle. Description from sale site:
The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all.
This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction."
