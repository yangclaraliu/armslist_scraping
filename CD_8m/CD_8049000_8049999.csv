This gun is extremely light for perfect carry.  The original factory grips are very small and the concensus is to replace them with the grips Hogue has designed for this gun. I have done that and also include the original factory grip.  Comes with a very nice IWB kydex holster.  All the factory stuff, including the soft case and lock.  I found a Sig 238 I want more so this one has to go.I've already lowered my price to $375.  Over $475 in the gun. It's NEW, NEW, NEW.  Don't offer less, I'll just ignore you.  NO TRADES. I have to fund the Sig.  Call or text REDACTED"

In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.  The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.”"

If you want to know my best price, it is $360, but you can buy it for $225 unless you want to negotiate and then you can buy it for $360.The scope is boresighted. It is has not been zeroed in. Tragically when I got around to shoot this gun the other day, I really needed it to hit what I was shooting at. The other problem that I had, the magazine will allow +1, but it won’t feed properly. If you have problems, make sure that you only have 4 rounds in the mag and not 5.I always have the wrong gun with me. I just ordered an expensive scope for my AR15. From now on, I will keep the AR with me when I am out on the farm looking for beaver and the like. Trade? What you got? I don’t need any more long guns. I don’t need any more pistols, but I have a thing for 1911s. I’ve pretty much had it with Taurus, but I’ll at least consider it. From the Dick’s website.

The pistol was completely stripped and everything was blasted with 120grit aluminum oxide as suggested by cerakote. It is the air dry cerakote which is actually more durable and withstands higher temperatures than the oven cure stuff. As mentioned, I do not have to get rid of this. It just sits in the safe and has only had 3 magazines through it since refinished. The pistol will come with 2 magazines. I will only sell, trade to KENTUCKY RESIDENTS 21 and over with valid ID.
