I purchased this fine, affordable weapon about 6-8 months ago,  I've taken it out twice, put maybe 150-200 rounds through it.  I've disassembled and cleaned it twice and it's currently clean as a whistle and oiled up nicely.  Included with the deal is a rifle/shotgun cleaning kit I've used twice,  a rifle bag (Allen Brand), an almost full bottle of remington oil, a belt/bandolier that holds 25 shells.
  Also, The reciept of purchase(purchased in Washington), gun lock, and all original paperwork and owners manual.  ALSO included is a full box (100 rounds) of Winchester #7 bird/clay shot, another half box of it, about 40 rounds of awesome RIO brand spanish 00 buckshot 2 3/4"" 9 shot(shoulder thumpers), About 30 rounds of RIO brand rifled slugs 2 3/4"",  I think I have a small box of S&B 00 Buckshot too, maybe 15 rounds.I purchased it for home defense and used it for a bit of recreation.  It's practically brand new and the only reason I'm selling it is because im going to be traveling and living on the road for a while and I'm going with other options for personal defense.  You can buy the Maverick 88 brand new online for $200 and I'm asking $175 for a practically new one with everything else you need to buy to use it and maintain it. The extras are worth about 70$ the ammo is worth about 80-100$   Price is firm, Buyer picks the gun store in the Portland area and pays the transfer fee.  It's a smoking hot deal priced to sell fast.  Jump on it quick and pleeeeaaaasee don't waste my time.
 
Call or Text me at REDACTED,  Tell me what gun shop is near you, you can take a look at it and we'll set up the transfer.
 
Thanks,

It is in VG+ condition considering it is 102 years old, matching, and in good working order. It comes with its original magazine The SMLE MK III 1916 was the standard issue rifle throughout the British army when the war began in 1914. While its large magazine, fast operating bolt, short and handy size, charger loading, and good ergonomics made it well suited for trench warfare; it was a bit too expensive and time consuming to produce in the numbers needed at the time. So in 1915, the MK III* pattern was accepted as a wartime economy. Really not much changed, except unnecessary features like the magazine feed cut off and volley sights were removed. Later, the windage knob on the rear sight would also go away, and late in the war the cocking piece would be simplified. Just little things like that but the rifles remained every bit as reliable, durable, and accurate as ever. My sell price is $700.00 will not last long, they do not come up for sale very often, Sale or Trade, looking for Pistol .No low ballers."

Rifle is in overall great shape, few typical dings and scratches you find on old surplus rifles. Rifle's serial numbers match, except for magazine plate which is forced matched, scope mount and scope are missmatched. Rifle has the correct Tula factory markings for sniper use, but likely lost it's original scope during the refurbishment process. It shoots very accurately but the mount needs adjusting, currently if I place the scope at around 300 yards it will shoot dead on at 100 yards, easy fix but I need money for an upcoming move so decided to sell it instead. The scope itself is potentially one of the oldest in the USA, it was produced at the No. 3 Kharkov plant in 1940, No. 3 Kharkov was the plant that originally started the PU scope production, they only made roughly 5500 scopes in 1940, this one is No. 4460, meaning it was also originally intended for an SVT 40 but placed on a 91/30 at some point down the line. Scope optics are clear and scope itself is in great shape. Will include scope cover, scope caps, attached sling and Mosin cleaning kit.Willing to drive a reasonable distance from Reading. Please no trades, I'm prepairing to move west and I could use the extra money for hotels and gas. If you don't like my price, make me an offer, all reasonable offers will be considered.

Importation ceased in 1968 due to the passage of stricter gun-control laws in the U.S. Another version, the Model 1971, featured a longer barrel and slide (similar in length to the Model 1922, but with a one-piece slide), adjustable sights, a finger-rest magazine, and enlarged ""target"" grips. These features were intended to comply with the Gun Control Act of 1968 which had halted import of the Model 1955.  ****READ BELOW.

Bought extra mag. Took it to the range. Fired about half a mag and decided 40cal was too much gun for him to carry. I traded to him another pistol he wanted to carry. I've never fired this pistol. It went into my safe and has been there a few years. Probably 5 years. I will make PISTOL BUYER a great deal on ammo to go with it. 512 rounds of Winchester, Federal, Hornady, and PMC $125.00.

Fortunately, it wasn't just any knife, and Jim wasn't just any man. Although shot, stabbed and pistol whipped by his foes, Jim used this knife of his own design to gut one man and slash a chunk from the arm of another, and lived to tell the tale. Jim would finally meet his end, overwhelmed by hordes while defending the Alamo. But the knife, which the world would come to know as ""the Bowie"", would live on, becoming America's most famous contribution to edged combat.The ZT Felon is our homage to the badassery of big Jim Bowie and the American knifemaking tradition. In typical ZT style, it's a big fucking chunk of steel, 20-inches long with a 12-inch edge, the classic clip tip with false edge, and a handle big enough for a gorilla's grip. At 2 pounds weight and a quarter-inch thick, the blade is heavy enough for a vicious slash, but long enough for classic cut-and-thrust swordplay. It even has a hammer point along the spine for working through a tough chunk of wood or the sinews of a unicorn. Be warned that wielding this knife will land you in the houscow in several Southern states (careful where you carry, Texans), but come the apocalypse, the Felon makes its own law."

Turns out the gun store was out of the C308 the day I went in for it so I settled for the Vepr and have slightly regretted it ever since. The long and the short of it is that it's been a joy to shoot, but it doesn't quite fit what I wanted out of it. Mags aren't the easiest to find and certainly aren't as cheap as the ammo to stuff in them. Definitely a great cool factor that it kinda looks like a SVD, but doesn't whet my whistle like it once did."

It is marked with the sitting fox stamp which was used by the Northwest Trading Company. This was the most popular of the smoothbores and was also referred to as the ""London Fusil, Hudsons Bay Fuke and the Mackinaw Gun"". Note: it has the large trigger guard used on trade guns for the Native Peoples of the Americas, the dragon or snake on the other side of the lock and of course the sitting fox. It also has a nice amount of trade tacks which was the last of the trade items when dealing with the trading post and gave rise to the statement of ""getting done to brass tacks"". This gun is in need of a few screws and a new main spring, and a portion of the pan but the parts are minor and the worth after repair will be higher than the cost.  It is most probably a 28 guage smoothbore and the overall lenght of this gun from the but to the end of barrel is 47 inches. Since this is a black poweder rifle and I live in Gerogia I will ship this gun but YOU will be responisble for making sure it meets all legals requirements for your state. I will accept paypal but you will have to pay the fees and shipping and handling is not included in the asking price. I will listen to offers but I will not work with scammers of hold any checks.

The light reflections in the pictures do not do this sight justice, as it looks great.Please email any questionsTrade will be given preference if it is PARTIAL trade toward 5.56 BDC Trijicon ACOG with green crosshairs. Other trade may be considered. Please consider the following: This is a $3000 retail sight, you can find it for around $2000 +/- in the right places, I recognise and understand this. That is why my price is a fair $1500. If you are going to ask for a REDICULOUS full retail value on your trade offer, then my trade value will go up to a rediculous retail value as well... so please dont tell me YOUR 5.56 ACOG is worth $1100-$1200 or more when they are selling all over the interned every day for $850-$950. And the same applies to your other offers, you CANNOT expect me to give you FULL RETAIL for your trade, but still offer you the Fair $1500 on my ACOG. Sorry for the rant, but it seemed necessary. So if YOUR binary trigger trade value is $500, then my ACOG value is $4000."

The XCR is truly modular.With one XCR-L Lower Receiver (the serialized part), the operator can configure the XCR as a shorty for close quarters combat, a light weight carbine, or a longer marksman’s rifle.The XCR-L’s quick change barrel system is unmatched in terms of ease of use and repeatability. Barrel and caliber changes can be made in less than 5 minutes.The XCR is the most ergonomic rifle available. Professional users report that the XCR has the fastest magazine change and clearing times of any rifle.Whether the rifle is supported by the right or left hand, the operator can manipulate all the controls while keeping his eyes on target and index finger near the trigger.Local transaction ONLY.
