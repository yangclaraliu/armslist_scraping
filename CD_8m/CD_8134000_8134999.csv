All who had the opportunity to shoot it agreed it is the answer to many of the complaints heard from original LCP owners—most notably the minimalist sights and long double-action trigger pull. Besides those two upgrades, Ruger replaced the plastic guide rod with one that is polished stainless steel. Best of all, these custom features come along without an inflated price tag. This one comes with one magazine and is in fair shape. 80%plus.For more info or to buy online click.......... RUGERLCP"

To really aprreciate this rifle, it has to be seen and shot in person. It is on believablely accurate with a very very soft trigger which is also adjustable. The only bad about the rifle is the scope, i am not selling the one i originally had on it so it wil be coming with the one in the picture. Other than that this rifle is true bueaty and qulaity. Also, i have 103 rounds through it and and i will sell whatever ammo i have left for it.  As this is posted, it is for sale but if i could avoid selling it somehow along the way i will. price may be negotiable"

I purchesed it new in the summer of 2016. It's in Like New condition with barely any scuffing. I've put less than 300 rounds through it and have cleaned it regularly and kept it in it's original box. The original trigger jiggled and made a clinking noise inside it's housing so I changed it out for a Wilson Combat Ultralight Match (Standard) trigger which is black and looks better in my opinion. It now fits snug and pulls smoothly without any clinking or jiggling. It comes with everything in the original box (including manual) as well as a 7round Wilson Combat extended magazine. You'll also get an excellent condition Alien Gear Cloak Tuck IWB Holster, tan, leather (right-handed orientation). Everything comes with all the original tools and parts. The gun has never failed on me and I've used several types of ammo, new & repacked. I'm selling because it isn't financially wise to keep such a nice gun when I don't get out and shoot it more often. I paid $900 originally (just for the gun) so with all the extras this is an excellent deal."

Here's an interesting and fairly scarce Colt pistol. This is an early post-war Colt Government Model .45 automatic. This pistol is among the very first Government Models made following the end of World War Two and exhibits some interesting features not found on any other Colt .45. The very first post-war .45 was serial number C220001...this is serial number C220810.
Always fiscally conscious, Colt seldom disposed of workable parts. Colt had many slides, barrels and other military components left over from war-time 1911A1 production. These parts were worked into commercial production as a cost saving measure. Only the earliest post-war commercial pistols are found with these military components. This pistol has the war-time slide which is rollmarked in the military style on the left but also in the commercial fashion on the right...the Colt ""prancing pony"" appears on both sides! The rollmarkings are slightly faint, which is normal even on an original finish pistol. The hammer, slide stop, safety, mainspring housing w/ lanyard loop, and stamped trigger are military as well. The grips are likewise WWII Colt plastic. The barrel is correct late WWII production marked ""COLT 45 AUTO"" beneath the chamber with a small ""F"" in front of the lugs. The top of the barrel chamber is polished ""in the white"" as was customary on commercial pistols. This pistol is in very good overall condition although it does show some normal finish wear from use. The finish on the slide shows a bit more thinning than does the frame and there are some handling marks and various fine scratches scattered about. There are a few tiny freckles here and there but nothing significant and no pitting. The frame's feed ramp is correctly milled ""in the white"", a good indicator of original finish. Internal wear patterns are consistent between frame/barrel/slide and they appear to be original to one another. The grips are in excellent shape, free of cracks or chips. The mechanics appear to be in good working order and the bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. It comes with a WWII ""Scoville Mfg Co"" contract magazine. This hard to find Colt .45 variation can be found in the serial range C220001-C222000 and was made between October, 1946-January 1947."

No manual safety. The trigger acts as the safety. 6+1 capacity. Only 3 rounds fired through it. Bought for my wife for conceal and carry, but she changed her mind. Don't need. Has 2 extra grip extentions, so it will fit just about any size hand. 3 boxes of ammo and black hard plastic gun case go with it. I have $178 in the gun; $50 in the ammo; $20 in the extra grip extensions and $10 in the gun case = $258. Yes, the gun is used, but everything is still worth what I'm asking. Let me know if you're interested by calling. Call any time: REDACTED."

The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes standard STANAG magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing the side-folding Pistol Stabilizing Brace. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers familiar AR-style controls. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety, magazine release and charging handle.LOG:46051SKU:PMCX-11B-PSBUPC:798681567546"

I have a stainless xds 45 4.0 only 100 rounds through it, also a Marlin 336 30-30 brand new only 20 rounds put through. I love these guns but sadly had a hard hit in the account so need to let these go (definately in no rush). Id prefer to sell together if possible for 900 OBO. Both are in excellent condition and almost (might as well be brand new). The 30-30 will come with a box of ammo and sling. The XDS will come with 50 HPs and its original box and papers, 2 6 rnd mags. Prices I will only budge on a price to sell together at 900 OBO, but to sell separately I will not take less then 450 each, possible incentive. Throw me an offer all I can say is no. Now for trade the only thing im looking for is a STAINLESS HK P30SK, VP9SK, glock 19,26, fns 9c, or my most desirable, a Beretta (compact carry) (G) model in 9mm or 40, but with that, trade value STAYS @ $900, so it will be the trade plus 400 cash.
