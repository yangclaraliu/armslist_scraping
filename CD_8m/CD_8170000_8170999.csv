He purchased it new in California several years ago for personal defense and shot it on occasion at indoor shooting ranges. He has since passed away. I kept it for a while as sentimental value, but have decided to sell it. Seems like a nice gun. I shot it once. Powerful for the caliber size. Also takes some other types of less expensive rounds--like .32 S&W, but you probably know that if you're reading this ad. Not real sure of the value, so I'll just put a price and take the best offer. Asking $400/obo. Thanks, Carl""The Ruger SP101 SP-3231X was chambered for .32 H&R Magnum. However, the six chambers of the SP101 KSP-32731X provides about one-eighth inch of additional space to accommodate .327 Federal Magnum ammunition. This is a new cartridge developed by Federal and Ruger that seats a 0.312-inch diameter bullet atop a taller, stronger case that they measured to be just less than 1.2 inches long."""

I can send as many pics as needed just ask.Egyptian Maadi Pars RML ak-47 akm in great shape. This is one of the closest ak’s to a kalishnikov you can get. These are getting harder and harder to find. They were imported in the U.S. between 1993-1995. Some came in with a 16” barrel and some with 20” bbl. this one has the 20” bbl. This rifle is NOT a parts kit. All numbers are matching. I believe the sling is from the factory. Email me and I will send more pics as armslist will only let me post one. Have a great day! Little more info on the rifle.Egyptian Maadi AK47’s One of the only semi-automatic Kalashnikov imported into the United States, in almost every regard, an exact duplicate of the Russian AKM. During the 1950’s the Soviet Union, as part of its military aid program, established the production of Soviet-pattern small arms in the Arab Republic of Egypt. AKM rifles were manufactured at the “Factory 54,” the Maadi Company for Engineering Industries in Cairo. Key Egyptian personnel were trained in the Soviet Union, and the plant was supervised by Russians prior to their abrupt expulsion from Egypt at the hands of Anwar Sadat in 1972. Designated as the “ARM” (Automatic Rifle Misr), a semiautomatic-only version of the Egyptian AKM was introduced to the American public in 1982 by the U.S. division of Steyr-Daimler-Punch in Steyr, Austria. For all intents and purposes this is as close as most of us will ever come to a Russian AKM. The laminated wood handguards and buttstock are correct in every detail. The lower handguard has the proper hand swells, and the buttstock has been reinforced with steel pins in all the right places. All the wood furniture was imported from Finland but finished in Egypt. The plastic pistol grip was injection-molded to correct Soviet configuration. The metal components are exactly those of the Russian AKM. Small recesses on each side of the receiver , directly over the magazine-well, serve as magazine guides and instantly distinguish this as an AKM. The four gas escapes holes found on each side of the Ak-47’s gas cylinder have been omitted, and there are two gas relief holes on each side of the gas block where it mates with the gas tube.Rear sights are graduated to 1000 meters (with a 300-meter battle sight marked “p”) instead of the AK-47’s 800meter maximum. The sheet-metal receiver cover has transverse ribs and a rolled edge over the ejection port. Chambers and bores are hard chromed. All the exterior metal surfaces have been finished with a baked on black enamel over phosphate. Only the green web sling was of Egyptian design."

The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier. Among its advantages, its bull pup configuration- the rear center of gravity enables a rapid acquisition of the target and provides the ability to fire the weapon with one hand. The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available. The Tavor SAR Rifle is a complete platform that comprises optical devices and other accessories, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the XXI century.

The Mobilchoke barrel is designed to shrug off the pounding of heavy hunting loads, giving you a long-lasting tool that will work as hard as you need it to. But in spite of its toughness, the A300 is light, feels lively in the hands and easily follows your eyes to the target, thanks to the low-profile action. And its impeccable balance make it feel even lighter than its 7.25 lbsEasy-to-MaintainEasy to MaintainThis shotgun is the perfect embodiment of Beretta’s philosophy about maintenance: easy, quick and tool-free. The A300 Outlander breaks down into four major components, making it simple to take apart and clean even under less-than-ideal field conditions. Also, the self-cleaning gas piston makes this shotgun shoot much cleaner than other actions, giving you more durability as well as less work keeping it in perfect shape even after a hard day’s hunting or clay-shooting. Overall, the A300 Outlander is today’s best value in a semi-automatic shotgun, and a worthy heir to Beretta’s legendary 300 line."
