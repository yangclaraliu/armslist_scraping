I've ran between 3-500 rounds through this thing, and loved it...if you've thought about getting one, here's your chance!Text me at REDACTED for the most immediate response.Buds has the gun currently at $1,234.97 plus tax, and the Vortex Venom is $230 in most stores.  My price is beyond reasonable, and I don't need the cash.  Low-ball offers will be ignored or responded to with sarcasm and derision.  =)
I do have a *few* things I'd be willing to trade for, but very few (cash can go either direction, depending on the value of the trades):
-- CZ P-09 9mm WITH THREADED BARREL (if it isn't threaded, I don't want it - I'm only getting it to shoot with a can so can't use the unthreaded). -- Precision grade AR style 6.5 Creedmoor (this is a maybe, at best.  I am looking for a sub 1/2 MOA 6.5 Creedmoor rifle, I like the AR platform, and I have a shooting range in my back yard...I'd want to see your gun perform to ensure it does what I'm asking for.  This isn't to say I don't trust you or your gun, I just want something very specific here).-- Benelli M4-- Good condition M1 Garand -- High-quality 300 Blackout (pistol preferred).Trade values should be based on MSRP or readily-available purchase values of each package (i.e. don't expect me to take a bath on my gun while you are trading above-value for yours, and I'll treat you with the same respect).
All of the guns above are on my purchase list, so I'd be willing to look at what you have for a trade.  
Also, I am selling the additonal guns, if you have any interest:Stainless Remington 700  chambered in 300 Remington Ultra Mag (I also have a couple hundred brass that can come with this)FNP 40 in black, with backstraps and 3 high-capacity magazinesNorinco SKS Paratrooper Rifle that accepts AK-47 Magazines (SKS-M or SKS Sporter) - manufactured from the factory to accept the AK mags - this wasn't a conversion)

Excellent condition. Includes nice holster and two mags.Late 1981-production (Serial Number 676,048), very accurate, fun-to-shoot CZ 70 (vz. 70) pistol in excellent condition. Comes with a brown leather holster for the CZ 70 and two eight-round magazines. The predecessor of CZ 70, the post war Model 1950 (CZ 50), was designed by two brothers, Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl, at CZ (Česká zbrojovka) and chambered in caliber 7.65mm (.32 ACP). CZ 50 combined the excellent features of the German Walther PP and PPK pistols. The early CZ 50 pistols were manufactured at the Strakonice Factory in 1950-1952. After a lapse of four years, production of the CZ 50 was resumed at Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod in 1957. The vz. 50 (commercially sold as CZ 50) is an all steel semi-automatic pistol made in Czechoslovakia. It is chambered in the plentiful 7.65mm (.32 ACP) caliber. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is traditional double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed and the magazine is single stacked with a capacity of 8 rounds. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. In 1970, the CZ 50 underwent a large cosmetic change and modernization, and was renamed the vz. 70 (CZ 70). The Model 1970 was issued primarily to police personnel and higher-ranking military officers. The vz. 70 was available in various finishes and engraved. The vz. 70 was produced in relatively large quantities. The exact number is not known at present; however, in our collection we have a CZ 70 pistol with serial number of 127,875 and one with serial number of 676,048). Although made at the Přesné strojírenství factory (in Uherský Brod) and not at the Česká Zbrojovka factory, this vz. 70, dated 81 (1981) has the model designation and CZ emblem on the side. In 1982, CZ 70 was replaced with an altogether new design (CZ 82)."

Worn finish but in good condition for age. 1959-production, very accurate, fun-to-shoot CZ 50 (vz. 50) pistol in great condition, with nice patina. Comes with two brown leather holsters for the CZ 50 and two eight-round magazines. The post war Model 1950 was designed by two brothers, Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl, at CZ (Česká zbrojovka) and chambered in caliber 7.65mm (.32 ACP). CZ 50 combined the excellent features of the German Walther PP and PPK pistols. The early CZ 50 pistols were manufactured at the Strakonice Factory (serial numbers 650,001–740,000). Production of the CZ 50 at Strakonice started in 1950 and lasted until 1952, when priority was given to production of the new Czechoslovak Army pistol, the vz. 52. After a lapse of four years, production of the CZ 50 was resumed at Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod in 1957. CZ 50 pistols manufactured at Uherský Brod have 5-digit serial numbers preceded by a letter (which may change in the middle of a number series). Our pistol, with serial number B25950, was manufactured in 1959. The vz. 50 (commercially sold as CZ 50) is an all steel semi-automatic pistol made in Czechoslovakia. It is chambered in the plentiful 7.65mm (.32 ACP) caliber. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is traditional double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed and the magazine is single stacked with a capacity of 8 rounds. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. CZ 50 pistols were sold commercially, but most were distributed to police agencies under control of the Ministry of the Interior."

Includes two mags and two holsters. Pistol is in very good condition overall. Finish wear as expected considering the age of the firearm. We have an early 1950-production, very accurate, fun-to-shoot CZ 50 (vz. 50) pistol in great condition, with a nice patina. Comes with two brown leather holsters for the CZ 50 and two eight-round magazines. The post war Model 1950 was designed by two brothers, Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl, at CZ (Česká zbrojovka) and chambered in caliber 7.65mm (.32 ACP). CZ 50 combined the excellent features of the German Walther PP and PPK pistols. Serial numbers of the CZ 50 started at 650,001 (Serial Number of our pistol is 652,983), which was a continuation of the terminated CZ 27 pistol. The early CZ 50 pistols were manufactured at the Strakonice Factory with serial numbers ending in the 740,000 range. Production of the CZ 50 at Strakonice started in 1950 and lasted until 1952, when priority was given to production of the new Czechoslovak Army pistol, the vz. 52. After a lapse of four years, production of the CZ 50 was resumed at Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod in 1957. CZ 50 pistols manufactured at Uherský Brod have 5-digit serial numbers preceded by a letter (which may change in the middle of a number series). The vz. 50 (commercially sold as CZ 50) is an all steel semi-automatic pistol made in Czechoslovakia. It is chambered in the plentiful 7.65mm (.32 ACP) caliber. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is traditional double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed and the magazine is single stacked with a capacity of 8 rounds. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. CZ 50 pistols were sold commercially, but most were distributed to police agencies under control of the Ministry of the Interior."
