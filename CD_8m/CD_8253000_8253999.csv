Gardone Val Trompia manufactured. 6.5 Carcano. This is the Carbine with an underfolding bayonet and has a transitionary bayonet catch that uses a lever instead of the later pushbutton and earlier lug style making it somewhat rare. There is a crack that has been repaired behind the receiver tang and the rear sling attachment in the buttstock has been filled. A handy rifle given to mounted, paratrooper, mechanized, and alpine Italian troops. 1942 Round receiver wartime production so its kind of neat to see the rough machining. Tula Arsenal. All matching. Comes with bayonet, tool kit, sling, cleaning rod, and cleaning kit. 2 stripper clips
1938 round receiver peacetime production and it shows in the machining of its round receiver, especially when compared to its wartime counterparts. Tula Arsenal. Matching bolt and receiver but force matched magazine floor plate. Comes with a sling and cleaning rod. 2 stripper clips
1926 hex receiver. These are a world apart in my opinion from the round receivers. The soviet stampings are far more refined. These were built on much older 1891 dragoon and full size rifle receivers. Also has an imperial tsarist eagle on the receiver so clearly from before 1917 originally. Tula Arsenal. Matching bolt and receiver but force matched magazine floor plate. Comes with bayonet, sling, tool kit, and cleaning kit. 1 stripper clip
As stated, I would prefer to keep all of them together. I bought these over a period of time in order to eventually build a complete collection. These each have different types of receivers that reflect the decade they were built. They also have all three types of 91/30 stock sling variations represented. partial metal pressed, full metal pressed, and full metal screwed. As a result I've enjoyed them as representative of a broad range of 91/30 types and a modest collection that can be built upon with other mosin nagant models. They just seem to work as a set.With any milsurp rifle, its impossible to say for certain but I believe that all four of these guns certainly saw action in at least one world war and in the case of my imperial russian receiver mosin and the carcano, even earlier. The Mosin being pre 1917 and  Italy getting busy in east and north Africa in the late 30s. I believe I have priced the set for less than individual asking prices here and eleswhere. I might consider selling individually at a higher per unit cost.Thank you for taking the time, Im happy to answer any questions you might have and can of course provide more pictures by request."

I also have seven sealed mags that are metal with the Magpul followers and special Springs all the mags are around $12.50 a piece.

I will take $8 a piece on the mags and 300 on the ammo considering $300 normally buys a thousand rounds online  but this is straight up out of the boxes actually paid 750 each for each box of 20  I wish I had known I could get it that cheap in bulk. but what I'm offering I think is a very fair deal $300 for 1325 rounds and the magazines are $8 a piece.  If you want to buy everything the ammo in the magazines I will do it for $420!!  that's 18 brand-spanking-new magazines even though some of them are open you will be able to tell they have not been worn or used at all flawless! I fired each magazine maybe twice some of them haven't even been used it all!  that's how short of a time I own them. I bought them for my AR-15 firearm.  The price for all of it I think is more than fair  and you will be winning out big time compared to having to buy magazines full price and the full price on the ammo all together you're making out fantastic. Serious offers only.  TRADES... if you have any 45 Auto ammo I would take a trade on my ammo or magazines or both! trade value is going to be different than cash value as you know but it will be fair just like I'm sure you will want a fair value for your 45 Auto ammo! so let me know what you guys have serious inquiries only. you can sell some of the mags if you don't want them all....  or have enough magazines and some of them sealed that will last you forever and you won't have to reload at the range... call me for cash price for either or both together..

The dream sidearm for every member was the Hitler Youth knife (fahrtenmesser).   This knife, like much of the equipment used during this time, underwent a series of changes during the Third Reich. Early examples up through 1939 had nickel-silver fittings, anodized scabbards, the maker's name and logo and the famous motto for the Hitler Youth which was ""Blut und Ehre!"". This literally translates to ""Blood and Honor!"".

Strange though it may be, it’s perfectly set up for those who desire a two-stamp gun. The extended forend from the Carbine will hide most 9mm and hybrid cans, while offering M-LOK attachment points and boosting the sight radius a good deal. Still using the 7.7” barrel of the standard Scorpion Pistol, a 5” KAK Flash Can extends the barrel to just a hair past the forend. Dual threads of 18×1 and 1/2×28 make fitting a suppressor simple, and adding an arm brace or cheek rest is as easy as can be with our accessory adapter kit. Even simpler is the addition of the factory folding stock, assuming you can stomach the ATF’s current wait times. Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants. The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws."

It has a 19"" barrel. I am going through a divorce and need some cash so I sadly need to sell some of my soul. Don't take advantage of my need of cash with ridiculous low-ball offers, I'm not that desperate to sell my soul. I'm selling at a very reasonable price. It is hard to part with something that can easily mow down a zombie horde with drum mags full of 00 buck shot. But I will for a good price. Everything cost me $1250 new when there was no import ban. Since the ban occured the value of this shotgun has increased. Sure you can buy the cheaper Chinese replica's with low quality control but if you want a genuine Russian Izhmash Saiga-12, here it is. Used in good condition with minor wear. About 300 rounds through it. I'm looking for a reasonable quick sale of $950 cash only. Can use 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells. Comes with a 20-round Promag drum, a 12-round Promag drum, two 10-round Surefire magazines, and a factory 5-round magazine.The shotgun has the following upgrades:-Tapco Saiga Intrafuse Tri-Rail handguard-Tapco Saiga Intrafuse T6 Stock-6-position Gas Plug Upgrade, Performance Recoil Spring, and G2 Puc to enable the shotgun to shoot all types of ammo from slugs/buck to low brass Walmart 100-round value packs.-JT Engineering Competition Muzzle BrakeThese are no longer being imported since Obama issued Executive Order 13662 on July 16, 2014 blocking the import of all Izhmash products. This awesome AK style shotgun was originally imported through Russian American Armory before importation was banned.For this sale to happen I will require you sign a Bill of Sale. You will need to show me identification to enter details about yourself on the Bill of Sale. This Bill of Sale and it's information will be for my own personal records as a safeguard in the unlikely event the gun is stolen or lost and used illegally and traced back to me. I will also need you to show me an Idaho Concealed Weapons License OR be willing to conduct a FFL transfer at a local gun shop. Sorry, I won't budge on this. I don't know you and I want to make sure you are legally able to make this purchase. If we do a FFL transfer you will pay for the transfer fee to the FFL dealer (typically about $20-25) BUT I will deduct that cost from the sale price of the shotgun if you successfully pass the background check. Lastly, I will also choose the place of transfer. If you have a CWL the transfer will likely take place in the parking lot at the Meridian Police Station. I have confirmed with the police station that it is acceptable to conduct private gun sales in the police parking lot for safety with surveililance cameras. If we are doing an FFL transfer then the transaction will take place at a gun shop of my choosing somewhere in either Nampa or Meridian."

Strange though it may be, it’s perfectly set up for those who desire a two-stamp gun. The extended forend from the Carbine will hide most 9mm and hybrid cans, while offering M-LOK attachment points and boosting the sight radius a good deal. Still using the 7.7” barrel of the standard Scorpion Pistol, a 5” KAK Flash Can extends the barrel to just a hair past the forend. Dual threads of 18×1 and 1/2×28 make fitting a suppressor simple, and adding an arm brace or cheek rest is as easy as can be with our accessory adapter kit. Even simpler is the addition of the factory folding stock, assuming you can stomach the ATF’s current wait times"

It's in beautiful condition, and has exactly 150 rounds down the pipe. It's decked out with all of the goodies that I'll list below and what they cost me.This gun shoots like a dream. With the compensator it has VERY minimal recoil (unlike standard 32's or other similar sized guns chambered in .357 SIG) and is wonderfully reliable. So a few things about this. The KKM compensator makes the gun the length of a Glock 34, so it fits in 34 holsters. The Comp-Tac is a 34 holster. The Truglo TFX sights are dual tritium and fiber optic, meaning they glow REALLY bright during the day, or at night, and they're wonderful.Package includes:Glock 32 Gen 4 ($550)KKM Match barrel with 4 port compensator ($275)Truglo TFX PRO Night/Fiber Optic sights ($115)Extended Slide Lock ($22)Comp-Tac International holster ($70)Factory barrel (never used/fired)3 magazinesAll backstrapsFactory boxI have $1032 into this, not counting tax or shipping.I'm only asking $600 FIRM for this. That is a REALLY low price, especially considering everything is almost new and has barely even been used!Not looking for trades.Located in Northville, willing to travel but nothing crazy. Must be 18+ with a purchase permit or CPL.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time or sending me a message on here.Thanks for looking!~ Mike *****SUREFIRE X300 DOES NOT COME WITH THIS PACKAGE. *****"
