Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."

It is a double action revolver, though I am unsure if this was an officer's double action revolver, or a single action revolver that was later retrofitted as the single action service revolvers ceased in 1922. The revolver has import markings on the lefthand side unfortunately. Other than that, the revolver is in good shape. The rifling is strong, the action is tight, and it fires reliably and on target. There are 14 boxes of military surplus rounds, each containing 14 rds for a total of 196. The rounds are corrosive unfortunately, but easy to clean after each shooting. I live in Gettysburg, but am willing to meet halfway if need be. Eligible for C&R FFl, or meet at a gun store for transfer (buyer pays fees). Please feel free to contact me for additional photos.Only willing to trade towards a P08 or motorcycle."

The lightweight barrel is made of 416 stainless steel, button rifled and cryogenically treated for outstanding accuracy. The 223 Wylde chamber is designed to be best of both the SAAMI commercial specification and the NATO chambering, allowing the widest variety of ammunition to be used, while retaining accuracy. The 1 in 8"" twist rifling produces good results with bullet weights from 40 to 77 grains. The 16"" barrel threaded 1/2""-28 with a JP Tactical Compensator. The Low Mass Bolt carrier is constructed of stainless steel with a QPQ finish. The QPQ finish is a five step treatment of polishing and hardening of the surface resulting in a very hard surface with a high level of lubricity. The bolt is constructed of SAE 9310 steel and exceeds the standard mil-spec in strength and service life. The low mass bolt carrier group and adjustable gas block work together to greatly reduce the felt recoil and keep the gun on target. It is recommended to us a LMOS buffer (available separately) with this upper receiver. The JP MKIII Signature Series handguard is a reduced diameter free-floating handguard with provisions for mounting accessory rails in many positions. The reduced 2"" diameter of the handguard makes it more comfortable in the hand and allows for better control of the rifle. The large ventilation slots and thermal dissipater work together to keep the barrel cool. The upper assembly is the perfect package for the competition shooter. Includes a Silver Thermal Dissipator, Low-Profile Adjustable Stainless Gas Block, and Sling Studs"

Each load features a low-flash, fast-burning propellant and primers compatible with the free-floating firing pins that are characteristic on MSR's. Each brass case features a harder case head for exceptional primer retention, military-style colored iris gives visual confirmation or proper case metallurgy.
