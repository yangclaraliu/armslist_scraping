They were made by Dan Coonan's head man ""Old Kur"" maybe 10-15 years ago before the new operations starting producing the new ""Classic"". I don't know if they will work in the new ones or not. The 5"" barrel is one I bought maybe 20 years ago but I never used it. It was polished so the ""357 Mag"" on the barrel is very faint. The grips are used but in excellent condition with only a few light marks. The 3 magazine assist loaders are I believe are repos but look just like the real deals.

It is the lightest and softest shooting deer gun I have ever carried. It has an adjustable trigger (currently set at 3.5 lbs) and comes with a very nice walnut stock. I sent the rifle off to a CZ Authorized Gunsmith who bedded and smoothed out the action. The gun now shoots sub-MOA at 100 yards with 85 and 100 gr Sierra Varmiter and Benchmark powder and 123 Hornady ELD and AR Comp Powder. It will shoot MOA with the 123 gr Hornady Black factory loads. I purchased this for an accurate medium range target gun that doubled as a deer gun. The recoil is half of a 308, can take a deer, and can ring steel at 550 yards more accurately than an AR-15. Like many of you, I have other more interesting projects and need the room in my safe. I paid for $640 the gun plus a few hundred for the gunsmith work. Included are the $70 precision CZ scope rings and a soft Beartooth Products cheek comb. I have the original box, warranty card, and paperwork. My price represents a fair discount and it is firm. The only trade I am interested in is a CMP M1 Garand that is certified Service Grade or better. I do all my transactions at my LGS, Young Guns, in Apex. I will cover the cost of an FFL transfer over to you. I am also willing to ship this to your FFL for an additional $25 after I receive and deposit a certified cashier's check."

Upper, Barrel, and BCG are Bear Creek Arsenal. The optic is a Primary Arms 1-4x Illuminated scope (Part PA14X) and the mount is a Burris PEPR mount with Quick detach base. This upper is very light and was a fun shooter for me. It cycles Brass ammo flawlessly. It is more picky with Steel ammo, but found Wolf Poly 124 gr fmj and HP to be about 95%. Tulammo sucks, it short-stroked with all Tulammmo. It will not cycle soft point ammo well. Honestly, its barely broken in with less than 100 rounds through it. Also included are 3 C-Products Defense 10 round steel magazines, the best ones for this caliber. This is a fun little shooter and I was using it as my dog pounder but I have other priorities now. I am also selling the Larue MBT trigger out of the rifle for $75 which is a very nice trigger. $525 for everything!

Witt Machine Clamp on Muzzle Brakes are precision machined to YOUR exact barrel specs. Tapered, Straight, or Stepped, we machine brakes for them all too greatly reduce recoil and muzzle rise (minimum 60%).  to greatly reduce recoil and muzzle rise (minimum 60%).  Because these brakes are custom cut to your dimensions we can hold tighter tolerances on both the bore and bullet exit hole our clamp on muzzle brakes are CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and require no permanent modification to the original firearm. They can be installed using simple hand tools. No gunsmithing required.  There are 20 .078"" holes drilled into the top of the brake that vent gas in order to stop muzzle rise. The bottom of the brakes have no holes or ports to kick up dirt all over the shooter. Having the bottom of the brake angled outward also helps to reduce muzzle rise. After months of testing and development the design of these brakes make them the most efficient clamp on muzzle brakes available today.

While not an exact M16A1 match, it has the characteristics of a retro rifle at a fraction of the price. Here are the parts:* Anderson Manufacturing Lower* Anderson Manufacturing LPK* Genuine military surplus M16A1 furniture - smaller A1 rifle stock, pistol grip, triangle handguards* UTG Pro detachable carry handle with sights* JSE Surplus 20"" pencil barrel profile 1:9 twist lighweight complete upper with MPI bolt and carrier* A2 Birdcage flash hider I have put under 50 rounds through it. It has been to the range once to sight in the iron sights. The rifle is extremely light compared to common HBAR 16"" AR-15s. The rifle length gas system shoots like a dream compared to a standard carbine system.The carry handle is detachable, so you can add an optic and convert the rifle into a DMR. Included in the purchase are extra parts to change the rifle profile:* A1 3 prong flash hider* A3 handguards and pistol grip* A3 buttcap spacer if you want to install the longer fixed stock* 3 - 20 round retro M16 magazines* A1 trigger guardOverall, the rifle simply looks cool and I am sure it will be a conversation piece at your range. It is actually a very light and easy rifle to shoot for a beginner. This was a fun project, however I have plenty more. As such, this rifle needs to go to make room in the safe. I am offering this rifle at a fraction of the cost of purchasing an official ""retro rifle"" from major gun manufacturers. My price is fair and final. I conduct all my sales at my LGS, Young Guns, in Apex. I will pay the FFL transfer fee. The only trade I am interested in is a CMP M1 Garand that is certified ""Service Grade""."

These are the best made, this one is original production with dual wire levers NOT a new production. These are incredibly hard to find and are a prize possession of any avid trapper or outdoorsman. I have had this one many years, but have stopped trapping and only have room for one of them on my wall so I have decided to sell this one which is the twin to the one on my wall.I'm asking 50 for this perfectly working piece of coyote trapping history. You can put it on your wall as a collector piece, or go use it to catch coyotes and Bobcats as it is still extremely strong due to it being such a heavy duty well made trap. It has everything that it came with chain nail swivels and oblong ring all original to the trap. Stamping is still 95 percent or better and it functions 100%. Text me at 417 988 898 one please no calls before you text or email me.Thanks and check my other listings"

Looked long and hard to find it! I originally bought it after picking one up in a gun store and being amazed by the grip ergonomics. What sent me back to buy was learning about the trigger system. V3 trigger is double action 1st shot, then single action thereafter AND a deckocker so you can carry hammer down on a round. Think of it as the trigger system you wish your 1911's had. The absolute best of all worlds! Shoots better than any Glock, Sig, Springfield, etc I've owned (trigger, low recoil, dead on accuracy). BUT...I've recently gotten addicted to saving $. Just keeping my pocket piece and using this one to grow my cash.- Original hard case with papers, back straps, side panels, etc.- Two mags. I bought the H&K pinky extensions for both. They are textured just like the grip. H&K does not offer these anymore. All of the other pinky extensions available do not match the guns texture!- Shown right hand draw, in waist DeSantis holster is also available. If you want it, add $25.Will sell without holster for $600 cash FIRM (Save lower offers please). I prefer cash, but may take a trade (weighed heavily in my favor) with at least $200 cash."

He and I even assembled the Raccoon City Police Department Beretta 92 Brigadier ""Samurai Edge"" which is currently residing in my safe. With all of that said, it would mean a tremendous deal to me if someone would sell me their Umbrella Corp Upper and/or Lower receiver so that he and I could work together again in assembling my first AR-15."

I have a receipt from Black Aces Tactical for the assembly that shows $191.25, it wasn't cheap. $390 for the 590 and $190 for the folding assembly leaves me at $580. I am looking to either trade with a value of $550 or get $525 cash. I will not separate the two, they move as a unit. I'd like to trade for an ak (non american), CZ P-01, Glocks in 9mm (preferably Gen 5 but I will listen to other offers) or 10mm, and if you have something else you'd like to offer the worst I can say is no."
