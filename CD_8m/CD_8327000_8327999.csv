The wood is definitely a factory upgraded version and has an eye popping pattern in the grain. This shotgun brings the WOW factor to the range. The finish on the stock has a few pinhead imperfections that I have pictured. Nothing really impresses the wood, no cracks, chips, or major scratches. The receiver is free of any scratches or freckling. The loading gate looks to have seen very few shells, and the bolt face just begins to show an impression ring. The barrel shows just a bit of tarnish at the very end and looks like maybe somebody touched it up with cold blue; not a bad look though. This Wingmaster still has a lot of life left in her; bid with confidence. If your like me, you like a pretty piece of wood to look at, so please inspect my pictures, this one is beautiful! Feel free to ask any questions, and I can email more pictures if you would like. I am looking to trade for collectible guns, and I can throw in cash for the right deal. I live in Aurora, but I can meet in Billings or Mt. Vernon. I like to exchange names and addresses."

This rifle, serial #4232 was manufactured in 1897, has 3 special order features and comes with a Winchester Factory letter taken from the ledgers housed at the Cody Firearms Museum confirming its original configuration. The factory letter is 30 years old (from 1988) and comes in the original envelope and has the Cody Museum paperwork that came with the letter. The letter reads: Rifle, 30 caliber, Lyman receiver and front sight, No rear seat (extremely rare), and received and shipped from the warehouse on November 15, 1897. I looked at every Model 1895 featured in ""The Winchester Book"" written by George Madis and was not able to find another example that was sent from the factory with ""No Rear Seat"" in the barrel. This is the first one I have ever seen in an 1895. This is an excellent example of an early Model 1895 Flatside Rifle in Caliber 30 U.S. (30/40 Government-Krag). This is the nicest Flatside I have owned. You will only find the 1895 Flatsides in 3 calibers, the black powder cartidges 38-72 and 40-72, and then the smokeless 30/40 Krag. The former 2 calibers came standard with a 26"" round or octagon barrel while the 30 U.S. came with the sleek 28"" round tapered barrel with a ramp front sight. Only the first 5000 1895's had the early Flatside frame with the one piece lever (a very difficult component to manufacture) after which Winchester introduced the scalloped frame 1895 and the more economical 2-piece lever. Only 19,000 Model 1895's qualify as Pre-1898 antiques... and about 10,000 of those were muskets ordered by the U.S. Government. As for condition the receiver retains much of its original blue finish, toning some and showing lighter towards the front left side of the receiver. The original 28"" round tapered barrel retains 98% of its original bluing. The original walnut stocks are in excellent condition, retaining nearly all of their original finish, with very minimal light handling marks. The wood to metal fit is tight and proud. The action is tight and smooth, mechanically perfect. The hammer retains nearly all of its original case colors. The barrel address and caliber markings are like new. The screws are very good. The special order Lyman #21 receiver sight is in excellent condition, retaining nearly all of its original blue finish. This rifle has been very well cared for over the years. In all this is an excellent example of an all original, unmolested an extremely rare Model 1895 Flatside that would be a standout piece in ones collection.

OR What are you asking for it -------------Here we have a nice Norinco SKS that has been professionally machined by a top notch gunsmith to take AK47 magazines. It works perfectly. It has also been shortened like the paratrooper model plus a muzzle brake installed and all of the bayonet junk has been neatly removed. This makes it a fairly light and handy rifle. Everything works perfectly. Note - You loose the last-round hold-open function when you do this but most AKs notoriously do not have last round hold open either. This will group nicely with standard low-end steel cased Russian ammo. Of course it would be even better with good ammo and also an SKS will shoot more accurately than most AK47s. BTW - At my age my eyes and iron sights are not a good match anymore. This ones a ""shooter"" - I had one of those magwedge Kwikrails from Canada on the thing with a primary arms 1-6x and could bang a 16"" gong regularly at a measured 300yds with ordinary Russian steel cased ammo. This is all numbers matching except the dust cover on rear which was replaced. The pictures do not show it but the receiver has 3 screw holes where a side mounted scope was installed once-upon-a-time. These holes have flush mounted screws with lock tight. Its a neat job but it is there and not an issue but I don't want anyone to be surprised by this slight cosmetic issue. It comes with everything pictured. It has 2 good stocks and the black ""cheese grater"" gas tube cover works well for both. The colors of the camo in the picture did not come out true(base is coyote tan then OD green with some foliage green) but it is a nice three colors and the paracord braided sling matches it well. The camo stock has a slip on butt pad as pictured. The other stock has a pro installed slightly longer pad and comes with the standard SKS sling. These 1"" and 1""+ extensions just feel a little better as these chicomm stocks that are usually a little bit short. They both come up nice to your shoulder. This comes with a great case that holds everything. It also comes with the old mil surplus mag pouch pictured that has 2 more 20 round magazines in it making a total of 3 20s included in the sale. It takes 30s too of course. I just prefer 20s. It also comes with the maglula AK47 magazine loader still in package and one extra butt pad that - uh well I never liked it but you might find some use for?. Asking $590 for all of it. Add it up. Why buy a plain old SKS when for a little more when you can have something special. Why deal with duckbill mags.... I check email often. This will be available thru Thursday May 10 only. Right now my plans are for a trip leaving probably by 1 or 2pm Friday. This will be FTF and green cash only. I can meet in Stillwater , Bartlesville or Ponca City. We'll work out details of a meet in email.  I am pretty much getting out of 7.62x39 and for the purchaser I will also sell a 1000 round case of 7.62x39 for $190. Of course thats a bargain and no shipping and no tax..... Also, to the purchaser of the rifle I could sell some 30 round magazines at a decent price. Thanks"

This rifle was made before 1898. This rifle was made in 1873 at Torre Annunziata as a single-shot black powder rifle, subsequently after 1887 in order to modernize it, even so it was already obsolete, it was transformed into a repeating rifle by adding a magazine. In 1915 when Italy entered WW1, due to the shortage of armament, the old Vetterli Vitali were put back into service by re-tubing the old 10.4 mm to 6.5x52 and put into service in the rearmost second line. Those rifles from 1870 onward were the official equipment of the Italian army and saw service where ever the Italian army was operating. During WW1 a lot of those rifles were sent to Russia to help the czar in his war again Germany, they mostly ended up in the hands of the Bolsheviks. In the 1930 a lot of those rifles were sent by the USSR to the Spanish republicans fighting Franco. After the defeat of the Spanish republic, Sam Cummings in the fifties bought all the surplus stock from the Franquists and that is how those rifles ended up in the US I would like $ 325.00 for this piece of history or, of course, best offer.

This rifle, serial #4232 was manufactured in 1897, has 3 special order features and comes with a Winchester Factory letter taken from the ledgers housed at the Cody Firearms Museum confirming its original configuration. The factory letter is 30 years old (from 1988) and comes in the original envelope and has the Cody Museum paperwork that came with the letter. The letter reads: Rifle, 30 caliber, Lyman receiver and front sight, No rear seat (extremely rare), and received and shipped from the warehouse on November 15, 1897. I looked at every Model 1895 featured in ""The Winchester Book"" written by George Madis and was not able to find another example that was sent from the factory with ""No Rear Seat"" in the barrel. This is the first one I have ever seen in an 1895. This is an excellent example of an early Model 1895 Flatside Rifle in Caliber 30 U.S. (30/40 Government-Krag). This is the nicest Flatside I have owned. You will only find the 1895 Flatsides in 3 calibers, the black powder cartidges 38-72 and 40-72, and then the smokeless 30/40 Krag. The former 2 calibers came standard with a 26"" round or octagon barrel while the 30 U.S. came with the sleek 28"" round tapered barrel with a ramp front sight. Only the first 5000 1895's had the early Flatside frame with the one piece lever (a very difficult component to manufacture) after which Winchester introduced the scalloped frame 1895 and the more economical 2-piece lever. Only 19,000 Model 1895's qualify as Pre-1898 antiques... and about 10,000 of those were muskets ordered by the U.S. Government. As for condition the receiver retains much of its original blue finish, toning some and showing lighter towards the front left side of the receiver. The original 28"" round tapered barrel retains 98% of its original bluing. The original walnut stocks are in excellent condition, retaining nearly all of their original finish, with very minimal light handling marks. The wood to metal fit is tight and proud. The action is tight and smooth, mechanically perfect. The hammer retains nearly all of its original case colors. The barrel address and caliber markings are like new. The screws are very good. The special order Lyman #21 receiver sight is in excellent condition, retaining nearly all of its original blue finish. This rifle has been very well cared for over the years. In all this is an excellent example of an all original, unmolested an extremely rare Model 1895 Flatside that would be a standout piece in ones collection. I guarantee you are going to love this old 1895."

The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod. 27”. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort.
