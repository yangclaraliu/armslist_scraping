Big box internet gun stores dont generally accept folks old shotguns for their brand new equipment. I however, do! (If I like of course)These are guaranteed to shoot at 1moa or better with the right ammunition and a halfway decent shooter.

This gun has served me well in my days of target shooting and I would like to see it go to a good home as I just don't have time to take her out anymore. Once re zeroed, it'll hold a 6 inch group at 500 yards in the right shooters hands. It has a round count of only about 500 that I've tracked in my logbook. This would also be a great firearm for any varminter as it carries a bigger, heavier bullet to your target and stays flat on the way there. Must meet face to face with valid ohio ID."

If someone moves to Massachusetts with an AR or AK after 7-20-16 they need to register the rifle with the state and they are free to sell it if they want in the state. So your ""pre-Healey ban"" rifle isn't a pre-ban anything and it isn't worth more than an actual pre-ban (ie. pre 94).
