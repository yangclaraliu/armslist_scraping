Please click link below to purchase.https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/caldwell-ballistic-precision-chronograph-premium-kit-721122/ Ballistic Precision Chronograph Premium Kit Description The Caldwell Ballistic Precision Chronograph Premium Kit is a must have for a variety of shooters from handloaders trying to optimize load data to archers and air gun enthusiasts. This kit includes everything included in the standard Ballistic Precision Chronograph package (product #626107) with a few add ons to make it even better. The chronograph will provide an accurate velocity reading from speeds of 5 to 9,999 fps within .25% accuracy. Caldwell achieved this level of accuracy by using a high speed 48 MHz processor and calibrating every unit after assembly before it leaves the factory. The chronograph also remains simple to use giving a readout of velocity in Feet per second or Meters per second on a large LCD screen. Extra wide sun screens are included for shading in full sun operation along with a 1/4-20 threaded insert on the bottom of the housing for use with a tripod (included). For shooters looking to fully take advantage of this chrono, this unit includes a 25′ audio jack cable which can be plugged into an iPhone or iPad to use a free app called “Ballistic Chronometer” available for download. This app will display the velocity of each shot on the screen and record it with other data identifying the current load and environmental conditions during the shooting session. Other data calculated by the app include average velocity, standard deviation, minimum velocity, maximum velocity, and velocity spread for shot string. This data is stored and can easily be exported through email or SMS messaging or simply stored for recall on a later date. Take your shooting to the next level with the Ballistic Precision Chronograph by Caldwell. Premium Kit Includes: – Chronograph – 2 sunshades – 25′ audio jack cable – Custom carry case – Tripod – Light Kit"

The pistol has never been in a gun store display case. Never fired, never cycled, never dry fired, never even took it out of the case except to inspect and photograph. It’s a beautiful 1911. It’s a shame that the pistol is just sitting there wasting away. I’d like it to go to someone that can appreciate it and I’d like to have something I’ll actually shoot. It comes with all of the typical Springfield goodies (holster, double mag pouch, 2 magazines, and extra fiber optic tubes. Has pretty wood grips and adjustable target rear sight.  Trade value is between $850-$800If I had to put a cash number, it would be $800-$750. Again, it’s brand new straight from Springfield. If anything, it’s even more perfect than if you were to buy one out of the case in a gun store. You can text me at 504-two3one-00six8 or email me through Armslist."

I bought this new and carried it three times. This Taser uses the same technology of the X26, X2, and X3. It doesn't look like a gun and instead looks like a cell phone. Gives the same shock as the police model but runs for 30 seconds. The police Taser only runs for 5 seconds. This is also good for contact stunning. This is the model with the laser site and flash light. When you flip the cover they automatically turn on. Don't buy the model without the laser. The laser might be all you need to stop an attacker. Many people are afraid of the Taser. Must be transferred legally through a Taser transfer form. Will need the routine battery replacement soon. Otherwise is like new condition. Has never been fired.
