Now, with a higher beavertail and an undercut trigger guard, your shooting hand will be as close to the bore axis as possible for enhanced accuracy at the range. Also, its contoured slide allows for the majority of the gun's reciprocating mass to exist below the bore, which reduces the amount of muzzle flip during trigger pulls and discharge. New trigger components give a smooth double-action performance and a crisp, clean single-action trigger break. Mag-release button boasts three settings to adjust for extra handing comfort. Black, nitride polycoat finish adds protection. Ambidextrous, manual safety. Steel frame with textured aluminum grips.LOG:51633"

A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools. The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa. The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before.LOG:51585"

The free float hanguard is round, practical, and extremely ergonomic relative to clunky quad rail, and the rail section can be relocated for various configurations. The red dot is dialed in and she runs very well, just not my cup of tea. If you do a quick Google search To build this setup, you're easily in the $900 - $1k+ range - $175 for the lower plus shipping/FFL, $279 for upper, $100 for BCG/CH, $150 for PWS CQB, $80 for MBUS2, $200 for the red dot and riser, $80 for the kak blade, $60 for the light and mount, $20 for the BAD lever... my price is fair and firm considering everything that's included. FTF and cash only, no trades, and as this is a pistol you will need a ccw or pistol permit to buy from me, no exceptions."

The front sight is hooded, and has several front sight posts that fold down, allowing the shooter to choose between posts and a front sight ring. The rear sight is fully adjustable. The rifle feeds from a tube magazine that is loaded from the buttstock. The reciever is drilled and tapped for a scope, and I believe it is factory done, or at least very professionally done. The rifle has a two piece mannlicher stock, fitted very well, and a leather USGI style sling."

Dont waste your money on them, they will soon be paperweights that you arent allowed to use! Notice all of the new listings??? People are trying to unload them ASAP!! WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Tuesday afternoon that he has signed a memorandum directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose regulations to ban ‘‘bump stocks’’ and other devices that turn semiautomatic firearms into ‘‘machine guns.’’
The device was used by the shooter who opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas in October, killing dozens and immediately prompting calls for lawmakers or the administration to ban such devices through legislation or regulations. At the time, the White House and the National Rifle Association made clear that they were open to the idea, but no action was taken. It was not until a mass shooting at a high school in Florida last week again brought attention to gun-control issues that Trump was pushed to act.
‘‘I expect that these critical regulations will be finalized ... very soon,’’ the president said during a medal ceremony at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. ‘‘The key in all of these efforts ... is that we cannot merely take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make a difference. We must move past cliches and tired debates and focus on evidence-based solutions and security measures that actually work.’’"

This is a big gun. Certainly a great range gun. Very accurate. Shoots anything that I feed it. Will certainly make other shooters think that you know what you are doing.
 
MAXIMUM
 
FIREPOWER.
 
COMPLETE CONTROL.
 
THIS IS SHOOTABILITY.
 
Much more than a huge, double-stack magazine capacity, the new Remington RP9 embodies our engineers’ commitment to shootability — designed end-to-end to deliver a level of shooter control and accuracy superior to every full-sized polymer-framed handgun on the market. So much so, it’d be a design marvel with a fraction of the capacity, but with the optional 18+1 round magazines at your absolute command, it equips you for the most demanding personal defense scenarios.
 
 
 
REMINGTON RP9 FEATURES
 
 
 
Smooth, light and crisp single-action trigger – consistent and smooth, with short tactile reset
 
Ergonomic polymer frame fits 95% of all shooters
 
Ambidextrous slide control
 
“Fighting surface” on rear sight – for one-hand slide operation
 
Optimized grip angle – reduces felt recoil and increases shootability
 
Trigger guard undercut – allows higher hand hold for increased control
 
Drift adjustable sights – easily adjusts sights to user preference
 
Easy loading, double-stack magazines – industry’s highest magazine capacity per caliber
 
PVD finish on slide and barrel for maximum durability

Gonna sell at a loss to get rid of both, so this is a pretty good deal for two pistols. The brands speak for themsleves. The Ruger SR22 is a great little .22 semi-auto shooter. Double acton, super fun, great as a back up, gift for a new shooter, or just for plinking. The SW Victory is a great one for competition shooting (which I used it for) with great after market upgrades. Love the gun, but moved to a new Ruger for competing. I took care of both very well, never had any issues, and hoping to get them to a good home.SR22 black/chrome, 2 mags (10 rounds), two handgrips, chamber lock.Victory Chrome, 4 mags (10 rounds), chamber lock.Looking to sell both for a solid $600 or trade for a semi-auto rifle in 5.56,.223, 9mm, or 300.Ad will only let me put up one pick, it'll be of the Victory, but it's easy to look up what a SR22 looks like.
