It comes with 2 mags and all original case and paperwork. This sweet piece has less than 50 rounds through it, is like new and has never been carried. This is the same gun as the M9-A1 except it has a 3.6” barrel. It is the perfect combo of high capacity and compsct size. Just right for EDC. If you arent familiar with theee guns, do your research. It truly is a Glock killer. Think of your Glock 19 with a trigger job, upgraded sites and better ergonomics and that is what the Steyr C9-A1 is. The trigger is by far the best striker fired trigger I have ever shot and the trapezoid sites are nothing short of amazing. Fast and accurate target acquisition with a super low bore axis is a winning combination. Aeking $475 and I may consider trades depends big on what you have. CCW preffered and receipt required."

Unlike other attempts to build a 9mm AK, the AKX-9 is a blue print designed gun from the ground up as a dedicated 9mm firearm. All major components are US made meaning the AKX-9 is not cobbled together using surplus parts kits. The AKX-9 series has been extensively tested over the course of 8 months to insure the highest quality & reliability of the weapon utilizing a wide variety of 9mm ammunition. The Firearms are packed full of shooter friendly features like a last round bolt hold open, left side bolt release, drop-free magazines and AR15 type magazine release. The firearm utilizes the Colt style stick mags that are affordable and readily available for less than $20.00. The The AKX-9 barrel is 11.125 inches long with a 1:10 twist and sports a 1/2 x 28  threaded for ease of adding a suppressor or mounting other common 1/2x28 accessories such as flash suppressors.  All models of the AKX-9 are easily convertible to being an SBR once a Form 1 is obtained. The Custom AKX-9 barrel has a full auto tapered chamber, so it will distort brass slightly, but improves reliability, So in true AK fashion it's designed around functioning.The Dedicated AKX Bolt is hardened to optimum hardness per similar specs on Russian AK bolts to insure extreme durability. The buffer weight, pivot/hinge point, and bolt travel distance were carefully tuned for the best balance of optimum reliability and management of recoil for faster follow up shots. The design of the gun was fine tuned to minimize recoil , increase accuracy and work with a wide variety of ammunition on the market. The AKX provides shooters a great combination of features, accuracy and reliability for Home Defense, Tactical or Sporting applications. Definitive Arms is well known for their high quality builds and is regarded as one of the Top 3 Custom AK Builders in the US. Prior to the AKX-9 they pioneered Mag Well conversions for the Russian VEPR and Saiga series of rifles in .223 & .308 . Based out of Florida the Definitive Arms team focuses on Innovative Enhancements to the AK platform of firearms. They do not crank out mass produced guns. Each gun is hand built one at a time to insure a straight & smooth weapon and they stand behind the products they build. AKX-9 Features Dedicated AKX-9 mm Barrel 1:10 twist 11.125"" long.

It is a 16+1 9mm pistol with lower rail for light or laser. I am including the factory mag and one additional promag magazine. I am also including a holster that I intended to use for concealed carry however I ended up using an LC9s instead. I think the holster is kydex. It fits excellent with good retention. The gun shoots great, striker fired. Less than 200 rounds fired. I think the value of the extra mag and kydex holster make this excellent condition gun worth about $250. Let me know if interested."

Almost new – fired at gun range one day (so far). Beautiful gun. See pics.
Fold-down style with two positions at half-cock. Lightning fast, glass-smooth rack and pinion lever-action with rotating head, multiple-lug breech bolt with recessed bolt face. Side ejection. Machined aircraft-grade aluminum. Drilled and tapped to accept scope mounts. Low profile, square notch, screw adjustable rear sight. Gold bead on raised ramp front sight. Individually machined, precision button-rifled, heat-treated chromoly steel. Crowned muzzle. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity. Wide groove design trigger with short, smooth pull of approximately 4 lbs. Trigger travels with lever and avoids pinching. American walnut, straight '81-style with classic round forearm or pistol grip stock with Schnabel forearm. High-gloss finish. Checkered. Flush mounted, detachable box. Capacity: Four magnum/five standard rounds in magazine, one in chamber. Deluxe recoil pad.
As a rule, lever-action aficionados have always had to trade away power and accuracy for quick handling and easy carrying. With the Browning BLR those compromises are a thing of the past. The design of the BLR is as modern as tomorrow with an aircraft-grade alloy receiver, glass-smooth rack and pinion system and multi-lug rotating bolt that handles many of the most popular magnum cartridges, including the fast new WSMs. The exceptional accuracy of the BLR comes from its precision machined, button-rifled barrel that puts those fast-stepping magnum bullets exactly where they're wanted. Add in the advantages of a great stock design and finish, a detachable box magazine, low profile adjustable sights and a wide, grooved trigger that travels with the lever to avoid pinching fingers and it's clear the Browning BLR is ready for any action.

The 7.0's length stops just short of a carbine-length gas block, providing true free-float. Our two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, sets LaRue handguards apart from the competition. Once properly installed, there is no chance of movement whatsoever. The side and bottom rails are tucked closer to the barrel, keeping the profile narrower and more streamlined. LaRue handguards also include integral QD sling-swivel sockets at the base of each side for convenient mounting 2-point slings. Additionally, our Free-float Rail system provides an excellent heat-sinking feature that pulls throat-damaging heat away from the chamber area. Another heat-sinking benefit is the elimination of pressure-spikes, which some feel is the cause of a large part of pre-mature bolt failures.larue.com/products/larue-tactical-7-0-handguard-lt15-7/"

Bolt shroud and receiver are coated with Dura Slick coating- Atlas BipodsI am trying to hold on to the scope, but I am open to offers for it, along with the rifle:- Schmidt and Bender PMII L/P x3-12, with P4L Fein reticle- Sits on top of a Badger Base, with Badger 34mm RingsI also have a Pelican 1770 case with pluck and play foam set up for this rifle- folded. The case was also housing an AR and pistol, so the foam is gone for that as wellThe rifle and scope are in excellent condition, I've only put about 200 rounds down the pipe of this tack-driver. If you have any questions regarding the rifle, or would like more pictures, please feel free to contact me. The case has been used, but it is in good condition and functions perfectly. It's just very cumbersome.The price listed below will be for the rifle, scope, and case; and is negotiable. I am willing to part with all three, or the rifle and case for a price to be negotiated.Also, I am willing to have this shipped, I’d ask that the buyer covers half the shipping cost. Thank you for your interests, and I hope to hear from y'all soon!"
