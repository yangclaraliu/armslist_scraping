This pistol was issued to a Police Department in Southern NY and apparently taken home by a Deputy as the story goes (as he was the homeowner prior to my friend's Daughter buying the place). It was found in 1989 by my friend in his Daughter's barn in Jamestown, NY, wrapped up in an old cloth. That would be the reasoning for the pitting on the outside. The inside is mint. The rifling, bore, chambers and inner works are virtually new. This will letter to a Police agency from WW2 era. Apparently Colt sold very little of these during WW2. This dates to 1943, but the information I have found all says that these were all produced in 1942. He had no idea about the grips or what the story on them was, other than they were very old and had come from an ""old pistol"" and he put them on this gun (the Deputy). The grips are in a Dragon motif. They are real African Elephant ivory (look at the 15 degree ""chevron"" Shreger lines). They were carved a LONG time ago (as evidenced by their yellowing). The eyes of the dragon have the black dots. They are very solid and weigh 73 grams with the escutcheons. They are in excellent condition and look great. This will make an excellent shooter. Grips like this add a LOT of value to any gun. Comes with original set of Herrett's stocks also. These grips will also fit a variety of other pistols:The ""E & I"" frame, Medium frame:The Army SpecialOfficial PoliceOfficer's Model target modelsThe 357TrooperPythonThe rare first model Border PatrolMarshal.The ""Commando"" a WWII Official Police with a parkerized finish.The E & I frame are virtually the same gun with only very small differences.For that reason, most people simply lump these all together, since there is near 100% parts interchangeability.All grips interchange. The main difference between the E and the I is the E has the firing pin on the hammer and I has a frame mounted firing pin. $775.00 plus actual shipping .

Picked this gun up at the last gun show in Pensacola - have not shot it yet, but need some extra cash for surprise truck repairs. There is some holster wear on the gun (the guy I bought it from said it was a trade in from a security company), but other than that I couldn't find anything wrong. Locks up good, forcing cone looks good, no binding on the ejector rod. There is the typical drag ring on the cylinder. What you see is what you get - gun didn't come with a box and did not have the target grips with it, just the Hogue. I'll toss in two HKS speed loaders as well. Prefer to meet in Milton, if possible. Not really looking for trades - I might do quality AR lowers + cash (Aero, Spikes, etc), but I really need at least $400 cash if we're going the trade route. Thanks for looking."
