Kit has everything you need to replace the standard gas system in your AR-15 and convert it to a reliable, positive-cycling, gas piston system. Eliminates venting of hot gases and powder residue into the bolt carrier and receiver for reduced fouling and less wear on the action. Feeds more smoothly, maintenance is easier, and the gun runs cooler, too. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling and reduced felt recoil. Easy to adjust for three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Picatinny rail on the gas block provides mounting space for a variety of front sights. Installation requires removal of original gas block, but no permanent alterations to barrel or upper receiver. Remove the piston system at any time and reinstall the original parts. Replacement handguard provides extra internal clearance for piston rod and has internal shield to protect your hand from heat buildup during sustained fire. Separate models for three popular gas system"

Everything you need to convert your DI AR -15 into a Piston operating system.Kit has everything you need to replace the standard gas system in your AR-15 and convert it to a reliable, positive-cycling, gas piston system. Eliminates venting of hot gases and powder residue into the bolt carrier and receiver for reduced fouling and less wear on the action. Feeds more smoothly, maintenance is easier, and the gun runs cooler, too. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling and reduced felt recoil. Easy to adjust for three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Picatinny rail on the gas block provides mounting space for a variety of front sights. Installation requires removal of original gas block, but no permanent alterations to barrel or upper receiver. Remove the piston system at any time and reinstall the original parts. Replacement handguard provides extra internal clearance for piston rod and has internal shield to protect your hand from heat buildup during sustained fire.

If you’re looking for a quality carbine-length barrel that features great value and long expected service life, you should definitely consider the Spike's Tactical 11.5” CHF Carbine-Length Barrel for your next AR-15 build.
The Spikes Tactical CHF Barrel is extremely durable. Its projected service life is upwards of 20,000 fired rounds. This Spike’s Tactical 11.5” CHF barrel is designed with the Mil-Spec standards for the M249 S.A.W. in mind but in a smaller, lighter package intended for the AR-15. Each one of these barrels is hardened by the Cold Hammer forging Process which involves a long process of hammer forging the blank barrel on a rifled mandrel. These particular barrels are chambered to 5.55 NATO and rifled with a 1 in 7 twist. Barrel blanks are internally lined with a hard chrome coating almost double the thickness of that found in M4 Mil-Spec barrels, as required by the Mil-Spec standards for the M249 SAW. 
To create the final product, the Spikes Tactical CHF Barrel is precision turned until it’s sized down to a lightweight profile. In the end, it weighs in at 17.5 ounces, including a Mil-Spec M4 barrel extension on the 11.5” CHF barrel. Each barrel is precision threaded at the muzzle so that the ½ x 28 threads are perfectly concentric with the bore. Attention to detail makes for a superior product. This barrel will not only outlast much of the competition, it will do so with accuracy that’s hard to beat.
The Spike's Tactical 11.5"" 5.56 FN Cold Hammer Forged (CHF) Carbine-Length Barrel features a .625 inch gas block seat with the appropriate size gas port. There is no front sight base on these barrels and they feature a sleek Mil-Spec Phosphate finish."

The AN/PSQ-20B Enhanced Night Vision Goggle is a helmet-mounted and/or hand-held device that combines the light amplification capability of image intensifier night vision devices with the heat-sensing capability of thermal imaging systems.  It allows for observation, detection, and target identification under adverse conditions including light rain, light smoke, light snow, and low light to total darkness.  As a fusion system, the ENVG allows the operator to adjust the viewed image from 100% night vision (I2) to 100% thermal, or a varying mix of the two.  It amplifies available light and thermal signatures, and fuses them together to produce a clear viewed image.  This cutting edge technology provides operators a tremendous advantage on the battlefield because he gets the best of both worlds, increasing the odds of mission success and survivability.
The ENVG provides better increased situation awareness capability due to the improved threat detection of the fusion technology. It allows the operator to see through more battlefield obscurants than any other device. On their own, standard L-3 Gen3 Infinity Auto-Gated I² tubes produce high quality images with superb resolution, providing excellent recognition capability. However, even these latest tubes are still dependent on available ambient lighting conditions. The more available light, the better the image will be (more detail and further distance resolution). But, battlefield conditions do not always allow for optimal ambient light. Cloudy nights with less moonlight, dense foliage, or internal/underground structure rooms can cancel out enough light that standard I² is defeated. Also, heavy rain, fog, snow, smoke, etc, will limit I² capabilities. This is where Thermal Imagers shine. Thermal identifies infrared energy (heat) and is not dependent on light at all. Thermal will see through most obscurants that would otherwise defeat I² and can create images in complete darkness. However, thermal imagers do not produce the same level of detail as I² tubes, limiting recognition capabilities.
The ENVG fuses these two technologies, providing the operator with all the benefits of I², while producing a thermal overlay. This gives the Warfighter substantially increased situational awareness because threats can be detected in virtually any environment. Bad guys that would normally be camofluaged in foliage, rock formations, etc can now be easily detected from a safe distance. Pitch black rooms or caves that would normally defeat I², causing the operator to use an IR illuminator (which can give away his position to anyone else using night vision) can now be easily negotiated with the thermal overlay. It is especially effective in urban operations.
The fused image has three modes: thermal overlay, thermal outline, and full thermal. The Overlay produces an otherwise standard I² image with orange thermal heat signatures over anything that is producing heat. This mode is extremely well-adapted to identifying threats quickly through obscurants. The outline mode produces a thin orange thermal outline around anything that is giving off heat. The rest of the image is standard I². This mode is especially useful when using an IR laser pointer because the operator can identify threats while still having recognition capability and can engage them with the laser. This is important because IR lasers are not seen through thermal. The full thermal mode overlays a complete thermal image over the I² image and is used when little to no ambient light is available, reducing the operator’s need to employ an illuminator.

I have had this rifle for about 4 years but I dont shoot it that often so it maybe has 200 rounds through it. It is sitting in a bell and carlson stock that is in really good condition. It has a 20 MOA weaver scope base and an Athlon 6-24 scope with 1/10th mil turrets. The barrel is 18 inches and has a clamp on muzzle break that is pretty effective. Ive shot less than an inch with this rifle using heavier match ammo, so if you are looking for something thats pretty compact and accurate, look no further."

The Sentinel XL has the smallest 1911 grip available with the enhanced practical accuracy and reliability a Compact slide offers.The reduced height Sentinel frame is ½” shorter than our standard Compact and when mated with the ultra slim G-10 grips is well suited to shooters who prefer a smaller handgun. The concealment grip safety/hammer and round butt mainspring housing selected for the Sentinel XL gives you a real advantage when it comes to daily carry and shooting comfort.Even though the Sentinel XL is designed for concealment, the precisely fitted slide, frame and 4” match grade barrel will give you the downrange performance you expect from a Wilson Combat custom pistol.

NO SHIPPING. Face to face only in Topeka, Kansas or near by. I could drive a little ways to meet. This is everything you need to fill your PCP guns. The only two PCP guns I have now are my two Marauders, and I have a pump I can fill them up with easily. I sold my AAA Slayer. There’s no real point in me owning this stuff anymore. That being said, this equipment has seen very little use and works perfectly. I’m a hunter, not a target shooter, so they have been used in that capacity. I’ve owned everything since 5/24/16 and the tank has been filled less than 20 times during that period. I bought everything but the moisture filter from Precision Airguns. I’m very meticulous about how I treat my equipment and everything has been maintained and cared for according to the manufacturers instructions. The air compressor comes with a nice no-kink tube with foster fitting and dead head cap. It also comes with extra grease, seals, and instruction manual. Other than two hunting trips riding in the back seat(never taken out of the car into the field) the tanks has been in the same spot the entire time I’ve had it. The born on date is April 2016. It is in perfect condition and comes with a no-kink hose with a foster fitting and dead head cap. It also has a top of the line gauge and fill adapter. The moisture filter is VERY well made. It was made by Jamie Lavalee, who goes by dman over on the talontunes forum. It was $262 when I bought it new. A lot of people prefer it to the Diablo or other moisture filters. It is rated for 6000psi. It is a sought after filter. I’m not trying to sell it separately from the air compressor though. Once the air compressor sells, I’d be willing to sell it on its own, if the buyer of the compressor didn’t want it.I’M ASKING $1650 FOR EVERYTHING. FACE TO FACE IN TOPEKA.

In 90% (99%compared to other firearms on the market) very sharp condition, we have a very seldom seen, extremely elusive, highly sought after, and very rare Czech CZ 36 (vz. 36) semi-automatic pistol in 6.35mm Browning. It comes with a leather holster and two eight-round magazines. VZ is an abbreviation of “vzor”, which is Czech for “model”. This was a WWII vet “bring back” commonly carried by German officers not engaged in frontline combat. Like all model 1936 (CZ 36) pistols, the featured CZ 36 is marked on the left side of the slide “ČESKÁ ZBROJOVKA AKC. SPOL. V PRAZE” and followed by a five-digit serial number “24741”. These highly innovative and well-made small pistols were the predecessors of the more plentiful post-war-made CZ 45. The pistol is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. The vz. 36 was designed by the prolific Czech engineer, František Myška, in 1934 and produced by Česka Zbrojovka from 1936 to 1940. The CZ 36 was made with an external safety on the left side of the frame, above which it was marked with a “Z” (most likely denoting Military Storehouse). While our pistol has a small thumb safety lever above the trigger, some CZ 36 pistols were manufactured without the safety lever. No one knows why some pistols have the safety and some do not; however, earliest pistols all tend to have it. This pistol was Czech Army accepted in 1941. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number at 13,000. Approximately 19,368 CZ 36 pistols were manufactured in total. According to other sources, only 12,000 vz. 36 pistols were produced. The highest known serial number is 31,131. Some early production models were purchased by local and state (government) police agencies. Most state owned pistols, like ours, have the Military acceptance mark in the form of a Czech twin-tailed lion on them and the year of the verification (1941 on our pistol). This is fascinating, because Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia in March 1939; however, our pistol is not Nazi-proofed. It is extremely difficult to find a CZ 36 pistol, and it is virtually impossible to find one in such exceptional condition.To buy call or click>>>CZ model 36"

Note “rid” on the left side of frame – military code of Česká Zbrojovka Factory (civilian arms were marked Česká Zbrojovka Strakonice or possibly the acronym ČZS). The letter “T” inside a circle on the barrel above the serial number is the Czechoslovak Military (Tormentační) proof mark proof mark. The CZ 52 (also known by the Czechoslovak military designations vz. 52, for (vz. - vzor = model) “model of 1952”) is a semi-automatic pistol designed by two brothers, Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl, in the early 1950s for the Czechoslovak military. Around 200,000 vz. 52 pistols were made by Česká Zbrojovka in Strakonice from 1952 to 1954. Before standardizing on the 7.62×25mm vz. 52, the Czechoslovak military used several domestic and foreign pistol models in three different calibers. After 30 years of military service, the vz. 52 was eventually replaced by the 9×18mm Makarov caliber vz. 82.To buy call or click>>>CZ 52"

The DUO was designed by František Dušek. Dušek’s business started as a small gunsmith’s shop and grew into a factory in Opočno, in northeastern Bohemia. DUO was the abbreviation for Dušek, Opočno. The DUO pistol was manufactured from 1926 until 1949. In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia. Dušek refused to cooperate with the German occupation forces, and the factory operated without him. The production of DUO pistols continued during the German occupation, and pistols made in this period were marked on the left side of the slide “AUTOMAT. PISTOLE “DUO” CAL 6.35 / F. DUŠEK, OPOTSCHNO”. Note the use of the German spelling of Opočno (Opotschno) on the slide. Slide also stamped with the Prague proof house firing proof and is dated 1942. The proof mark is also on the barrel at the ejection port. The DUO pistols continued to be proofed and proof-marked to Czech standard. The production of DUO pistols increased throughout the war. Over 110,000 pistols were made during WWII.To buy call or click>>>Used CZ DUO"

If you collect Czech pistols, note that this CZ 22 is one of the very first Czech pistols ever manufactured (SN 13111). The CZ 22 was the first Czechoslovak Army pistol of the inter-war period. The pistol is the rare 9 mm Nickel caliber (caliber .380 ACP, known in Europe as the 9 mm Browning short). Also known as the “Nickel” or “N” pistol, CZ 22 was designed by Josef Nickl (also Joseph Nickel), who was employed at the famous Mauser Factory in Germany. Using the Mauser pistol, known variously as model 1910 or 1914 as a basis, he modified it to his own design. Brno manufactured only some 18,000 of the original Army Pistol Model 1922 before more modifications were ordered and production shifted to Česka Zbrojovka (CZ) works at Prague and Strakonitz. Fewer than 22,000 CZ 22 pistols had been made. CZ 22 served as a prototype for the CZ 24. The left side of the pistol displays the factory marking on the trigger plate, “Čs. st. zbrojovka, Brno.”, which translates to Czechoslovak State Arms Factory in Brno, and the early 1920’s Czechoslovak Army acceptance mark on the upper left of the trigger guard. The right side of the pistol displays the early 1920’s Czechoslovak Army acceptance mark (“E”, rampant lion, “23”) on the upper right of the trigger guard. Army unit marks (“7P 542” – the 7th Infantry Regiment weapon 542) are displayed on the front of the grip strap. Czech pistols are widely collected these days and this is a great example of one of the hard to find key pieces. We only get one of these pistols every couple of years so if you need one, consider the rarity of the pistol. The pistol is housed in an original brown leather flap holster.To buy call or click>>>used CZ 22"

Overall condition 75%  very light pitting on front top and side of slide. The Vzor 45 (Czech for “Model 45”), commonly known as CZ 45 is a compact blowback operated semi-automatic pistol chambered in .25 ACP. It was made in Czechoslovakia and later in the Czech Republic. CZ 45 was derived from the CZ 36 designed by the prolific Czech engineer, František Myška, in 1934 and produced by Česka Zbrojovka from 1936 to 1940. Because of war demands, production of the CZ 36 ceased in 1942. In 1945 the CZ 36 was redesigned by Jan Kratochvil to make it easier to manufacture and became the Vzor 45. The safety lever, which had sometimes appeared on the CZ 36, was eliminated. Production of CZ 45 began in 1946 (with the serial numbers continuing from the CZ 36) and ended in 1959. Our pistol (Serial Number 115481) was manufactured in Strakonice. CZ 45 pistols, produced in Strakonice during 1945-1952, display the following text on the left side of the slide: “ČESKÁ ZBROJOVKA - NÁRODNÍ PODNIK STRAKONICE”. Like all CZ 45 pistols manufactured in the year 1948 and later, our pistol displays “MADE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA” on the left side. The CZ 45 holds 8 rounds in the magazine and has a simple groove down the top of the slide for sighting. After the termination of firearms manufacture at Strakonice, manufacturing was transferred to the primary branch of Česka Zbrojovka at Uhersky Brod. The pistol is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top.To buy call or click>>>Used CZ 575"

Like on the Browning, the gas system vents excess gases to aid in recoil reduction and helps eliminate stress on the operating components. Notable to us was that while shooting this 6-pound gun, we didn’t notice any more recoil with it than the other, heavier guns. Also, it pointed very fast, our team said, and even though we weren’t able to adjust it with the non-included LOP and cast spacers, it fit most of our shooters well out of the box. The trigger-pull weight was a lowest-of-the-test 5.0 pounds, and the rounded trigger itself was comfortable on the finger. The top of the receiver offered a better sight plane than did the Browning, our team said, and was on par with the Remington.COME DOWN AND CHECK IT OUT!!10812 N SCOTTSDALE RD SCOTTSDALE AZ 85254480-483-4210ASK FOR GEORGE"
