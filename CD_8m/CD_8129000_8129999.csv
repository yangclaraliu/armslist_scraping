79,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8129079,For Sale:  Sharps New Model 1863 Metallic Conversion Carbine/1864/ ID'd to Cavalry Soldier,"Panton, Vermont, United States","$ 1,500","Listed On: Wednesday, March 21, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"PHOTO LINK: https://imgur.com/a/O3T2T For sale is a Sharps New Model 1863 Metallic Conversion Carbine – Serial #C,16377, 50-70 U. S. Govt. Cal., 22 inch round barrel, blue/casehardened finish, walnut stock.This is an example of a Sharps Model 1863 carbine that was either arsenal or Sharps Rifle Company converted to .50-70 center fire metallic cartridge with the relined 3 groove barrel. The Ordnance Department contracted with Sharps to convert more than 31,000 Civil War carbines from percussion to center fire configuration in 1867. These carbines were issued to the U. S. Cavalry and along with the Model 1865 Spencer Carbines were the primary cavalry carbines until the Model 1873 Springfield Trapdoor carbine replaced them in 1874 to 1875. The carbine has the standard Lawrence folding leaf rear sight graduated to 800 yards and is fitted with a sling bar and ring on the left side of the stock wrist and receiver. The barrel is absent of the standard Sharps markings and the New Model marking is vary faint and mostly missing. The left rear flat is marked with the letter “S”. “Sharps and R. S. Lawrence” patent markings are on the receiver and lock plate. The serial number is located on the upper tang. The script “DFC“/ribbon final inspection mark applied to Sharps conversion carbines is stamped on the center of the left side of the stock. The rifling is good but has pitting. The bore is good. This is still a VERY shootable rifle! The stock has cracks. The pictures show the condition of the rifle clearly. But for a 154 year old rifle that went through the Civil War, I'd say it ain't too bad!This rifle,as some were, was most likely just taken home or bought by the Cavalryman who it was issued to. His name was John Conroy, of White Plains, NY. His service records are attached. I am assuming he reentered the Army post Civil War, but I did not go farther than his Civil War records. This could just be a rifle he acquired later on too, but I think the evidence is to the contrary. But again, buy the rifle not the story! John Conroy entered the service on October 6,1863 in Oswego, NY, for a 3 year term of service. He was 23 years old. He joined Co. I, 24th NY Infantry. He later transferred as a Private to Co. I, 15th NY Cavalry in November 1863. On June 17, 1865, he was transferred to Co. I, 2nd Provisional NY Cavalry. He was mustered out of service August 9, 1865 at the rank of Private. He dies October 29,1894. He most likely saw several skirmishes in the Shenandoah valley, where some extensive fighting took place. The 15th was part of Sheridan's raid and were at Appomattox to see the surrender of Lee's army.  I included records from the Coates & McAulay book that show the next serial number to this one, C,16378, as being with the 22nd NY Cavalry. I know not all the records with every serial number issued survived, but I do know these were issued out in sequence, so it's not a stretch that both ended up in the NY Cavalry. I see these listed for anywhere from $2,000 for a real beat up one with a sewer pipe barrel and cracked stock , to over $5,000 for a really nice example. I am pricing this one to sell. $1,500.00 plus actual shipping or 6% state tax if sold in Vermont. Email me at REDACTED or call Shawn at REDACTED.  ANTIQUE, SO NO FFL (EXCEPT WHERE REQUIRED).

It started life as a Russian M44 carbine in great shape. To that I've added an Archangel Stock (bedded to the action with Acraglas) , Timney trigger, Rock Solid Industries scope mount, Osprey 4-16x50 scope, custom bent bolt, and the barrel has been machined to accept a carbon fiber tube and titanium nut at the muzzle. This gives the barrel the stiffness of a heavy target barrel without all the weight. The muzzle is also threaded with 5/8-24 threads to accept a suppressor or muzzle device (suppressor not included). Comes with two 10rd mags, one 5rd mag and a Harris bipod. I spent over $850 on parts and materials to build this (plus many hours of labor), so I can't give it away, but I'll entertain reasonable offers including trades for guns or ammo."

This is a high quality pistol that is reliable and an extremely smooth shooting firearm. Every feature is fully ambidextrous (saftey, decocker, slide stop, and mag release) It features really nice easy to use sights, a 4 slot pic rail, and 4 interchangeable back straps. The double/single action trigger is light and crisp and in my opinion far superior to a striker gun. I have tested a variety of deffensive ammo with no malfunctions. The pistol comes with the original hard case, cable lock, 4 different size back straps, 3 17 round magazines, around 50 rounds of defensive ammo and some plain 115 gr. ball ammo. Feel free to contact me with any questions. I'm only looking to trade for now and am in no hurry to get rid of it."

Anyone that has had a 1911 built before, knows it takes time. I am unfortunately losing interest in this project as time goes on. I'd like to get the word out ahead of time as I plan on selling it once it's back in my hands. Ideally with a buyer or a trade lined up. I expect it back in a few weeks. It will look SIMILAR to this picture but some of the work I'm having done is cosmetic. It WILL NOT have the factory brushed stainless finish like in the picture when it's back. It will be a high polished jet black ion bond finish. It will also have checkering on the front strap and have a different barrel. Specifically, an EGW checkered front strap is being installed and a match grade scheuman ramped barrel is being fitted. The slide is also being flat topped and serrated and the area around the beaver tail is getting blended. Other than that, it will look the same.. It already has been reworked with Wilson, Edbrown, EGW, and Cylinder & Slide components. Only thing colt that remains is the slide and frame. No MIM components are left. I'll have around 4 grand tied up in this pistol, give or take. Keep that in mind. I'm very open to trades. In particular, I'm looking for an sl8 either g36 converted or factory, a Sig 553p, an sp5k (will consider other MP5's), Brugger & Thomet tp9, and Scar rifles. Will consider anything though. Also interested in various parts kits...Especially HK. May need cash on top depending on your trade. Willig to add cash on top if necessary. Also taking cash offers.(443) 834-3436 is my cell.

The bluing is near perfect with the exception of slight marring on the top of the receiver where a scope rubbed the finish. The walnut stock is in similar condition with a very few handling marks. The rifle does not bear any serial number (or at least I can’t find one) which means that this SA22 was made prior to the year 1968 when serial numbers. Browning’s website states that serial numbers were not available between 1914 & 1955. I have fired the rifle and not only is it beautiful - it functions flawlessly.

Built off of a kit from their last year of production(1994) this build has lots of upgrades.I have no need to sell or trade this rifle. I am merely interested in what is out there. -I got rid of the ambidextrous safety. It is notorious for being gritty and unreliable and had it built with a tradition safety that has been correctly modified for semi-auto use. This eliminates the tendency for the hammer to drop when disassembling. All articulating surfaces polished-This has the stock wire side folding stock all Tantals had. Has has had the action worked to make it smooth to deploy. Has the regular handguard and a Hogue Overmolded pistol grip. -7 mags in total. One Russian ""Plum"", two Duracoated Polish metal mags, two black Bulgarian poly mags with the steel reinforced feed lips, two Magpul PMags. -Cerakote finish, don't remember the exact color, but it is a little darker than FDE. - Had it built with an upgraded barrel. The stock barrel has a large extension to hold a multipurpose barrel device. I had this built with a Green Mountain barrel with it threaded in 1/2""x28 tpi so it could take all AR style muzzle devices. It currently has the typical slant brake to make it as short as possible, but for the right price/trade I can include a DPMS Miculek brake or a Smith Enterprises Good Iron Brake-Custom ground and polished Tapco G2 trigger and hammer. This is the best AK trigger I've used-Polished bolt guides and rails-Circle 10 AK U-Notch sight. Game changer on the AK, in my opinion. -A few hundred rounds of Silver Bear ammo-Some more stuff I'm forgetting right now"

The gun is a great shooter with a crisp trigger and is a real head turner at the range. No rust on or in the barrel, and Its been treated as a safe queen since I purchased it a few years back. Unfortunately a previous owner thought it wise to refinish the stock, and though it looks great, the finish is not origional. There is also a ""fix"" near the grip, where two screws were added to secure a crack. Right now I am up in Vermont for the next two or so weeks, so I will gladly drive down to MA for a sale.

It has a compact overall length of 34″ and a 16 1/8″ barrel. ""The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight and a 3/8″ grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooter.  ""The barrel length is 18¼”, overall length is 36¼” and it weighs in at a very comfortable 5¼ pounds.

This is 1 of less than 1000 made Norinco SKS Poly Tech Hunter. It is in excellent condition and has a beautiful high gloss stock. Information below comes from this SKS website... http://chinesesks.weebly.com/polyt ech-hunter.html. Call or text at any time. REDACTED. Sorry, I had the wrong # listed before. ""The Poly Tech Hunter has the most modifications of any Chinese SKS imported into this country. They are rearsenaled from existing rifles. Get the light just right and you can see were they welded over the previous markings inclusions are even seen on some rifles. You can see this shadow under the new Poly Tech SKS Hunter stamping. 945 is the highest serial number seen.   The first mod was to shorten the barrel to 16.5 inches. Cut off the bayonet lug half way between the front sight and the lug. Install a bushing over the barrel between the gas block and the front sight. The bushing covers the second pin hole from the original FSB, Reinstall the front sight with 1 retaining pin. Then cut the shroud around the sight open as to emulate other military rifles.     They welded up the bayonet groove in the stock ferrule and filled the hole for the cleaning rod with a Uncle Mikes detachable sling swivel. These rifles were not imported by Polytech in Atlanta, Georgia. In actuality they were imported and sold before Kengs switched there name to Polytech. All came through Century Arms International and are import stamped under the barrel.   Next they replaced the rear sight with a windage adjustable sight.   This sight is thicker than the original and requires a relief cut in the bolt carrier above the stripper clip groove.   The original mag is carved and riveted into a 5 rounder. The finished product has 6 rivets on the bottom. There is a metal mag well glued into the stock that goes around the magazine. The bolt wings are relieved for a drop free magazine. Pull on the mag release and the mag will fall out with the charging handle closed. Here is a pic of the mag out of the rifle. Look at it closely. A lot of work went into this mag   All are equipped with a stamped trigger group and a ambidextrous safety. The parts of this rifle are not marked with the serial number. Only the receiver has the serial number on it.    The stocks are only found on this rifle. I don't know what the wood is but the finish is a dark brown. Most have a dull tongue oil finish. While some have the glossy shellack the Chinese are known for. The left side of the stock is cut low for a reason. This allows the use of any drill and tap scope mount without the need to inlet the stock. The rear sling mount is on the bottom of the stock and it comes with the Uncle Mikes detachable sling swivel. These rifles did not come with a sling.The stock has a metal but plate and is not cut for a cleaning kit. It is safe bet to say these rifles started a 00001.  Poly Tech Hunter roll call000190002500026000410006300102001520048000493005490059900675006880072300765007650081200910009370094500985....is the highest number I have a photographic record.........Total 946 rifles"""

Also comes with a pressure switch. This is the strongest legal red laser civilians can buy. Reason I'm selling is because I purchased the wrong model, the OTAL-c comes in two diff models - an IR laser and a red laser beam. I meant to purchase the IR version and now I've waited too long to return it. It's never been used and less than a year old. These sell for $400 about everywhere you can find them. I'll let this one go for $280 FIRM. Bottom dollar!"
