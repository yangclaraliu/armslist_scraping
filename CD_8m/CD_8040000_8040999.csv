I have experienced exactly one failure to eject which I believe was a bad round (Winchester White Box for what it's worth). This is a pistol you can feel confident in.Alien Gear holster is an IWB hybrid style holster with neoprene backing and sturdy kydex shell. Ride height, cant of pistol and retention can be adjusted with a hex key. Alien Gear also sells entire new shells for the backing, so one holster can turn into as many as you like. This is a very comfortable holster that makes concealing in a T-shirt easy.Sticky holster was used primarily to store gun out of sight but in reach between split bench seat in my truck. Also used it to carry in a fanny pack quite frequently, and occasionally as a minimalist IWB holster. I had a problem with the rear site catching on the nylon stitching. To address this I cut a small amount of the webbing off and fused it with flame. Since then I have had no problems drawing. Holster stays put, pistol comes out.2 8rd magazines included as well. One is less than a year old. Both will be loaded with Hornady Critical Defense HPs.This is the most compete concealed carry package you are going to find at this price. Only reason I am selling is I have been carrying my 1911 95% of the time. Just couldn't justify keeping it around if it never gets carried."

It's a great gun but I just got a performance center shield that I carry. This model has the real deal tritium night sights. Some models have the glow paint, which in my opinion aren't true night sights. I also have a +1 pinky extender that I had to order extra and that cost me around 30 bucks. This model with tritium sights on Grabagun is around 650 which is very cheap. In gun  shops they usually charge well over 700. I'm really looking for a fair trade but I'd prob take 550 cash.

I've had it for 3 days.I will trade this for an HK P30L which I believe may be slightly less expensive now that HK has dropped their prices.I would also sell this for what I paid for it which was $625.00+TAX. I'm not taking a loss on a firearm that is very sought after and out of stock everywhere. My shop had literally gotten ONE of these in the same day I bought it and no one in Grand Rapids has these in-stock, I checked.Also a some of the GR shops want $659~679.00 a pop for these which is above MSRP I believe, when they have them. They all have wait lists and get like one or two in at a time. You can have this now, no wait."
