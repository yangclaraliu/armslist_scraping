I dont see this beinh worth the extra $175-200.Watch YouTube and read reviews they get good reviews. Trigger is long and crisp like revolver  I personally like this. This is smaller than Glock 36 and close to Glock 43 9mm. It's very accurate and shoots well when I got it I shot some cheap ammo 14 normal fire and it's very accurate and little recoil. I then fired 7 federal hydroshocks perfect performance. Yesterday I fired Hornady 185 Zombie and it likes them.  I have rapid fired and it's amazing pistol. The holster is top of the line and most comfortable IWB holster you will ever find.

The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is Ed Browns finest work. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button.
