Check out all my listing as I may be interested in doing a package buy if you want all 3. This is a DOU 43 Waffen Werke Brunn marked rifle. This is an all matching rifle.  I bought this one from the son of a vet who brought it back 10 odd years ago at a gun show.  There is no import mark and it is in very good condition. It was sporterized at the time I bought it (with the numbers matching stock, which I still have). And since then I bought a era correct stock and rear band with the hopes of restoring it. Besides the stock and rear band this is an all matching gun, including the sporterised stock. This would be a great project gun for someone or leave it as it is and shoot it.  I do have a milled front band (not era correct, it’s an early band when this rifle would have had a late era sheet metal band) which will be including so you can use the rifle right away. I am asking 650 for this and that’s a great price for what it is. If you want more pictures let me know. Also if interested in buying all 3 of my K98ks we could work a deal out.

the pistol isin great shape you can see that it has been carried but nothing a little love and attention with a rag won't fix if that's what you are looking for.as a note the holster is not fit to accept the gun with the light on. as far as trades I am really looking for smith and wesson compact 2.0 or shield  other then that I am looking for 22lrs and 17 hmr if you got them. The only other thing would be maybe a large caliber rifle (300 win mag, 300 rum, you get the idea haha)
most of those guns trade slightly below the para and with the light too I would like a little cash on top or added features to the gun.let me know what you got the worst I can say is no."

These swords feature heavy duty full tang construction and are made to specifications required for Medieval Reenactors to perform and spar with. This scimitar is in good condition, like new mechanically, but the finish has suffered from a lack of proper oiling and has significant rust on the pommel and beneath the handguard. There are minor rust imperfections on the blade as well as a small indentation on the underside of the handguard caused during moving. None of this affects the function of the scimitar and with some light sanding and polishing it could be made as good as new. I unfortunately don't have a workshop space for restoration or a space to display the sword any longer. My loss is your gain. This would make a great project for someone who is handy and enjoys serious medieval hardware. The price has been adjusted to reflect the work needed to restore the sword to its former glory, and is firm. These cost $325.00 new. You can find more info on their website at star fire swords dot com. Cash only, no trades. Thanks very much for checking this out. Tax return season is here, get this while it's still available!"

It’s a great Rifle, I have just come to realize that I much prefer pistols. It comes with 2- 30 round magazines. Im looking to trade for a full size pistol in 9mm, .40, or .45.im open to most common brands except Taurus, Glock, or Kimber. I’d also be interested in a .44 magnum. Cash on either end to even things up. FFL transfer and CCP are a must. FFL for legality sake and CCP because I don’t have time to wait a week while your background check clears. It’s $55 and convenient as hell so why don’t you have one already? Lol!Im really good about responding even if just to say “no thanks”, so message me and we’ll see if we can make it work."
