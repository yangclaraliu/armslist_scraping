Please click link below to puchase.https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/cold-steel-recon-tanto-fixed-in-vg-10-san-mai-7-blade-11-3-4-length-35am/ Description   Our Recon Tanto continues to redefine the standard for combat knives around the globe. Having seen active military application in numerous conflicts over the last 20 years, it is well on its way to becoming the preferred fixed blade for special military units and even SWAT teams on our own soil. Experience the extraordinary quality – test the distinctive razor-sharp edge for yourself and you will see why the Recon Tanto is a knife you can’t afford to be without! Also available in SK-5 and 3V. There isn’t a person working in the knife industry today that knows more about the Tanto than Cold Steel does. It was, after all, Cold Steel who invented and popularized this knife style in the early 1980’s. We have spent millions of dollars persuading the public, both through advertising and live or videotaped demonstrations, of the Tanto’s many advantages. We have been producing Tanto’s for more than 30 years now, and there is still no factory or custom knifemaker around making a Tanto that can approach the cutting, slashing or piercing power of one that is manufactured by Cold Steel. All of our Tantos feature a deep lustrous satin finish on the hollow ground blade bevels and a contrasting line grain finish on the blade flats. This technique highlights our state of the art grinding methods and emphasizes the Cold Steel Tanto’s unique appearance. In addition, the Tanto’s come with our famous flattened oval Kraton® handle. The oval shape provides a solid grip and resists rolling or twisting in the hand under hard use, the kind that, over time, would destroy a lesser knife. The use of Kraton® in knife handles is another Cold Steel innovation. Kraton® is an unparalleled space age material that won’t crack or rot and is immune to the ravages of bad weather. The tapered, solid steel pommel is another important Tanto feature that should not be ignored. Lynn Thompson designed it to concentrate the full force of a crushing blow in a small area so that even a moderately powerful blow can be remarkably effective in disarming or otherwise incapacitating an attacker. The Tanto series knives in San Mai® all come with a thick, high quality Secure-Ex™ sheath that is sure to give years of hard service and keep your Tanto at your side, ready for action."

It is completely factory stock and is in excellent condition.It's really neat how it uses a variation of the standard AR-15 bolt and locking lugs. It negates the need for a super heavy bolt and buffer. This gun is over a pound lighter than another similar 9mm AR pistol I had that was a regular blow-back design!Additionally, the delayed-blowback design should allow it to be suppressed more easily than a standard blow-back AR.The bolt locks back on an empty magazine, and the forward assist actually works. These two features are often missing on other 9mm AR firearms.Comes with the following:KAK Shockwave Blade Brace/Stabilizer & KAK notched buffer tubeMagpul MOE pistol gripCMMG Keymod handguardOne 33rd factory Glock happy stick magazineThe original box, owners manual, warranty card, CMMG catalog/flyer, safety cable-lock, etc.The only trade interest I have at this time would be a Gen 3 Glock 17 9mm, plus cash or extras.Located in New Castle, Indiana.

Rifle will hold MOA with Match ammo as long as the shooter does his/her job. Rifle also comes with 10 new unopened 25 round Magpul magazines. Rifle will be transferred through an FFL, I am aware that it is not required, please do not ask. If you have any questions or want more pics feel free to contact me. The price is $2250 (not in a hurry to sell) but I will entertain resonable offers. I am not looking to trade, trying to make room in my gun safe. Thank you for your consideration."

This one is in very good condition, chambered in the powerful .30 carbine with 2x 15rd magazines included. Rear sight replaced with a fully adjustable Williams ramp sight. This is a Generation 2 Universal, considered by collectors to be better quality than the later Generation 3 types with the slide lock lever. This beast is a firebreather with surprisingly light recoil.  The .30 carbine cartridge is much more efficient with the shortened barrel with less flash and noise than a .223 or 7.62x39 pistol, losing only 100-150 fps when fired out of the Enforcer's 12 inch barrel.  Though considered a pistol cartridge the .30 carbine penetrates hard barriers including Kelvar soft armor at close range very well. Ammo is common and Hornady and Buffalo make some impressive hunting and high performance loads. Scope mounts are available, and magazines are available in 5 to 40 round capacity. Additional pictures available on request. Prefer a face to face transaction in North Platte, purchase or carry permit must be presented at time of sale.

At the heart of the 101 is a low-profile steel receiver that enhances quick and instinctive shooting needed for upland hunting. With the low-profile receiver, recoil occurs in-line, directly back, reducing muzzle jump for faster follow-up shots. A Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad absorbs recoil also aiding in getting off rapid second shots, while reducing shooter fatigue so you can stay alert and ready to instantly shoulder the gun again when another bird flushes. The Model 101 uses the field proven Invector-Plus™ interchangeable choke tube system that works hand-in-hand with .742 back-bored barrels to reduce shot deformation and promote uniform shot patterns to consistently down birds. Hard, chrome-plated chambers and bores provide surfaces that are highly resistant to wear and corrosion, and clean easily. The Winchester Model 101 Ultimate Field Over/Under Shotgun comes with a finely finished walnut stock and fore-end with 20 lines-per-inch cut checkering that looks elegant and provides a non-slip grip. All metal components are machined to exact tolerances, and wood-to-metal fit is extremely tight. Chrome plated chambers and bores.- Comes with 3 Invector-Plus choke tubes (F, M, IC)."
404,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8058404,For Sale:  Rare Lend/Lease 1911 From WW2 Nearly Mint Condition,"St Matthews, Louisville, Kentucky","$ 1,500","Listed On: Monday, March 5, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Thinning out some of my collection to fund some other purchases. I bought this lend/lease marked 1911 several years ago because it was unlike anyhting I had ever encountered, and I collect a lot of 1911 variants. This 1911's frame, serial 408211, began life as a Colt in 1918 for WW1. At some point in it's service life, between then and WW2, the slide became damaged and the pistol ended up at Augusta Arsenal. There it was fitted with a new Remington slide, High Standard barrel, a few A1 parts including the grips, and parkerized. Now here's where it gets interesting. From there the pistol was sent to England as part of our lend/lease program. You'll find the British proof marks on the barrel, slide, and frame. Due to the incredible condition of the finish, it is unlikely that the pistol was ever issued upon being received and accepted by England.
The parkerized finish is uniform throughout the pistol with little to no wear to be found. The only slight sign of wear is found on the right side of the trigger. The barrel's finish is blued and there's bits of cosmoline in the rifling. The bore overall looks brand new. The frame bears the 'United States Property' mark as well as 'AA' for Augusta Arsenal and the English acceptance stamp. The slide displays the English acceptance stamp as well as the standard Remington Rand hallmarks and a P on the top of the slide.
This truly is a unique piece of history. A frame that saw both World Wars and proof marks that it was sent to our ally Britian to aid in the fight against Germany. And to top of that off, it's in fantastic condition. Since ArmsList will only allow a few photos please refer to the below DropBox link for the a gallery of high-resolution photos. If you have any questions or would like to see additional pics of anything just let me know. Please respond via email and I will get back to you quickly. I am not a FFL holder however I would be happy to ship the pistol provided you make arrangements with an FFL in your state that can receive it and transfer it to yourself.Asking $1500 however I will entertain realistic offers. Not interested in any trades at this time so please do not ask.

I believe this is a mid war production and is transitional from having the blued blade but the hooked quillion. The bluing is original and in excellent + shape. The frog and scabbard are in excellent shape. The only wear on this whole package is on the grips, and it isn't much. I believe it would be very hard to upgrade this set.

This weapon would make a great carry for anyone. -This 9mm handgun has a 14(+1) magazine capacity-I have 2 mags for this gun-Frame Aluminum (7075 T6)-Grips are rubber (manufacture grips)-Trigger Mechanism is DA/SA-Has a Decocker-Barrel is 3.75 inches and cold hammer forged -Over all length 7.24 inches Overall weight 27.5 Oz-Sights are Fixed 3 dot I would be be interested in trading this for an AR-15 as well. Not looking for another handgun I am looking for a rifle. Thank you

Up for sale or trade is my Smith & Wesson Model 19-3 in great mechanical condition.2.5” Snub Nose Pinned Barrel.357 MagnumRound Butt Original Wood Grips30.5 ouncesK-FrameDA/SA6 Shot Cylinder with Recessed ChambersAdjustable Rear / Ramp Front Iron SightsColor Case Hardened Trigger and Hammer with Easily Removable Firing Pin on HammerThe finish does show a fair amount of wear and is the original factory blued carbon steel. While this was clearly carried extensively and is not perfect, it has very sharp rifling and does function very nicely. This was not much of a shooter. I only have a few hundred rounds through it personally and it does not appear to have been shot much more than that. I bought it used and cannot be sure of the actual round count. The revolver bundle will come with the Model 19-3, a black leather IWB/OWB holster with adjustable retention and a speed loader. I am asking $650 for the bundle. I am willing to work on that for the right deal. Typically, I prefer to work in trades for the right stuff but cash is king. I don't have much .357 Magnum ammo but I can add some to help even out a trade.If you are interested, please save us both a lot of time and review the below information. Thanks!If the ad is still up, the item is still available. I will remove the ad when it sells like everyone should do on every listing anyway. CPL holders always prefered. All firearms sales (serialized parts) will require a bill of sale AND RI-060 transfer for handguns. This is only done as a measure of protection for both parties. This is something you should welcome in an honest transaction. The registration paperwork and bill of sale on handguns is not negotiable. If you read this and are still interested and have any questions, please let me know.Please, be able to have an intelligent conversation about pricing, values, basic guns and ammo information and item descriptions. I try to list everything of importance in my ads and do not want to have a week long back and forth discussion because you cannot articulate an acceptable explanation of your items or questions about my items. If you refer to magazines as clips, cartridges as boolets or send photos of your guns with your finger on the trigger, I will assume we are off to a less than desirable start. Sorry if I sound rude, but I have bought and sold a fair amount from Armslist and the sheer amount of people that cannot seem to follow the golden four rules of firearms safety or use correct terminology is an ongoing issue. It is an ongoing issue across the entire firearms culture for some reason and every one of us should be working to do better.If you want to test fire a gun that I am selling, that is perfectly acceptable in most cases. I am happy to meet with you at COSC on a weekend with you as my guest or at a range of your choosing at your own expense.Thank you for looking! Check out my ""Listings by this user"" link to the right of the photo above for a look at all of my listed items! I am always listing new items and may not have something posted yet.
