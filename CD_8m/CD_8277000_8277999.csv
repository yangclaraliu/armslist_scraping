Bought new in 2017 and decided I'm not an AR guy. Exactly 100 rounds fired through this rifle. In pristine condition with all original accessories. The best price you'll find currently (late April 2018) online for a new one is $550. Also included are 2 extra 30-round Gen 2 PMAGs (3 total since the gun came with one) and 1 10-round Gen 3 PMAG ($30 value for 3 extra magazines). Also include an AR-style silicone-treated gun sock ($10) and 150 rounds of loose amunition (TulAmmo steel-cased and Federal brass-cased, $45 value). That brings the total value up to $635 plus tax, transfer, and FFL fee, which would bump the price up to around $720 or more. I'm selling the entire package for $550 FIRM. Buyer MUST have TN HCP and sign bill of sale. No trades. If the ad is up the rifle is available. No shipping. FTF only."

The bore is in great condition and the rifle is functional. The gun is in arsenal-stored condition and needs to be oiled and the traces of cosmoline cleaned. Includes rifle, one enbloc magazine, 6 rounds of 6.5 Carcano and sling. While fully functional, this gun was never intended to fire modern smokeless powder 6.5 Carcano except in a last-ditch emergency situation i.e. World War I. While it will handle it, it is not recommended. 6.5 Carcano rounds loaded with black powder are what you want to shoot in it *IF* you decide to shoot it at all. The 6 included rounds are modern smokeless 6.5 Carcano that would probably be a bad idea to shoot out of it. You could pull the bullets and save the brass."

It is not import marked and my understanding is that this was a WWII bring-back. The grips are obviously not original, in fact, upon closer inspection you will notice that they were hand fashioned from the unmistakeable wood of a K98 German Mauser buttstock. The bottom of the grip frame is sheared off where the grip plate and lanyard ring were. It’s unclear if this was done intentionally to accommodate the grips, or if the grips were designed as a repair for a damaged grip frame which would have prevented the original grips from staying on properly. I’d like to think this is a French Resistance gun that was modified with on-hand materials, but who knows."

Gun was originally a 416 rigby, sent it to PAc-Nor to get it rebarreled in 500 A-Square. Has A custom MAde Terminator T4+ Brake reamed out to take the 50 cal projectile with 7/8x20 threads. Selling this as a project gun, although everything functions and feeds perfectly the stock could use a little cleaning up. Barrel channel was inletted out to take the much heavier profile barrel. Measures 1.23 at the start and 1.05 at the muzzle (Before the MUzzle threading) 28 Inch barrel, and the chamber has been custom throated to take the longer BMG/Military projectiles. BAsically just seat the bullet into the crimp groove and your good to go for the military bullets.  75 Formed, Prepped, Primed ready to load cases come with it as well as 11 Loaded rounds loaded with 570 GR BArnes BAnded solids. I also HAve a box of 25 Fireformed Casings but have to find where I put them. Custom Dies from CH4d, Seating die which can also be used as a crimp Die, and sizing DIe. Comes with 150 Military Bullets, 18 750 AMAXS, Over 400 Barnes 570GR Solids, 42 Hornady Solids, 2 CAns Of REloder19 Which is probably most versatile Powder for loading this round. Also wikll throw in scope rings and a cheap scope probably worth around $100. Muzzle Brke currently Times to where the 2 Ports are at 6 and 12 o clock, will need to be adjusted if you want them horizontal. Over $4000 into this gun to get it to this point. Basically built this to have a 50 BMG type rifle but since most ranges dont allow BMG I built this. Will single feed the miltary Bullets, Or the magazine fits 3 of the safari Styled Rounds plus one in the chamber. CAn include the original barrel in 416 rigby, since im most likely not doing anything with it. Gun Weighs 12.5 Pounds with the brake on it and recoil runs about 40-45 foot pounds, which isnt bad for something with 8000-9000 pounds of energy on the other end. Contact me on here for questions, not really looking for trades but may consider something so dont be afraid to send an offer. Starting this one at $2400 which is about 2/3 of whats into it.
