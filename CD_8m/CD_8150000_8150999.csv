I've had it for a year and a half and it has been a great varmint rifle for me, but doing more varminting at night (foxes been getting my chickens) means mounting my spotlight on the scope... and the harmonic balancer on the barrel (especially in stainless) catches some of the light and blurs my view. For this reason, I switched back to a bolt action for varmints and I'm selling this.It comes with a Bushnell 4-16x40 scope with lighted reticle. The reticle is powered by a button battery and has several brightness settings in red and green to provide contrast in low light. It also comes with 2 mags, I think a 15 and a 20, one is Ruger and one aftermarket, both feed flawlessly. The balancer on the end of the barrel is adjustable, I've got it tuned for a specific reload, you may need to adjust it for whatever ammo you shoot. I used this for varmints, mostly in the 100 to 175 yard range, and if it weren't for 2 shots I attempted on running foxes, it would have a perfect record of 23 kills in 23 shots.Bipod not included but it does come with the adapter that allows standard bipods to be attached.Sigh. I hate to have to do this, but it seems necessary. If you're interested, mention the rifle and ask specific questions about the rifle, or about when and where we could meet. I will not respond to ""still for sale?"". If you sent me an email with less that 6 words in it, and were actually interested, try again."

This specific model is a stainless version, also known being referred to as HK's Bi-tone model. They use that term simply because it has the standard black frame with an all stainless slide. This gun was manufactured in 97' and I believe HK discontinued the stainless model in the early 2000's. This gun has seen very few rounds its entire life and it spends all its time sitting in the safe. This would make anyone a very accurate and dependable piece. I believe I do have the box and paperwork with it as well. If you have any questions, feel free to call or ask. Thanks for looking!Dustin 270-317-4376"
