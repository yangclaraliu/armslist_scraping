The finish still seems good for the most part. $50 for the Russian stock in the middle rightThe far right stock came from a Yugoslavian rifle. It is missing the sling swivel, buttplate, cleaning kit and handguard. Either it's finish has been removed or it didn't have much of a finish to begin with, but other than that this stock seems in good shape. $30 for the Yugoslavian stock on the far rightUnfortunately I am without a means of transportation, so if you would like to buy any of these SKS stocks, you will have to come to Ephrata.My phone number is 509-398-6179, please text if you have a question or offer."

The rifle features a 24 inch heavy fluted barrel with a muzzle break, a one piece picitinny rail, digital camo AccuStock, AccuTrigger, and an all steel construction 10 round detachable box magazine by Accurate Mag Company.  In addition to that, I have a 6-18 Vortex Crossfire II scope with a level attached, a cheek riser, and an imitation Harris bipod.  I zeroed the rifle at a hundred yards last August, cleaned it, oiled it, and put it away.  The only adjustment I never made to it is on the magazine feed lip.  I never bothered to buy the adjustment tool because I feed the ammo by hand one round at a time when I shoot long range.  The mag feed lip probably needs to be opened up about 3 thousandths or so to get the cartridges to feed more smoothly.  The adjustment tool costs about 25 bucks.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale.  1000 dollars gets everything I listed in the ad.  900 gets you everything but the optic.  Not looking for trades at this time."

Cash Only, email with questions. Comes with bolt and washer. If the add is still up it is still avaialble. LaRue Tactical A-PEG™Initially designed with the precision shooter in mind, the folks at LaRue Tactical queried trusted individuals in the precision shooting community what they would prefer in a grip. The result is the LaRue A-PEG™. The project grew into an accessory that featured ambidextrous geometry that can be used by all shooters, enchaining control of AR15-type weapons. The A-PEG™ is available in two sizes; Regular (for 5.56 receivers) and Extended (for 7.62 receivers). The Extended version fills the “gap” in AR10-platform receivers. Inspired by the human hand, the unique “flats” on the front and back fall more naturally onto the geometry of the hand’s structure. The flat front also provides indexing to help level and square the firearm to the target. A sculptured palm swell on either side fits nicely into the hollows of the palm. A gentle taper helps seat the hand towards the firearm, and helps to keep the hand from sliding. The generous texture added to the sides gives just the right amount of traction in slippery conditions. Having an A2 footprint, the A-PEG™ will attach to almost any firearm that has an AR15-type grip interface. Comes complete with mounting hardware.

I have 4 boxes of 7/8 oz slugs and 2 boxes of buckshot ( 4B+1B ) These are pretty rare. Hard to find on a few major ammunition sites. And when you can they are $20 a box for slugs and like $22 for the buck shot. These are perfect for home defense or teaching a youngster to hunt. Just look these up on youtube and you will see for yourself. There is an adaptor for your Mossberg called The Mini Clip. Made by OPSol ( like $22 on ebay ) These will double the capacity of your HD shotgun. Some really cool youtube videos featuring the Mossberg Shockwave, the Mini Clip and this ammo. Asking $15 each or B.O. Will only sell as a lot of 6. Will not sell separately. Need to meet FTF in the Athol/ Leominster area and i will need to see your LTC. Whether you are looking to double your shotgun capacity or looking for some collectable ammo, these are it !"

Comes with upgraded Trijicon HD night sights that cost me $175.00.  2 10 round magazines. I purchased a brand new Glock 30s upper and brand new Glock 30 Gen 4 Lower. I then had brand new Trijcion HD night sights installed. They do not make a Glock 30S Gen 4. It's really difficult to find a Brand new Glock 30 Gen 4 Lower. This gun is in mint condition and only has 50 rounds fired through it. This is an amazing gun that packs a punch with 10+1 rounds of .45 AUTO.The advantage of the Glock 30s is the slimmer slide that is better for concealed carry. Later down the road you could also buy a Glock 36 lower and also use this Glock 30s slide on it to bascially have a Glock 36 at the same time. On Gun broker you can find a Glock 36 lower usually around $165.00 give or take. This Glock 30s Gen 4 comes with the original box and adjustable backstraps. I didn't like the Glock 30 Gen 4 because the Glock 30 Gen 4 upper is thicker than the Glock 30s slide. I didn't like the Glock 30s lower because it is a gen 3. This Glock 30s Gen 4 gives you the best of both worlds. You get the slimmer upper and the nicer gen 4 lower that allows you change the grip to fit your hand better. Asking $800.00 or best offer.Text or call me with offers or questions @ (407) 797-9569.

Chambered in the 5.7x28mm this cartridge offers mild report and virtually nonexistant recoil for fast and controllable follow up shots. And there are a lot of follow up shots available with this gun, the cartridge feeds from a top-loading 50 round FN P90 magazine, and ejects straight down through the lower receiver magazine well. The brass lands in a nice little pile, or you can make a brass catcher with a standard AR15 magazine with the spring and follower removed. In excellent condition with about 200 rounds fired. The Gen 2 upper has some nice refinements over the 1st gen, weighing over a pound less with unnecesary material removed from the picatinney handguards and a fluted barrel. Magazine release on the Gen 2 is ambidexterous, and it also has the option for left side charging, which I currently have set it up for for ease and speed of use. Ergo grip pistol grip and Magpul Moe adjustable stock included with the lower.To utilize left side charging the bolt hold open device is normally removed, however I wanted to be able to manually lock the bolt open. Instead of removing it I modified the BHO to clear the charging handle and the upper receiver so it could manually hold the bolt open. If you put the AR57 upper on an unmodified stock lower, the design of the upper prevents the BHO from being pressed in to lock the bolt open. Not a huge loss of function, as the PS90 magazines have no provision for tripping a LRBHO but I wanted to be able to manually lock the bolt back for chamber checks, malfunction clearance, and cease fires. I machined enough material from the BHO to allow it to clear the walls of the upper receiver so that it can now hold the bolt open. With this setup on the left side I have the ability to pull back and lock the bolt open with my left hand while keeping my right hand on the pistol grip. This is much less awkward than having to release my right hand from the pistol grip to pull the charging handle on the right side while activating the BHO with my left handThe bolt is a standard semi auto type. The buffer is a couple ounces heavier than the standard AR57 bolt, it slows the extraction resulting in slightly less deformed brass and adds a small extra margin of safety for the blowback design as well as slightly reduced recoil impulse for the already low recoil of the 5.7.It's currently wearing a truglow 2x red dot sight. I found the size and height is perfect for the short length raised Picatinney rail on the upper, while the low magnification red dot is very fast on target and about optimal for the 200 yard effective range of the 5.7x28. I've also tried a compact 3-9 power scope on it and found it's extremely accurate with sub-MOA groups being easy to attain. Long scopes that hang over the magazine impede loading and unloading but it can be done by swinging the magazine under the scope, it's just slow and awkward.I have several factory AR57 magazines and an ATI magazine. The AR57 mags are the way to go, they're affordable, feeding is flawless and the mags lock in and remove easily. Perfect copies of the FN mag but cost a lot less. The ATI mag doesnt lock in as easily though it does feed alright. The promag and korean aftermarkets I havnt tried but the manufacturer doesnt recommend them.The lower is an Omni Polymer lower, very lightweight and durable and lockup with the AR57 upper is nice and night. I've put some 200 rounds through this setup and it has very little wear. Asking $950 for the rifle, or $800 for the upper, optic not included. I'll include 4 AR57 factory magazines and 1 ATI magazine. Additional factory AR57 magazines are available for $20 each. 5.7 ammo available as well. If the optic is wanted I'd like $50 for that."
