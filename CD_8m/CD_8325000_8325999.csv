SAM7 receivers are milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock but Arsenals hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.
Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive but Arsenals meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength precision and durability. 
100% new-production parts and components.
Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger
Cold hammer-forged 16.3"" barrel from Arsenals Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology
Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber
Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads.
Intermediate length US-made 10 trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4.)

The only trade would be a Taurus PT-92 that is a little newer, preferably before 2005, like 84-04 prior to the decocker but not necessarily a deal breaker. This is an 82-83 vintage weapon, it has the heel European style safety of the Beretta 92 original model. Most PT-92 magazines have both style cuts so not a big deal on magazines, I just want one a little newer. These are known to be much higher in quality than the newest PT-92s, they always find ways to make em a little cheaper. In case you don't know...PT-92s are refined Beretta 92s, they have forged frames, slides and barrels and forged guide rods unlike the plastic Beretta ones. They also have the frame mounted safety so you can carry this cocked and locked like a 1911 unlike the Beretta. This weapon appears unfired and includes original magazine, box, warrranty card and a big fold out info poster with a parts breakdown. It only has a couple little nicks on the inside of the hand grip. Not trying to be rude, but if you have a PT-92 for trade that has been abused or dropped I am not interested. Thanks for looking."
