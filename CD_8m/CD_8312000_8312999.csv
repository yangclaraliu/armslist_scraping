Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact.READ LESSShareSPECSCALIBER.40SWRECOIL SYSTEMDual Spring w/ Full Length Guide RodSIGHTSFiber Optic Front, Low Profile Combat Rear (Steel)WEIGHT26 ozs. w/ Compact Mag, 27 ozs. w/ X-Tension™HEIGHT4.75"" w/ Compact Mag, 5.5"" w/ X-Tension™SLIDEForged Steel, Melonite® FinishBARREL3"" Hammer Forged, Steel, Melonite® / 1:16 TwistLENGTH6.25""GRIP WIDTH1.19""FRAMEBlack PolymerMAGAZINES1 - 9 Round Compact, 1 - 12 Round w/ X-Tension™, Stainless Steel"

This has the shortest stroke of any lever action Ive ever encountered. The blueing is worn and there is a old repaired crack in the stock (pictured) but never caused problem or issue. I will include 45 rounds of factory 256wm ammo in the sale as well. Asking $650 obo. I live in Anderson and work on Indys westside for FTF sale.... and I will need to see a Indiana drivers license and would also like to see a LTCH as well with nothing recorded. THANKS"

(for those not familiar with using the 9mm in a revolver):February 24, 2017 by KenI’ve been a law enforcement officer for the past 29 years. This revolver mechanically and cosmetically is not at the same level of a $1000 plus firearm, nor is it purported or expected to be. Charter Arms does not manufacture museum quality handguns. The do build durable, reliable weapons with superior quality components where it counts (like the beryllium copper firing pins which are widely regarded as unbreakable.)Similarly, the action which boast fewer parts than most other double action revolvers, is robust and reliable but lacks the refinement of a S&W. The revolver is very attractive, adequately finished and the action better than I would expect for a currently manufactured revolver at this price point.The timing is absolutely 100 percent perfect.As the revolver got dirty it was more difficult to punch out the empties.It contains a spring-loaded plunger for each chamber.These plungers eliminate the need for the use of half-moon or full-moon clips, which are usually required to eject semi-auto cartridges from a revolver.Key Specifications:Caliber: 9mm (standard 9mm)Action: Revolver (SA / DA)Capacity: 5Barrel length: 2.2""Frame Finish: MatteGrips: Full rubber/ NeopreneSights: FixedHammer: SpurredOverall length: 6.75""Overall weight: 22 ozs.Must have LTCH."
