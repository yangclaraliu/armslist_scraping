This is an awesomely fun and cool looking bike. It was a 2001 sportster that I converted into a hardtail. It is fun to ride and is definitely a head turner. The led sled kit that was used is a top of the line hardtail conversion kit that is welded onto the original frame (not one of those finicky bolt on kits). The kit also included a battery box relocator that sits up under the back fender giving it a cleaner look, as well as a led sled oil tank that sits under the seat. The kit with the hard tail frame, battery box and oil tank cost $950 . I also converted it from a belt drive to a chain drive that was a$275. I added an after market led sled fender that was $150 and fender struts that were $110. It has low rise Rolling Sands handle bars that cost $250, but you could easily throw on some mini apes if you want a different look. And lastly but not least is a seat pan kit that was $325, and a hand crafted leather seat that was $350. As you can see the parts alone costs almost $2500 and that doesn’t even include the cost of labor. There is nothing wrong with the bike, the only reason I’m selling is because I recently had a neck fusion as well as shoulder surgery and riding is just too painful now, and I’m also trying to fund another project. If interested hit me up and I can send more pics or answer any questions.$3500 OBOMight be interested in a partial trade, but mainly looking for cash.my cell# 9one9-888-3 four 2 zero Thanks"

I bought this in 1990 new and have shot it about 6 times total. Total safe queen. Cycles 2-3/4"" shells reliably. Will shoot light power loads, but for 100% reliability use full power loads like the manual recommends. No dents, dings, etc besides the slight wear marks every Spas get from working the action. Everything is original with the exception of the buffer and folding stock rubber bumper. Original Hook not repro and original push button not retrofit. Can give you tips on spotting either if you need. Consider trade for Five Seven and cash."

Factory or P-mag doesn't matter to me, long as they are in good shape. Please note I do NOT have any for sale, so don't ask. How much I'll pay depends on what you've got and how many you've got.  Looking in particular for 33rd mags, but will also take standard 17rd mags. Translucent mags are also welcomed! If you've got a speed loader as well, I'll take it. Can negotiate price. Thanks for looking!"

NO SHIPPING. Face to face only in Topeka, Kansas or near by. I could drive a little ways to meet. This is everything you need to fill your PCP guns. The only two PCP guns I have now are my two Marauders, and I have a pump I can fill them up with easily. I sold my AAA Slayer. There’s no real point in me owning this stuff anymore. That being said, this equipment has seen very little use and works perfectly. I’m a hunter, not a target shooter, so they have been used in that capacity. I’ve owned everything since 5/24/16 and the tank has been filled less than 20 times during that period. I bought everything but the moisture filter from Precision Airguns. I’m very meticulous about how I treat my equipment and everything has been maintained and cared for according to the manufacturers instructions. The air compressor comes with a nice no-kink tube with foster fitting and dead head cap. It also comes with extra grease, seals, and instruction manual. Other than two hunting trips riding in the back seat(never taken out of the car into the field) the tanks has been in the same spot the entire time I’ve had it. The born on date is April 2016. It is in perfect condition and comes with a no-kink hose with a foster fitting and dead head cap. It also has a top of the line gauge and fill adapter. The moisture filter is VERY well made. It was made by Jamie Lavalee, who goes by dman over on the talontunes forum. It was $262 when I bought it new. A lot of people prefer it to the Diablo or other moisture filters. It is rated for 6000psi. It is a sought after filter. I’m not trying to sell it separately from the air compressor though. Once the air compressor sells, I’d be willing to sell it on its own, if the buyer of the compressor didn’t want it.I’M ASKING $1650 FOR EVERYTHING. FACE TO FACE IN TOPEKA.

Com   Thank you and God bless!There is lots of confusion on the internet as to the legality of selling a completed 80%/home built firearm. As per FEDERAL law, it is legal to sell a “home built” firearm. It is ILLEGAL to build a firearm with the INTENT to sell it without becoming a licensed manufacturer. If you were to complete your 80%, use it for a while, serialize it and then decide to sell it to finance your next build…all good. If you sit at home finishing 2 of them a week and listing them on Gunbroker…federal crime. It is much the same as selling your PRIVATE collection/inherited firearms from home/a gun show vs buying guns in private sales/shows and then trying to flip them for a profit. It’s all about intent. This is the only one I’ve done over a year ago and have used it. Did not buy this with intent to sell, just don’t use it much and have other options, also could use the money. Thanks for reading."

I have 57 rounds to go with it. Everybody thinks that 300 RUM is ""painful"" to shoot, and it can be with full power or hot loads but plenty of manufacturers make lower recoil rounds (like the ones I have for the gun) so don't think necessarily you'll have a broke shoulder and fall out of the tree if you shoot a deer with it. I'm interested in trades. Nothing really specific. I like all different types of guns so just shoot me a offer.Depending on the trade I may cab add cash or something else or I can take the scope off and even up the trade.
