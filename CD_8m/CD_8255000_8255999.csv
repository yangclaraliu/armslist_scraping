2,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8255002,For Trade:  2000+ rounds Speer gold dot 223,"Twin cities, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, May 5, 2018",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Two .50 cal ammo cans each with 1000+ rounds of 223 62 grain Speer Gold Dot Law enfocement duty ammunition. These are soft points. This ammo is specially made with SBR’s in mind. I have spoken with Speer about their ballistics multiple times. They said it will reliably expand with a 10 inch barrel past 300 yards, and will reliably expand with a 7.5 inch barrel to about 220-260 yards. Noticeably quieter and way less muzzle flash out of 7 inch pistol AR and 10.3 AR, Speer says ballistics are better as well than most loads in short barrels.  This ammo is not hunting ammo, although I’m sure it would work for that as well. this is quality defensive ammunition made by Speer for their Gold Dot line of LE ammo. I have fired several thousand of this stuff through multiple AR Pistols/SBRs and a few rifles and never had a malfunction.This is new manufacture ammo, non nickel cased. reloadable ammunition.ammo is can be somewhat hard to find, case of 1000 sells for around $700-850. Normally only sold to us civilians via police surplus/trade ins. Would consider selling/trading cases individually. I really do not want to hand count say 500 rounds or 350 etc. send me an offer. Worst I’ll say is no. also have 8mm surplus mauser ammo, around 600 or so rounds, mix of 1943 Turkish and 1954/1955 Ecuadorian. All on stripper clips."

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec  Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. The barrel is fluted for light weight and effective heat dissipation. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.  Brand: Kel-Tec UPC: 640832002676 MFR #: PMR30BBLK"

I say that it is an A5 Light because when researching it, Browning’s website said that the Light model has the serial# on the bottom side of the receiver in front of the loading port, which is exactly where this one is. It has a serial# of 7xxxx6, which when I tried to date it according to Browning’s Website, has to be between 1903-1939. As it said, you would have to guess but if you take 228,000 and divide that by 36 years, that comes out to approximately 6,334 weapons produced each year which one would imagine coming to this serial# in year 12, which would be approximately 1915.

Will not lower anymore. This Tactical 5.0 has had some work done to it by a local gun shop to make it a great competition pistol. It’s had the whole lower grip replace with a DVC grip, Daweson Precision Ice Magwell, a Sti gunsmith blank trigger(left long and flat cut), as well as had a trigger job to smooth out the brake and reset. The grip safety has also been deactivated but not pinned. The upper and slide has been stripped of the finish and is now a satin stainless steel finish instead of the blued finish. Front sight has been changed to a Dawson Precision fiber optic sight. Over all it’s a solid pistol. Has been used in a few competitions and has roughly 5k rounds through it. Keep in mind it takes about 2k rounds to brake in a pistol like this. I’ve had a few questions on the round count. sell only no trades.  If you have any questions please feel free to message me.You must be 21 years old and have a valid Nevada ID. I will be doing a bill of sell with both yours and my Nevada ID number on it. The pistol is sold as is in a working condition."

The Flat Dark Earth version of the P-10 C.
Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.
First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.
Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.
Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.
Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.
It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

If you are planning a build or just putting lowers away for a rainy day you can't go wrong with Spike's lower receivers. The PHU rifles are the result of our collaboration with Pipe Hitters Union attitude apparel. PHU was founded in Baghdad in 2004 by American security contractors who found themselves at war without the benefit of formal weapon supply. This forced them to build their own rifles with little bureaucracy and oversight. This created an era of innovation and an evolutionary jump in development of AR products. This rifle has been built to the specifications of the Pipe Hitters Union CEO, who spent over 20 years serving at every level of the GWOT. Together with Spike's years of experience, sourcing hard to find parts, and building consistent blocks of custom ARs, we are proud to offer these combat rifles as our Flagship product of 2016.
