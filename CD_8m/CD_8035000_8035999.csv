It's the gun on the left.This is a cool piece with interesting background. Made by Beistegui Hermanos in Spain between 1909 and 1936 as a copy of the FN 1905 / Colt 1908 Vest pocket pistol. Those designs went on to become the Baby Browning. Beistegui Hermanos is still around today, but they currently make bicycles. At the time, Spanish pistol makers were trying to get into the European gun market that was dominated by FN Herstal. The roll mark on this gun says FABRIQUE D'ARMES DE GUERRE DE GRANDE PRECISION, to trick potential consumers into thinking it was the roll mark on the FN 1905, Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre.This particular specimen has two sets of proof marks; the original Eibar proofs, and a second set of Belgian proofs.Cool, accurate, tiny pistol with thumb safety, grip safety, magazine disconnect safety. All matching serials. These are solid all steel pocket pistols. Willing to hear trade offers, not particularly wanting to sell. Comes with a partial (39) box of Winchester .25.Update: just took her to the range today, still fun. I shot about 50 rounds. Could use a refresh on the recoil/firing pin springs. My uncle has a matching one these and pointed me towards this when he saw it for sale. Comparing with his, I found three coils broken on the original firing pin spring when I first bought it. It goes bang when you pull the trigger, but the firing pin also acts as the ejector on these. With the shortened spring, the pin doesn't always protrude from the breech face long enough when cycling before engaging the sear to reliably eject the spent round. Rack, bang every few rounds on FTE. Wolffs has spring sets for $10, worked great for my uncle."

This gun has both a pistol and a rifle configuration. Using the DOLOS quick-change system, the rifle can be taken down or barrels can be swapped at a moment's notice. The Law Tactical folding stock system allows the buttstock to collapse against the rifle's left side for a further reduced footprint. In the pistol configuration, the gun fits in the included satchel or any other compartment that is at least 6""x7.5""x11.5"". The canvas satchel has room for 8+ mags in the front pouch and plenty of room for additional items. The rifle configuration offers a collapsible stock while the pistol configuration has an arm brace. Both configurations have free-floating handguards.  The attached muzzle brakes significantly reduce recoil and the chrome lined barrel extends barrel life. The red/green dot sight has perfect clarity and the rifle possesses flip up 45° canted back-up iron sights. The BCG is NiB coated and the upgraded trigger has a very smooth and crisp break. This gun is a pleasure to shoot and is very accurate, I just don't take it out enough anymore.The pistol is ATF compliant and switching between the pistol and rifle configuration is legal.https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/can-i-lawfully-make-pistol-rifle-without-registering-firearmI may be interested in trades.  Just shoot me what you have to offer!"
