It's been professionally cerakoted in Patriot Brown mixed with Crushed Silver. It has a custom trigger job performed by a local gunsmith, and all springs or worn parts have been replaced with Wolff springs or Ruger parts where needed. No hammer push-off and functions flawlessly. Has an excellent trigger pull/break for accurate shots. I have recently put a rubber Hogue Monogrip on it for target shooting, but it will come with the real carbon fiber grips as shown. The cerakote coating shows slight wear on the front of the cylinder from smoke, but to me it adds to the look of the gun. This is the model to have, as it has a transfer bar that allows the hammer to rest on a loaded cylinder. This is also a convertible model that accepts the 9mm cylinder available online. Heavy enough that .357 magnums are very manageable and .38 specials feel like .22lr. Adjustable rear sights, very accurate and fun to shoot. Single action only. All original parts, receipts, and original box are included along with the Hogue and carbon fiber grips. Can include 250 rounds of 148gr 38spl target wadcutter ammo for the right deal. Only offering for trade/sale because I want something more suited to NRA Bullseye competition.

Please clik link below to purchase. https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/spyderco-autonomy-g-10-black-black-blade-spyderedge-c165gbbk/ The Spyderco Autonomy was developed in response to a request from the U.S. Coast Guard for a cutting tool that would meet the demanding mission requirements of their rescue swimmers. They needed a high-performance knife that could be easily deployed with only one hand while wearing heavy gloves, is impervious to salt water, could be easily maintained and, above all, would cut with extreme authority. The result was the orange-handled Autonomy automatic, which is approved for use by Coast Guard personnel. Because many of the features of the Autonomy were so revolutionary, Spyderco also decided to create an all-black version of the knife with a safety and a pocket clip that is ideal for other end users. The heart of this knife is its voracious SpyderEdge™ sheepfoot-style blade, which is ground from H-1® steel—an extraordinary nitrogen-based alloy that is completely immune to corrosion. To optimize its function in tactical environments where light discipline is a requirement, it receives a tough Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) coating to reduce its reflective signature."

The AMD R9 RX-480 is extraordinary compared to other moves up to be discharged ever to game! Highlighting the most recent Polaris GPU with 2304 stream processors and 8GB of 8000MHz GDDR5 memory this little and low power card packs an intense punch. It contends with substantial weights, for example, AMD R9 390X yet expends far less power having only a 110W TDP and a solitary 6-stick control connector.
The RX-480 can even oversee gaming easily at 1440P (2560x1440) which exhibits really how intense this card is, yet it highlights such a low value point and is an awesome overhaul for practically any PC with a 350W or more noteworthy ATX control supply. Should Half Life 3 ever be discharged, the RX-480 will be the ideal gaming card!!!"

Please click link below to purchase.https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/spyderco-autonomy-h-1-steel-spyderedge-g-10-orange-c165gor/The Spyderco Autonomy was developed in response to a request from the U.S. Coast Guard for a cutting tool that would meet the demanding mission requirements of their rescue swimmers. They needed a high-performance knife that could be easily deployed with only one hand while wearing heavy gloves, is impervious to salt water, could be easily maintained and, above all, would cut with extreme authority. The result was the orange-handled Autonomy automatic, which is approved for use by Coast Guard personnel. Because many of the features of the Autonomy were so revolutionary, Spyderco also decided to create an all-black version of the knife with a safety and a pocket clip that is ideal for other end users. The heart of this knife is its voracious SpyderEdge™ sheepfoot-style blade, which is ground from H-1® steel—an extraordinary nitrogen-based alloy that is completely immune to corrosion. To optimize its function in tactical environments where light discipline is a requirement, it receives a tough Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) coating to reduce its reflective signature."

It’s about a month old purchased from field and stream, I’ve put roughly 1000 rounds or so through it so far with absolutely no problems. It’s been cleaned regularly after use and oiled well. It currently has a rail on the underside of handguard, folding vertical grip, and a red dot from truglo all of which I may be keeping depending upon our trade. If I do decide to keep them I do still have the stock magpul flip ups and no modifications were made to put the rail on so can be easily removed. I’ve had a fun time with it but really am looking to trade it for an AR-10, or a Mini-14/30. I’m not interested in cash offers so please don’t email me asking for a price. If yours is significantly more valuable I can consider the option of a 2 for 1 trade including either my Hi Point Carbine or my Mossberg Plinkster. I can also include ammo again depending upon the trade. Shoot me an offer and we can go from there. Thanks."
