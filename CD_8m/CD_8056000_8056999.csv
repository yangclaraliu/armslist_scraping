Improving on the FNP™-45 Tactical, developed for the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 Tactical FDE was born and bred for battle. Like its legendary FN forefathers, this combat handgun was designed to not only survive the battlefield, but to emerge victorious. It is the latest in technological advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a host of unique features that no other handgun can match.
Its 15-round magazine is precisely engineered to take a dive to the prone position and naturally roll up toward the target. The checkered polymer frame has a low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil, enhanced operator control, and a grip angle that provides unmatched natural point of aim. Four interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The 5.3″ cold hammer-forged stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to accept sound suppressors, compensators, and other accessories. The stainless steel slide has high-profile combat night sights and includes two mounting bases to accept multiple styles of optional red-dot electronic sights.The gun comes to you in like new condition with everything from factory including 3 mags, 4 different back straps and the mounting plates for a variety of red dot optics.FTF sale to VT resident with valid state ID or you pay the NH FFL fees, will not ship.MSRP of $1349,  ?<b>its yours for $949.</b>  Only trade I'm interested in is Sig p220 Combat or Sig 227 Tacops."

Raptor Charging Handle  $65.00
Nichol Baron BravoCompany Trigger            (forgot what I paid for it).
The upgrades were $1,341.00 and do not include the brand new base M&P AR15 at $675.00. I am asking $1,200.00 for the brand new rifle that has never been shot. I will never shoot it because I would only use it for home protection and being new to the rifle world I was not educated to rifle and ammo over-penetration. I live in a urban area with houses being close together and being made out of board with no brick. So, I cannot shoot this gun for home defense for fear of my neighbors safety. Have purchased a shotgun and loaded it with buckshot for home defense. Hence, have no need for this customized beauty."

Bought the gun last year on a whim, and while I enjoy the rifle I could use the money for other things. The rifle is surprisingly accurate. Ive shot a few 2MOA groups with it using a red dot sight. Never bothered to zero the irons. I’ve had zero malfunctions to date. I’ve shot mostly Malaysian surplus through the rifle, and one box of Russian steel. The round count is somewhere between 150-300 rounds. When I picked up the rifle, I checked the bolt gap and it was within spec. If a serious buyer wants, I’ll track down my feeler gauge and check it again. Unfortunately, it’s tan. It’s the factory finish, I think I read it’s Ceracoat. If you can’t live with it, it can be remedied with some paint if you desire. It will ship with the 5 round magazine it came with as well as 15 nice German aluminum surplus mags. I’m looking to get $575 for the rifle and mags."
