It has the following markings. M91/30, Izhevsk Arrow in Triangle (post 1928) Barrel shank, 1939R., (Cyrillic ""alpha prefixes"" yy1221 came into use a Tula in 1937. These consist of two letters followed by a number of four didits or less. The prefixes were apparently assigned at randon and changed when number 9,999 was reached. No known records of the order in which they were assigned exist. Because of the randon use of the Cyrillic characters it is impossible to know whether a rifle was built early or late in that year's production. Also, ""low"" serialo numbers have no significance because it is not known whether their block was first, last, or somewhere in the middle or the year. Occasionally a rifle is reported with a single Cyrillic character, but in all cases, it has been found that the second character was a Cyrillic ""Z"" which looks like the number ""3"". Izhevsk began using this system in 1938.) PW Arms of Redmond, WA (They place the entire import mark on the receiver witha new serial number) M91/30 7.62 X 54R, Russia Ser. #RMN044402. I took as many pictures of the marks as I could. It has a round receiver. It has an unstepped tang. It has an extra notch at the stripper clip guide. It has a low wall receiver. It has a machined right rear receiver. It comes with a strap, the original site and a bayonet. For more information on this gun you can go to 7.62x54r.net web site.I can email many more pictures if you need them. Will not ship this gun.

This pistol has a beautiful commercial frame that retains a conservative 85% of its beautiful Early Colt high polish bluing and is one of the nicest I've ever seen in my years of collecting 1911s. The Slide is a US Army Slide that is from the same timeframe as it has the Gothic lettering and rear prancing horse which was used in 1916 on the Army Models. My personal belief is this Firearm was bought as a private sidearm before WW1 then either brought to war by the person who bought it or shipped over by their family and while in service had a US Army slide put on it as the slide and frame match pretty well and seem to have been together for quite sometime.

Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact."

The pistol comes with an extra magazine which is also vintage and a box of German ammunition.  This pistol is dated circa 1950 to 1953.  This version is highly collectible and sought after I am a very reasonable person so if you make me a fair offer I will work with you.
