She’s just sat in the safe (I’ve only shot it once) and I’ve decided to go a different direction with my collection. Almost 100% finish still on her and she comes with 3 mags and original holster. Interesting side note about it is only 200,000 of these were made for the Czechoslovakian military in ‘52 and ‘53. It shoots the quick 7.62x25 Tokarev round and is a roller-lock design, a very uncommon feature in pistols. Since this one was manufactured in 1952, it is C&R eligible. Not super interested in parting with it for cash, but shoot me an offer anyway. I’m really interested in trades. Trades I’d be interested in (can also throw in some cash from my end depending on what you have) Any model of Tokarev (but an original Izzy or Tula would be AMAZING), Nagant Revolver, Mauser HSC, Mauser 1914, CZ75 B or BD (all full size 75 models are welcome), original Mosin Nagant M91- older the better, or any other weird, obscure, old C&R firearm you have. Let me know, I’m open to anything."

Highly precise .308 WIN-chambered M1A models are found in the hands of elite tactical teams, snipers, backcountry hunters and competitive marksmen. Now skilled shooters can get unmatched Springfield M1A performance in 6.5 Creedmoor caliber. With high muzzle velocity, low recoil, and extreme long-range accuracy, the Creedmoor round is becoming increasingly popular and easily accessible. The new M1A 6.5 Creedmoor makes the most of the ammo’s attributes with the rifle design, craftsmanship, balance and response known to Springfield Armory’s storied M1A platform. The M1A’s National Match Grade, 22-inch medium weight stainless steel barrel provides a long sight radius for outstanding iron sight accuracy, with a 4-groove 1:8 right hand twist and shot-steadying muzzle brake to put rounds right where intended. The NM Grade .062 post front sight is paired with a NM Grade non-hooded .0520 aperture rear sight that’s ideal for distant targets and adjustable for ½ MOA windage and 1 MOA elevation. The 2-stage trigger is National Match tuned to 4.5 – 5 pounds, for a crisp, confident pull. The new 6.5 Creedmoor M1A is a “true 1000-yard rifle” that delivers a level of shooting satisfaction few rifles can match, especially when paired with an SA scope mount and your optic of choice.

This sale includes a standard and extended mag, trigger lock, 80 odd rounds of FMJ, a couple dozen random reloads, and the original box and documentation. The standard mag does have a crack in the metal at the top, I suspect from being dropped during reloading drills, and likely needs to be replaced soon. I've set the price to reflect this.

This is one of the most beautiful early high polish CZ 27 pistols we have ever seen. Perfect mechanical condition, and an excellent like new bore. Serial Number: 141,755. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts (straw color is very generous), and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap CZ 27 holster displaying a big Nazi stamp (The Reichsadler of Nazi Germany) inside flap. The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod. 27”. This is a rather common WW2 German-issued pistol in uncommonly nice condition. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. While most CZ 27 variants are quite common, it is difficult to find early pistols like this one in such exceptional condition. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. This pistol displays a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA 76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark (on right frame, top slide, and barrel). The barrel is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague) followed by the Nazi proof and serial number. Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. All the numbered parts are matching (right on frame, top of slide, left on side plate, and on barrel). In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500 (the serial number of our early pistol is 141,755). Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation.To buy or call >>>> CZ CZECH CZ 27 EARLY HIGH POLISH GERMAN ARMY ISSUE"

Armour Wear level IV Body Armor is rated for up to and including just that threat! We are known for offering the most rugged and affordable body armor in the industry; and we've raised the bar again in terms of quality and value with our Level IV body armor solution. With a profile of .75"" thick, our level IV body armor features a thinner profile compared to what's currently being offered on the market at 7.5lb's per plate. Rated for a single 30.06 APM2 (7.62mm x 63mm 165gr Armor Piercing, Black Tip) round, and all lesser Level III threats, Level IV Body Armor provides protection against a higher threat level than our traditional Level III body armor.  Stand-Alone, our Level IV body armor does not require any additional backing or soft inserts to meet the threat level. The curved contour improves comfort and ergonomics, with a similar design to the contour of our Level III body armor. We utilize a durable single panel ceramic strike face to maintain the best ballistic properties for higher level threats, and a composite backing comparable to a traditional armor system that is similar to what is currently, standard issue in the military. Coated with our PAXCON protective coating in conjunction with our strike face, and spall & fragmentation containment technology, our Level IV body armor is industry leading. Fully sealed from the elements, our PAXCON coating creates a water tight seal which protects the inner armor components from liquids, chemicals, UV, sweat, and other harsh elements and is designed to be used as a front or back.  Level IV Body Armor Features:  Level IV rated for threats up to a 30.06 Armor Piercing round 10"" x 12"" SAPI cut profile Stand-Alone Ergonomic curvature for improved comfort Designed to be used as a front or back plate Composite, Ceramic, and PAXCON construction Thin .75"" profile 7.5lb per plate PAXCON coated, liquid, chemical, UV, and sweat resistant Single panel ceramic strike face, composite backing Works well with our 10""x12"" ASC Trauma Pad 5 Year Warranty"

Serial Number: 70,101. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. This pistol displays a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA 76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark (on right frame, top slide, and barrel). The barrel is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague) followed by the Nazi proof and serial number. Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. All the numbered parts are matching (right on frame, top of slide, left on side plate, and on barrel). In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500 (the serial number of our early pistol is 70,101). Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation. The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod. 27”. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts (straw color is very generous), and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. This is a rather common WW2 German-issued pistol in uncommonly nice condition. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. While most CZ 27 variants are quite common, it is difficult to find early pistols like this one in such exceptional condition. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap holster.To buy or call >>>> CZ CZECH CZ 27 EARLY HIGH POLISH GERMAN ARMY ISSUE"

Serial Number: 59,799. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. This pistol displays a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA 76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark (on right frame, top slide, and barrel). The barrel is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague) followed by the Nazi proof and serial number. Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. All the numbered parts are matching (right on frame, top of slide, left on side plate, and on barrel). In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500 (the serial number of our early pistol is 59,799). Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation. The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod 27”. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts (straw color is generous), and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. This is a rather common WW2 German-issued pistol in uncommonly nice condition. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. While most CZ 27 variants are quite common, it is difficult to find early pistols like this one in such exceptional condition. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap holster. The holster is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark.To buy or call >>>> CZ CZECH CZ 27 EARLY HIGH POLISH GERMAN ARMY ISSUE"

This is one of the most beautiful early high polish CZ 27 pistols we have ever seen. Perfect mechanical condition, and an excellent like new bore. Serial Number: NONE. This CZ 27 pistol has no serial numbers! The frames do not display a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA 76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark. The barrel is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark and a “WaA76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark. No marking anywhere else. There has been a lot of speculation about what these pistols were used for. According to some experts, this pistol was sanitized for clandestine use by SS or Gestapo. In any case, this pistol should be of extreme interest to the growing number of Czech pistol collectors. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts (straw color is very generous), and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. The pistol is housed in an original brown leather flap CZ 27 holster. The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod. 27”. This is a rather common WW2 German-issued pistol in uncommonly nice condition. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. While most CZ 27 variants are quite common, it is difficult to find early pistols like this one in such exceptional condition. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague). Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500. Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation.To buy or call >>>> CZ CZECH CZ 27 VERY RARE EARLY HIGH POLISH GERMAN ARMY ISSUE WITHOUT SERIAL NUMBER"

It is a 1983 vintage production, one of the first made and it still had the European magazine release on the bottom of the handgrip. Most PT-92 mags have both cuts so it's not really a big deal. I just prefer the newer type near the trigger and am willing to either sell this weapon or trade it for one of those PT-92s, hopefully a pre-decocker model but not a deal breaker. Alot of people think this is a clone...copy...etc..of the Beretta. These weapons were built on Beretta tooling when their contract for the Brazilian militar contract expired in Brazil but it is an improved version of the 92. The Taurus introduced the square trigger guard and kept the safety on the frame where it belongs. Also, you can carry this weapon cocked and locked like a 1911 and it has a forged guide rod as opposed to the Beretta plastic one. The gun is forged on frame, slide and barrel, signature Taurus features (Forjas Taurus/Taurus Forge). It comes in original box with warranty card and an awesome parts breakdown foldout poster. It is as nice as you will find an early one. It has upgrades including Hogue allen grip screws and Wolf hammer and guide rod springs. I will trade for a little newer PT-92 but don't want any abused or dropped weapons. Thanks for looking."

Someone in the past has removed the original finish and polished it. When I got it, it also had very old after-market sights installed. It also had a trigger shoe installed. I assume one of its owners from back in the day must have accurized it for competition or something?I have gone completely through it and repolished everything, including all internals. Replaced the springs, firing pin and a couple of other items but I have all of the original parts too. Took it out 2 weeks ago and shot approximately 100 or so rounds through it and it is a great shooter with very nice recoil and accurate as well. The mags (2 of them) should probably be replaced as they are not the best. I would stick with ball ammo as I tried a few brands of JHPs, etc. and it did not like them.It has the pearl-like grips that are in nice condition and fit well in my hand. If I keep it, I will probably mount it in a display box and hang it on the wall as it is a beautiful piece of history but will function if the need arises.Asking $800.00Feel free to text me at 281.seven 36-nine 678Please do not ask if it is available. I will take down the ad if I sell or trade it.Thanks for lookingI have lots of HD pictures I am more than happy to text anyone interested."

This model fits the H&K USP and USP Compact pistols. The bulb in the light still works excellently, all functions work and the bulb is nice and bright. I had this light mounted on my USP Compact in my home, but removed it whenever I took my USP Compact out shooting, so this light has no wear and tear from firing. There is a small nick on the sticker. Included is the original case, foam padding, instruction booklet, a spare bulb, and the spare bulb carrier. 
Sorry for the following disclaimer, but I've been getting too many time wasting emails about this light: Before you try to lowball me, realize that I also have access to the HKPro forums, where I have not seen one of these sell in a while. When they do sell they usually go for $150-200. If you want to offer me less than $180, you need to provide evidence that a sale has occurred at that price point or I will ignore your email. If you want to offer me less than $150, I will ignore your email outright. This is a rare light, it is discontinued, you can not find them new. They are very hard to find used."

Great shooter. Very nice/smooth action. I mounted a 6"" pic. rail to the bottom of the front of the stock to use a bipod (not a hack job, very solid). The bipod is not included in the sale as it is my only one, and I use it with other rifles. But, the rail will stay on the rifle. If you don't know much about these rifles, go to the Ruger website and check them out. I personally have no complaints. They are great rifles for the money. I actually want to get another one in a different caliber. Asking price is $350, or trade for another firearm. I'm open to any offers, especially springfields, but no Hi-Points. No offense to those who like them, but I don't. Contact me via email, text, or call. If I don't answer a call, leave a message and I will return the call as soon as I can. Thanks for looking. *I will only make a private sale/trade to someone who has a valid NH P.R.L. and photo I.D. as I have them (I know you don't need a P.R.L. anymore for concealed carry in NH, but I still maintain mine). The only exception to this is going to a F.F.L. to make a legal transfer. This is only fair and covers my backside.*bcoll1082(at)hotmail(dot)comREDACTED"
