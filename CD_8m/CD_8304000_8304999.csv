The handgun has 1000+ plus rounds through it and still functions like the day I bought it. The lower frame has factory FDE paint, and the slide and barrel have the stock black coating. Some of the FDE paint on the lower frame has faded, but is the only visible wear and tear I can find on the handgun. All internal parts are stock, and the grip has custom stippling. Great handgun, functions beautifly and has never given me any serious malfunctions or failures. I am selling it because I have turned to the Glock side and just dont shoot this pistol as much as I used to anymore. I would rather sell it to someone who will use and shoot it instead of it collecting dust in the safe. I am more than happy to answer any questions or send more pictures via email."

The rifle has only fired 19 rounds. It mainly lives in the safe, so it is time to sell it to fund other projects. Additional specs are below for those who are interested.
The rifle comes with an Alexander Arms soft case, 3x 10-round magazines (2x are brand new in the packaging), 80x rounds of 335 gr. FMJ ammunition, 1x Hoppe's BoreSnkae, and 19x once-fired brass cases (wet-tumbled once).
Retail Pricing Breakdown: The rifle (w/ muzzle break) is $1,258.94, the ammo is $26.15 per box, and the magazines are $28.50 each. Total retail value is ~$1450 (plus tax, shipping, and FFL fees).
Asking Price: $1,100 (OBO w/ trade). I am mainly looking for a cash deal, but am open to offers involving cash. May consider a one-for-one trade for an AK or bolt action rifle (interested in .308 or 7mm) of comparable value.
Rifle Specs (from the Alexander Arms website): Flat-top receiver, 16.5"" chrome moly barrel with 1:20 twist and standard Picatinny railed gas block. Direct impingement operating system. Standard-specification lower receiver assembly with our name, logo, and caliber engraved. Ships in an Alexander Arms soft carry bag with one 7-round magazine.

Ammo Specs (from the Alexander Arms website): .50 Beowulf 335g Rainier FMJ flat-point ammunition. Target load. Ballistics Coefficient: 0.210. Nominal muzzle velocity: 1,880 FPS. OAL: 2.110"". Box of 20.

Buyer agrees to abide by all local and federal laws concerning the transfer of this firearm and must present a valid driverâ€™s license or state-issued identification card at the time of purchase. CCW holders are preferred and receive priority. As a private party sale, the transaction is not taxable, and the seller does not offer a warranty or refund for any item sold."

The M&P Shield 2.0 builds on this success with seemingly small changes that add up to dramatically improved performance! With the same proven reliable safety features, reinforced polymer frame, and scalloped slide serrations you've become accustomed the Shield 2.0 is like a familiar friend. With its 18 degree grip angle and natural point of aim, they have added an enhanced more aggressive grip texture. The trigger has been reworked to provide a lighter crisper trigger pull and a tactile, audible reset to enhance firing. Slimmer, lighter and faster is the best way to describe the M2.0 Shield! The reduced profile and lighter weight makes an easy to carry pistol, even easier to carry. It has a 3.1"" barrel and is chambered in the amazing 9x19mm cartridge with a 7 round magazine and an 8 round magazine. Law Enforcement and legally armed citizens rely on Smith & Wesson M&P's every day for personal protection. The compact size and enhanced ergonomics of the M&P Shield M2.0 may make it the perfect firearm for concealed carry! Specifications and Features:Smith & Wesson M&P Shield M2.0 11806 Semi Automatic Pistol 9mm Luger 8 Rounds 3.1"" BarrelStriker Fired 3-Dot Sights Manual Thumb Safety Black Polymer Frame Black Armornite Finish Overall Length 6.1"" Height 4.6"" Width .95"" Weight 18.3 Ounces  Brand: S&W UPC: 022188872194 MFR #: 11806"
