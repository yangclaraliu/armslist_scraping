It's in fantastic shape, and the serial number dates it to 1990 and is one of the rarer ones that's marked Heckler & Koch on the side of the receiver. What's unique about this gun is that you can run it in BOTH semi auto and pump action because of its unique design, and that allows you to run anything from blanks to full power 3' magnum buckshot with no hiccups. It's also in the 'law enforcement/military' configuration, which gives it the pistol grip stock, as well as the full length magazine tube. The tube holds 7 rounds, plus one in the chamber, plus one 'ghost loaded' by thumbing the round under the bolt, giving you a total of 9 rounds on tap. It comes with a standard shotgun stock, a tactical pistol grip stock, as well as a shotgun scabbard. Asking $1100, or I'm open for trades, although cash is preferred.

The light weight synthetic stock provides a durable, all-weather foundation upon which the rest of the rifle is built. A match grade, fluted polymer barrel ensures excellent accuracy. The trigger's smooth action enables the shooter to engage a target accurately, quickly and with ease. The stock utilizes a Shock Wave Absorber that provides up to 74% more recoil absorption than a standard recoil pad. The non-removable noise dampener reduces the noise up to 89.5%. A 3-9x40 scope with adjustable objective is also included with Whisper Fusion Pro. The Gamo Fusion will surely change the way you think about hunting with airguns!Note: Some break barrel action guns may be harder to break then others. It may take added force to break open the barrel for the first couple uses, after several uses, it will become easier. It is recommended to break it open, however not fully cock the gun, 10 times to loosen the barrel and make it easier for future use.Technical Information:Weight: 8 lbsOverall Length: 46.5""Barrel Length: 18""Ammunition: PelletMagazine Capacity: Single ShotCocking Effort: 41 lbsTrigger Pull: 3.74 lbsTrigger Type: Two-stage adjustableSafety: AutomaticMax Muzzle Velocity: 177 Cal: 1400 fpsAction: Break BarrelPower Source: Gas PistonBarrel: RifledScope: 3-9x40mmStock: Ambidextrous"

Original owner, 600 rounds or less on the conversion barrel and the factory .40 barrel hasn't been fired. I am a Glock Advanced Armorer so the conversion has been done with the correct parts and runs flawlessly. You'll get the G23 factory parts with the addition of the conversion barrel, G19 trigger housing w/ejector, 9mm extractor and 9mm recoil assembly. The plastic bag pictured contains the factory extractor and slide stop. Will come with the Overwatch Precision TAC trigger pictured, a Zev skeletonized striker, 2 G19 mags (so 5 total) talon grip, extended slide stop, hyve base plate, hyve back plate, and your choice of the stainless pins pictured or factory black pins. I have over 1k invested in the gun, parts, and ammo and it all is in excellent condition. The price is more than fair. No, 500 won’t get it all. If you have aftermarket sights you'd like installed, bring them and I'll install at no cost when we meet. For an additional $50 (around 125 bucks retail) I can sell you 250 rounds of .40 cal Fiocci 180 gr CMJ rounds and 20 rounds of Underwood Xtreme Penetrator. No bill of sale needed but would like to see a carry permit or GA ID and be legally able to purchase a handgun in GA.I can send more pics upon request, can't post them all on here due to size limits apparently."

Sling, stock pouch and limbsaver included. SCOPE IS NOT INCLUDED. If interested, its a $400 Nikon ProStaff 5 4.5-18x40, non-illuminated, nikoplex reticle. I really like this scope, but if you want it too, the entire gun + scope is $650 firm (appreciate if you don't haggle).The rifle is a Marlin X7Y (Youth) - which has slightly shorter LOP synthetic stock. I added a soft rubber Limbsaver to increase LOP & comfort. The pencil barrel was 22"" and is now shortened to 16"". It is very handy, and reliably accurate due to its stiffer barrel (whip less when hot). Stock fore-end is internally JB welded with steel rod to increase rigidity. Action is bedded, and torqued so tight the hex screws are now bust. I have not dis-assembled this rifle since 4 years ago, and have never looked back. The plastic trigger guard is screwed and JB welded as well. Rear action screw is tightening against steel washer as opposed to the original plastic guard. Trigger - originally came with 'accutrigger' type system. I immediately discarded the trigger safety in the middle, and maxed it out on its lightest pull setting. Never measured, but feels like crispy <1lb. Safety - Like a Remington 700 right thumb safety setup. Pull is safe, push forward to fire.  Honest performance: In good days, 0.75-1 MOA. On really bad days, 2MOA. On average, this is a reliably 1.25"" MOA rifle measured using 3 and 5-rounds (@ capacity) groups from the bench, sandbagged, if you do your part (scope zeroed, not loose, no flinch, etc.). Never shot from a rigid rest, so this is sort of 'practical' measure.   Favorite ammo:I used FGMM 168 & 175 grain, Hornady Match 168 to get 1.25"" MOA average reliably, with unskilled shot like me. Most of the time, I use Federal 155 gr or 180 gr SP or other hunting rounds to get 1.5"" MOA average. Remington premier green box ammo is fine too. If you RELOAD: 178 gr hornady a-max, CCI primer, go for SLOWER (whatever your powder is, use a little less of it), and seat bullet as close to o-give as possible - more consistent powder burn and gentler recoil. this strategy gave me 0.333"" MOA with 5 shots consistently from cold barrel to hot in this stupid rifle. (POI moved slightly after several strings of 5s, but grouping is still very tight.)  Least favorite, factory ammo: Sig Sauer Match ammo (won't fire sometimes). Russian stuff (also won't fire occasionaly). Maybe primer is too hard.Shipping situation: Will not ship anywhere, don't ask.Transaction: Cash + PPT fee @ local FFL only. My favorite is SC Guns in Santa Clara on a slow Sunday. I'm willing to drive out within 20-30 minutes of Downtown San Jose. Beyond that is a bit too far. All sale is final."

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. New for 2016 are Flat Dark Earth (FDE) models, VPs with special colorants added to the frame during the molding process creating the tan/brown color scheme increasing used by military and security units. The frame’s color is indestructible, permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change."

It is a gen 3.I like having it in my collection but am testing the waters. Brand new never fired. Box and paperwork will be included. I added Troy flip up sightsand a angle grip. I am looking for 925.00 for this cash or trade. Yes you can buy them for 800 on gun broker but then ship and ffl fee plus tax. The Troy sights are more than 200 alone plus the grip. So if you are looking for a steal this is not for u. But if you are looking for a never fired ksg with about 260 dollars in upgrades, here you go. I would be interested in sig or cz pistols such as the evo 9mm. Cz shadow. Higher end 1911 with a rail for light preferably threaded. Am open to other trades as well but it has to be fair for all parties. I am reasonable and I expect you to be responsible. For the right deal I can throw in a few boxes of ammo to.thanks.

This specific model went out of production in 2016. I ordered this pistol from the Fin, Feather, and Fur outfitters in Ashland, Ohio back in 2015. Aside from the ambidextrous safety AND slide release that makes the CZ-85 a true left-hand friendly pistol, the Combat submodel features a trigger overtravel screw, lack of a firing pin block safety and magazine brake, and an adjustable rear sight.   This pistol is startlingly accurate, and I've neither done nor paid for any aftermarket work to it. CZ Custom or Cajun could probably improve on the stock trigger, but it's pretty damned good by my estimation as it is.  The pistol will come to you with everything that came with it from the factory, plus one Mec-Gar 19-round extended magazine that is generally the only one I ever use. I also have a set of softer rubber grip panels off of an SP-01 that have more palm swell and fit my hands better than the hard plastic grips. Buyer will get both sets.I love this gun, but I picked up a P226 Legion last fall and it has become my go-to Wonder Nine.  I wouldn't call the 85c a unicorn, but they're not very common. I'm a very frequent shooter and again, I love this gun. It probably gets 1K rounds a year through it. The slide and frame black polycoat shows no wear or damage, and my pistols are always stored clean and well-lubricated.  The 85 Combat has a black coated barrel as opposed to other CZ pistols that sport a white stainless barrel, as such it does show some wear from the slide. I'm firm on my price. I travel to the Mansfield/Ashland area occasionally, I can bring the gun with me if you are in that area or between there and Columbus.

The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period."

It is used but in good condition, besides what one idiot had done. I'd bought it from a coworker a few years ago, he had always carried the revolver in his pickup. Well, his pickup was broken into and it was stolen, and eventually returned by the police surprisingly enough. Well, the morons tried to sand paper the serial numberr off, if anything making it brighter and more noticeable then ever, it really did not do anymore then remove the bluing. As seen in photos it did remove the finish and scratched it uppretty bad. II've shot itt a hand full of times, but just got my wife a lighter airweight to carry everyday.It is a little dusty, but in good working order.
