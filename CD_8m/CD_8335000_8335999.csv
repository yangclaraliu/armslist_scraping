Wish I could post more pics, when I clean a revolver I take my time and get as much off the cylinder as I can, so this appears as nearly new.  These list for quite a bit more on other sites than I'm asking, they weren't made in abundance and an original 686 without dash and numbers is always a fantastic find.

This is one of the most beautiful early high polish CZ 27 pistols we have ever seen. Perfect mechanical condition, and an excellent like new bore. Serial Number: 110,307. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts (straw color is very generous), and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap CZ 27 holster displaying a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark (on the back). The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod. 27”. This is a rather common WW2 German-issued pistol in uncommonly nice condition. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. While most CZ 27 variants are quite common, it is difficult to find early pistols like this one in such exceptional condition. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. This pistol displays a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA 76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark (on right frame, top slide, and barrel). The barrel is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague) followed by the Nazi proof and serial number. Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. All the numbered parts are matching (right on frame, top of slide, left on side plate, and on barrel). In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500 (the serial number of our early pistol is 110,307). Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation.To buy or call >>>> CZ CZECH CZ 27 EARLY HIGH POLISH GERMAN ARMY ISSUE"

Perfect mechanical condition. Serial Number: 210,250 (top slide only). This pistol displays a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA 76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark (on right frame, top slide, and barrel). The barrel is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark (no serial number). The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague) followed by the Nazi proof and serial number (210,250). Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts, and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap CZ 27 holster. The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod. 27”. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague). Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500 (the serial number of our early pistol is 210,250). Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation.To buy or call >>>> CZ CZECH CZ 27 EARLY HIGH POLISH GERMAN ARMY ISSUE"

609,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8335609,For Sale:  US MILITARY ISSUE 14 FOOT FOLDING TACTICAL ASSAULT LADDER,"Far Eastside, El Paso, Texas",$ 200,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 9, 2018",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The ladder is constructed with Military Grade  Aluminum with a Maximum Load of 250 Lbs.  It's flat black in color and it comes with the carrying handle and carrying pack. It is used and is in used condition but everything still works great. When I say used I do mean used on the battle field. This ladder was used in Iraq on the frontline during clearing operations in the cities of Baghdad as well as in the Diyala Province. These ladders are intended to offer ground troops the option of having a 14 foot ladder on hand that could be quickly assembled and effectively used whether to clear or raid a structure from the roof down, place a soldier in a higher position to provide over watch, search a high area out of reach, ect. These ladders are rugged and ready. They have to be. So when you purchase this ladder not only are you getting the ladder with pack but you are also getting a piece of history from the Iraq War from 2007. The ladder is small and can be easily tucked away until next time it needs to be used. If you look these up on ebay you will find that they are being sold between $300 and $600 so you won't find a better deal than this. The NSN and Model number are as follows below. Thanks much and God Bless!  NSN 4240-01-515-6935 MODEL # PSBE114"

The bore is bright and shiny. The pistol shows some holster wear. Serial Number: 91,845. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. This pistol displays a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA 76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark (on right frame, top slide, and barrel). The barrel is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague) followed by the Nazi proof and serial number. Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. All the numbered parts are matching (right on frame, top of slide, left on side plate, and on barrel). In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500 (the serial number of our early pistol is 91,845). Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation. The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod. 27”. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts (straw color is generous), and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) good-quality grips with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap holster.To buy or call >>>>> CZ CZECH CZ 27 EARLY HIGH POLISH GERMAN ARMY ISSUE"

The finish is nice, but shows some browning coming through the high polish. Serial Number: 61,321. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. This pistol displays a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA 76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark (on right frame, top slide, and barrel). The barrel is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague) followed by the Nazi proof and serial number. Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. All the numbered parts are matching (right on frame, top of slide, left on side plate, and on barrel). In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500 (the serial number of our early pistol is 61,321). Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation. The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod. 27”. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts (straw color is generous), and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) good grips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. What makes this pistol so attractive is that the slide has turned a very nice reddish plum color that makes this pistol very attractive and appealing to the eye. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap holster.To buy or call >>>> CZ CZECH CZ 27 EARLY HIGH POLISH GERMAN ARMY ISSUE"

Serial Number: 42,474. Gun is all matching including one of the two matching mags! This is the only CZ 27 we have ever seen with a matching mag. Comes with an original leather holster. Although the Česká Zbrojovka Factory was under the control of the German Military, a part of the CZ 27 production was allotted to the German Police. These police “Eagle K” pistols (produced 1941-1943) were considered a commercial contract, and therefore, will exhibit the Czechoslovak commercial proof marks, not the WaffenAmt acceptance mark on the right side of the frame. While the featured pistol is part of a commercial contract, its barrel displays a German Military “WaA76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark, identifying the Česká Zbrojovka Factory. This pistol does exhibit the German Police acceptance mark of an eagle with the letter “K” on the left side forward web of the trigger guard. “Eagle K” mark indicates use by one of the Law Enforcement branches. The right side forward web of the trigger guard exhibits the Czechoslovak commercial proof mark of a lion over the letter “N” with a two digit date “42” (1942) underneath. The first German Police pistols show up in the 30,000 serial number range produced in late 1941. These pistols are scarce and rarely encountered. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague) followed by the serial number. Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500 (the serial number of our early pistol is 42,474). Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation. The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod 27”, and on the left side “42474” and “1”. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts, and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top.To buy or call >>>> CZ CZ 27 1942 POLICE EAGLE K VERY RARE 1 MATCHING MAG FULL RIG"

The bore is bright and shiny. The pistol shows some holster wear. Serial Number: 134,060. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts, and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap CZ 27 holster. The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod. 27”. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. This pistol displays a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA 76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark (on right frame, top slide, and barrel). The barrel is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague) followed by the Nazi proof and serial number. Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. All the numbered parts are matching (right on frame, top of slide, left on side plate, and on barrel). In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort.
