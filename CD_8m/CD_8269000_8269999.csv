I've had this pot since I was a kid and it's time to find it a new home. The pot is original finish as far as I can tell with very coarse cork texturing and solid paint. It's a rear seamed model made with what looks like holdover stainless rim material. No stress cracks that I can find, not even any started so it's solid. Swivel bale with replacement, new production, US made chin strap. Marked under the brim with what looks to be 1250C. Research indicates that anything under 1300 makes it WWII production. Liner is also WWII and appears to be either a Seaman Paper Co. or International Molded Plastics. It's so small I can't really tell. All webbing is original except the leather sweatband which is a US made, correct reproduction. I added a post war, USGI leather chinstrap to round out the ""restoration"". Please contact me with specific questions or for me to email additional photos. I'm asking $225 firm (which is a good price if you look around). I'll ship to you at your expense.  I'll accept USPS money order or personal check."

With improvements such as our roller cam pin and patented heat sink barrel nut, these upgrades go well above mere aesthetics often found in rifles today. Put simply, the Renegade + addresses all of the weak points of the direct impingement system. The Dictator 9-position adjustable gas block gives you ultimate control of your rifle, whether tuning for ammo load or suppressor use. The straight gas tube eliminates heat build up from the weak points of standard gas tubes. And the roller cam pin ensures a smooth and more reliable relationship with the upper receiver. The Renegade+ is built off of our Gen 4 billet lower receiver and Ultimate Bolt Carrier Group. This receiver is completely ambidextrous and includes our flat 3.5 lb match grade trigger with KNS Precision anti-walk pins. Competition ready right out of the box. The magic in the upper receiver is held within our Ultimate Bolt Carrier Group which is high phosphate nickel coated for maximum protection & reliability and features an integrated gas key (no screws required). Like the Renegade, the Renegade + comes with our M-LOK compatible Renegade rail, covering the 16.5” nitride heat treated barrel. IF THERE EVER WAS A DIRECT IMPINGEMENT RIFLE THAT EXCEEDS ALL EXPECTATIONS, THE RENEGADE + IS IT."

This isn’t a stripped down rifle that’s saving weight by making extra cuts or lacking the battle rifle features you’re accustomed to. We’ve worked Patriot magic into the Revolution by using a 5.56 bolt carrier and other 5.56 parts allowing for a shorter overall receiver size and reduced weight. This also isn’t a normal small frame .308, it’s smaller! The Revolution features many 5.56 parts; such as charging handle, bolt carrier, cam pin, buffer, heat sink barrel nut, handguard, and 5-position gas piston operating system. The barrel extension, bolt assembly, upper, and lower receiver are the exact same size as those on an AR15. Weighing in at 7.3 lbs.the Revolution features our new Edge Handguard with four built-in QD mounts, and is packed with all you’ve come to expect from POF-USA. Fully ambidextrous billet receiver set, high phosphate nickel coated bolt carrier group, 5-position adjustable gas piston, single stage match grade trigger, and more. With our redesigned triple port muzzle brake recoil management is not an issue.

I only use the rifle for deer hunting so doesn’t get shot all that much and always holds zero. Comes with a nice rifle case and about 30 rounds. May trade for a semi auto shotgun but cash is what I really want. Selling for $500 OBO. Text me at REDACTED for more pictures or info. Thanks!
