It will come with lifetime warranty and lifetime battery replacement. Also this is the model that came on the Lispey’s style Glock 43 so it comes with a custom DeSantis Holster with Glock Logo on it.Only way to get that is to buy there specific edition 43. All warranty info and tools needed for installation and lens cleaning will be included. This run at cheapest with no holster for 143 no holster and around 179 mark with generic in pocket holster. I also have a new Sticky Brand holster that made for 43 with laser. I have decided to order a millled slide for it and laser would be a lot of extra stuff on a CCW gun so I’ll pass on some savings to a member. 80.00 bucks with DeSantis Holster and Sticky Brand holster will be another 10 bucks so 95.00 or best offer. I also own the Anklebiter for the Sticky Holster which is a add on option for using the sticky holster as a ankle holster. If you would like that would be priced at 115.00 dollar for everything heck I’ll had some range ammunition new in box also for getting adjusted and practicing with laser. Text 757-604-1388 for quickest reply. I figured Trade Value be a little higher and we can figure that out.
