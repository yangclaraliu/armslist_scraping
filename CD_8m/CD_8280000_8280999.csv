In recent years, the SP-01 Shadow has taken the competition circuit by storm. In USPSA Production Division, CZ pistols are now used by twice as many top-level competitors than any other maker. Given that popularity, it was high time to up the ante. Starting from scratch, CZUB engineers took the best features of the original Shadow and improved upon them. More than two years later, we’re seeing the fruits of their efforts. With a higher beavertail and undercut trigger guard, the shooter’s hand is able to be as close to the bore axis as possible. With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. Increased weight at the dust cover/rail also helps keep the muzzle down. The Shadow 2’s swappable mag release has an adjustable, extended button with three settings to allow shooters to set it in the spot most comfortable for them. Best of all, new trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset. A hardy nitride finish coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion. Thin blue aluminum grips have healthy checkering to match the fine front and backstrap checkering of the pistol itself. Sitting atop the slide are a set of target sights — fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage).LOG:52307"

As it made its way into commercially produced firearms the name .45-70 appeared, because it was loaded with a 70 grain blackpowder charge with 405 and 500 grain bullets. Virtually all rifle making companies of the late 19th century chambered their single shots and lever actions for the .45-70. As those companies and their rifles faded away, the .45-70's popularity did not. Factory .45-70 ammunition has been cataloged continuously since 1873 but never in the variety of loadings available now, in the 21st century. They range from 405 grain lead bullet, low-velocity loads for deer hunting and target shooting to high-velocity 300 to 400 grain jacketed bullet ones meant for large game. The Model H010 .45-70 can handle them all. Its receiver is blued steel fitted with an 18.43"" round barrel underneath and a tubular magazine of four-round capacity. Its pistol-grip buttstock and steel-capped forend are crafted of beautiful American walnut and cut with checkering to provide a sure grip. The buttstock wears a soft rubber pad to help shooters handle .45-70 recoil from a 7.08 lb. rifle. The model H010 will be factory issued with fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear, and brass beaded front sight. Because the receiver is drilled and tapped, scope mounting is an easy option."

The stock features an adjustable comb that can be raised and lowered in relation to scope height, and 3 removable butt stock spacers allow the length of pull to be adjusted from 13"" to 14"". The short, medium-contoured, barrel features a threaded muzzle fitted with a 4-port muzzle brake. The Savage 11 Scout offers versatile sight options with a fully adjustable peep sight in the rear with a fixed blade sight in the front; and a Picatinny rail attached in front of the action for mounting long-eye-relief optics for rapid sight acquisition with both eyes open. The Model 11 Scout Bolt-Action Rifle features Savage's AccuTrigger® that is fully adjustable to provide a light, clean, crisp break; while a lever mounted within the trigger body blocks the sear unless the trigger is intentionally pressed in the center, virtually minimizing the risk of accidental discharge. A 10-round detachable magazine facilitates loading and unloading the rifle, and the 3-position safety allows the chamber to be loaded and unloaded with the safety engaged. The entire rifle features non-reflective matte finishes that blend into most tactical environments."

In USPSA Production Division, CZ pistols are now used by twice as many top-level competitors than any other maker. Given that popularity, it was high time to up the ante.
Starting from scratch, CZUB engineers took the best features of the original Shadow and improved upon them. More than two years later, we’re seeing the fruits of their efforts. With a higher beavertail and undercut trigger guard, the shooter’s hand is able to be as close to the bore axis as possible. With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. Increased weight at the dust cover/rail also helps keep the muzzle down.
The Shadow 2’s swappable mag release has an adjustable, extended button with three settings to allow shooters to set it in the spot most comfortable for them. Best of all, new trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset.
A hardy nitride coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion, while the frame gets an additional layer of our black Polycoat finish. Thin blue aluminum grips have healthy checkering to match the fine front and backstrap checkering of the pistol itself. Sitting atop the slide are a set of target sights — fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage)."

I have owned this gun since it was new. The round count is around 250 at most. I shipped the barrel to Nefarious Arms, Marvin Pitts and had it shortened with an AAC muzzle brake pinned/welded to meet all ATF requirements. This gun is in excellent shape and very hard to come by since they stopped importing them. I will be very picky on trades.Mainly looking for LWRC IC-Enhanced or A5 with the 14.7"" barrel, not picky on color. Would consider other LWRC rifles as well including a REPR which I can add another gun or something for. The only other trades I will consider are a SCAR in FDE, a Daniel Defense with the 14.5"" barrel pinned/welded brake (cash or other gun on top), and possibly would take multiple nicer AK47's like Arsenal, Maadi, Saiga, Vepr.Cash price is $2500 very firm.If the ad is still up, it is still available."

An added benefit of the Secure Action system is that it's easier to rack the slide, compared to a similar size striker-fired pistol. The pistol's frame is constructed with glass-filled nylon with a precision machined, hard coated, aluminum chassis that contacts the slide with full-length guide rails. The slide is made of through-hardened alloy steel and blued; front and rear serrations provide a non-slip hold while loading or clearing the weapon. Front and rear sights are dovetailed to the slide, and drift adjustable. Sharp edges have been beveled to aid in concealment, drawing the pistol and holstering. The Security-9 Semi-Auto Pistol comes equipped with a trigger safety and a manual thumb safety. The slide stop serves as the takedown pin to easily fieldstrip the pistol for cleaning. Ships with 2 magazines.
