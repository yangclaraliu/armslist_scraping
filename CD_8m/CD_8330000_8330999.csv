Has a SGM tri rail, Dragunov style stock, 1 brand new CSSPEC 20 rnd steel mag, one brand new SGM 25 round mag and a factory 10 and 5. This is the best put together AK you can buy. Fit and finish is superior. Price is firm at 1300.00, and you wont find this model anywhere. Not interested in trades!"

Just a heads up to other sellers... the above email address contacted me wanting to buy a DPMS rifle I have listed here. Never mentioned the item name, wanted to pay with a cashiers check, wanted the listing removed, strange wording, etc... 

""Thanks for contacting me. I must confess that I am so interested in purchasing this. I am sorry for replying a little late. I am away for a family emergency. I love the picture and really want to buy. Is that the final price? I understand if you are not willing to go down. 

  However, because I am away and really not sure of when i will be in town, I want it shipped to me. I will get a FFL so that transmission can be through FFL and you know I am not possessing this illegally. Lets discuss on the payment. I am ready to have a check sent to you. A cashiers check will be sent to you. When the funds is in your account, we can then proceed on the shipment. 

Let me have your   FULL NAME,ADDRESS and phone number.  these details are needed for the check.

Feel free to text me on    REDACTED if need be

Please understand that I am making this arrangement because I want to purchase this before any other person and I am also willing to pay the shipping fees.

If everything looks good, Please send me the details and then kindly delete the post on the site for it is now mine...lol

Get back to me as soon as you can.""

The kicker was what he emailed me this evening.... ""Ogbeni park well""

It has the factory lamintaed ""Wundhammer swell"" type target stock. Unfortunately this stock is made only for right handed people and, and since I'm a lefty, it's obvious I did not know this when I ordered this rifle over the internet. However, when the rifle got here and I went to pick it up I liked the looks of it so much I thought I would give it a try. It shoots great, I put about 40 or so rounds through it and it shot sub MOA groups at 100 yards. Unfortunately, I just can't get used to a rifle that does not fit me. If you are right handed, this will be a great varmint or target gun for anyone who loves to shoot small groups. The key selling point about this rifle, besides the excellent accuracy, is that it accepts AR type magazines which makes an extended shooting session or setting up on a groundhog colony a breeze. Just stick in a 30 round mag of your favorite prarie dog dynamite and go to town. If there is anything I haven't covered, or a question you would like to ask me, just shoot me a line and I'll be happy to answer any question. Like I say, the rifle is everything but new, you won't be disappointed. I will accept cash in person or I will accept a United States Postal Money Order as payment. I will mail the rifle to you if you live across the state, just so long as the address is within the State of Alabama and you are an Alabama resident. This has to be proven before I send the rifle. That's legal. However, if you live in another state, I will have to send it to an FFL dealer, and you can pick it up from him.  If you have any questions, just ask. Thanks, Greg"
