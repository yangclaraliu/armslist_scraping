Time to “thin the herd” as they say.
 
I have a number of guns I will be listing over the next couple weeks that have either been to the range one time and are still like brand new , or have never been shot at all.
 
Each have their original box and all the paper work that they originally came with.EACH WILL BE LISTED INDIVIDUALLY AS WELL BUT THOUGHT I WOULD POST A GROUP LISTING FIRST
 
 
HK VP9 9mm LE version - has 3 mags, night sights  - no more than 100 rounds fired through  $625
 
HK VP9sk 9mm - compact version of the HK VP9 - has never been fired $550
 
Dan Wesson Pointman Carry - 
commander sized compact 9mm - fit and finish on these are second to none - compare with any Ed Brown, Les Baer or Wilson Combat! These are FINE pistols and super hard to find - never been shot or carried  $1400
 
Dan Wesson Specialist 9mm- 
commander sized slide with full sized frame …has had less than 100 rounds fired through. $1450
 
Colt Combat Elite .45 - full sized with several upgrades - has had a extended slide release,  trigger job and a Wilson Combat compensator custom fit, all done by Wilson Combat….comes with Pachmayer wrap around grips and of course the original wood grips….less than 200 rounds fired through.  $1200
 
Sig Sauer Stainless Traditional 1911 .45 …commander sized with night sights, Wilson Combat Magwell installed …..new - never been fired.  $1100
 
Glock 34 MOS Gen 4 9mm with numerous extras!   $1200 w/o trijicon
Zev trigger package
Zev stainless match grade threaded barrel
Zev stainless guide rod
Zev beveled mag well
Zev stainless pin set
Zev slide release
I have all the original parts as well and can sell the gun stock or with the upgrades. 
it also has a brand new Trijicon Red Dot that can also be sold with or without. 
this gun has been to the range one time since all the work was done and had less than 200 rounds fired through….its a UNREAL shooting gun! and the upgrades take it to a whole new level….this is NOT a carry gun, its a dead accurate range gun and would make a great competition gun!
I have each and every upgrade parts packing…..all the work was done by ZEV….if you don’t know their work, do a goggle search and look them up.
 
 
 
the only trades I will consider are older, pristine safe queens - like Browning , Colt , Smith & Wesson and again , only if they are 95-100% condition
