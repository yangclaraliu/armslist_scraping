Comes with the usual factory items and then some, six mags (1-18rd CZ, 5-17rd Mec-Gar). Also comes with the following, an extra custom CZ aluminum grips (pictured), 1-Kydex IWB holster, 1-Kydex OWB holster (not pictured), extra brand new set of CZ cocobolo grips (pictured). All the factory parts are also included (pictured). This CZ 75 has at least $400 worth of custom work done to it. It has the defensive carry package parts from Cajun Gun Works. The custom work done includes modifying and refinishing the left external safety, a trigger job (trigger pull is so smooth), has a floating trigger pin, a 12 Lb recoil spring, it has an extended magazine release button, and an extended slide stop. It also has the TruGlo PRO TFX fiber optics/night sights, and a CGW 10X barrel bushing. I like this gun a lot and it is set up for competition. But I don’t compete and it’s too nice for me to shoot. Traded this gun and thinking keeping it for a little while. But it was more like an impulse trade...lol. I’m more of a collector than a shooter, and I need some funds for another project. So off it goes. Overall, the gun is in mint condition. Must have a CCDWL to buy/trade this gun. I do have a CCDWL if you need to check. Face to face deals only. No shipping. Meet within the surrounding counties only. Package sell or trade only. Will not separate the extras from the gun. $975 for all (cash). Cash price is FIRM. Trade value is $1,100 . No low ball. I have over $1,300 invested on this gun and the extras. Low ball offers will not get a reply or will be ignored. No calls or texting (I’m not giving out my number to a total stranger). I need to know you first. There are too many scammers out there. I’ve been burned before. Corresponds via emails first, and then will exchange phone numbers when time to set up a meeting.

Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Starting in 2016, Scorpion Pistols feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability. The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck."

Please click link below to purchase.https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/crkt-hvas-folder-3-34-in-plainedge-blade-grn-handle-2817/ Description For a minimalist with an appetite for big adventure. Jesper Voxnaes’ Scandinavian backyard is filled with fjords, punctuated by mountains, and sliced by surging rivers. So when he sets out to design an outdoor knife, it’s crafted to perform. Everywhere. And with Field Strip technology, the HVAS™ is taking preparedness to the next level. Your move, Mother Nature. Jesper Voxnaes calls Loegstrup, Denmark home. And his hobbies include hunting, fishing, sailing, camping, hiking…you get the picture. So when he reaches for a knife in the backcountry, miles from anywhere, he expects it to perform. In fact, he designs it to do just that. The name HVAS™ (pronounced simply vas) harkens to the knife’s Old Norse roots, translating to “sharp” in the ancient language, and it’s a flawless addition to an outdoorsman’s wilderness gear with a classic drop point blade in a clean satin finish. The glass-reinforced nylon injection-molded handles are a formidable opponent for unexpected conditions. But if it does start to slow down, it’s been given Field Strip technology for quick cleaning and simple maintenance without tools. From the highest peaks to the rowdiest river canyons, the HVAS™ is raring to go. How Field Strip Works Field Strip Technology lets you easily disassemble your knife for cleaning without tools. To disassemble, close the knife, push the front release lever up. Then spin the rear release wheel clockwise —once you feel the handle release, pull it up and away. Handles and blade come apart easily. To bring the knife back together, place the blade and handles into the closed position – press and hold the pivot. Once the pivot is seated correctly, rotate the release wheel counter-clockwise until snug. Push front lever down. The knife is restored to full working order.

I had my brother who is a armmorer go through it. Yoke, plunger, plunger spring, firing pins, triggers assembly & safety assembly all look good. Blueing is in really good condition no rust or pitting. Just wanted it gone through good before I list it. Stock is in good condition. One small crack in the forearm which he did a really good repair & assured me it wouldn't be a problem. I tried to illustrate in the picture. I prefer not to travel. I will not conduct transaction in a public business parking lot. That is a good way to draw unpleasant attention. I live in a safe neighborhood & can meet in my driveway, front yard. Locks up tight & nothing loose. Gun appears to have been well maintained & shot little. Bores are bright no scratches see pictures. If I can't recoup my money it won't hurt my feelings to keep it. Must be Ohio resident W/valid ID. Please be 21+. If you are under firearm disability please do not contact me. I can also throw in a nice carrying case & a couple boxes of 7.5 shot IF you pick it up at my place. I may consider trading. Let me know what you have. Worse I can do is say no thank you.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Has a Timberwolf Frame, permanent Beavertail with 2 Backstraps, 1 Backstrap making it like a normal Glock Grip, and 1 with a 1911 Grip, I preferred the 1911 Style. (I did dremel some of the stock stippling Lonewolf puts on it, and did some of my own stippling with a Saudering Iron, I don’t think it looks too bad). All of the Internals are Lonewolf including the Trigger, trigger is very nice. It comes with TruGlo TFO Green on Green Sights, and a  Surefire XC-1 Compact Weapon Light. The Lonewolf 19 did not come with Magazines, so I have 4-5 that I bought for it afterwards.Additionally it comes with a Tuctite OD Green Appendix Rig build specifically for the Glock 19 w/ Surefire XC-1. Also comes with another Holster without the Mag Caddy Attached, for the same set up. Also have a Holster for Hook and Loop for that exact set up I used for a Vertx Commuter Bag.I am open to offers, I paid over $800 for just the fun without the TFO Sights and XC-1, not including any of the Holsters as well, or the Magazines. So keep that in mind. Only looking for Trade wise, maybe a Sig P365 Plus Cash, or maybe a Glock 19 MOS Plus Cash. But feel free to offer any cash or trade offers I maybe can’t pass up.Phone Number is 513-814-6829. (P.S. I will be checking ID). This is for my own protection, In case of a use of the weapon once it’s out of my possession, to prove I don’t own it anymore."
