I am asking $1300 cash, no trades, again, NO TRADES. This is a fantastic scope. The only reason I am selling it is because I got a smokin deal on the XRS version of this same scope so I am trying to sell this one. I literally had it mounted for about a month and only shot it twice while mounted on a 6.5 creedmoor. The zero stop is a breeze to work with, the clicks are tactile and accurate, the reticle is freaking awesome! You will love this scope. The glass has slightly more chromatic aberations than a vortex razor HD gen II, but at half the price, you kind of expect that. And bushnells warranty is now as good as Vortex's so you can't really go wrong.My last post got flagged as spam for some reason, this is legit, I live off of prospect road in fort collins, so please don't flag as spam. I prefer to be contact via email - Please put in the subject line ""Bushnell Scope on Armslist"" otherwise I may miss the email as they usually go to my spam folder. Here is some information from BushnellAt less than 13” in length the DMR II/HDMR II offers more performance than any scope in its class. This scope provides long-range precision without sacrificing short-range capability.The ThrowHammer™ Lever makes magnification changes a snap with the flick of a finger. The elevation turret provides 10 mils of adjustment per revolution and is also equipped with the easy-to-set RevLimiter™ zero stop for a positive return to zero.The features on the new HDMR scopes add up to more time looking through your scope and less time adjusting it.

It is extremely accurate with round balls and 275 grain T/C Maxi-Hunter bullets. I can bust clay pigeons all day long at 100 yards with the Maxi-Hunters. The pitting you see in the picture is not as bad as the flash of the camera makes it out to be. The previous owner didn't clean it properly and it has some pitting around the nipple. I have taken care of it and it hasn't gotten any worse in the 18 or so years I have owned it. It has been hunted with so there are signs of use. I have pictured them as best I can. I can meet in Portland/Vancouver area during week days and weekends if needed. I am located in Salem, Oregon. $350 or open to trades for a quality youth rifle.

I'm only selling because I want to downsize to a 22. http://filmlocationhouse.com/gun/gun.htmlIncludes everything that came with the gun when I bought it including plastic carrying case, lock and 2 keys, instruction manual, and various other paperwork.I am also throwing in a gun barrel cleaner, speed loader and 50 rounds of 38 ammo. This gun can of course fire 38 or 357 ammo.Buyer also pays for all fees including DROS + dealer fee if any (most dealers charge $35 in total) if purchasing in person at an FFL near me. Buyer also pays shipping cost (if applicable). Meet in person to avoid shipping cost.  If this gun will be shipped then I plan on using Turner’s Outdoorsman (Torrance, CA) who have recently quoted me a total of $75 including DROS and shipping. California requires a 10 day waiting period as the dealer keeps the gun until the transfer is approved. Payment forms accepted if purchasing in person at FFL dealer: Cash only! Payment forms accepted if shipping: Bank cashier’s check or certified check. Please note that your check MUST CLEAR BEFORE I ship. If your check is from a major bank that has a branch near me then I can cash in person at that branch (and thus if cashed and cleared I would then proceed with the FFL transfer process immediately). I ship within the USA only. If this gun is being shipped, then you have a 3-day inspection period, assuming you are able to return it to me without legal or shipping restrictions. I believe that this gun cannot be shipped back to California because it is not on California’s list of approved firearms. I believe that this gun can be shipped within California. If for any reason you are unable to ship the gun back to me (such as due to changes in the law or incorrect understanding of the law(s), due to shipping regulations which prevent return of the gun, etc) then my 3-day inspection period becomes null and void and the sale is final. Also if you are able to return it, you will only be refunded for the sale price of the gun itself, with no refund for DROS fee and shipping (if applicable). Additionally you would be responsible for paying sales tax (if any) which may be imposed by the FFL on having the gun shipped back to California. My Internet research indicates that there should be NO tax imposed by the FFL if shipped back. Please do your own research to be sure. Since I am not a retail seller, I am NOT collecting any sales tax for this sale.If purchasing in person, once you have purchased, the sale is final and there is no “inspection period”. Transaction must take place at an FFL dealer on the West side (near Pacific Palisades). I recommend Turner’s in Torrance, in the San Fernando Valley or in Pasadena.

And I live in Lenoir, NC. I really don’t care where you live or how far away it is. If you are too far, then buy someone else’s Fox.
