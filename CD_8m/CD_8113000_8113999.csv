I've managed to shoot around an MOA at 100 yards(I think it was Hornady 750 grain AMAX) with it but  I haven't really shot it much. This is a great starter .50 BMG, its well made and Safety Harbor backs their products. Took it hog hunting once, that was a lot of fun. This has been zeroed for me at 100 yards with M33 ball as it sits. And yes, the muzzle brake works, it is not at all unpleasant to shoot, probably could stand to have a limbsaver pad stuck on the A2 stock for extended range sessions though.This listing is for the rifle as it sits, complete with the Armalite complete lower reciever and the SWFA 10x fixed power Mil-dot reticle(1/4 moa turret) scope(which is actually rated to handle .50 BMG) with its sunshade, pretty clear glass.

The Redhawk is offered in several configurations; mine is the Hunter model, with a 7.5-inch barrel, ready to accept a scope, should you want to meddle with the beauty of the beast."" Ruger Redhawk HUNTER .44 magnum with extra set of grips. This double action revolver is from the late 80's and in great condition. Came from the factory ready for scope to be mounted. Used very little. I installed a set of Hogue grips for it, but still have the original Pachmayr grips. I have a few boxes of high-quality ammo (Buffalo Bore) to go with it. I bought this from Gander Mountain several of years ago to take out west for backpacking in bear country (did not come with original box/papers). Very stout revolver, one of the strongest .44's money can buy, and combined with the Buffalo Bore hard cast ammo, it has very capable protection capabilities against anything on this continent, close to the .454 energy levels. The 7.5"" barrel makes this revolver extremely accurate. Any questions feel free to shoot me an email. Pick-up only. $700, a steal for this gun; MSRP is $1,079 right now. Plus it comes with about $100 in ammo and $25 Hogue grips."

I paid $450 for the unit itself off a Jeep forum. It has Bluetooth that works great and also a USB plug in the front to attach and charge a phone/iPod or play music files off a flash drive.I’ll leave it installed so you can verify it works as it should.

You tell them you're in Jax, they say they're in Key West but can ship, you tell them you're actually on your way to the keys today, they say they're on a boat to Cuba but their wife can ship to your FFL. You say you're in Miami and they say they're in Jax or Clearwater. Any BS story to avoid Face to Face deals.These scammers need to be FLAGGED and IP/email info turned over to LEO's, hackers, mobsters, goombahs, nerds, triads, snake people, good ol boys, or anyone willing to deal out some ""mercenary sensibility and lead pipe cruelty"" on these low life scum bags.   Have a nice day... Seriously, as a community of Firearms traders and collectors, protect each other. Any and EVERY time you see a listing without a City, or a too good to be true price... FLAG the F-ers as SCAM. Let's make operating scams on armslist near impossible by keeping the less street smart buyers from getting screwed, and make these types of listings get flagged so fast that it's no longer worth their time and these jerkoffs go back to their Spamming Campaigns from a Nigerian Prince, or selling knockoff Sham-Wow's.The community has spoken, get the hell off our site, dirtbags.I hope we catch you in a parking lot, for a ""spirited discussion"" & the next time I run into you, I hope I'm driving. ArmsList'ers....

Though this sounds like an involved process, it's about 30 seconds worth of work on my end. I will work with you on price WITHIN REASON.  This is a 45/70 Henry.  Don't throw me prices as if it was a .22lr Ruger. It's annoying.IF YOU ARE INELIGIBLE TO BUY A FIREARM, If you are not able to pass a background check, please don't waste your time and mine. Please shop elsewhere. Please don't ask me to violate the law, by putting a weapon in your hands.  Besides; if you want to hunt, I don't think a NICS check is needed for a black powder gun, so you'd be legal that way, AND you'd have a longer hunting season.

It is evident that at one point in time there was some slight surface rust, but the gun has been reblued and is currently rust free. The original grips are missing and have been replaced with some custom (more than likely homemade) target grips. The stampings are light but still visible.The Llama functions well, I test fired it with 50rds of light 38 super loads (well within the firearms original designated chamber pressures) with no apparent failures. The safety is functional, and the gun is a good copy of a 1911, sans grip safety.The model IV was the first gun produced by Llama and were not produced for the American market. The caliber is 9mm largo or 38 acp. The 38 acp is the exact same dimensionally as the 38 super auto, albeit the 38 acp is lower powered than the super. With light 38 super loads, the gun functions marvelously and all internals, including the bore, are in very good shape. It has a 5 1/2” barrel, slightly longer than a standard 1911. Production of the Llama IV started in 1932, with this specific firearm being produced in 1941. If any reference material is needed on this firearm, please email me and I will forward you to where I have found all of my information. I can also send more pictures if needed. These are extremely scarce on the American market, and it is truly a collectible that you will not find anywhere else.Asking price is $700 obo, willing to meet relatively close to Salisbury, NC.Open to any trade offers. Looking for 9mm carbines of good quality, AKs, ARs, big bore revolvers, old revolvers, military firearms... really any decent offer will be considered."
