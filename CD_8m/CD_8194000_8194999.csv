Now, on to the bad, and this is the only ""bad thing"" about the gun... the phosphorous sights that it came with were not so great. When I went to the range, the very first shot I took, the left rear sight dot popped off so I went on and took off the rear right dot as well so it wouldn't look uneven. 
Basically, the rear sights are now blacked out and the front has the phosphorous ""glow in the dark"" sight (you have to charge it with a flashlight). If you're planning on swapping them, it shouldn't be a big deal but I just want to lay it all out there. Other than that, it's a great shooter and conceal carry gun. I'm located in Renton.

Furthermore the finish on the rifle is heavily worn and there seems to be a feeding issue but is minimal as despite a drifting front sight I was able to nail a head size target at 100 yards with about 60 or so rounds. The magazine is a new made magazine made with the original WW2 factory dies so is not really a reproduction. If you have any questions please feel free to ask."

This is one smooth shooter, it is pretty much dead on accurate and is just as reliable as any other AK on the market. The rifle still has the big stock and goofy front end that was put on to make it legal to import but it does take double stack magazines! Most US made magazines will need the catch filed down to fit but they should work. Other noteworthy features are the side rail to mount an optic if you like and a BOLT CATCH. Yup this AK has a functional bolt catch; it does not lock to the rear on empty but you can lock the bolt back. This is a great candidate to convert into an AKM or just leave it as is and enjoy a great shooting Russian classic!
I would prefer to keep it but I need the money to put towards a security deposit for a new apartment. Comes with one ten magazine.
