If you don't know much about these, they are indestructible being forged frames, slides and barrels. This weapon actually nearly beat out the M9 Beretta as the US military sidearm and only lost due to the weight of the forged steel. They are still in use with the Spanish military and police. It's a rare opportunity for a go to war pistol and you can pass it down the line it will be here long after you are gone. The magazines average about $100 each.

I have owned this gun since new for about 6-7 years. It has seen a very low round count (around 250 at most). I had the barrel shipped to Nefarious Arms, Marvin Pitts and shortened with an AAC brake pinned and welded on. With the brake pinned and welded it is shorter but still meets all ATF requirements. This gun is in excellent shape. If you are not aware, they have stopped importing these guns a while back and they are very hard to come by. Due to how hard these are to find, I will be very picky on trades. Silencer is not included.Mainly looking for LWRC IC-Enhanced or A5 with the 14.7"" barrel, not picky on color. Would consider other LWRC rifles as well including a REPR which I can add another gun or something for. The only other trades I will consider are a SCAR in FDE, a Daniel Defense with the 14.5"" barrel pinned/welded brake (cash or other gun on top), and possibly would take multiple nicer AK47's like Arsenal, Maadi, Saiga, Vepr.Cash price is $2500 firm.If the ad is still up, it is still available."
