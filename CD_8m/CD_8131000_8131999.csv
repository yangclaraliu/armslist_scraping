Typical wear for milsurp type firearm.  Lots of holster strap wear on the back of the grip where the blueing is worn through to the aluminum frame.  Overall very nice looking gun.  I preferred the all blued versus the two tone that is more prevalent.  This gun was used in Hungary during the communist era as a government issued firearm. The AP63 is very similar to the German Walther PP. Functions and fires very nicely.  Full transparency - slide does not always lock open after last shot fired.  Not a safety issue, just annoying.  I replaced the magazine spring, but it still occurs occasionally.  $200 cash. I ask that we meet in person at a public place, preferably a police station to handle the transaction.  MUST be an Ohio resident.  Thanks."

It is evident that at one point in time there was some slight surface rust, but the gun has been reblued and is currently rust free. The original grips are missing and have been replaced with some custom (more than likely homemade) target grips. The stampings are light but still visible.The Llama functions well, I test fired it with 50rds of light 38 super loads (well within the firearms original designated chamber pressures) with no apparent failures. The safety is functional, and the gun is a good copy of a 1911, sans grip safety.The model IV was the first gun produced by Llama and were not produced for the American market. The caliber is 9mm largo or 38 acp. The 38 acp is the exact same dimensionally as the 38 super auto, albeit the 38 acp is lower powered than the super. With light 38 super loads, the gun functions marvelously and all internals, including the bore, are in very good shape. It has a 5 1/2” barrel, slightly longer than a standard 1911. Production of the Llama IV started in 1932, with this specific firearm being produced in 1941. If any reference material is needed on this firearm, please email me and I will forward you to where I have found all of my information. I can also send more pictures if needed. These are extremely scarce on the American market, and it is truly a collectible that you will not find anywhere else.Asking price is $700 obo, willing to meet relatively close to Salisbury, NC.Open to any trade offers. Looking for 9mm carbines of good quality, AKs, ARs, big bore revolvers, old revolvers, military firearms... really any decent offer will be considered."

A sharper break has been achieved by polishing the engagement surfaces and coating the trigger with an electroless Nickel plating that provides a significant enhancement to surface hardness, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. The hammer, disconnector, and pins have been treated with Nickel Teflon for reduced friction and good wear resistance, with the trigger treated with Nickel Boron the harder surface and greater wear resistance. Like the QMS, the ACT has been designed to remain as close to the standard MIL-SPEC trigger as possible, maintaining a trigger pull that is not lighter than M4/M16 minimum spec of 5.5 lbs.ALG ACT Trigger - Advanced Combat TriggerFor all AR15 parts see AR15 Parts"

This listing INCLUDES the BAR barrel nut that Aero Precision does not include when they sell their handguard to you...Ordinarily, this handguard is $85 on their website... sounds like a great deal, but you have to buy a proprietary $40 barrel nut separately, too! So really this handguard is $125 new. Still affordable, but not as much as a screaming deal as it first looks like!This listing includes: The handguard itself with the front 1913 rail already installed, all 8 screws for attaching the handguard to the barrel nut, the BAR barrel nut, and shims to time the barrel nut. I recommend that you use as many shims as possible to time the barrel nut, otherwise the handguard will be too close in to the pivot pin ears on the lower and will not allow the AR to pivot open properly. This handguard has only seen a couple trips to the range and has otherwise been on a home defense pistol. Unfortunately, when I received this handguard, some of the black anodizing had been scraped off the top, which I show clearly in my pictures. I will ship this item for free."

This rifle sells for MSPR of $1300 and this is the info from Seekin's Website:Designed as a high performance tactical carbine, the SP15 is built to Mil-Spec configuration with greater adaptability and performance through upgraded components and precision manufacturing. Billet upper and lower receivers are CNC machined from 7075-T6 aluminum. The exacting attention to detail and precision manufacturing produce a superior fit and finish not found on standard Mil-Spec parts.Extremely lightweight and user adaptable, the included No Excess Rail (NOXs™) is perfect for tactical, sporting and competition use. Precision machined from 6061-T6 aluminum, it features a seamless top Picatinny rail and M-LOK slots at 3, 6 and 9 O’clock positions for solid mounting of accessories where needed. The SP15 provides precision rifle performance in a tactical carbine. The SP15 comes with a 16"" match grade ArmorBlak barrel with our melonited Rook Flash Hider. Each barrel is inspected four times to insure match grade tolerances for maximum accuracy and performance.Melonited gas system components are used, including the gas block, gas tube and M16 Bolt Carrier Group. These are coated to resist corrosion and wear. This also aids in easier cleaning, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard parkerized finishes.Other high performance features include a Mil-Spec trigger group, an Magpul MOE + Grip and the Magpul STR butt stock.•Billet upper and lower receivers CNC machined from 7075-T6 aluminum•Exceeds Mil-Spec requirements and performance•No Excess Rail M-LOK (NOXs™) •Type III Class 2 Hardcoat Anodized Finish•Match Grade 16"" barrel•Mid-Length Gas System•M4 Feed Ramps•Melonited Gas Block, Gas tube and M16 Bolt Carrier Group• Melonited Rook Flash Hider•Weight - 6.85 LBS*Ambi Selector* Handguard 15"" NOXs* Gas Block AdjustableThe price for this NIB rifle is $950 and will be lowered each day until either a) it sells or b) it's time to take it to the Market Hall gunshow.
