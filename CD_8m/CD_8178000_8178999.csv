For the seasoned MP5 owners, why not train on readily available .22lr and save that 9mm for your handguns. (No offense to .45 ACP people)Yes it has an (evil) pistol grip. Yes it has a suppressor looking (terrifying) add on with no noise reduction whatsoever. This .22lr beast has a coveted sniper optic system (ok, a Bushnell TRS-25 1X magnification red dot on a perfectly co-witnessed ultra low mount). Also comes with the original (mean looking) and the new M-Lok (really mean looking) hand guard with a hand stop for increased rate of fire-ability. Sorry, no chainsaw lug or chainsaw included.And if you act now, you will receive a total of not 1 but 4 thats (4) or four, 25 round magazines at no extra charge.Don't delay, get this one soon, maybe with your tax return.

It's basically a cross between a roller locked MP5 and the newer UMP 9 (ie MP5 style roller delayed action and a polymer receiver designed to replicate the UMP). It's set up with a UMP style folding stock (made by SW, which are bit hard to come by). It has a full auto MP5 bolt carrier and comes with 1 German MP5SD straight mag. I can sell some additional Korean MP5 curved mags with it (new in box), if the buyer is interested. The barrel was cut and re-threaded 1x2x28 by ZR Tactical, who then added the faux suppressor and pinned and welded it. They also removed the ""tumor"" (the built in flashlight bump) and replaced it with a rail for a foregrip.This is as close to a UMP 9 without dropping $4k on an HK USC to UMP conversion or $2400 for one of the new Omega Gideon pistols. The gun is ready to go as is and would be a perfect candidate for an SBR (file your Form 1 and then when you get your tax stamp, you can cut the weld on the faux suppressor and have a ready to go SBR with a threaded barrel).Asking $1300"

The target models are very sought after. They include a peep sight aperture that is easy to adjust. The  heavy long barrel and peep sight allows for long sight radius = very accurate rifle! I easily made dime size groups with cci quiet ammo at 30 yards. Copy and paste url link below to see pictures!https://imgur.com/a/3Dh1hThis is an all original gun. No modifications or sling holes drilled. Amazing right? At first I thought because of its condition that it was a refinished rifle stock. I put it under a black light and it glows in a green colour. That indicates an old lacquer that is used on guns back then. I did it to all my other Winchesters and they show the same. Even vintage Gibson's will show the same green glow. Its an indicator that the lacquer is old.Surprisingly through its long life, the finish is still in very nice condition. I have also found another picture of a Winchester 69a that has the same finish to confirm its original finish.NO SERIAL NUMBER.What is also great about this particular rifle is that it comes with the front sight hood. Most 69a that are still available are either modded or missing their front sight hood.The bluing metal is at a 85-90% condition.The rifling is strong and sharp and the bore is shiny.This rifle has an amazing adjustable trigger as well as a buttery smooth action. You will learn when you pick up this rifle what I mean. It is amazing how great the action is on this little rifle.It comes with the original Winchester magazine.**this is an older rifle, so it will have some blemishes! please look at the pictures. ** I would grade this rifle at a 85% overall!All features of it work great! Safety and adjustable trigger and peep sight!The long barrel allows for very quiet shooting with CCI quiet ammo._____Policy:sold as is. price is firm. no trades.please text 4 7 0 five 2 2 3 7 five six if you are interested! I have a lot more pictures if you are interested.If this is sold out of state it will need to be shipped for an additional 20.00. Must include FFL info and a drivers license.PAYPAL GIFT payment only.If you live in the state of GA, you will be required to supply me a copy of your drivers license or CCW before meeting.You will be meeting at a Sheriff's office for both of our safety.No exceptions to this policy.__This is a very great gun to have in your collection. They do not make guns like this anymore! Grab it for cheap while you can. I am actually selling under the market price to make room fast for other projects. I have seen 69as in this condition sell for around 450+"

That is where you can install a hammer extension. It aids in cocking the hammer back if a scope is installed. The condition is 98%. The only blemishes that I see is that the stock on the non-ejecting side of the rifle has some light paint chips. Nothing major. Bore is super clean and shiny and rifling is sharp! Includes the original sling mounts and a nice Amish made leather sling.

Schwarzlose blow-forward semi-automatic pistol came in from an estate. It is chambered in 7.65mm (32 acp) caliber, has a 50% blued finish, S/N is 5521, checkered hard rubber grips, and is in overall good original condition. The hammer is a little sticky but everything does function. This is one of the scarcest German semi-automatic pistols made, and an important piece for the system collector as there are only a couple models of blow-forward actions. The Schwarzlose Model 1908 was a semi-automatic pistol, designed by Andreas Schwarzlose, released in 1908 in German Empire and produced until 1911. The Schwarzlose employs a very distinctive ""blow-forward action"" operating mechanism. It has no slide, instead the mechanism is operated by the barrel being projected forward due to the gas pressure and the friction of the bullet passing through the bore, the compressed recoil spring drives the barrel back, stripping the top cartridge from the magazine, chambering the round, and pressing the cartridge head against the standing breech, which is part of the frame. Andreas Schwarzlose (best known for his 1907 and 07/12 machine guns) designed this pistol for military and civilian use, and it saw minor commercial success. The blow-forward action was pretty much a developmental dead end, because it made for unusually sharp recoil and was potentially unsafe to handle – the only three commercially available pistols made this way were the Hino, the Schwarzlose, and the Mannlicher 1894 (which was quickly replaced by better Mannlicher designs). The Swiss did tinker a bit with a blow-forward action in their AK-52/53 rifle as well, but this ultimately went nowhere.Shipping is $15"

It also comes with the case, sling and manual. This is a really accurate sub-caliber rifle. It has a red laser with it as well, with a pressure pad on the right side..can be changed around, of course. It has two 15 round Beretta magazines with it. The nice thing about it is that it uses the same magazines as the Beretta model 92 fs (M-9) series so they are interchangeable and there are tons of them for sale reasonably.. I have used the 20 rounders as well with success. This is a really fun gun at the range and is a tack driver even with the ""iron"" sights.. Add an optic and your good to go out well beyond 100 yards. Thanks for looking."

This rifle is marked R. Famage 1952. It also has a .30 stamp to signify it is chambered in 30-06, and has a small cut out in top of the reciever to accept feeding of the longer 30-06 round. From some basic research I can tell you this rifle was likely chambered in 7mm and then converted in Bogota, Colombia to 30 cal.Condition: The bore is in good condition, it is shiney with strong rifling (I bought it filled with cosmoline). The metal appears to be in decent shape. It has various small dings on the bolt handle and rear area near the safety. The stock is beat to crap but I can't find any cracks. It has a lot of dings/dents and some trench art carved into it in a few spots. A few original markings are visible if you look close.Any potential buyer must have at least a current ohio ID (ccw preferred), No felonies or other reasons to be unable to own a firearm, and be willing to sign a bill of sale.

Dragoon marked sights. The buttplate says ""27"" which could be off of an M28 stock, civil guard, or maybe the 27th Jager battalion. It also has a ""1"" inscribed under the buttplate. Finnish wartime round finger spliced stock. Nice tiger striping on handguard, arctic birch stock. KAB marked rear sight indicating cossack or Dragoon. It is a bit shorter than a regular M91. This was most likely used in the winter war, Finnish civil war, world war I, and WWII, if not all. It's counter bored, no import mark. I have shot it about 5 times and is a consistent shooter, but still would only buy as a collectible and not something to eat a bunch of lead. This is probably a bring-back since there's no import mark. It has the Finnish army SA mark on the side of the barrel shank, imperial tula crest, tang matches receiver and marked 1895 so this considered antique and requires no FFL to sell, but I will not ship. Only trades I'm iterested are Suomi KP31's, M1 Garrands/Carbins(depending on make & condition), Swedish or German mausers, Swiss K31's, FN49's, Russian SKS's, SVT-40's, Romaian PSL's, other mosins, M1917 revolvers, WWII pistols, - Pretty much anything WWII/WWI and/or slight-postwar military weapons.
