Chambered in the .45-70, the 1895 Trapper SBL utilizes the time-tested Marlin 1895 action that was built to handle full power big-bore loads. As with 1895s that came before it, the TSBL features side-ejection, so mounting an optic is an option. But don’t discount the iron sights that come standard with this rifle; the adjustable Skinner rear peep sight and post front sight are durable and well-designed—perfect for fast shooting in dense cover and refined enough to make accurate shots at surprising distances."

I bought this ATI pistol about 60 days ago, I really love an ATI 1911 that I picked up awhile back, so I've bought a few other of their items. When I got around to shooting this pistol down at the farm, I realized there appeared to be something odd cycling the charging handle when a round was in the chamber. I sent the upper off, 30 days later when I get it back, they said all that was wrong with it, is that I didn't clean it before I went to shoot it. Lesson learned, because it took 30 days for that report and they kept the magazine that I was required to send with the upper Possibly they found a problem and corrected it, but that's not what they said and they seemed to be good people).Anyway, slow forward to now. I'm playing around with 7.62x39 for more beaver / coyote killing options when I do manage to make it to the farm, so this item is up for sell. Less than 30 rounds have been fired in it. People always ask me, where are you located? Like the listing says, Madison in the Jackson area. You'd be surprised the people who don't notice that before they get around to deciding that it is too far for them to drive to come get it. So to cut down on the useless messaging I'll add a few details because I've dabbled enough to know where the problem areas are when listing something. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cue humorous guidelines, that someone isn't going to find funny and will need to chat me up to let me have a piece of their mind-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's a 1st come 1st serve sort of thing. Lots of people tell me that they are coming for something eventually, but they change their mind. No problem. If you don't want it, don't come get it. I completely understand. If we've talked that you are planning a trip to come get it, that doesn't mean that I am holding it for you. We aren't dating. If you want it, come get it. Just because we talked that you planned to get around to picking it up doesn't matter. This is what I have. If you can't get to it, no problem. No reason to chat me up to let me know what I have, is something that you don't want. For things that are too of a deal to be true, I sometime mark things as sell pending when it appears that I have a creditable buyer... just to keep other people from chatting me up to see if it is still available. Things that sell, I take the listing down within minutes and the transfer. No need to send me your phone number. I'm not calling everyone who sends me their number. Please read the details and write questions. I can do that from anywhere at any time without trying to make phone calls. This item is in the Jackson area. You can buy it for cash if you are willing to be in the Madison area when I have time to meet you. I don't want your trades. I'd rather keep this gun, than trade for something else. I am at capacity for everything. I'm purging the excess, not swapping for it. Someone did steal my Glock 19 Gen 3. If you have one of those for a trade, mention it to me because we might be able to work something out. If you have a Glock 19 Gen 3, but don't want to trade it, no need to mention to me that you have one, but don't want to trade it. This is a local cash deal ONLY for people who can show me a Mississippi driver's license. If you are buying an upper, you don't have to show me a Mississippi driver's license. You may feel that you know more about gun laws than I do. Maybe you do, but I only sell lowers to people who can show me a MS DL.There are several blocked numbers and email addresses for rude people and / or bad people trying to effectively steal from me. I'm just a guy selling stuff off at times. I don't have to have your money. If you offend me, I'll never sell to you just because that is in my stubborn nature. Don't bother asking what my bottom dollar is. Things that I have for sell that no one wants, I might lower the price on. I might keep it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Not pictured:Starting late tomorrow, for an additional $150, you can add a PSA 8.5"" PL 300AAC Phos 7"" 2A Mlok upper. They you can just switch uppers, move over your ATI bcg / ch and now you are shooting 300 blackout using your same mags. I haven't got around to ordering a suppressor so it might be deer hunting 2019 season before I get back interested in 300 blackout subsonic suppressed. So that is $550 if you take both. Or $200 is someone reads this and just wants the 300 blackout upper. Not only have I not shot it, it won't be delivered till tomorrow. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here are the details on the pistol that is hard to find, because everyone is usually sold out------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATI® Omni Hybrid Maxx P4 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington Semi-auto AR PistolFeaturing ATI®'s metal-reinforced polymer upper and lower receivers for reduced weight and increased maneuverability…without sacrificing durability. The lower receiver features an over-molded metal insert, which reinforces the buffer tube housing and rear takedown pin. This allows for metal-on-metal contact with both the buffer tube as well as the rear takedown pin, delivering durability to withstand recoil and constant use. Bottom line: you get an AR Pistol with ""heavy metal"" strength…but at a price that can't be beat.Both the upper and lower are built from a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert, with extra reinforcements in high-pressure sectionsInter-lock hammer and trigger pin retainment system built into the Lower prevents movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing7"" KeyMod handguardPlum CrazyTM lower parts kitStandard charging handleIncludes one 30-rd. polymer magazine (magpul gen 2 since ATI kept the original).Key SpecificationsItem Number: 704540Caliber: 5.56 NATO/.223 RemingtonAction: Semi-automaticCapacity: 30+1Barrel length: 7.5""Barrel twist: 1:7""Stock: -Upper receiver: Metal-reinforced polymerLower receiver: Metal-reinforced polymerSights (front/rear): Optics-readyHandguard: 7"" KeyModOverall length: 23""Overall weight: 4.2 lbs.MFG Number: ATIGOMX556P4UPC: REDACTED95"

I bought this ATI pistol about 60 days ago, I really love an ATI 1911 that I picked up awhile back, so I've bought a few other of their items. When I got around to shooting this pistol down at the farm, I realized there appeared to be something odd cycling the charging handle when a round was in the chamber. I sent the upper off, 30 days later when I get it back, they said all that was wrong with it, is that I didn't clean it before I went to shoot it. Lesson learned, because it took 30 days for that report and they kept the magazine that I was required to send with the upper Possibly they found a problem and corrected it, but that's not what they said and they seemed to be good people).Anyway, slow forward to now. I'm playing around with 7.62x39 for more beaver / coyote killing options when I do manage to make it to the farm, so this item is up for sell. Less than 30 rounds have been fired in it. People always ask me, where are you located? Like the listing says, Madison in the Jackson area. You'd be surprised the people who don't notice that before they get around to deciding that it is too far for them to drive to come get it. So to cut down on the useless messaging I'll add a few details because I've dabbled enough to know where the problem areas are when listing something. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cue humorous guidelines, that someone isn't going to find funny and will need to chat me up to let me have a piece of their mind-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's a 1st come 1st serve sort of thing. Lots of people tell me that they are coming for something eventually, but they change their mind. No problem. If you don't want it, don't come get it. I completely understand. If we've talked that you are planning a trip to come get it, that doesn't mean that I am holding it for you. We aren't dating. If you want it, come get it. Just because we talked that you planned to get around to picking it up doesn't matter. This is what I have. If you can't get to it, no problem. No reason to chat me up to let me know what I have, is something that you don't want. For things that are too of a deal to be true, I sometime mark things as sell pending when it appears that I have a creditable buyer... just to keep other people from chatting me up to see if it is still available. Things that sell, I take the listing down within minutes and the transfer. No need to send me your phone number. I'm not calling everyone who sends me their number. Please read the details and write questions. I can do that from anywhere at any time without trying to make phone calls. This item is in the Jackson area. You can buy it for cash if you are willing to be in the Madison area when I have time to meet you. I don't want your trades. I'd rather keep this gun, than trade for something else. I am at capacity for everything. I'm purging the excess, not swapping for it. Someone did steal my Glock 19 Gen 3. If you have one of those for a trade, mention it to me because we might be able to work something out. If you have a Glock 19 Gen 3, but don't want to trade it, no need to mention to me that you have one, but don't want to trade it. This is a local cash deal ONLY for people who can show me a Mississippi driver's license. If you are buying an upper, you don't have to show me a Mississippi driver's license. You may feel that you know more about gun laws than I do. Maybe you do, but I only sell lowers to people who can show me a MS DL.There are several blocked numbers and email addresses for rude people and / or bad people trying to effectively steal from me. I'm just a guy selling stuff off at times. I don't have to have your money. If you offend me, I'll never sell to you just because that is in my stubborn nature. Don't bother asking what my bottom dollar is. Things that I have for sell that no one wants, I might lower the price on. I might keep it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Not pictured:Starting late tomorrow, for an additional $150, you can add a PSA 8.5"" PL 300AAC Phos 7"" 2A Mlok upper. They you can just switch uppers, move over your ATI bcg / ch and now you are shooting 300 blackout using your same mags. I haven't got around to ordering a suppressor so it might be deer hunting 2019 season before I get back interested in 300 blackout subsonic suppressed. So that is $550 if you take both. Or $200 is someone reads this and just wants the 300 blackout upper. Not only have I not shot it, it won't be delivered till tomorrow. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here are the details on the pistol that is hard to find, because everyone is usually sold out------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATI® Omni Hybrid Maxx P4 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington Semi-auto AR PistolFeaturing ATI®'s metal-reinforced polymer upper and lower receivers for reduced weight and increased maneuverability…without sacrificing durability. The lower receiver features an over-molded metal insert, which reinforces the buffer tube housing and rear takedown pin. This allows for metal-on-metal contact with both the buffer tube as well as the rear takedown pin, delivering durability to withstand recoil and constant use. Bottom line: you get an AR Pistol with ""heavy metal"" strength…but at a price that can't be beat.Both the upper and lower are built from a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert, with extra reinforcements in high-pressure sectionsInter-lock hammer and trigger pin retainment system built into the Lower prevents movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing7"" KeyMod handguardPlum CrazyTM lower parts kitStandard charging handleIncludes one 30-rd. polymer magazine (magpul gen 2 since ATI kept the original).Key SpecificationsItem Number: 704540Caliber: 5.56 NATO/.223 RemingtonAction: Semi-automaticCapacity: 30+1Barrel length: 7.5""Barrel twist: 1:7""Stock: -Upper receiver: Metal-reinforced polymerLower receiver: Metal-reinforced polymerSights (front/rear): Optics-readyHandguard: 7"" KeyModOverall length: 23""Overall weight: 4.2 lbs.MFG Number: ATIGOMX556P4UPC: REDACTED95"

This rifle has a Vortex razor HD gen 1 scope that’s another $1699 brand new. This rifle has the best of the best on it and I will include the build sheet in photos so you can see exactly what you will be getting if purchased. You also can give sawtooth rifles a call and they will tell you this is not a cheap rifle by any means nessasary. This rifle was just finished December 2017 and has 354rds logged shot out of the barrel so not even remotely broken in yet. Any other questions please ask."

901,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8286901,For Sale:  HK 94 / MP5 SBR Original H&K,"Lakeway, Austin, Texas","$ 7,400","Listed On: Friday, April 27, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"MP5 in excellent condition with all HK internals as shipped. I’ve run her once in auto (both suppressd and unsuppressed) to verify function but this thing is so nice and I have other MP5 hosts so she has rested in the safe for nearly a decade. She had bright night sites when she arrived but those are now dim (easy enough to find online and replace or ignore as they are not necessary). Stock looks new and is tight with no wobbles. 3 lug works perfectly on HK IG date coded barrel with new appearing bore. Paddle mag release is as smooth as the one on my previous original post 86 machine gun. Carrier has been welded to allow auto function with an HK sear. The carrier looks factory original after the minor work done to accomplish the conversion.
HK 94 originally converted by Curtis Higgins at S&H Firearms to an MP5 form when married to one of his HK sears. Original HK made in W-Germany imported by HK Chantilly VA, 9mm and remarked MP5 and is an IG (1986) production. When the gun was transferring to me it was divorced from the sear and papered to as SBR by TSC LLC in Ruther Glen VA. The SBR marking is to ATF spec and discreetly located on the lower rear receiver rail. All maintenance parts are current to include new German HK recoil spring, extractor and extractor spring. Includes nice B&T forward rail.
You can now purchase some great Heckler & Koch clones but if you want an original in premium shape this is the one to have.
Cash preferred but willing to consider interesting trades. If asking about a trade please say exactly what you are considering including any cash offered or needed to make up a value difference. I have other items listed and can work a deal either way. A Desert Tech SRS and premium optic would go a long way to catching my attention. I'm located near Mansfield Dam on Lake Travis, nearest cross streets being Hudson Bend and RR620. I either work from home or at the Capital Complex during the week. I will want and happy to provide a bill of sale.
If the add is up the toy is available. I will not respond to questions asking “still available” or that do not show a person has read the listing. This gun will require an ATF F4 transfer. I live near Capitol Armory and Silencershop and happy to meet at either to complete paperwork if you already have your information on file with either."
