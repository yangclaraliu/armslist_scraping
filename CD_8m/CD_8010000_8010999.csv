Found it in a gun shop in Lindsay, America a short time ago and had to have it. It is in great shape, and since I’ve had it, it has been rebuilt, cleaned meticulously, and is in perfect time. This revolver is great if you’re looking for something you can just throw in your jacket for a trip to the store, or all day carry as well. I also have a brand new ankle holster that will come with it, and a box of 47 .22LR Ammo. Ammo is cheap for it, and it will go bang every time you want it to! Revolver is is very accurate given the size of the barrel, and I actually like this gun a lot. Just kinda seeing what’s out there really. My favorite thing about this gun is the fact that you can buy literally every single part for this pistol on eBay for roughly $7.00, and there are a lot of surplus parts for them. Most aren’t in this great of shape, and I’m not looking to make a profit on it. Mostly interested in trading for other baby guns, so shoot me an offer if you’re interested."

927,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8010927,For Sale:  Neumann Freres Frontier Bulldog .44 Russian,"Fishers/Noblesville, Indianapolis, Indiana",$ 190,"Listed On: Thursday, February 22, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"From what I can gather on my limited internet research, this is a Belgian made revolver in .44 Russian. I got this as part of a deal with another gun, and it just doesn't fit my collection. It will shoot, according to the guy who gave it to me, but will need some gunsmithing to be safe as the cylinder spins freely. This antique pistol is double-action only and pre-1899. I most likely has a storied life as it has had some gunsmithing done to it, from what I can tell. The original cylinder pin has been replaced, which seems to be why the cylinder now spins freely. It is missing the ejector rod, and the nickel finish does not seem to be original. I believe this is a copy of the Webley Bulldog or RIC. The original grips indicate it is a Neumann Freres firearm, and the only markings on the pistol are ""Frontier Bulldog"" on the top strap over the cylinder, ""152"" on the frame below the cylinder, ""ELG"" symbol on the cylinder itself, as well as a star shaped symbol on the cylinder and frame. This is a pretty neat looking revolver with its unique double trigger guard, but will most likely need some gunsmith work before it becomes a shooter.I have more pictures on request, so just let me know.I am located in Noblesville, but am willing to travel some if necessary. Must be an Indiana resident and proper person."
