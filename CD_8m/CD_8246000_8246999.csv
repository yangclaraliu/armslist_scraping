The EPSILON 556 just outperforms everything on the market. Designed for the discriminating shooter and professional end-users, VG6 Precision's EPSILON 556 affords you the best muzzle control and recoil mitigation the industry has to offer. This is a true combination muzzle brake / compensator / flash hider. Its performance is matched only by the amazing look of this device. The VG6 Epsilon 556 carries many of the same characteristics as the Gamma 556 with a few exceptions. Extended flash hiding prongs and no ports at the 12 o’clock positions allow uninhibited view from flash through optics or sights. The difference in porting is also noticed on the underside of the device where it has 6 valve holes to allow the fastest gasses reaching the second chamber to exit. This creates very soft low energy recoil that allows for absolute control.

I absolutely love the M1A; it is a dream to shoot and very accurate. But it is my only 308, I already have an FN49 in .30-06, and unexpectedly acquired an all original, WWII, non-CMP Garand after the M1A. So I'm interested in moving over to .30-06 primarily. That and I would like to have a Garand I feel less guilty shooting. So there is exactly nothing wrong with the M1A. It is a fantastic rifle and I can't say enough good things about it. It has about 100 rounds through it, and it comes with all original everything including paperwork. Hell, I have the cardboard box it shipped in if you want it."

Designed for the discriminating shooter and professional end-users, VG6 Precision's EPSILON 556 affords you the best muzzle control and recoil mitigation the industry has to offer. This is a true combination muzzle brake / compensator / flash hider. Its performance is matched only by the amazing look of this device. The VG6 Epsilon 556 carries many of the same characteristics as the Gamma 556 with a few exceptions. Extended flash hiding prongs and no ports at the 12 o’clock positions allow uninhibited view from flash through optics or sights. The difference in porting is also noticed on the underside of the device where it has 6 valve holes to allow the fastest gasses reaching the second chamber to exit. This creates very soft low energy recoil that allows for absolute control.

If you are not familiar with the red lion forend it is an awesome upgrade to this cool little rifle!! It allows you to loosen a nut to rotate the forend so that the rifle may be folded without optics or accessories getting in the way. Please note that I was not completely satisfied with the iron sights when I purchased the rifle, I felt there was a small issue with them (though I was still able to zero the rifle). I contacted the manufacturer and they sent out a replacement front sight, still same issue. I decided that sending the rifle back to the manufacturer was too much of a pain since I don't even use the irons with the red dot mounted so the problem was never addressed any further, not to mention there are better aftermarket iron sight options out there if that is the route you want to go."

The serial number suggests it was produced in or around 1971, may have been a duty weapon for LAPD. I've put several hundred rounds through it since I acquired it ten or so years ago, and it is the most accurate sidearm I currently own. While it does show its almost 50-year age, it is still exceptionally reliable and accurate, as can be expected from a Smith & Wesson. While I have owned it, I have taken immaculate care if, cleaning and oiling it after every trip to the range, and storing it in a humidity controlled safe. I have no doubt that with proper care, the next owner could get another 50 years out of. Included, but not pictured, is a law-enforcement-style holster with level two retention.

I repaired it from the inside with 4 layers of fiberglass mat and epoxy so it can't be seen and it’s much stronger that the thin walnut was. Because of the damage, I refinished it with matt spar urethane over ebony stain. The rear stock I left the walnut in its natural color when I finished it. (New stocks are available from Boyd’s if you wanted to upgrade.) I flushed and cleaned everything and it all functioned very well when I put around 300 rds through it. I cleaned it again last weekend and it is ready to go. Very fun gun to shoot cans with! Scope and rings shown on it are optional.

More info on the Sub9: •KelTec says there were approximately 3500 made, with one of 10 different magazine/caliber combinations. •The receiver is machined from billet aluminum, and matching assembly numbers applied to the inside of both halves. •The feature-set was similar to that of the Colt R6450 (pistol caliber, adjustable front sight, last-round bolt hold-open), but also featured: forward assist (reciprocating bolt handle), interchangeable magwells to share magazines with your sidearm, and was collapsible for storage. •Optional accessories included a quick-detach scope base, built-in weapon light, laser, etc. •In 2000, the rifle was redesigned to reduce costs by: simplifying the firing assembly, removing the last-round bolt hold-open, and forming the receiver and barrel block out of polymer. It was also renamed Sub-2000. •In 2015, the rifle was redesigned again to speed up production. The polymer type, barrel (now threaded), and front sight were changed. It also got a facelift and mounting points for optics and accessories. It still carries the Sub-2000 name, but with the ""Gen2"" moniker. •It can be extrapolated that there were approximately 500 Glock 17 Sub-9s made based on magazine availability at the time, but it may be less. KelTec did not keep aggregated production data based on the magwells because they were intended to be ""exchangeable"" over the lifetime of the product. If you've wanted a Gen2 Sub 2000, then you'll love the Sub9 for it's feel, build, shootability, and scarcity. If you have any other questions, let me know."
