It is the latest in technological advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a host of unique features that no other handgun can match.
Its 15-round magazine is precisely engineered to take a dive to the prone position and naturally roll up toward the target.

Four interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use.

TX residents only, strongly prefer CHL/LTC holders. Listed from top to bottom:SOLD  Chiappa Firearms M4-22 ($350):  SOLDI purchased this Chiappa Firearms M4-22 upper from someone on Armslist and then built a lower. The upper was pretty gunked up when I got it, but it cleaned up nicely. The lower is polymer and is manufactured by New Frontier Armory. I never got around to shooting this one so I can’t speak to how it functions, it may need to be re-lubed. Comes with 1 magazine and flip up iron sights. SOLD  Century International Arms PW-87 ($350):  SOLDThis 12 GA lever action shotgun is a functioning replica of the famous Winchester 1887 and is the gun that Arnold Schwarzenegger famously flip cocks in Terminator 2. I collect old Winchesters and thought this would be cool, but wound up never shooting it. Brand new, never been shot, in original box with all the trimmings.SOLD  .410 bore / .45 LC Derringer ($200):  SOLDThis interesting piece is a double barrel, break action derringer capable of shooting either .45 Long Colt or .410 bore shotshell. It was manufactured by Cobray/Leinad and is sometimes referred to as the “DBD41045” model. This thing has one hell of a kick and is a lot of fun.Charter Arms AR-7 Explorer ($250):I bought this takedown/survival rifle with the intent of using it as a backpacking gun. It’s a cool piece, but I ended up switching gears and going with a takedown 10/22 instead. SOLD Unknown Derringer ($250): SOLDI inherited this from my Grandfather many years ago and don’t know very much about it. It’s a double barrel, double trigger, break action derringer. It is stamped with “CAL .320” and a couple of proof marks but nothing else. A gun shop owner said it was possibly manufactured by FNH or a French company (I guarantee neither of these, it’s just what I was told)."

Only gun of lesser value I am interested in is a M&P 2.0 FDE + 200 dollars cash or maybe a tricked out G19 Gen5 only. This gun is no longer new but it is far from broken in. I have only fired about 100 rounds through it and have kept it clean. The longer I keep it the more it's worth so I am in no hurry to get rid of it.

After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracyIntegral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptaclesSimple field stripping into easily serviceable subassembliesMil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR® SAR partsUses standard AR-15/M16 magazinesLast round hold open on empty magazineAll metal parts are treated for corrosion resistanceIntegral rubber recoil padAssembled in the US from Israeli and US manufactured partsOptimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of useClean, long stroke piston operationBody constructed of high-strength impact modified polymer"

Designed by Emerson and USA-built by Kershaw, this handsome auto takes Emerson’s tactical looks to the next level of refinement. The Launch 5’s CPM154 powdered metallurgy blade steel offers more uniform distribution of carbides—so it takes and holds an excellent edge. It also provides good corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and toughness. The blade is stonewashed for good looks and to hide use-scratches. To lighten the Launch 5’s weight, the handles and integrated backspacer are made of durable anodized aluminum. A machined texture on the handles provides a secure grip. The Launch 5 opens with a push button, recessed so that it is level with the flat of the handle. This is a safety feature and makes it harder for the knives to accidentally deploy. Left-handers can use their index finger instead of their thumb to press the blade-release/lock button. A reversible pocketclip is included and a lanyard tie-off is built into the butt end of the knife."

These rifles are built with durability,accuracy,and weight in mind and are extremely accurate. I only have one of each left and due to the man induced ""ban"" scare prices have already began to inflate on supplies needed to build these awesome little shooters and I refuse to take part in that non sense so these will be the last two built and sold until prices for supplies come back down to ""normal"" levels and if they are banned in that time frame so be it guess they'll be the last ones lol. Take your pic on either both priced the same at 700.00 each cash or 1k trade..Both are in new unfired condition add your favorite optic and oil and you are ready to match shoot or plink at the ranch.

Emerson design meets Kershaw auto-magic An exciting new entry in Kershaw’s automatic series is the Launch 5. Designed by Emerson and USA-built by Kershaw, this handsome auto takes Emerson’s tactical looks to the next level of refinement. The Launch 5’s CPM154 powdered metallurgy blade steel offers more uniform distribution of carbides—so it takes and holds an excellent edge. It also provides good corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and toughness. The blade is stonewashed for good looks and to hide use-scratches. To lighten the Launch 5’s weight, the handles and integrated backspacer are made of durable anodized aluminum. A machined texture on the handles provides a secure grip. The Launch 5 opens with a push button, recessed so that it is level with the flat of the handle. This is a safety feature and makes it harder for the knives to accidentally deploy. Left-handers can use their index finger instead of their thumb to press the blade-release/lock button. A reversible pocketclip is included and a lanyard tie-off is built into the butt end of the knife."
