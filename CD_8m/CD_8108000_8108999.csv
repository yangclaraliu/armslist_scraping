It is, however, better than no gun at all.)  Online reviews of the SD9VE berate the trigger pull as too heavy (8.5 lbs.), but the gun was designed like this intentionally for inexperienced shooters in a home defense scenario in which high adrenelin levels may cause an inadvertant discharge of the weapon.  There are after market kits available for around $60 that will reduce trigger pull to around 6 lbs.  This weapon is in excellent condition, having fired only 100 rounds and the SD9VE has a very good reputation for reliability.  I have fired a 1,000 rounds through my SD9VE without a single issue.  I paid $310 for it new and am willing to take $250 for it.  The original box, a lockable plastic carry case, and 2 magazines are included.  I prefere to be contacted by text message...my phone number is REDACTED."

Crisp & predictable trigger - on the Colt Defender is heavy and long with a smooth travel and crisp break that's consistent and predictable.  This airgun is almost the same size and weight as the Smith & Wesson Shield and makes for a great gun to practice holster drills and target acquisition.
 16-round build-in magazine - very easy to load with spring tension and hook.  The defender gets great velocity and has good CO2 economy.  Shoot it on a warm day as fast as you can reload it!

Rifle has typical wear of a Russian SKS from this ERA. I am not certain on the exact age of the rage but it will be from near around the end of WW2 to before 1956. No transfer fees as since this rifle is over 50 years old it will be cash and carry. My guess on age based off available data is post 1950 as the bayonet is a blade rather than spike and the gas block matches the 1952-1956 era of Russia rifles. The rifle has what appears to be the original sling, bayonet, and tool kit inside the buttstock. Bore is decent and its definitely a shooter. Only modification is the scope mount. If you want more pictures send me a message. Asking $450 OBO."

The frame is 7075 Aluminum like quality AR receivers with stainless barrels. The quality of the doubletap amazed me the most. Being in 9mm and having a Hogue grip it is not a big pain to shoot and actually feels pretty good in the hand. It has a compartment to store 2 extra rounds on a speed strip. This would also be the perfect gun for snake shot, with no slide to cycle you can run whatever you want through it.  And if 9mm isn't enough you can upgrade to .45ACP by swapping the barrels. Then you have the world's smallest .45 acp. May consider trades,  AR upper assemblies,  AK receivers, other pistols, Carbines, single action,  black powder. 80% receivers and jigs,  let me know what you have.. Thanks!  -nick913-602-75 six zeroCall or text,  please leave a voicemail if no answer. Search words: Heizer ps1 pak1 par1 ruger lcp lc9 lc380 smith wesson s&w boduguard 380 642 637 638 640 940 taurus 45 9 40 caliber bersa beretta pico nano rm380 tcp slim 738 keltec p3at sccy ioinc 80 percent jigs tools shockwave 870 tac14 mossberg remington R51"
