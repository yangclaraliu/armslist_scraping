The end result is a tack driver that will nail a pop can at 300 yards with the right ammo and a competent shooter behind the trigger. *note... The picture makes it look like a lefty. Its just the camera being silly. This is a RIGHT HAND CHARGER!I really dont need the semi auto capabilities the AR15 provides. I would much rather have a nice bolt gun that I can use to beef up my long range skills. -Stock has rubber pad that grips the shoulder and prevents sliding (especially useful when shooting prone) Also houses a small compartment for batteries/tools etc.-Nikon Prostaff 3-9x, standard duplex reticle with nikon p series scope mounts.-Magpul handguard w/added picatinny rail on underside. -Carbine length gas system with topside picatinny gas block.-flat top,  side charging upper receiver w/ thick, stiff walls.-Nitride bcg (right hand charge)-Trigger pull reduction job (breaks quick and clean without posing the safety risk of an excessively light trigger)-Triple baffled compensator (SIGNIFICANTLY reduces recoil and muzzle climb in comparison to the standard bird cage A2, allows shot followthrough and quck target reacquisition)I have enjoyed this rifle. It is a rock solid multi purpose weapon that is capable of an extremely high degree of accuracy from any firing position. It is light enough to fire standing but sturdy enough to mount on a bipod or bag and shoot prone or benched. It will eat anything you feed it. I have been able to achieve 1.5 moa with wolf/tulammo steel cased as well as tagged a half pound can of tannerite from 300 yards with match grade brass.I would prefer a solid trade for this rifle . But, I will probably not say no to cash so if you have an offer lets talk.I also have a brand new 6.5 grendel (type 2) barrel and bcg which I will put in on request with an appropriate trade or payment.Add 160 or equiv to to total to include the grendel conversion (will include both bcgs and barrels. will swap barrels and bcg before sale on buyers request)"

Rated for +P ammunition, this striker-fired 9mm pistol hold a full 10 rounds in its double-stack mag, yet retains a slender, concealment-friendly 1"" width. The fully textured polymer grip makes it easy to hang on to your P365 under recoil, while deep serrations on the stainless steel slide provide a positive gripping surface when racking the slide.With the P365, Sig also proves that packing a small, concealable pistol does not require a compromise in trigger quality. The P365 has a remarkably clean, crisp trigger pull for a small striker-fired pistol. There is no manual safety to complicate the firing sequence; an internal firing pin block allows a round to be carried safely in the chamber for a fast first-shot capability - and an 11-round practical capacity.  Comes with two 10-rd magazines - a flush-fit carry mag and one with an extended finger rest Reinforced molded polymer frame keeps weight & bulk down Stainless steel slide has a tough, matte black Nitron finish Rated for +P ammunition  The P365 is fitted with Sig’s Xray3 sights with a bright fluorescent green front dot for easy sight alignment in daylight and Tritium inserts for low light use. Further departing from the typical micro-compact carry pistol, the P365 includes an under-frame accessory rail, ready for mounting a compact light or laser.With the Sig Sauer P365, you get more capacity and more concealability, all in a package that’s easy to carry all day, every day, 365 days a year!"

Lots of added performance parts in this one and ready to go, everything you need to go participate in a match. This gun was built as a USPSA Open Division gun but it would be right at home in 3-Gun/2-Gun, Steel Challenge or even IDPA. It can be adapted to do it all! It could also be a great platform as a suppressor host if that is your interest or maybe your are the next John Wick and need a new sidearm? The gun shoots very nice; light but crisp trigger with a clean, short reset. It shoots really flat with minimal disturbance or lift of your sight picture. The gun comes as the complete package with everything you see including all the original parts. The upgrades include:*Dawson Precision iron sights, fiber optic front. *Storm Lake 5"" barrel, Polished*Powder River Precision Competition trigger kit + trigger & action tuned.*Springer Precision Compensator*Heavyweight guide rod + springs*Springer slide racker*Dawson ICE Magwell *2-Mags, one is stock with Dawson basepad, one has a Pistolgear 170mm extension (+10rds) and Gram's spring & follower*Fab Defense Pic rail optic mount inc.

You could not build this gun and package deal for the asking price, it's a lot of kit for your money. The gun is overall in excellent shape, slick, smooth, accurate, and reliable. I'd keep it for a backup gun / supressor host but I'm trying to fund other projects so my loss is your gain! You can purchase this gun in a face-to-face or I can ship from my FFL to the FFL of your choice at the buyer's expense if in non restricted states.

this gun has been to the range one time since all the work was done and had less than 200 rounds fired through….its a UNREAL shooting gun! and the upgrades take it to a whole new level….this is NOT a carry gun, its a dead accurate range gun and would make a great competition gun!

Or "" if it has had any failures whatsoever?""  The emails from the seller stopped.  Further followups to attempt to get a look at this in person were ignored.  Our impression is that there is something not on the level here.Proceed with caution."

The PPQ has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools. The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is a departure of previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ.[9] When the trigger is pulled the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm (0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lbf). Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It should however be noted that the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state."

If a person could own a 1 stop shop, ""do-it-all"" rifle, then this is it. The Ruger SR 762 chambered in 7.62 NATO/.308 Winchester is a true multi-purpose rifle. Have you ever thought to yourself, ""boy I wish I had a lightweight carbine rifle that could do double duty as a 1000 yard gun"", if so then this is the gun for you. Shoots 1.0 - 1.5 moa as consistently as the sun coming up, if you feed it healthy food that is. Collapsible stock and folding iron sights will adjust to your hearts content. If you want more possibilities however, it is interchangeable with all those mil-spec AR parts. It fits the bill for a ""battle rifle"" if thats your fancy. Weighing in at 8 1/2 lbs unloaded, who wouldn't want the satisfaction of 5, 10, or 20 rds of .308 at their disposal? The bolt is fully chrome and closes with more authority than your old high school principal. When changing mags, the 20rd PMAGs slide in and out faster than poop through a goose. Get yourself a 5rd mag and deer might as well lay down and give up when your carrying this nimble but full powered beast of a gun. I know what your thinking, ""boy it must kick like a mule on fire"", but au contraire friend. The piston driven system with adjustable gas block has 4 settings to regulate that gas pressure and show that cartridge who's boss. If you are wanting to play quiet as a mouse, adding a suppressor is easy for this platform. The gas settings will tackle that no problemo. Much of me is sad to see such a fine specimen of a gun slip through my fingers, but alas, I must make this rifle transform into diapers, wipes, baby food and other things that little girls require. So for your money, you get 1 outstanding rifle, 3 20-rd pmags, and all factory accessories. 2 picatinny rails, 3 hand guard covers, Nylon carrying case and Ruger booklets. 
Located near Thayer, MO. Cash only. I would prefer to do a simple buyer/seller agreement. That helps you to help me, to help me to help you and me steer clear of claims of thieves or other unsavory folks for the rest of time. Have a good one, and may the road rise up to meet you and the wind be always at your back."
