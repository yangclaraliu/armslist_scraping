All three come with CMP certificates, CMP cases, an enbloc, and CMP paperwork. I also have greek and Norwegian ammo in cans that I will sell at a good price to the buyer of any garand. If these are still available on Sunday they are going on gunbroker and i know what they will bring but id rather try to sell them local first. Let me remind you these are SERVICE GRADE rifles, not the crappy rack or even field grades. These guns are good to go and have A LOT of life left in them. And lastly no trades. I'm looking for cash only. I would be more than happy to send more pics and give part numbers if someone is interested. Make an offer on each or all three.

Also It has some unique customizations. It has custom made fiber optic sights,  grip stippling, polished barrel, and fully polished feed ramp, and loading lug.. The Beretta Pico is a modular handgun system just like the Sig P320, and P250.. And Beretta's APX,  and Nano pistols. Meaning the sights can easily be changed at home with an allen key, there are several different grip frames to choose from including FDE,  Olive Drab,  and Pink, and one with an integrated laser,  and another with an integrated flashlight. Last time I checked Beretta had a sale going and the Flashlight grip was $50, and the basic grip frames were $18. Also this is a hammer fired gun with re-strike capability, hold open on an empty mag,  and an external lever to drop the slide after changing mags.

I will send pictures of my actual rifle by text if you're interested. It is like new mint condition. The new Primary Weapons Systems MK220 Precision Rifle in 6.5 Creedmor. It has a 20"" stainless barrel which is an optimal length for target/precision shooting. The stainless barrel is button rifled with a total of 25 produced. During testing PWS was able to keep the grouping well under MOA. The muzzle brake is a PRC style which aids in less felt recoil, allowing the shooter to get back on target sooner.The PWS runs a Long Stroke Piston, A significant improvement over standard AR-15 direct impingement systems, the PWS long-stroke piston system greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon, making it as reliable as the AK-47 it was designed after.Has 3 easy to change adjustable gas settings. The Nickel-Teflon[emoji768] coated enhanced piston bolt and bolt carrier are precision machined for perfect fit and functionality making the PWS mk2 rifle operating system efficient and effective.The lightweight, free-floated aluminum handguard features the almost universal KeyMod interface to eliminate unnecessary weight and allow for a wide range of accessory placement.This beautiful rifle comes with 2 Magpul Pmags, 37 rounds of 6.5 Hornady ammo and upgraded $100 stock.I'm mainly looking for a 16"" upper tier AR rifle with optic. BCM, Daniel Defense, Black Rain Ordnance, PWS, Noveske, etc. I may take less expensive AR rifles, but would need other guns, pistols, etc in place with it. Please text me offers at REDACTED.
