I will ship this upper fully insured For $30.00  so you will have peace of mind!  I have attached the Specs for the DD M4a1 upper from the Daniel Defense website below: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DANIEL DEFENSE M4A1 UPPER RECEIVER GROUP The Daniel Defense M4A1 Upper Receiver Group features the M4A1 Rail Interface System (RIS II), which has been in use by US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II Weapons System since 2005. This two-piece, free-floating rail system allows the mounting of devices like a M203 grenade launcher without influencing the barrels harmonics, eliminating problems like wandering point of impact that plagued other mounting designs. The two-piece design also allows for partial disassembly of the rail to aid in cleaning around barrel without completely removing the entire rail system. The weight of anything attached to the RISII rail system is fully supported by a sturdy bolt-up system, using 6 grade 8 bolts, leaving the barrel completely free floating for best possible accuracy and dependability. The M4A1 features a 14.5” Cold Hammer Forged M4 Profile barrel with a permanently attached Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor to meet the NFA required 16” length. Daniel Defense complete upper receiver groups come complete with bolt carrier group and charging handle."

The Star pistols when the safety is engaged moves the hammer out of alignment with the sear and blocks the slide from any movement, on the P938 it does the same but the slide can still be moved.The Star BKM comes in the original box with included cleaning kit, manual and 2 8 round magazines, for the price of $375,transfer to be done at Tigard Pawn 4 More or A Cut Above Pawn."

Gold trigger, Marlin inlaid bullseye, everything is as new condition. As I said, no handling marks or anything of the sort. The rifle is still in it's original wrapping. Everything in the pictures is included. The rifle will ship in two boxes, the original and then inside another box to protect the original. More pics upon request.

I also have a bianchi leather owb holster for it as well as a few boxes of defense ammo. 2 magazines included. Im asking $650 on this one.Next is my CZ P01 9MM Luger. Has all factory paperwork, (2) 14 round magazines, night sights, leather paddle holster, kydex serpa holster and a couple boxes of defense ammo. Not a single mark anywhere, in pristine condition. Its a brand new gun and im asking $575 for it.All prices are fairly firm but just talk to me and we can probably work something out. Must meet in public, have a valid ID and/or CHL, be legally able own the firearm, and willing to sign a bill of sale. Send me an email if interested and let me know if you want any more pictures or information. Thank you."

The rifle features a 24 inch heavy fluted barrel with a muzzle break, a one piece picitinny rail, digital camo AccuStock, AccuTrigger, and an all steel construction 10 round detachable box magazine by Accurate Mag Company.  In addition to that, I have a 6-18 Vortex Crossfire II scope with a level attached, a cheek riser, and an imitation Harris bipod.  I zeroed the rifle at a hundred yards last August, cleaned it, oiled it, and put it away.  The only adjustment I never made to it is on the magazine feed lip.  I never bothered to buy the adjustment tool because I feed the ammo by hand one round at a time when I shoot long range.  The mag feed lip probably needs to be opened up about 3 thousandths or so to get the cartridges to feed more smoothly.  The adjustment tool costs about 25 bucks.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale.  1000 dollars gets everything I listed in the ad.  900 gets you everything but the optic.  Not looking for trades at this time."

As expected of Glock pistols, it performed flawlessly.  Otherwise, it’s almost new and has never been carried so it has no wear marks or scratches.  It’s the ""s"" version (small frame) that uses a slightly reduced grip-size (front-to back only) to accommodate folks like me without huge hands. It's a slim double stack and it’s ideal for concealed carry.  You’ll especially like the Glock trigger...it’s a sweet shooter and very accurate.  This gun comes in its original factory box with all paperwork from the factory including speed-loader,  six 10-round factory mags, a nice Blackhawk OWB holster, ""30S"" slide plate cover (original Glock cover still installed), plus the Glock cleaning brush & rod. I've added a Talon grip (easily removed if you don't like them) and I'll also throw in 150 rounds of ammunition to get you started.  I prefer face-to-face transfer without shipping.  I’m in College Station so anywhere inside the Austin, Houston, DFW triangle is OK.  Let's meet half-way to minimize driving.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TX driver’s license or permit.  If I don’t respond to your email immediately, that just means I’m still at work and I’ll reply as soon as I get home.  My only trade interest is for a Glock-42 plus cash from you, or cash only so I can go buy something else.  Price is firm and Low-ball offers wil be respectfully ignored. If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.  Thanks!"

Someone in the past has removed the original finish and polished it. When I got it, it also had very old after-market sights installed. It also had a trigger shoe installed. I assume one of its owners from back in the day must have accurized it for competition or something?I have gone completely through it and repolished everything, including all internals. Replaced the springs, firing pin and a couple of other items but I have all of the original parts too. Took it out 2 weeks ago and shot approximately 100 or so rounds through it and it is a great shooter with very nice recoil and accurate as well. The mags (2 of them) should probably be replaced as they are not the best. I would stick with ball ammo as I tried a few brands of JHPs, etc. and it did not like them.It has the pearl-like grips that are in nice condition and fit well in my hand. If I keep it, I will probably mount it in a display box and hang it on the wall as it is a beautiful piece of history but will function if the need arises.Asking $1000.00I am only attempting to sell or trade it so that I can get something of nice quality in .45acp or 9mm with a threaded barrel that I can install a suppressor on.Feel free to text me at 281.seven 36-nine 678Please do not ask if it is available.

This is the real deal Russian Millitary Red dot sight For ak type rilfes. The PK-01 VS is one of the newest variants that has a longer battery life (uses AA) , weights less and is millitary grade tough. Has 8 brightness settings and 2 are for night vision compatibility. Uses the standard AKM sidemount rail to mount and you can adjust how tight it clamps to the rail. The optic sits low enough for the iron sights to co-witness on the bottem of the optic and you dont have to change your cheek weld. I had this on a WASR 10/63 to function test it and it works perfectly. I sold the rifle and am looking to sell this optic. I have one my Arsenal sam7 and love it. Im only selling because i dont need two. I can ship."
