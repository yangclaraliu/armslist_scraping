This gun had some corrosion on the barrel. I wanted to stop the corrosion and cheaply clean it up to stick in my truck. I took it apart, bead blasted most of it, painted the frame with Krylon paint (again cheaply) and reassembled it. Upon reassembly I noticed that I had lost a couple springs. Now pissed off, I just want to move the gun along. The springs can be purchased online or you could probably find them at that old guy who sells all the parts at the gun show. I just don't want to mess with it anymore. The parts missing are below. The gun worked perfectly prior to disassembly. Comes with the ammo and holster pictured also. I may be interested in trades also. Could use a nicer propane grill, a work bench, or ?? let me know.- Cylinder latch washer- Cylinder latch plunger- Cylinder latch spring- Firing pin spring"

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. “The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).” -CZ USA"

Elegant in Blue or Stainless, this small, single-action-only could be found under a cummerbund or a pair of bibs. It's what you have been asking for! No revealing lumps or lines makes concealed carry easier than that larger capacity gun you already have. Cool, neat and ready to go-the Taurus Slim will be your companion for a long time to come.Taurus Security System (TSS)s""Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Loaded Chamber Indicator“Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.”"

""The development and introduction of the Ruger LCP is in direct response to customer demand,"" said Ruger President, Stephen L. Sanetti. ""We have not been part of this market, but the growing number of states authorizing the licensed carry of pistols for personal protection by law-abiding citizens, and continued demand by law enforcement for quality back-up guns, cannot be ignored. The Ruger LCP is a .380 Auto pistol with superior ergonomic design and handsome styling. It incorporates state-of-the-art polymers, aircraft quality aluminum alloys and high-grade precision steel components engineered for strength and maximum weight savings."" This shape and size of the Ruger LCP is similar to a Kel-Tec 380, but unlike Kel Tec P3AT380s, the LCP offers legendary Ruger reliability and quality craftsmanship. The Ruger LCP is comfortable and affordable, making it a natural choice for a dependable back-up or personal defense carry pistol."

The rifle has a very durable factory finish that’s is first parkerized, and then painted over top the parkerization. The rifle has has a unique right side folding tubular stock with a western length of pull. This allows the stock to be folding without removing optics.the rifle also features a unique thumb actuated safety lever on the non ejection side of the rifle near the pistol grip. You can use the traditional safety lever as well.  This Sam comes with original black hand guards, as well as a beautiful set of laminated polish handguard a from a type 3.

539,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8200539,For Sale:  World War 2 Japanese Type 2 Paratrooper Rifle,"Clarksville, Nashville, Tennessee","$ 2,250","Listed On: Saturday, April 7, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For your consideration is this Japanese type 2 Paratrooper Rifle. The primary difference between this rifle and the Type 99 was the fact that it had a bolt that locked the two pieces into place rather than being made of a single piece. The purpose for this was to allow the Japanese paratroopers to carry them in a bag while they jumped and then piece it together on the ground. There were only 24000 of these types of rifles made throughout the duration of the war. Compare this to the millions of K98s, M1 Garands, Nagants, and even T99s and you can understand why it’s a unique bird. The rifle still has a full imperial Chrysanthemum as well as it’s original anti aircraft sites. Both halves Match however the bolt is ~50 numbers off from the remainder of the rifle. This is commonly seen on rifles brought back from the Pacific Campaigns as it was common procedures to confiscate the bolt while in transit back to the states. Once back they often just grabbed a random bolt assembly from a large group of readily available ones. This rifle displays well and will be a great addition to any advanced World War 2 firearm collection. I can send additional detailed pictures upon request. Will consider trades for an original WW2 era German Luger or other WW2 era firearms"

631,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8200631,For Sale:  World War 2 Japanese Type 2 Paratrooper Rifle,"Clarksville, Clarksville, Tennessee","$ 2,250","Listed On: Saturday, April 7, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For your consideration is this Japanese type 2 Paratrooper Rifle. The primary difference between this rifle and the Type 99 was the fact that it had a bolt that locked the two pieces into place rather than being made of a single piece. The purpose for this was to allow the Japanese paratroopers to carry them in a bag while they jumped and then piece it together on the ground. A large number of these were captured in 1944 after the Japanese paratroopers made a combat jump against US Forces in the Philippines. There were only 24000 of these types of rifles made throughout the duration of the war. Compare this to the millions of K98s, M1 Garands, Nagants, and even T99s and you can understand why it’s a unique bird. The rifle still has a full imperial Chrysanthemum as well as it’s original anti aircraft sites. Both halves Match however the bolt is ~50 numbers off from the remainder of the rifle. This is commonly seen on rifles brought back from the Pacific Campaigns as it was common procedures to confiscate the bolt while in transit back to the states. Once back they often just grabbed a random bolt assembly from a large group of readily available ones. This rifle displays well and will be a great addition to any advanced World War 2 firearm collection. I can send additional detailed pictures upon request. Will consider trades for an original WW2 era German Luger or other WW2 era firearms"
