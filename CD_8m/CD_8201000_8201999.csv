At least 25 years old. I got this new from a guy who was friends with Mr. Frizzel when the company was young. According to him, this is the first Persian Fighter made by MMHW, but I have no way to prove this, but do believe this to be true. This is a large heavy scary knife, the blade is ground from 1/4 "" steel. Wood grip. MMHW still makes a version of this under a different name. Buf they have a composite handle and a Kydex sheath. If you are into antique or early production hand made knives this is a good find.  Check the pictures and ask any question.The blade has never been used, I carried it in my car for several years, so the leather sheath and wood grip has some scratches.  16"" overall, 9"" blade whick was ground from 1/4"" steel. I think this knife could survive any kind of use.Price is firm, no trades, call or text (9-0ne-8) 38-F0UR-939-0ne Sand Springs QT is best for me, I might meet somewhere else depending on location and where I will be that day."

The rifle features a 24 inch heavy fluted barrel with a muzzle break, a one piece picitinny rail, digital camo AccuStock, AccuTrigger, and an all steel construction 10 round detachable box magazine by Accurate Mag Company.  In addition to that, I have a 6-18 Vortex Crossfire II scope with a level attached, a cheek riser, and an imitation Harris bipod.  I zeroed the rifle at a hundred yards last August, cleaned it, oiled it, and put it away.  The only adjustment I never made to it is on the magazine feed lip.  I never bothered to buy the adjustment tool because I feed the ammo by hand one round at a time when I shoot long range.  The mag feed lip probably needs to be opened up about 3 thousandths or so to get the cartridges to feed more smoothly.  The adjustment tool costs about 25 bucks.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale.  1000 dollars gets everything I listed in the ad.  900 gets you everything but the optic.  Not looking for trades at this time.  And thanks for your interest."
