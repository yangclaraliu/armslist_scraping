Pump action shot gun, fires12 guage catridges. By the time World War II began, stocks of shotguns were too small to support the mobilization and new orders were placed. The well regarded Winchester Model 12 trench and riot guns were again procured with a total of more than 80,000 guns ordered by the U.S. Government by 1945, more than any other combat shotgun of the time. Collectors will notice that there was a change in the ventilated heat shield during WW II from the WW I design of six rows of holes to only 4 rows starting in 1942. This example was manufactured in the the last block of guns made in 1943. A cartouche is present(GHD) but is faint. The four-hole heat shield appears to be a replacement."

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.  Arsenal's Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal's hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.  Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal's meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.  Summary: SAM7R-51 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, Arsenal, Inc.'s US made hammer forged and machined trigger that features a wider trigger grip for more comfort on the shooter's finger and a Bulgarian Warsaw Pact length buttstock, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

New is the 18"" Heavy Barrel - it's threaded and includes a thread cap. This may very well be the same barrel we will find on the R716 'Precision Marksman' when it's eventually released. Next, a TI-7 stock sits on the buffer tube with QD sockets on either side which you can use in combination with a 2 point sling (not included). This stock feels strong and sturdy - a fine addition to the rifle. Also welcomed is an upgraded latch on the charge handle to give a better grip, especially while wearing gloves. While on the subject of gloves, a Magpul Winter Trigger Guard sits nicely under the trigger. A raised letter 'G' is cast on the side of the new trigger, a hint that you will have something better than the standard Mil-Spec we've been accustomed to. In place of this basic unit Sig Sauer has installed a Geissele 2-Stage Trigger to complete the 3-Gun package."

It runs them all. The jacketed bullets are the most accurate and will hold a palm sized group  at 100 yards, the hard cast is the least accurate, but cheap and good enough for close range steel shooting. This thing hits hard, 1700 fps for a 135/155 grain, 1550 fps for 180 grain, and 1250 fps for a 200 grain. Perfect for a short range deer rifle or a truck gun.I have all the parts it came with plus a compensator and a green dot sight. I'll throw in a soft rifle case too. Other than a small amount of file work on the top rail (it's not picatinny) the rifle is how it came new, I just took all the extra rails and the stock sights off.I've shot lots of different types of ammo through it, so if you have questions, ask away.

It was built by the master of RIA super comps Larry Bell. It is a 2018 build and has not been shot by me yet. Twice by Larry to check action of the complete make over.Here is my beautiful Factory new Rock Island 1911A1 70 series Nickle in 38 super. It has received a 1911 upgrade package. The upgrades consist of the following. Trigger job to 3.25 pounds, action smoothing, fitted new black beaver tail grip safety, thumb safety, slide stop, trigger, mainspring housing, barrel bushing, recoil plug and a custom set of pachmayr laminated black wood grips. Also installed a green fiber optic front sight. The contrast in color makes this an amazing looking and very user friendly handgun. This gun is a pleasure to shoot. Comes with 1- 10rd mag, box and all the paper work. All new in the box. More has been done. That is just the highlights of the build.The total build was over $1400 in all the receipts. The action of this pistol is smooth and the trigger light to the touch. Needs final buff and coating set to be yours. Or run it as is either way it is gorgeous. Larry knows how picky I am and spared nothing to make sure it is perfect. It will come with factory barrel only. I do not sell my spec’d barrels. It has been fitted and adjusted to the pistol. Just got it back. LOVE THIS GUN! But I don’t need it after building and shooting my STI 38 Super. It will come with the factory ugly slabs and a custom pair also.I am a huge fan of Big Bore Lever actions in 45-70 but only in Stainless steel and any long range rifle with optics in FDE or Camo."

Parker started its grade numbering system at zero to denote their lowest grade made at that time. As Parker introduced the named grades they named Grade 0 guns R, S, T, U and VH. Except for the VH which describes all Grade 0 hammerless Parkers, the other names describe Grade 0 hammer guns based on various gauge and stock configurations. It had Decarbonized Steel barrels in the beginning and later used Plain Twist, Stub Twist or Plain Steel barrels. The early grade 0 guns were back action lifter guns and evolved into the front-action lifter. In 1899 the hammerless grade 0 , the VH, was introduced and it used Vulcan steel barrels. The grade 0 was the mainstay of Parker production and the fit and finish was excellent. They have little extra finish in the way of checkering or engraving and the wood used was plain, straight grain American walnut. The engraving was a simple border around the frame. The early guns had plain metal butt plates and later ones have hard rubber dogs head butt plates. The frame, forend iron and locks were casehardened."

Very similar to the H&R and Iver Johnson Arms and Cycle works revolvers of the period, these guns were marketed largely to women for home and self-defense. I’ve always wondered how many of these pistols were owned and carried for protection by women of that period and interestingly enough, this firearm was! The inside of the grips are engraved with a really cool name: “Abiliene Hans” as well as the name of the original owner, a “C.H. Haugh”. One can only wonder what the relationship between these two might have been? The pistol is in remarkeable shape for its age. The bore is in great shape and there are only two minor issues. 1) the front sight is missing but could easily be replaced by a competent gunsmith and 2) While the main spring is in great shape, for some reason it is firing double action only and likely needs a tune up. (I didn’t want to completely dissasemble the frame to try to fix it myself). While I suspect it is an easy fix, you could always just leave it and/or bob the hammer.The gun is perfectly functional, however you DO NOT want to fire modern .32 ammunition in it under any circumstances. You would need to find black powder cowboy action loads or load your own black powder cartridges for it. I’m including a leather holster and a super cool contemporary Royal Neighbors of America medal. The Royal Neighbors of America was an early 1900s womens fraternal organization that championed women’s rights during the suggerage era, a fitting companion to the gun.Given the owners’ signatures on the grips and that one of them was female which is pretty rare and cool from a historical standpoint, I’m asking $300 firm for the pistol."
