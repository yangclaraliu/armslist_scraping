I will not trade for firearm that cost $750 new unless your adding cash. The msrp on this 700 was over $925 so if you value your firearm at retail prices then so do I. A gun that has been shot is not a new gun, it's a used gun. Mine has 100 down range and I took almost $200 of the msrp. Please be realistic"

This is a VERY RARE, COLLECTIBLE handgun produced at the Tokyo Arsenal. It was one of only about 8,000 total made and was an improved version that quickly followed the Type A Grandpa Nambu. This example of mine is an all-matching numbers gun, with the exception of the magazine (typical, but the mag. is of the correct type). I believe that this gun wears it's original blued finish, the checkered wood grips are in great shape and the gun appears to function perfectly; though I have never personally fired it since owning it. Tangent sights. This Nambu came to me from the personal collection of a military arms collector and it shows by it's wonderful condition that it was properly cared-for during his time with it as custodian. I am a private collector, not a dealer. My intention is to let the current market among collectors and Nambu enthusiasts determine a fair price/value on this particularly presentable  example of the Papa Nambu. That said, I am very open to SINCERE and REASONABLE PURCHASE OFFERS from interested parties on this great and very desirable piece of sought-after Japanese military history. Yes, I would like to re-home this handgun, but am also not desperate to sell it. So please don't lowball me with unrealistic purchase offers.

The scope is not included.
This Carbine Directly descended from the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements for the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program, the SPR is built for high performance. 
The SPR variant is one of our most popular models.  Constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI™ raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance. The gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws.
The SPR with one-piece Monoforge™ upper design includes an integrated rail-base that is stronger and lighter. 
The investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset. 
The SPR uses manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that are 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter.  The increased surface area reduces heat – speeds up cooling.  Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity. 
You must be legal to own a firearm, be a Texas resident with a valid Texas Driver’s License photo.  A CHL is even better.
I can ship out of state to a FFL only, but can also ship within Texas. Will not do business with buyers outside USA, and local delivery only to the actual buyer with ID and cash on hand. No phantom courier pickup.

These were limited to only 3,500 pieces and this example is in beautiful condition. This particular Colt was reworked by Kings Custom into a King Super Target with vented rib, cockeyed hammer, and single action conversion. The whole pistol has been refinished nicely at some point but the front of the text on the barrel is a little thin and there are some finish marks on the receiver. This is a very unique pistol. The barrel is 6 inches long and has a great looking bore with crisp rifling. This should make a fantastic shooter. Has the target style wood grips. Overall this is a great looking and great working Colt. The finish is about 85% with some very faint thinning on the front of the barrel."
