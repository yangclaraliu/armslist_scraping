If you ever wanted to have an AR with everything you could ask for--2 magazines and weatherproof case included--this is the AR for you. I specifically built this rifle to be ready for anything. Time and consideration have gone into each and every piece and addition. There are a lot of people and salesmen out there that tell you that the most expensive stuff is always better and after careful research, I've found the right balance between quality and reliability. I have taken the time to think of everything so you don't have to. Below is the list of parts and additions:1:8 Mid-Length 16"" barrel for reduced recoil and reduced wear and tear12"" Free Float M-Lok rail for increased accuracy and space for attachments (lights/lasers)BCM vertical foregrip that allows for an angled grip style1-8x24mm Vortex Strike Eagle Scope (easily transition between 8x zoom to 4x--best of both worlds)(Shockproof, waterproof, fogproof)Diamondhead style 45 degree offset flip sights (in case your optic is zoomed and targets happen to approach you at a closer distance OR if for some reason the optic goes down)Raptor style ambi charging handleAmbidextrous safety selectorMAGPUL BAD lever (makes reloads SO much faster)ODIN Works XMR 3 extended magazine release (again faster reloads)Anti-Pivot trigger pin for added reliabilityExtended Takedown pins for ease (You'll know if you've had rifles before just how difficult these can be to manipulate)MAGPUL MOE polymer trigger guard for added room (and space if you want to use glovesERGO pistol grip with beaver tail (allows for high comfortable grip = more accurate shots)Hogue Adjustable stock (so comfortable and barely and wiggle--certainly much better than standard stocks on the market)2 Gen M3 PMAGS (so durable)My most favorite part is the BCG. It is from Sharps Rifle Company. It is their new Xtreme Performance Bolt Carrier Group. It is so smooth and I have tested it with a variety of ammunition and can vouch for its durability and dependability. Easily one of the best on the market. All of this comes inside a 5 latch double-lock All Weather Tactical rifle case that is water-tight and feels very rugged. Triple-layer foam on the inside keeps your baby free from damage during transit.Please contact me with questions and offers! Very willing to negotiate."

You can google and confirm that Derek does outstanding work. This is a beautiful rifle with HK black moly over parkerizing. Paddle mag release option installed. Currently has soft buffer installed. Round count since it was built is 100-200. The SEF trigger pack was converted to semi-auto only using the ATF friendly method of removing the front bottom portion of the trigger housing that would hold the auto-sear and welding in a bracket. The “F” marking was welded in, the “E” marking was converted to a “F”, and a selector stop added. This makes it a short throw from Safe to Fire. It did have a faux pin added (i.e., the heads of a push pin were glued to the lower to make it appear like an actual pinned lower), but one side has come off. If desired, it would be an easy fix to cut and glue a new one.Included Accessories: A3 collapsible stock; Brugger & Thomet Universal Scope Mount (overbuilt and solid); Specter gear 3-point sling, black; 17 magazines, some like new, some with wear and tear; sight adjustment screwdriver/tool; Spare parts (bolt, complete; bolt carrier; firing pin; stock pins); Polymer lower, never used, with extended safety; cheap, but functional, metal bipod for wide forearm. §922(r) ComplianceThe HK91/G3 has 17 parts under §922(r) (http://thegunwiki.com/Gunwiki/BuildG3VerifyCompliance).US Parts (7): Receiver, Trunnion, Trigger, Sear (technically a disconnect), Hammer, Pistol Grip, Cocking HandleForeign (9): Barrel, Flashhider, Bolt, Bolt Carrier, Trigger Housing, Handguard, Mag Bodies, Mag Followers, Mag FloorplatesUS or Foreign: The fixed buttstock is a US made part.
