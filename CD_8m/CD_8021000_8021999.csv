It shows a couple very minor signs of wear on the grips, but I think that adds to the classic feel of the gun. This revolver is 100% functional and has a mirror-like chrome/nickel finish. I've seen other postings offering these Mod. 13-2's for around $700.

I've got my brand new Bullseye that I'm absolutely in love with, but today I handled a Sig 1911 Extreme that I also really liked and would like to own one or something similar. My MAC hasn't been shot yet and it's practically new and gorgeous. I just really liked the lines of the sig as well. Not looking for anything else other than a sweet Sig 1911. Unless you've got a cool Colt 1911. Either way, I'll gladly keep my MAC if nothing peaks my interest, but I thought I'd see what's out there. I prefer firearms in good condition and won't accept anything abused as I take very good care of my stuff. Yes , they're tools, but they aren't cheap. My MAC ran me $1,150. Add another $40 for the Hogue black pearl grips and another $15 for the screws. Just looking to trade evenly. Keep in mind these hard chrome ones are hard to come by and aren't normally in stock anywhere."

The rifle was purchased around 2007-08 ($800) not long after they came out. This is the Generation 1 T3, which are getting a better rep than the new T3 models!  Absolutely great shooting rifle in a cartridge I really like. If you can handle a little kick the T3 paired with the 270 WSM is an extremely flat shooter and Tack driver, crisp 3.5 pound trigger. Used on a couple of deer hunts as an all-weather gun then I upgraded to a Sako and it has just served as a backup in the safe since. The Nikon scope does have one small scratch near the front just from handling at some point taking out or putting away in safe. Completely cosmetic does not affect function of scope at all and is covered with black touch up. Rifle also comes with 30 rounds of Federal Premium ballistic tip which go for about $2 per round or more in this caliber! Great deer hunting or out west (gun was originally for an elk trip that never happened). 480 obo, $695 or best offer with scope, or trade"

Also has a perfectly fit Pachmayr pad. The whole thing looks new with perfect bluing, you can't get a rifle this high in quality unless you spend over a thousand bucks!!! This round is the first small bore magnum and has as close to a perfect ballistical coefficient as you can get. It has a custom turned down bolt and safety. I want to trade it for an AR-15, all I care about is mil-spec and Im not a brand whore. I do want a bayonet lug on it, flash hider, and it has to be forged upper and lower. This is a very rare opportunity. Thank you and God Bless America!!!"
