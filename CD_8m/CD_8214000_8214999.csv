This is a beautiful gun, but I bought it on impulse. I'm just more of a semiautomatic gun guy. I have only shot 10 rounds or less of 38 special out of this firearm. I have not shot any 357 ammo out of it. I bought it brand new about a month or so ago. It's literally pretty much brand new. It will come with the original box, paperwork, manual and lock. I am also including 20 rounds of Liberty Ammunition Civil Defense 50 grain 357 self defense hollow point ammo (retails for $25+) and also 20 rounds of Sig Elite Performance 125 grain 357 magnum hollowpoint ammo as well (retails for $25+). You won't find another one this nice. This is a highly sought-after model and it shoots amazing.. The single action trigger pull is especially unbelievably nice . I'm sure it's even better with 357 ammo. Please text or call 828-962-536eight. I will also include a model 686 plus speed loader as well. (Not pictured)DO NOT LOW BALL OFFER! I WILL NOT ENTERTAIN ANY LOW BALL OFFERS SO DONT EVEN ASK. All laws apply. I must see concealed carry license or you must surrender a pistol purchase permit and we will fill out a bill of sale (which I will already have typed up) to complete the sale... If you have any questions feel free to ask. Thanks and have a great day. I am not really interested in any trades @ this moment unless you have something awesome. Right now I own about 30 pistols and  over 10 rifles....from all different manufacturers... and most people that want to trade want to trade me something that I already own or something I have no interest in. So unless it's something amazing I'd rather not trade and keep this as a cash-only transaction.Asking $750 or best offer. Please just save my time and yours and DO NOT low ball because it will be immediately rejected."

It is as simple as two allen screws to swap the magazine catches out, allowing you to use magazines for any of these three pistols (with more available). I installed the mag catch for each platform and shot one magazine to test performance, the rifle functioned flawlessly with a factory magazine from CZ-75, Beretta 92 and Smith 5906 for a total of 49 rounds through the gun. These guns are hard to find, hoping to trade but open to cash offers as well."

This is evidenced by a Serbian nationalist image carved in the stock. The image is a simplified Serbian Cross with what appear to be four ""C's (actually cyrillic ""S's). This is an acronym for ""Samo Sloga Srbina Spasava"" (Only Unity Saves the Serbs). That slogan and the corresponding symbol were used heavily during the Croatian and Bosnian wars, and are very commonly found carved into the stocks of AK and SKS pattern rifles from that time. Seeing that image on an M48 however, is much less common, and seems to imply that this is a rather special example. Additionally, the wear on the rifle is consistent with a rifle which has seen battle. The buttplate is pitted and rough, the finish is heavily but evenly worn, and the trigger group is exceptionally broken in.The bad: The bolt body on this rifle needs to be repaired or replaced. A slight imperfection in the geometry of the boltface lip prevents this rifle from properly seating cartridges. The rifle will not reliably cycle rounds. In order to restore this rifle to full function either: A) The current bolt face will need to be carefully reprofiled -OR- a new intermediate length bolt body will need to be fit to the rifle. Numrich currently sells stripped Belgian 1924 bolts, which can be fit to M48s. I may or may not have such a stripped bolt available with this rifle, inquire if interested.The mundane: Overall condition of the firearm would be ""Surplus Good"". I have detail stripped this rifle. Magazine body and trigger guard have cosmetic pitting. Barrel bands and rifle have minimal corrosion, but moderate to heavy finish wear. Stock has been knocked around a bit, but has no signficant dents, and absolutely no cracks. Stock and Reciever match. Bolt, Rear Sight, and mag plate do not match. Bore is very good.This rifle is specificallly designated as a Curio and Relic by the ATF (27 CFR 478.11), and therefor DOES NOT require a background check for private transfer in the State of Colroado (CRS 18-12-112 6(a)). As such, the buyer of this rifle will not be subject to any transfer fees. I will require a photo ID with proof of age (CO law requires 18+). Prospective buyers able to present a valid CHP or other proof of recent background check will be given preference."

The rifles wood has been refinished and looks amazing.The PSL has been in service in Romania since the 1970s and is widely sold on the world market. They are frequently encountered in Iraq where they appear to be quite popular. The simplicity of the rifle makes it ideal for soldiers to use and maintain. The action, being a variant of the AKM's, is extremely reliable despite lack of maintenance, and is particularly forgiving of sand and other debris. The scope's reticle pattern is easy to use and makes range estimation quick and reasonably accurate without any mathematical calculations necessary. With some simple instruction an average individual can be issued a PSL and successfully engage targets at ranges that far exceed the accurate capabilities of non-scoped assault rifles like the AKM, AK-47, etc. Accuracy varies greatly, however, between individual rifles to a greater extent to other rifles in its class, probably due to insufficient quality control during the manufacturing process. In the hands of a capable shooter and with quality ammunition such as 7N1 and 7N14 a PSL is capable of 1 Minute of angle (approximately 1"" at 100 yards) or less while the rifles on the other end of the spectrum are only capable of about 3 MOA. Complete with original military scope. These rifles are also known as a Romak-3 PSL and SSG-97 and are extremely accurate/reliable. This gun is the Romanian version (PSL). This is a great Rifle for many reasons. The PSL rifle's primary purpose is to be used by a platoon level designated marksman to engage targets at ranges beyond the capabilities of the standard issue AKM carbines. It is built around a stamped steel receiver similar to that of the RPK light machine gun, having a wider forward section enabling a strengthened, more substantial front trunnion. The PSL's operation is the same long stroke piston action of the Kalashnikov family of weapons. Its appearance is similar to the Dragunov sniper rifle yet not one single part interchanges between the rifles. It's semi-automatic and it uses very powerful 7.62x54R caliber ammo. which is a Very Large round. Bigger then .308 The PSL is chambered for the same venerable 7.62x54mmR (rimmed) cartridge as the Dragunov, and feeds from a ten-round detachable box magazine. The magazine used on the PSL differs from that of Dragunov models in that it is stamped with an X shaped pattern on the side, rather than the waffle style stamp found on the Russian and Chinese magazines. The magazines, though they are similar in shape and size, are not interchangeable between the Dragunov and PSL without modification. The size of this round (7.62x54R) and the long barrel of the rifle allow shooting out to 1000yards plus. These features make the perfect long range Riffle for any situation. Comes with Two 10 round mags and a cleaning kit and sling. This rifle comes complete with scope that has a built in range finder reticle which was originally lit with radioactive Tritium and is still going strong."

I'm selling them for my mom because she has recently become disabled and needs help with her bills.  I've done my research. I'm a coin collector myself, so I'm knowledgeable. I would love to keep them, but she needs the money and I don't have it to give her.  The majority of these collections are unfinished to due my grandmom passing away before she finished them. Everything listed here was purchased from the United States Commemorative Gallery. - Note: If you look up the US Commemorative Gallery and see all of the bad reviews, it is customer service-related, not the quality of the coins/products.Here's what we have:  (3) United States Commemorative Gallery Uncirculated Statehood Quarter collections with 19""x26"" display frames  - The first set has the first 39 out of 50 uncirculated Statehood Quarters plus 1 ""heads up"" quarter and the display frame has glass. This set is all Philadelphia mint and has an engraved brass plaque ""Philadelphia Mint"" - The second set has the first 37 uncirculated quarters plus 1 heads up quarter and has no glass in the frame - The third set has 35 uncirculated quarters plus 1 heads up quarter and has no glass in the frame  All of the framed displays are in their original shipping boxes and the encapsulated coins are in bags (not yet inserted into the displays)  I'm pricing them as fair as I can and on the lower end of what I see them going for online #1 set - $75.00 #2 set - $65.00 #3 set - $60.00  The next framed collection is full/complete: It is the Presidential Colorized Statehood Quarter Collection in a display frame with glass It is in new condition in it's original packaging Again, I'm pricing it very fairly at $80  The last framed piece is: The Presidential Dollar Collection in display frame with glass and original packaging. Only the first issued coins (Washington) (2007) are included. The empty frame alone sells for $40 I will keep it at that price including the first year coins - $40  Along the same theme as the framed displays, I have some other related sets:  - Uncirculated Statehood Quarter Portfolio/folder/album This set is still sold on the United States Commemorative Gallery's website for $89.70 My grandmom was only able to fill 37 out of 50 encapsulated quarters before she passed There is also minor damage to the lower corner of the center-folded area Because the set is not complete and the minor damage to the folder, I am pricing this at $30.00  - Next I have (2) 2005 10-coin uncirculated Statehood Quarter Year Set's These are housed in hinged display boxes with blank brass plates for the lids/covers These also use the encapsulated quarters like all of the previous displays/collections This set features the P & D mint quarters for each of the 5 states for 2005 These are still sold on the US Commemorative Gallery's website for $39.00 each I am pricing them very fairly at $15.00 each  - Lastly, I have (3) 2007 10-coin uncirculated Statehood Quarter Year set's Unfortunately, only the Montana P & D coins are included This set uses a one-piece clear plastic display holder instead of the individual capsules This set also uses the hinged display boxes with blank brass plates for the lids/covers Because these only have 2 out of 10 coins in each set, I'm pricing them at only $5.00 each.  I apologize for the picture quality. The Glare and shine made it difficult.I have many more pictures that I can't post here  I have everything listed above at a total of $395.00 I would prefer to keep it all together, but will separate if necessary.  If you would like to buy it all, I would sell it all as a package for $375.00 - and - I will include a bonus 14-coin Uncirculated set of Sacagawea golden dollar coins housed in a cherry wood display box (valued at a minimum of $35.00)  Be patient for a response as it is hard for me to check my emails while I'm at work. Please do not send me lowball offers. I am only selling these to help my disabled mom pay her bills - Every penny goes to her. Thank you for your consideration."
408,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8214408,For Sale:  Romanian PSL Dragunov sniper rifle,"San Antonio, Texas, United States","$ 1,550","Listed On: Tuesday, April 10, 2018",Rifles,Century International Arms                                                                                ,7.62x54R                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"A Parts kit built Romanian PSL Dragunov sniper rifle built on a Nodak Spud receiver. The rifles wood has been refinished and looks amazing.The PSL has been in service in Romania since the 1970s and is widely sold on the world market. They are frequently encountered in Iraq where they appear to be quite popular. The simplicity of the rifle makes it ideal for soldiers to use and maintain. The action, being a variant of the AKM's, is extremely reliable despite lack of maintenance, and is particularly forgiving of sand and other debris. The scope's reticle pattern is easy to use and makes range estimation quick and reasonably accurate without any mathematical calculations necessary. With some simple instruction an average individual can be issued a PSL and successfully engage targets at ranges that far exceed the accurate capabilities of non-scoped assault rifles like the AKM, AK-47, etc. Accuracy varies greatly, however, between individual rifles to a greater extent to other rifles in its class, probably due to insufficient quality control during the manufacturing process. In the hands of a capable shooter and with quality ammunition such as 7N1 and 7N14 a PSL is capable of 1 Minute of angle (approximately 1"" at 100 yards) or less while the rifles on the other end of the spectrum are only capable of about 3 MOA. Complete with original military scope. These rifles are also known as a Romak-3 PSL and SSG-97 and are extremely accurate/reliable. This gun is the Romanian version (PSL). This is a great Rifle for many reasons. The PSL rifle's primary purpose is to be used by a platoon level designated marksman to engage targets at ranges beyond the capabilities of the standard issue AKM carbines. It is built around a stamped steel receiver similar to that of the RPK light machine gun, having a wider forward section enabling a strengthened, more substantial front trunnion. The PSL's operation is the same long stroke piston action of the Kalashnikov family of weapons. Its appearance is similar to the Dragunov sniper rifle yet not one single part interchanges between the rifles. It's semi-automatic and it uses very powerful 7.62x54R caliber ammo. which is a Very Large round. Bigger then .308 The PSL is chambered for the same venerable 7.62x54mmR (rimmed) cartridge as the Dragunov, and feeds from a ten-round detachable box magazine. The magazine used on the PSL differs from that of Dragunov models in that it is stamped with an X shaped pattern on the side, rather than the waffle style stamp found on the Russian and Chinese magazines. The magazines, though they are similar in shape and size, are not interchangeable between the Dragunov and PSL without modification. The size of this round (7.62x54R) and the long barrel of the rifle allow shooting out to 1000yards plus. These features make the perfect long range Riffle for any situation. Comes with Two 10 round mags and a cleaning kit and sling. This rifle comes complete with scope that has a built in range finder reticle which was originally lit with radioactive Tritium and is still going strong."

Key features of this patented configuration include a low bore axis, 1911-style straight pull trigger, and lowered recoil spring placement for a pistol that does not require an off-axis firing technique and achieves a flatter shooting platform. The low bore axis is achieved with the striker-fired system and placing the barrel camming surfaces forward of the trigger guard. Along with the recoil spring placement in front of the trigger guard, it reduces torque on the wrist for better control. The linear 1911-style trigger minimizes disruptive trigger finger movement during the firing sequence to maintain greater control and more consistent follow-up shots. The lack of a hammer spring allows a more slimline and higher grip on the pistol giving the shooter more control while diminishing felt recoil. Note: Due to the low bore axis, the H9 is not compatible with other magazine designs. The H9 has an all-steel frame with an accessory rail, integral trigger safety, ambidextrous slide release, and a reversible magazine release. The H9 also features a G10 Hogue lower backstrap, G10 VZ interchangeable grip panels, Trijicon HD front sight with a black serrated rear sight, and a stealthy black finish. and a stealthy black finish.

It comes with 10 large capacity mags (possibly more if I can find them). The Galil is a milled steel receiver that comes with a heavy folding metal stock, removeable muzzle break, threaded barrel and has a matte black finish. These guns are also famous for having a far better quality than your typical AK series rifle on the market. They have tighter tolerances, better fitment, and shoot a much tighter group than your run of the mill AK. The Galil is considered the AK of the Israeli world and is known worldwide. It not only comes with the typical AK style bar safety on the right side of the receiver, but also has a thumb safety on the left hand side of the receiver as well. It is a milled steel receiver, not stamped like your typical AK47 or forged like your average AR15. Because of this, it is considered one of the most durable battle proven rifles on the market.If you have never fired a Galil before, you will find it to be one of the smoothest firing/recoiling piston systems around. This isnt like shooting an AK47, where there is that harsh upper left hand recoil, but more of a manageable smooth recoil that allows you to execute fast double taps with very little muzzle rise. Cash is king as with all things, but I am VERY open to trades of any sort for the most part. I am primarily looking for firearms, ammo, optics trades. I will be upfront and say I am NOT looking for lawnmowers, or sound systems, or extremely cheap firearms, so please do not waste yours or my time. I will answer all emails, if anything, to say no thank you for your offer, but I do appreciate you taking the time to make me an offer. IF YOU ARE EMAILING ME AN TRADE OFFER, PLEASE DO ME THE COURTESY AND INCLUDE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION AS WELL AS PHOTOS OF WHAT YOU ARE WANTING TO POSSIBLY TRADE. IF YOU WERE THE ONE POSTING AN AD, IM SURE YOU WOULD WANT THESE AS WELL. THIS ALSO HELPS ME DECIDE IF A TRADE IS SOMETHING I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN."

I know it’s a pain in the ass, but it’s the only way I’ll do it. I purchased this Canik 9MM brand new about 5-6 months ago and have only shot about 1,000 rounds tops through this gun. And all rounds shot out of this pistol, not one jam or failure to feed at all. I purchased the Vortex Red Dot brand new as well separate from the pistol and sited it in myself, it could be fine tuned a little bit with a vice to hold the pistol but it’s pretty accurate now. I am also one of those guys that cleans his guns after every shoot so even in its short life it’s been well taken care of, the gun still looks brand spanking new. This gun is an awesome gun and fun to shoot, and I really don’t want to get rid of it, but I am in need of some quick cash so I must. Someone else is on here selling the same exact gun and Red Dot with only two 20 round magazines for $699.00 so I am going to say I will take $600.00 for this pistol and everything that comes with it. Will consider any reasonable trades. Currently looking for a “Ruger 300 Winchester Magnum” or a “1911 style pistol”. Please feel free to call or text me (Mike) at REDACTED if you are interested in this pistol, have any questions or want me to send you more pictures.  Thank You!"

This is a great shooter in the 454 Casull caliber and 45LC.  Has both 1"" and 30mm Factory rings; currently setup with 30mm rings with a 2-7 scope (non name brand) but has held up well and is bright and clear.  The .454 is a powerful round, one of the original hand cannons out there - aprox twice the power of a 44 mag!  This a great hunting or long rang handgun with incredible stopping power capable of hunting any game in mennesota!  I am the original owner, has been well maintained, no rust or major issues.  Couple of nicks and slight discoloration on cylinder near front.  Comes with original factory hard  box and paperwork along with an extra larger hard case to accomodate pistol with scope.
Not interested in shipping this will be face to face only cash sale.  Buyer MUST have permit to purchase, carry permit and MN DL; no exceptions.  Will complete bill of sale at time of transaction.
