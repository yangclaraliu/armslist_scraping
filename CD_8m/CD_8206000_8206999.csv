Was a new barrel when installed and you could say still new since the rifle has not been shot since the rebarrel.The bolt was also modified with a well done bent bolt handle. So, 200 for the rifle, 70 for the bolt handle, 130 for the barrel, 500 for the barrel install and associated work. I never planned on getting that money back out of it so that is good news for you. As a project gun goes I think this is the easiest completion job you could get and have something not too manny people have. I would suggest a Timney trigger, new stock, and a posp scope.

806,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8206806,For Sale:  HK VP9SK,"Kokomo, Kokomo, Indiana",$ 660,"Listed On: Sunday, May 6, 2018",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"NIGHT SIGHTS, 2 EXTENDED & ONE FLAT BASE 10 ROUND MAGAZINESThe highly-rated HK VP precision strike trigger is also found on the VPSK. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The net result is trigger quality unmatched in production striker fired pistols. A small-scale interpretation of the completely adjustable VP grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the compact grip frame of the VP9SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit any individual user and is a feature found only on Heckler & Koch handguns. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. The VPSK has the features of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.HK’s patented charging supports, found on full size VP pistols, are also present on the VPSK. The charging supports are simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. VPSK pistols can use a variety of proven HK magazines, including compact double stack 10-round and 13-round with either flat or extended floorplates for a more ergonomic grip. The VPSK can also use the same high capacity 15-round magazine used by the full size VP and P30 handguns. Magazine sleeves that replicate the grip profile of the VP handgun are also available. VPSK pistols have an abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. VPSK pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component life span. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures a long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VPSK’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. Despite their small size, VPSK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. VPSK models are currently available in 9 mm. VPSK pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. A high quality and well-engineered design, the VP9SK possesses all the features and long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And like full size VP pistols, the VP9SK is value priced at $719 (MSRP)."

Easy to install and use. Very durable. Comparable cost to a Maxim PDW stock but in a lighter, slimmer, more compact design. Extending the stock is easier one handed than the Maxim.Heavy Buffer helps manage recoil/cycling issues for over-gassed rifles without an adjustable gas block. Functions great with an adjustable gas block as well.From the manufacturer:Our Optimus PDW stock is designed to address several deficiencies in the general PDW design. First, we have built the stock on a single guide rod thereby eliminating the cumbersome dual guide rod standard. The Optimus affords the shooter a proper cheek weld, a feature many PDW stocks lack. The Optimus also allows users to use their existing BCG and is compatible with high pressure and anti-tilt designs. Next, a solid tungsten heavy buffer and high performance flat wire spring result in maximum performance for a range of rifle styles including carbine and short barrel rifles and both suppressed or unsuppressed. Not only does the Optimus shorten the overall length of the rifle, but the innovative guide rod ring also incorporates a dual QD end plate to give users a well-balanced point of attachment for a QD single point QD-Sling (sold separately).

And it comes in a hand-matched combo.This is a San Tan Tactical billet receiver (logo delete option) that is rock solid and has all the STT ambi controls that you could need. Left or right handed, you're covered. Comes with mag and bolt release hardware (please look, it's pretty cool) standard.I use these on all my builds now because I have not found any better options out there.In their own words, this is how the folks of STT describe the lower:
""This is the most advanced yet simple AR lower receiver ever made!
We designed this lower receiver out of necessity and a desire to have a true ambidextrous AR-15 M4 platform. Allowing it to accommodate any and all shooters without the need to add countless costly add-ons. Whether you are a right or left handed shooter, or forced to shoot with your off hand, the STT-15 has you covered! STT-15 is designed specifically for situations in which there's no room for error and you must use your rifle to take that shot!
We machine the STT-15 directly from a billet of 7075-T651 aerospace grade American aluminum on our brand new Haas CNC machinery. This allows us to hold ultra-tight tolerances and make sure that the final product is exactly as designed. The finished receiver is then finished in Mil-Spec, MIL-A-8625 Type III hard anodizing.
Even though this is a tool to some it is a show stopper to others! The final finish is every bit as important as the features and materials the lower consist of! The STT-15 is everything you have come to expect from a San Tan Tactical, and then some. The STT-15 is your final answer in the AR M4 firearms platform!"""
