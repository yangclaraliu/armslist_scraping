It is a breeze to feild strip and clean. It would also be a good gun for newcomers because of the low recoil and would be great as a concealed carry piece. its an Early 1990’s copy of a Beretta of similar style. Purchased it USED and has been out wih me on almost every range day. it is heavier for a .380.  It’s well made, shoots great since it’s fairly heavy. No box or papers. however will add in IWB holster and a trigger lock for safe storage. (also as it was bought used, i have found that sometimes the hammer does not engage the primer on the first shot. but after re-engaging the hammer into recocked position it will engage and fire no problem.)"

The shotgun handles these magnum rounds like a dream with a very comfortable, shock-absorbing pad. This shotgun was NOT part of the recalled lot from Remington and can be verified via serial number. The armor-lokt coating on the shotgun has stayed in great condition and truly does protect against all elements. Dove season will be here for you know it, and this is a great gun that deserves to be used by someone instead of just sitting in my safe! If the ad is up, it's still available.
