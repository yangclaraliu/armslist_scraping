All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro 9 design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro 9 includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory. Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro 9 pistols are the right choice for many applications.

Comes with original box, three mags, OWB holster, and two full mags of hollow point rounds. Any questions feel free to call or text me at 423-557-5six89 ask for jacob. Thanks for looking."

I wouldn’t say more than 100 rounds have gone through the barrel. It’s a fun and great fun, low recoil. I am NOT in a hurry to get rid of it. Looking at all trade offers! Cash price looking at $550 obo. What particularly interests me: AR pistols, AR Uppers-fully assembled or full kits. Shotguns with pistol grip, revolvers, optics. That’s all I can think of right now. Im will to also add some cash to any trades to equal out the values. Just ask, worst I can say is no.

This gorgeous Colt New Frontier with nickel finish was manufactured in 1979 as number 912 of a planned edition of only 3,000 pieces. It is not clear how many of the planned 3000 Commemoratives were manufactured or delivered. This pristine example carries the markings and features that were standard for the limited edition with the barrel stamped “NED BUNTLINE COMMEMORATIVE”, the standard one line Colt Manufacturing address line, and “COLT NEW FRONTIER S.A.A. .45”. The left side of the frame is stamped with the standard Colt patent dates in two lines followed by the rampant Colt logo. The serial number, NB0912, is stamped on the frame forward of the front end of the trigger guard. The front sight is a tall, ramped single blade and the rear sight is adjustable. It comes complete with a maroon velvet lined walnut presentation case with glass dust cover, locking display drawer, multiple shipping boxes hand numbered to the revolver, six nickel plated dummy display rounds with 45 Colt headstamps, a silver finished Ned Buntline commemorative plaque and brass key. This is a factory new Ned Buntline Commemorative with all accessories. The revolver and the case are in excellent condition, preserved for you since 1979. Any handling marks are minimal. The grips have crisp checkering. The case is excellent. The revolver appears to be excellent mechanically but we did not cycle the action in order to preserve the cylinder finish. A classy Colt with a very showy appearance. SN: NB0912"

I find the MIL system much easier to measure distance and target size with, in addition to making adjustments. I have the ballistics cards for this rifle in 168grn SMK and 175grn SMK. EX: 400 yards, 2.4MILS low, click the elevation dial to 2.4 (24 clicks) and you are on target. Pretty simple once you understand the mathematical equation.The Weaver Tactical line is extremely clear, robust, and durable. This is my second one, my first was the 4-20x50. This glass is as clear as ANY Leupold or Nightforce I have ever used, has reset to zero, MIL/MIL as far as adjustments and reticle, illuminated center crosshairs, etc. I paid $1100 for it, and in my opinion it should cost way more than it does. I believe this is due to Weaver's lack of marketing of this product. It has every single feature the $1500-2000 dollar scopes have for far less money. The Rifle: As I stated, this rifle is made by a company out of Florida called tacticalrifles.net. I have included their link and a review of this rifle that explains the manufacturing process and all of the upgraded parts this rifle has. It is guaranteed by the manufacturer to shoot 1/2 MOA, and I can tell you from my experience with it that it hasn't ever shot that bad. Last Sunday I set a 3inch AR500 steel gong out at 400 yards. Right out of the truck, adjustments made from 100yd ZERO, off the bipod shoot and hit! I repeated that during the day while helping others sight their rifles in, with the final shot being a golf ball at 400yds. Same results. Using factory 175grn SMK's. This rifle is not a joke, a handmade backyard toy, or a clone. I have provided pictures of it, as well as the casting from the manufacturer in the barrel. I will NOT entertain stupid offers or comments. I am aware of someone stating that TR's stuff is no good, and that someone got sued and in the end it was proven he was misleading other consumers for another reason.Do your research. Read the review I posted. Look on the forums. You will find that this rifle is everything I am saying it is."

It shortens and lightens the pull and shortens the reset. Stock springs are in them to keep reliability so the pull isn't a hair trigger,  just dropped it by a pound or so.     One is a mod 2 bi-tone 5"" tactical with heavier solid steel guide rod,  heavy duty prp ejector, stronger rolled striker pin and a titanium firing pin.    The other is an xd mod 2 sub compact 3"" with tritium steel night sights,  rolled striker pin, prp trigger and ejector.     Both have factory springs to keep reliability up, they have stayed well oiled and clean,  and both have been 100% flawless. The 5"" comes with (2)10 round mags and (2)16 round,  the sub compact comes with (1)16 rnd and (3)13 rnd mags and an inside the waistband holster. The mag extention allows all large cap mags to fit in the SC. Both guns come with hard box, locks, docs. Also i still have the factory parts if you want them.  I have too many striker fire guns and would like to buy a few other things.  Open to trades like reloading stuff, rifles, sigs, particularly looking for Romanian AKs right now, or other things.

Remington sells the rifle, for the intended purpose of varmint hunting. This one is the .243 Winchester. The barrel has never seen a round go through it. I also modified the original stock to take the Magpul dropbox conversion so the hard part is already done and it fits and works perfectly. The barrel has been threaded by Brux Barrels and re-installed to insure perfect headspacing. It has a flash supressor installed but can be removed if you prefer a different style or sound supressor for direct thread. Also something else you don't have to do making this better than the typical ""out of the box"" version. It can come with the scope and bipod and sling if you want it in it's current configuration for the right price. The threading was $80 and the drop box conversion w mag wasn't cheap either. It has had the recalled trigger already exchanged and the warranty repair done.The Remington 700 SPS Varmint models all share a few factory characteristics: They are 46 1/2 inches long, 26 inches from the barrel, which is carbon steel with a matte blue finish. The length of pull is 13 3/8, the drop comb is 1 1/8 inches. The drop heel is 1 3/8. Each can be conveniently mounted to a sling or bipod.The 243 Winchester twist is 9 1/8.So why has this rifle had so much work done and never fired? Because I bought it to use for this past deer season, did the work, was ready to go, got ill and was told I have Leukemia and had no immune system and should not go hunting. So this perfectly set up rifle still sits unused. If you want it for $575 with no scope or bipod or sling but still w muzzle break and dropbox conversion, we can do that. If you want it as it sits I'd like $700. Still losing $ but what can ya do? Will ship to FFL. Prefer paypal."

Both of us shot 2 years on the Gateway Claybusters youth shooters trap team. He put a Todd Nelson ""The Country Gentleman"" $600 fully adjustable custom stock on it. He was well over 6 foot and it was fitted to him. I'm 5' 9"" and it fits me fine. Even Todd said it does when he came into town. Since I've had it I've cleaned it after every use and stored it with a dehumidifier. Comes with everything it did from Browning: multiple Hi-Viz sights, 3 Briley invector DS chokes, the owner before me bought another two extended Full and I-Mod which I use, 3 interchangable gold plated and textured triggers, the manual and barrel locks. I also got a few other things in there you can have with it like a microfiber towel I use to wipe off excess choke tube lube, a preimpregnated silicone cloth to wipe down the outside of the barrel before putting it away, a choke wrench, and a dehumidifier pack in the case. Taken care of with extreme care. Only selling because I can't afford ammo to keep shooting on the team with my friends anymore. This is the perfect shotgun to buy it you are getting into trap, sporting clays, skeet, or really any other type of similar game. This is by far the best shotgun I've ever shot, it's so balanced has very little recoil. It's really good looking too.Specifics: 2-3/4"" chamber, 32"" barrel, 8lbs 10ozMay trade for semi auto 12g and cash or Savage Axis + cash or an F1 Firemarms AR-15For any more information or questions please email me.
