If you think that my rifle is to expensive than please go to Gun Broker, there you will find SVT-40’s for about $1700 which you can pay to have shipped to a store, and then you can pay the stores fee to hold the firearm and tax on the rifle.

It is chambered for 2.75"", 3"", and 3.5"" shells. The camo is Mossy Oak Infinity. I bought this shotgun new and have never fired it as there are very few turkeys on my property and I have a different deer rifle.

I am not looking to trade. The buyer should plan to pick up in the Desloge, Park Hills, or Farmington area because I do not make it to St. Louis very often. I will not sell to a non-missour resident, a felon, or a person under 18. I will provide a bill of sale for the buyer.
