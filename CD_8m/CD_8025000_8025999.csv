Featuring a blunted blade tip to avoid piercing skin or other sensitive materials. When the U.S. Navy needed a rescue knife they came directly to us. The SARK knife was designed specifically for emergency use situations where safety and effectiveness are equally important. This is an official issue rescue knife to the elite U.S. Navy Rescue Teams. It was designed according to their parameters, field tested in actual emergency conditions, and chosen just as you see it here. Built with a safety tip, curved blade, and Dragon’s Teeth™ serrations, it is bulldog strong, razor sharp, and also features the patented “wave shaped feature” for lightening fast opening. This knife is the first hard-use knife ever built for EMT, Paramedic and Rescue use. It is what these professionals needed and they chose Emerson to design and build it. It is an essential tool for anyone who travels off the beaten path."

Featuring a blunted blade tip to avoid piercing skin or other sensitive materials. When the U.S. Navy needed a rescue knife they came directly to us. The SARK knife was designed specifically for emergency use situations where safety and effectiveness are equally important. This is an official issue rescue knife to the elite U.S. Navy Rescue Teams. It was designed according to their parameters, field tested in actual emergency conditions, and chosen just as you see it here. Built with a safety tip, curved blade, and Dragon’s Teeth™ serrations, it is bulldog strong, razor sharp, and also features the patented “wave shaped feature” for lightening fast opening. This knife is the first hard-use knife ever built for EMT, Paramedic and Rescue use. It is what these professionals needed and they chose Emerson to design and build it. It is an essential tool for anyone who travels off the beaten path."

Appears to be hunted or shot very little. Super clean bore and action is extremely tight (of course all Model 12's have an adjustment screw that tightens action/barrel lug). I had my local gunsmith give it a once over and he said it looked great. Made sometime in the 50's and everything is original. He priced the gun in the 800$ - 1000$ range due to the upgraded wood with the ""figure"" and the overall great shape of the bluing and wood. I siply have no use for it and it has been in my safe since I received it. My gunsmith said he would ask at least 800$ for it, but I am getting rid of everything I don't shoot, so here is your chance at a piece of history that you can shoot. A genuine Winchester Model 12 in 12 gauge, 2.75"" chamber, 28"" full choke shotgun that you can afford to show off and shoot at the skeet range or in the dove fields.

It comes with a hard plastic lockable case and 2 magazines. One 17 rnd and one 19 rnd extended. This is an awesome copy of a cz-75 but has an alloy frame which makes it quite a bit lighter. The slide rides inside the frame allowing for a more solid lockup and lower bore axis.Its probably seen 250-300 rnds in its lifetime. Has a little bit of finish wear on the outside of the barrel and a crack in the factory grip which has been repaired but could easily take cz-75 grips with a little fitment. The barrels on tristars/canicks are chrome lined and can handle +p rounds no problem. It has been 100% reliable not one fte or ftf the whole time. Its taken several different brands and loadings and functions flawlessly.These pistols will take cz-75 magazines and they function as they should so magazines shouldn't be a problem. I just use the mec-gar ones that they come with but tried my actual cz-75 mags in it with no problem. The mec-gar mags are pretty cheap around $20 or so. I have always had good experience with them.
