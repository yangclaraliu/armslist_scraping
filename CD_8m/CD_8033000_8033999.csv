Neat collectible revolver from the early 1900’s! $99 In 1871 Sullivan Forehand and Henry C. Wadsworth founded Forehand & Wadsworth from the remnants of Ethan Allen & Company after the death of their father-in-law, Ethan Allen.Wadsworth sold his share of the company to Forehand in 1890 in order to retire and the company was rebranded as Forehand Arms.The company was involved with a patent infringement lawsuit on behalf of one of their employees, John C. Howe, against the United States government. Howe had patented an ammunition cartridge in 1864 and the US government infringed upon this design in 1868 with the ""Cup Anvil Cartridge"" until the expiration of Howe's patent in 1881. Howe asked Forehand to bring a lawsuit against the government and eight years later the company won the suit on behalf of Howe with a judgement of $66,000. The lawsuit was not paid until after Howe's death and a few weeks before the death of Forehand in 1898. Forehand's sons ran the business for several years following the death of their father, but sold it in 1902 to Hopkins & Allen, who had been making Forehand Arms' revolvers under contract.The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"

It is a 14.5 inch AR with a pinned and welded flash hider from Seekins Precision. This gun has been fired a total of 5 times. It's a little embarrassing that it's only been shot that many times to be honest with you - Just a bone-headed matter of not tightening the gas block properly and waiting to find out until I got to the range. Since then, I haven't had the time to fire it at all and it has just sat in the safe collecting dust. I'd like to see someone else really enjoy it.For those of you not familiar with VSeven - it's kind of like the Gucci of rifles in a way - they make some of the finest parts in the industry and make them extremely lightweight - often times out of materials like titanium or lightened billet aluminum. The barrel comes from the wonderful folks over at JP Rifles and is their pencil profile 14.5 inch barrel with their fin-thing around it (shown in the picture without the handguard). I'm honestly not even sure what the fin thing does but it looks badass and supposedly keeps you from melting your hand on the forend, and also keeps such a small profile barrel more rigid while staying lightweight. Not sure - haven't shot it enough to see if that is indeed true. The parts in this build include:- VSeven enlightened billet lower and upper receiver- CMC 3.5 pound flat-faced trigger- V Seven Titanium BCG- AXTS Raptor Charging Handle- Battle Arms Development club foot stock thing- Tactical Paracord I weaved myself to make the Battle Arms stock more snag-free. I won't be offended if you just cut it off- VSeven Enlightened 13.5 inch handguard M-Lok- JP Rifles Pencil Profile 14.5 inch barrel with the fin thing- Battle Arms Development ultra-light gas block- Pinned and welded Seekins Precision Flash Hider to bring to the NFA-legal 16+inches- Magpul SL Pistol GripIf you have any questions let me know. Not really your average ""Starter Rifle"" unless you're the type of dude who drove a Mercedes in High School - which is cool too because Merc's are badass. Just sayin'Thanks for looking!"

This means faster target acquisition, faster target transition and improved accuracy at both short and long range, making these pistols ideal for competitive shooting, target shooting and concealed carry. Polymer grips feature the modular backstrap design, which allows for easily interchanging backstraps, creating a custom grip to fit any hand size. Polymer frame sports Gen4 rough, textured technology to provide a phenomenal grip. Dual-recoil spring assembly lessens recoil and increases the pistol's durability.

None of the reliability issues reported with a few early serial number 5.56 Arsenals, this is a BF serial number prefix which was made after these were worked out (all sources suggest early BE prefixes and before are potential lemons).Just added: Brand new Gen 3 TWS Dogleg Rail (yet to fire the rifle with it!), and an EOtech 512 holographic sight w box in excellent working condition (besides a single small scratch near the battery release lever). Would possibly sell or trade AK without optic, but ideally only only in a trade for something to put it on.Trades Considered:1.

Auto loads with no problem  WITH CCI copper round nose bullets. Shoots every round every time. Sights are tight and work perfectly. Crisp trigger. This one has been in the family (not in my hands much) since it was new. The front piece was given to a guy to repair years ago and none of us know who that was. I've seen that piece for sale or a parts gun for sale with that piece. Make reasonable offer for a working 22cal 151."

Identification is believed to be manufactured in Germany, originally assembled from J.P. Sauer and Sohn in Suhl. It was either a S/147 1937 or 147 1938 according to my sources and sporterized into a Guild-like rifle by a competent gunsmith (german). Awesome piece of history. Condition is good to very good, as shown by the pictures. No rust or pitting anywhere at all, well taken care of. The bore is good, headspacing is perfect (gunsmith confirmed when I had purchased it). The rifle is mostly matching, minus the safety and floorplate/trigger guard. This Mauser also comes with German type claw mount bases, a nice wood sporter stock with raised stock for cheek weld, and dialed in iron sights. After the couple hundred rounds I have fired through this rifle over my 5 years of ownership I can say this is a very accurate rifle for its age, perfect loading/extraction/bolt manipulation. Stood the test of time excellently.Specs-Caliber:8x57 JS, .323 boreCapacity: 5+1Overall length: 44 inchesBarrell length: 23 inchesWeight: about 6 1/2 poundsIncluded in the sale is 160 brand new cartridges of 8mm Mauser soft point ammunition (8 boxes of 20) from Pvri Partizan. I found this ammo to be the most accurate and powerful loading compared to the downgraded American stuff. Also included are 2 used snap caps to use with the rifle (8mm), a canvas/leather soft rifle case, and if desired a large ziplock bag of once used 8mm mauser brass for reloading. **TRADING**: I am looking for bolt action .308 winchester rifles with iron sights, specifically for used Savage 11/111 Hog Hunter+cash or a Ruger M77 Hawkeye all weather stainless in a straight trade. Will consider Savage 16, or other 308 bolt actionMy location is Santa Cruz, CA, near San Jose.

Swedish Mauser 6.5x55. This is all matching and in amazing condition. NOT IMPORT MARKED . The rifle is all original, no refinishing, no force match parts etc, alot of cosmoline from the pre 1968 importation. The metal is at least 95%+ and the wood 90%+ only because of obvious storage wear. The action and interior are still extremely bright polished, the bolt, action and barrel are packed with grease still. I have lots of pictures if you want please ask. The only thing this rifle doesn’t have is the correct cleaning rod, but nearly all are missing, mismatched, or were non numbered that someone had the correct numbers punched. Stock disc is 0 and 1. Rifle will only go up in value. $650 is rock bottom cash price, trade value is higher"

Think he had three grades at the time and this was a mid-range walnut example.  It definitely saw active service!  I steamed the dents out as good as I could, and removed a ton of cosmoline.  I then applied a few coats of linseed oil -definitely a lot of character in that wood!  There were no markings present, but I can’t recall if there were any underneath the buttpad.  All the hardware is original, everything is as it came from Fred’s.  You will notice some brass pin repairs made by the army, above the trigger well.  I’ve had this on and off my M1A over the years, as I do like shooting with the pistol grip.  Thanks for your interest, hope you will like the stock enough to build your own M14A1 Clone!
