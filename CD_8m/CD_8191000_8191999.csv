I bought this girl brand new about two months ago. I have put exactly two mags through it. It’s great, shoots flawlessly and functions as it should. I’m only getting rid of it because it’s a bit too short for my liking and I’m looking to go another direction. She has been cleaned after the 2 range trips she’s been to. Hell, she’s even been cleaned just because I felt like it. She was intended to be my “bump in the night” security but I have something else for that job now. Everything is factory except for the ambi fire selector and forward angled grip. She has the velocity drop in 3lb trigger option, mft pistol grip, a.r.m.s front and rear pop up sights, utg pro slim keymod handguard, kak flash can, also the kak pistol blade and buffer assembly. The buffer itself has notches all the way down it so your brace doesn’t go all loopy on ya. It stays where you put it. She’s sighted in at 100 yards right now and stays on target. You can check it out on their website for comparison. I’m open to any trade offers. Asking price is negotiable as well. The worst I could say is no, so let them fly. I’m not in any rush to get rid of her, so please review the webpage and my description and if there is a trade involved don’t try to short change me. I know how selling and buying works. I will not ask retail for her, but I’m not going to just give her away either. Thanks for checking out my post! also I know the manufacturer is not correct for the posting category"

All numbers are matching and the rifle is basically pristine as if stored after refinishing by the arsenal in the Second World War except for three flaws. The stock has been chopped up, there is wear on the finish of the barrel on the front end where it should be covered by a hand guard, and finally there are tiny little scratches that are barely even visable on the reciever by a tiny screw. These three flaws make me believe that this rifle is worth 349.99 and not 799+. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. Remember this rifle is 100 years old and those in condition like this one are hard to come by and as such, there are no returns or exchanges."
