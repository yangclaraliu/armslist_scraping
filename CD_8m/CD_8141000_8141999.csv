Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game. Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear. When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic with a protective coating for complete corrosion resistance. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.” –Henry USA   This firearm has been kept in good condition with only minor blemishes on the finish, and is fully operational."

According to the Firearms History on the company’s website – NOTE – If you haven’t discovered these pages, I highly recommend them – this particular piece was manufactured from 1948 through 1970, during which time approximately 757,000 were made. ""[This rifle] is a single-shot bolt action of .22 rimfire, capable of handling Shorts, Longs, and Long Rifle rounds. Here, and at great risk of offending fans of the piece, I’ll say the M514 might best be described as extremely basic; however, that was Remington’s intent, as the rifle was brought into play to compete with similarly elemental and inexpensive rimfires from Stevens, Savage, and others. At introduction, the M514 set the buyer back the princely sum of $14.” –Gun Digest (full Gun Digest review can be found here.)   This rifle is in extremely good condition given its age, with no obvious blemishes or discoloration. The previous owner had it professionally drilled and mounted with a Tasco RF3-7X20 rimfire scope."

The rifle features a 24 inch heavy fluted barrel with a muzzle break, a one piece picitinny rail, digital camo AccuStock, AccuTrigger, and an all steel construction 10 round detachable box magazine by Accurate Mag Company.  In addition to that, I have a 6-18 Vortex Crossfire II scope with a level attached, a cheek riser, and an imitation Harris bipod.  I zeroed the rifle at a hundred yards last August, cleaned it, oiled it, and put it away.  The only adjustment I never made to it is on the magazine feed lip.  I never bothered to buy the adjustment tool because I feed the ammo by hand one round at a time when I shoot long range.  The mag feed lip probably needs to be opened up about 3 thousandths or so to get the cartridges to feed more smoothly.  The adjustment tool costs about 25 bucks.If you have any questions feel free to ask.  If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale.  1000 dollars gets everything I listed in the ad.  900 gets you everything but the optic.  Not looking for trades at this time.  And thanks for your interest."

Hammer fired, Double-Single action trigger, the Beretta has an ambidextrous safety with automatic decocking and an ambidextrous slide catch. Previous owner installed an extended mag release.This gun is a true pleasure to shoot, hardly any recoil and easy to hold on target. Because of the recoil characteristics, it's easy to hold tight groupings even at ranges beyond 25 yards despite the fact that the barrel is only 3.2 inches long. You will find a natural adjustment to the travel in the trigger pull that will bring out double-taps and rapid fire sequences with intuitive reflex. Everyone who's carried this pistol knows why it surpasses the Glock 19 on just about every basis for CCW. I'm also including 57 rounds of Hollowpoint for good measure. Don't miss this Beretta. You'll need an Ohio ID to make the purchase."

The safety works from either position and allows the slide to still move to chamber a round or unload the gun.The gun is a sweet shooter with a trigger that in my opinion is better than a standard P226 trigger but a little less than a SRT P226 trigger.The gun comes with everything in the pictures including the factory and aftermarket grips.

The Sig P226 X-FIVE Enhanced Classic chambered in 9mm. LONG POST BUT PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE YOU MESSAGE ME No other brand compares; you can try to sink $2,000 into a Glock but it still won’t come close to the overall accuracy, performance, and feel of this Beast of a pistol. And well... it’s still a Glock. This Gorgeous ALL stainless pistol was built with one tenant in mind: Be The Best, NO Excuses. Many brands that make a competition line use polymer lowers to cut weight in order to increase speed. It also gives your very expensive gun a “cheap” feel to it. The brilliant minds of Sig Sauer Germany KNEW that speed means nothing without accuracy and controllability. That’s why they built this pistol with SOLID stainless construction. No aluminum or polymer lower. The added weight increases the ruggedness and rigidity of the pistol and also reduces recoil so you can place rapid follow up shots on target without the violent recoil of lighter weight pistols. It has a FULLY adjustable trigger allowing you to change the pull weight, trigger placement, as well as creep and reset to fit your specific needs. I have it currently set at 2 POUNDS with No Creep at all and the Shortest Reset possible in a pistol. I’ve had other competition pistols with compensators such as CZ, Zev Glocks, Agency Arms M&Ps. None of them come even close, neither in accuracy nor feel. This pistol has the SMOOTHEST action you will EVER feel in a pistol. I shoot better with this pistol than most people do with red dots (including myself), my other pistols had red dots. I’ve been able to get under 2” groupings at 25 yards and have been able to hit a 4” steel target consistently at 75 yards. This pistol has practically no recoil at all. It’s like shooting a 22 pistol. I’m a big Sig fan and the new P320 X-Five is trash in comparison. It comes with the original stainless barrel which has 800 rounds through it, and the new threaded barrel has 400 through it. So in total this gun has seen and flawlessly operated 1,200 rounds. I contacted Sig to find out what the barrel life expectancy on the X-Five barrels were and they said at LEAST 50,000 rounds. This is rated for ANY type of 9mm ammunition you can find on planet Earth. Comes with original case, tools, Sig Lube, 2 19 round mags, and all perperwok as well as an additional hard case.So here’s the rub and what I paid.Sig Sauer X-FIVE Enhanced Classic $3,500X-Weight module $400Sig X5 Open threaded barrel w/X-Kompensator $1,800 Hogue X5 Piranha G10 grips $100Sig OEM tuning slide springs $40$5,840 is what I have invested into this bad boy. Obviously I’m not going to ask for what I paid. But I’m also not going to be lowballed. People today always want something for nothing. Yes I know that’s a lot for a barrel and comp, but that’s how much it actually cost. The threaded barrel is LITERALLY impossible to find outside of buying the $6,000 X-Open model. Seriously, you can’t find it anywhere. They’re not for sale outside of the model they come standard with. My price is $5,000 CASH. No payment plans, no money orders. My price is based on use and lowest available prices. So it is already decreased for those factors.Not interested in lowballs offers or trades.I’m selling THIS, so please believe me when I say there is nothing you have that I want. I’m not trying to be rude but people have a bad habit of ignoring information. They just look at the pictures, find the number in the ad and then make ridiculous offers. Trust me, I know the price of these pistols and their parts are ridiculous, but then again this pistol isn’t for everybody. Competition is a very niche market and then you gotta have the money to afford the best of the best. No real rush to sell this, I have plenty of time. Because this is so expensive, I have no problem letting you try it out at the range before you buy (serious buyers ONLY). I can cover the ammo.If you’re interested, please feel free to shoot me a text at REDACTED"

Please click link below to purchase.https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/cold-steel-storm-cloud-folder-3-1-2-bade-8-1-8-overall-21tu/ Description Sometimes you need the performance of a big tactical blade, but don’t want to alarm the general populace when you snap it open. With that in mind, Mike Wallace developed the Storm Cloud, a strikingly handsome folder featuring a 3 ½” American-Made CPM20CV powdered steel blade. Unlike the Americanized Tanto Cold Steel is known for, the Storm Cloud boasts a modified Tanto that places the point closer to the center of the blade for increased accuracy and penetration when piercing. To compliment this exceptional blade, we’ve crafted a sumptuous G-10 handle featuring a silky-smooth overlay of carbon fiber that allows the knife to effortlessly transition from the boardroom or church pew to the field and back again. But don’t mistake this knife for just another pretty face, it’s a highly capable thoroughbred! Weighing in at only 3.5 ounces, it’s as light as a cloud and, due to its interchangeable pocket clip, it’s fully ambidextrous so it can be easily carried without adding bulk or weight. When it comes time to unleash the Storm Cloud, you can rely on lightning fast pocket deployment, courtesy of Andrew Demko’s patented Thumb Plate. Safety and reliability come standard with the Storm Cloud, which is outfitted with the Cold Steel® Tri-Ad lock®, the strongest and safest folding knife lock available."

The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing.Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.SKU: 91190 Firearm Type: Handgun Purpose: Concealed Carry Chambering: 9mm Luger Magazine Capacity: 14 Magazine Type: Double Stack Frame: Steel Grips: Rubber Trigger Mech: DA/SA Sights: Fixed Barrel: Cold Hammer Forged Barrel Length: 3.75 in Weight: 32.8 oz Overall Length: 7.24 in Height: 5.03 in Width: 1.38 in Safety Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block SafetyPOLICIES:1) Please ensure that this purchase is legal in your state.
