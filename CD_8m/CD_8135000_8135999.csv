In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols. Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off. When Taurus made the first PT-92, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory with its machinery, parts and plans. They even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. Beretta’s and Taurus’ designs have evolved in divergent ways since 1980, and the two pistols now share very few parts in common. But they still share the same lineage and (almost) the same manual of arms. Other innovations include a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked and locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

Included in the box are what looks like a cleaning solution or wipes, manual, chamber flag, gun lock and a 30-rd. Magpul Pmag.

Anyway, I've looked up reviews on this rifle, and I have noticed more than one difference in what I have to sell, and what they review online... with pics to back up what I have found. Any changes I notate below are from DPMS, I haven't touched them other than to get pics of them, so the changes are factory changes.

Reviews online of the DPMS Oracle rifle include the following detracting points:
--Poorly staked gas key screws/bolts
--Non-Staked Castle nuts
--Semi-Auto-cut Bolt Carrier Groups (BCG's)
--No thread-locker on the gas block screws

Obviously concerned, I opened one of my boxes and had a look.... these *absolutely* have properly staked gas key bolts (Allen-type bolts, not YFS brand)... the extension tube/buffer tube castle nut *is* staked (although it could be better staked).... the BCG is indeed a full-auto/M16 style BCG, which is really only important if you wish to run something like the Fostech Echo-II Binary trigger... and there is definitely some thread locker compound on the front gas block screws.

So.... all of the 'bad points' about this rifle in all the online reviews I have seen have been addressed by DPMS with the rifles I have here. 

Some 'bad things' in the reviews which have NOT changed... it still is not a chrome-lined barrel (the BCG is lined) which may or may not bother you-- Chrome=longer life, less accuracy, while non-Chrome=better accuracy, less life.... it does still use a commercial (larger OD) extension/buffer tube for the stock which, again, shouldn't matter unless you want to run a bump-stock or something like that.

Some GOOD things I can say about this rifle... it's very tight. There is *zero* slop between the upper and lower when assembled.... is it very well machined with no nasty machining marks inside the upper, on the BCG, or in the lower. It's a well-made firearm..... the finish is great, it looks like a well-made firearm as it has a nice finish and proper machining.... it's a VERY reasonably priced rifle if you're just getting into the AR-platform market or wish to have a rifle to gift-away or if you need a truck-beater rifle.

I think that is about it... I've covered the good, the bad, mentioned how I want paid and the procedure. If you're keen on making it faster, I *do* have new Slide Fire SSAR-15 MOD stocks (bump stocks) and Fostech Echo-II triggers that we can discuss at the time of sale.

Thanks!"

MK1. This rifle was produced by the Royal Ordinance Factory in Fazackerley. The two serials found on Lee Enfields (on the receiver ring & bolt) are both matching.It has a walnut stock with the original raw linseed oil finish and ""ladder sights"" that were used before the British adopted the cheaper flip peep sights. This rifle features a very shiny barrel with strong grooves, a nearly mint condition stock and the action locks up quite nicely. The magazine appears to be a reproduction piece. Because of the excellent condition, this rifle is valued at $700 but I am primarily looking to trade. Very accurate and easy to perform a ""Mad Minute"" on. This rifle was very well taken care of, cleaned & oiled after every outing and was actually placed inside it's own protective case before being placed in the safe to keep it free from any dings, scratches, etc.I am willing to ship this firearm for a trade but for cash deals, I would like to do face to face. You are entirely free to inspect this rifle upon a face to face transaction and I will bring a bore light for you to see the barrel's great shape. Please do not contact me asking what my ""bottom dollar"" is."

This is a WWII gun that was loaned to Denmark after the war. The Danes manufactured their own stocks, and this beautiful gun has its fishscale-rich matching stock! As you’ll see in the photos below, the gun bears various BMB and PB-coded replacement parts, as one would expect. It also has a fantastic VAR barrel; a big bonus, as some guns were fitted with later SA barrels (which aren’t bad, but just aren’t as precisely made). This gun is smooth as silk. I have several, and the others are more collectible, so this has been the gun I have shot for the past few years. The throat erosion measures 2 and the muzzle wear measures 3, so the barrel has lots of life left. The bore is beautiful, rifling is good, op rod button and gas cylinder are tight. Great sights! This gun will retail at about $1299, and I am asking $1149. Please don’t ask for my best price; I just gave it.Please don’t ask me if I can meet you halfway between Kalamazoo and Timbuktu; I can’t.Please don’t be a Nigerian prince willing to send me a bad check for $4,000 to cash, then send back the difference, while keeping $500 for my trouble.Instead, be a MI buyer, with a MI D/L or MI CPL in hand, whom can come to see this gun in Kalamazoo. You know these guns? Great! All the better, because you’ll see the value of this gun straight away. If you are interested, or have questions, text me at 269, then 720 and finally 3848. I will respond quickest this way, and get to email less often.I am a collector, and I am always interested in high-condition military surplus guns. Cash can go both ways. I am also a buyer; so, if you are not interested in buying this gun, but you have a military surplus gun (even a whole collection!) text me a photo of both sides of the gun and price, and I’ll let you know if I am interested. I have an FFL, so you can sell your gun to me directly, with no liability and for cash.Please cut/paste the link below into a new browser window to see extra photos:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8u3a62CXa-FLVpnb1I2b09oSm8"

So I finally figured it out.... I want to Trade my Norinco SKS and its remaining rds for a basic target bolt gun setup.  My first choices Ruger American (the kind that takes ar15 mags)!!!!Mossberg mvpRemington Savage-Something with a heavy or fluted barrel that I can shoot either prone or off bench. ( NOT LOOKING FOR A SKINNY BARRELED HUNTING RIFLE!!)-I Would rather it have a scope but if it does not and it is a halfway decent rifle I wont be complaining about it. -I would rather it be a 308 but I have a feeling that I will lose out on some great opportunities if I remain a stickler about this so 5.56 and 7.62x39 are welcome as well. Just please nothing else! MY reason for these cartridges is availability and cost. I am buying this to practice with. If the bullets this rifle fires cost me a dollar a shot rather than a quarter, that means Im going to be practicing a quarter as much as I could be.And one final thing... I HATE to use the word ""tactical"" because it is over used to the point that it has virtually lost its meaning. BUT, if I was trying to describe what I am hunting for I might use that word to differentiate my preference from a ""hunting"" rifle. (meant to fire prone or from bench, heavy/threaded barrel, Heftier longer reaching scope, bipod etc.)*NOTE: Keeping the caliber consideration in mind... If you have something thats JUST REALLY FREAKIN COOL in another caliber I would like to hear about it. I am just trying to rule out the Walmart lazy suzan gun cabinet specials.No lowballing please. Im willing to graciously entertain all reasonable offers but when people show up offering to trade me their 175 dollar big 5 bottom of the barrel hunting rifle I get a littlae grumpy."
