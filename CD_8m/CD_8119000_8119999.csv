Second owner, previous owner claimed low usage at around 2-300 rounds (take that how you will) and I never got around to firing it. I'd always wanted one of these but the range I usually go to is limited to 15 yards and the bigger indoor range is pricey by comparison, so it's just been sitting around. Got rid of a AR pistol I built but kept the Vortex StrikeFire 2 red dot and threw it on. Comes with SA Tactical Gear carrying bag and 3 mags (2 20 round and 1 10 round). Also comes with 20 rounds of American Eagle 7.62x51 OTM (the stuff thats supposed to be specifically made for M1As).
Price is OBO at $1400, meet FTF in Fort Worth. Not looking to trade. No shipping at this time unless I cant move it within a decent amount of time, will update if/when that changes. Will update with better pics, currently my LG V20 has suffered the broken camera glass issue and the lens is damaged so they come out super fuzzy.
Note that it does have some light scarring in the magwell from fiddling with mag inserts since I wasn't used to the rocking motion. Could easily remove with light sanding/filing but I'll leave it as is for transparency.Please note that I work graveyard shift, so it may take a while to respond (I'll either be at work or sleeping during the day). Typically I'm on from 6am to 2pm but sometimes I'll take a nap between those times. I do check reddit during my breaks and lunch at night depending on work load. Thanks."

ARD 7.62x39 barrels are chambered and feed ramped to function and feed like an AK-47. Traditioinally, 7.62x39 ARs had issues with the hard primers on cheap Russian steel ammunition and also had feeding issues due to traditional AR barrels being used. ARD's 7.62x39 barrels built upon those original barrels and this AR47 is a beast! This is what you will get with this rifle:1. Anderson upper receiver, lower receiver and LPK, with ARD 7.62x39 16"" H-Bar barrel2.

I do have some already, so I won't just buy anything, but I don't necessarily care about whether it's all matching, mint condition, etc. I do want it to be as original as possible and it absolutely has to be in it's original caliber. None of that Mauser Bubba'd into a .243 or anything. The only exception might be an Enfield in .410. I also won't pay top dollar, but I will pay a fair price based on variables. Email me what you're wanting to part with and lets see if we can make a deal. I will drive ~1hr away, possibly farther for the right piece. Handguns and shotguns will be considered too, but if it doesn't shoot a self contained cartridge, I likely won't be interested.As a side note, I wouldn't mind replacing the Ruger 10/22 I used to own. I just don't wanna pay new prices. Same goes as above-condition doesn't really matter as long as it's safe and funstional. Price offered will of course be dependent on condition.

Please click link below to purchase.https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/zero-tolerance-0850-cpm-20cv-blade-sub-framelock-blue-carbon-fiber-handle/ Description The Zero Tolerance 0850 is an exciting Dmitry Sinkevich/Todd Rexford collaboration based on a spectacular custom piece the two knifemakers built together last year. Dmitry and Todd had always admired each other’s work, so perhaps it was inevitable that they would eventually collaborate. That time came early in 2016. They talked and agreed to work on a project together. Dmitry provided a drawing of an initial concept. Todd worked out the design details and décor. Together they went to work in Todd’s Colorado workshop, sawing, milling, sharpening, and polishing. Eventually, they built exactly two completely astounding knives. And sold them almost instantly. Zero Tolerance decided that two was not enough. We talked with Dmitry and Todd and they agreed to work with us on a production version of their collaboration. The new 0850 is the result. The blade is CPM 20CV stainless steel with a two-tone, stonewash-and-satin finish. This powdered metallurgy steel offers outstanding edge holding capability and corrosion resistance. The 0850 opens manually using a decorative aluminum thumb stud with a clear anodize. The thumb stud is echoed by the unique aluminum backspacer that has been turned and sculpted, then clear anodized. The handles that surround this unusual backspacer are built from a carbon fiber composite material that maintains the benefits of carbon fiber while enabling it to take color, in this case, a deep blue. To keep the weight down on this big folder, ZT added our patented Sub-Frame Lock with hardened steel lockbar insert. (The ZT Sub-Frame Lock is covered under US Patent 69.120.234.) A custom machined titanium clip with bead-blasted finish and black Teflon®-coated hardware round out the look of this extraordinary knife.
