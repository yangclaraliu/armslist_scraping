I bought this to live out my John McClain fantasies and it’s served it purpose. It’s now time for it to find a new home. Not really willing to negotiate on price as I have a lot more into this setup than I’m asking and frankly $500 for all this is a pretty sweet deal already. I’m asking what I need out of it to fund a different 9mm I wanted more. Condition of the gun is excellent. The 30 round mag has been used once. 2 of the 15 round mags are un-used. The 1 original mag is in excellent condition. The Galco holster has heavy wear but is functionally perfect. Any questions call Rob at(314) 276-two three one zero

The downside is I don't have the original case for it but they can be ordered off eBay for $25 so no I won't drop the price down $100  due to there not being one. The gun is in next to mint condition and has no signs of wear. The magazine has a +1 aluminum extension and I do have the original base plate as well. It will come with a leather owb holster that's not cheap quality and I'll add 100 rounds of hollowpoint ammo to go with it. Mostly looking to trade but I will sell it for the right price.

Going up to Longville, MN by Walker. Do not know if I'm going up Hwy 169 to 6 and then to Longville or Hwy 10 to Hwy 371 through Baxter/Brainerd route.So if anyone is interested let me know and we might be able to meet up. I'll probably go the 169 route, but no problem taking the Hwy 10 to 371 route if you want to meet up. ---------I know there in big demand right now and was planning on having one with an aftermarket laser on it eventually (not Sig's) and leave the other one stock. BUT since that is probably 9 to 12 months away, thought I'd offer this up to someone who could use it right away with warmer weather coming up. I currently have a Harry's Holster and it IS Very Comfortable for Appendix carry. Well I think my M&P M2.0 9 Compact is too (also AIWB), it's just smaller and less noticeable with shorts.I also have 2 extra 12 round magazines for it, have a total of 5 now.However, those are going to be $50 each.Valid MN DL & PCP or PTC Required. Also must be willing to sign a Bill of Sale.FTF Meeting ONLY.I have been asked about trades. I guess I'd consider a Complete AR15 .224 Valkyrie Upper (but wasn't planning on that until Spring/Summer 2019).

Style: Compact
Caliber: 9mm
Condition: like new!
 
Springfield compact carry. A practical carry gun upon which you can bet your life.
Built with Springfield’s legendary reliability and workmanship!
 
FEATURES:
Proven 3-dot sights. Fully Supported Ramp Sights. Front and rear sights are dovetailed into the steel of the slide.
Springfield’s famous comfortable ergonomics and grip angle.
TWO factory magazines: There is one a finger grip extension that holds 12 rounds. A second mag that holds 9 rounds makes the pistol smaller and is flush with frame.Also includes accessories from Springfield: holster, loader, magazine holders, etc.
In the accuracy department, the Springfield Sub-Compact is tremendous! As good as a Glock Or better.
Safeties: Grip safety, the gun can only be fired when the hand firmly depresses the safety located at the rear of the handle.  Patented Ultra Safety Assurance trigger system, which guards against accidental discharge. The USA only allows the gun to be fired when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger, eliminating the possibility of an accidental discharge if the gun is dropped or bumped. The XD has a striker status indicator that protrudes from the rear of the steel slide when the striker mechanism is cocked. In addition, it has a loaded chamber indicator, which is a thin piece of metal that pops up when a round is in the chamber.
Picatinny rail for mounting a laser, light, and other accessories.
Dual spring and guide rod system - less torque is placed upon the guide rod and spring.
Weighing a little more than the Glock, the Springfield Sub-Compact manages recoil more confidently than the Glock, enabling accurate “follow-up” shots.

It has the same Jerico slide that were being supplied to Wilson Combat at the time. This model also predates the Swartz safety that was introduced in 2001. The only shooting that has been done is the recommended break-in and it is a tack driver. In the last year I have not seen another one of these for sale locally or nationally. The asking price is what it is... hard to compare when you can’t find another for comparison. It is in excellent condition with a few very minor handling marks. Hand made hand checkered cocobolo grips are slim cut mounted on slim bushings and screws. The original black rubber grips are excellent and included, along with the original screws and bushings.
