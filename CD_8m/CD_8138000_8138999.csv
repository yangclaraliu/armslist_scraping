The size, shape, and design is similar to the Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" OAL and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1.75"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube which is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail accepts many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Reliability and simplicity have made GLOCK® semi-automatic pistols a favored sidearm for law enforcement, military, and civilian use all over the world. The GLOCK 17 is a full-size service pistol, shooting the 9mm pistol cartridge, a standard defense round with proven knock down power. Rough grip texturing on the polymer frame provides a sure hold on the pistol when hands are wet or sweaty, and the enlarged magazine catch is reversible, accommodating left- or right-handed shooters. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of a plethora of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The dovetailed rear sight is drift adjustable and has a white outline around its notch; the fixed front blade has a white dot. Sight acquisition is quick in any light. The GLOCK 17 Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be for field carry, at home, or in a vehicle. The model 17 comes with two standard 18-round magazines.

It co.es with the accutrigger and accustock from the factory along with a fluted bull barrel and muzzle brake. I also had mounted a 4-16 Nikon Monarch scope that is configured for the 223 cartridge using Leopold bases and rings. Before tax I was over $1500 in this set up. I had the scope professionally mounted and bore sighted, and broke the barrel in slowly over about 8 hours cleaning between each round and allowing it to cool on between rounds as well. I shot 1 box (20 rounds) through it and was going to use it to coyote hunt, but never got into it. It is by far the most accurate 223 I have ever shot, but it just sits in the gun safe now.  I also will require the buyer to fill out a complete transfer form. I realize this is not required by law, but it is a crazy world now so I just want something to cover me, and I am willing to trade for the right item."

It was intended to replace the costly Luger P08, the production of which was scheduled to end in 1942. The first designs submitted to the German Army featured a locked breech and a hidden hammer, but the Heer (German Army) requested that it be redesigned with an external hammer.   The P38 concept was accepted by the German military in 1938 but production of actual prototype (""Test"") pistols did not begin until late 1939. Walther began manufacture at their plant in Zella-Mehlis and produced three series of ""Test"" pistols, designated by a ""0"" prefix to the serial number. The third series pistols satisfactorily solved the previous problems for the Heer and mass production began in mid-1940, using Walther's military production identification code ""480"". After a few thousand pistols the Heer changed all codes from numbers to letters and Walther was given the ""ac"" codeThis Walther comes with period correct Holster and two P38 Magazines. This is a beautiful Piece of History.REDACTEDMore Pics Here"

The M5 scopes' mil based adjustments complement the mil based reticles to make long range shot placement quicker and easier.

All Mil Dot calculations are TMR compatible. To use the system, simply determine the range to the target using the mil system, then use the corresponding aiming point that is matched to your cartridge to engage the target.  SPECIFICATIONSLength (A) 14.6 inTube Length (B) 7 in(C) 2.7 in(D) 2.4 inEyepiece Length (E) 3.2 inObjective Length (F) 4.4 inObjective Diameter (G) 2.3 inEyepiece Diameter (H) 1.7 inTube Diameter (I) 34 mmActual Magnification 19.5 (6.5)FOV @ 100 yds (ft) 5.5 (14.3)FOV @ 100 m (m) 1.8 (4.8)Eye Relief (in) 3.6 (4.4)Eye Relief (mm) 93 (111)Obj.

Overall Length: 39.5” Stock: Black Synthetic   Features:   590M shotguns and magazines are uniquely designed incorporating stabilizing ribs that engage the magazine directly to the receiver for a sure lock-up. The 590M™ Series offers magazine-fed convenience in the legendary Mossberg pump-action tactical platform.     For home security, tactical, and competition applications, 590M Mag-Fed pump-actions offer many practical advantages: faster reloading/unloading, increased capacity without additional magazine tube length, and quick and easy transitioning between various types of loads (when using designated magazines). Full magazines are the center of gravity point, making the 590M shotgun easy to balance for greater accuracy.
