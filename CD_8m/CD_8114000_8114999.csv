The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.Arsenal's Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria.

This is a new company that has combined many great features that many top companies use today. The H9 is an all steel design that helps reduce felt recoil. The H9 comes with a HD tritium front sight and black serrated rear sight straight from the factory that provides a precise aim. The firearm comes with 3- 15 round magazines, factory box, and manual. We can ship to your FFL for $15. Please know your local laws as we will not ship where it is prohibited. Features: 1911 Style Trigger The trigger can make or break a pistol so why not have the best? The well-tuned 1911 style trigger found on the Hudson H9 offers a short take up, a crisp release, virtually no overtravel and a tactile but short reset. The patent pending integral trigger safety is engaged instinctively and doesn’t take away from the smooth straight pull trigger that allows the shooter steadier and more consistent follow-up shots. Striker-Fired Design Patent pending striker and sear design is optimized for less wear and tear of parts. The lack of a hammer spring also allows a more slimline and higher grip on the pistol giving the shooter more control while diminishing felt recoil. Low Bore Axis The H9’s unique design is not simply aesthetic. The unconventional nose of the pistol allows for the barrel and recoil spring to sit drastically lower and closer to the hand than heritage designs. This, coupled with its striker-fired design, creates an extremely low bore axis which reduces torque about the wrist when firing and contributes to unparalleled precision in the shot process."

I am changing jobs and do not need it anymore. I drive her between 2 and 4 hours every workday. She starts and drives everyday. I have either done or had done the work listed: Sway link kit, rack& pinion, both front struts, tie rod ends, 4 wheel alignment, exhaust, spark plugs, wires, rotor, belts, upper hose, brake pads, and the previous owner had the timing belt changed. New tires. She has power windows, locks with remote start. The sunroof works great with no leaks. The heat and air both work. The air may need topped off when it gets really warm. The motor and transmission are strong. The interior does not have any rip or holes. The head liner is in good shape. There are a few cigarette burns from the previous owner. We never smoked in it nor does it smell bad. That being said she does have a couple of quirks. She leaks a little oil. Drivers door lock keyhole does not work. The passenger side does and keyless entry works. The clearcoat is almost gone. The speedometer may flake out for a couple of miles every few days. I have put a wireless code reader to overcome the speedometer. The check engine light comes on every few days. It is an o2 censor. I use the code reader to turn it off. The code reader is run through an app on my phone. The abs light will come on once in a while. The brakes work fine and the light goes off on its own. She has a salvage title. I will continue to drive it till it sells, so the mileage will increase.
