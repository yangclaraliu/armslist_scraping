I have a mint condition (basically brand new) Sig Brace with a KAK brand buffer tube for sale.  Both items came on my newly purchased LWRC AR pistol.  The day I bought it I had my gunsmith remove these items and install a different brand brace.  First reasonable offer gets it. The KAK buffer tube is better than a standard buffer tube because it has a wider sectionsecti the threads which forces the SIG Brace to stay about a 1 or 1.5 inches back setting you up for a much better length of pull when the brace is shouldered.  Any questions please email or text/call me at 754-7zero2-756zero.Thanks

Ceska Zbrojovka has always had some of the most rigorous testing requirements in the world but, the Czech National police has required that they go even further, the testing regiment for this new pistol was the most demanding anyone has ever encountered. There are almost 20 specific requirements covering everything from accuracy to interchangability, from safety to reliability/durability and everything in between.The pistol: The CZ P-01 is a Gen 3 pistol that began as a requirement for a lightweight compact pistol that will deliver the accuracy and durability of a full size, full weight pistol. This was no small task, several manufacturers declined to even start the project.The first thing you notice about this pistol is the M3 light rail on the frame, a first for CZ, the alloy frame is a little wider at the top than a steel CZ 75. This adds strength and rigidity for mounting the light and increasing the accuracy and service life of the pistol. The P-01 also sports enhanced controls as well as a drop free magazine and a lanyard loop.The pistol was required to pass a wide variety of tests:The police required that the pistol ensure the highest level of comfort, an extended slide release was added as well as an extended magazine release and the trigger was reshaped to give a more consistent pull throughout the trigger stroke.The pistol must be 100% reliable in extreme conditions, the following is a list of some of the minimum requirements.Must be able to complete the following without failure:4000 dry firings 3000 De-cockings Operator level disassembly 1350 times with out ware or damage to components. Complete disassembly 150 times, this is all the way down, pins, springs etc. 100% interchangability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy.Safety requirements:Drop test 1.5 meter (4.9”) drop test, this is done 54 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked. Dropping the pistol on the butt, the muzzle, back of the slide, sides of the gun, top of the slide, in essence, any angle that you could drop the gun from. This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.3meter drop (9.8”) 5 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked, This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.After these tests are complete the gun must fire without service.The factory contracted an independent lab to do additional testing on guns that previously passed the drop tests. These pistol were dropped an additional 352 times without failure.The pistol must also complete an environmental conditions test: This means cold, heat, dust/sand and mud. The pistol must fire after being frozen for 24 hours at –35C (-36F). The pistol must fire after being heated for 24 hours at 70C (126F) The pistol must fire after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations including being stripped of oil then completing the sand and mud tests again.Service life: The service life requirement from the Czech police was 15,000 rounds of +P ammo! The pistol will exceed 30,000 rounds with ball 9mm.Reliability: The reliability requirements for the P-01 pistol are 99.8%, that’s a .2% failure rate. This equals 20 stoppages in 10,000 rounds or 500 “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) During testing, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired, this is a .05% failure rate, a MRBF rate of 2142 rounds! Over 4 time the minimum acceptable requirement. The U.S. Army MRBF requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols with 115 grain Ball ammunition.Heritage: The P-01 is based on the CZ 75, the most used pistol in the world. Over 60 countries use it as the standard side arm of their Armies, National police forces, National security agencies or other Law enforcement organizations. No other pistol can make this claim."

The Steyr S-A1 striker-fired pistol is a sub-compact, semi-automatic, double-action handgun available as the S9-A1 chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum or the S40-A1 chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson. The smallest of Steyr’s pistol line, the S-A1 has a 3.6” (92mm) barrel and the same short overall length as the C-A1 but features a short grip for ultra-concealment.
As with each model in the Steyr A1 line of products, the pistol features a low bore-axis which minimizes recoil and improves control while the ergonomic grip offers optimal control for a variety of hand sizes. The lower frame of the gun offers a standard slide-lock thumb tab, right-handed magazine ejection button and pivoting break-down lever. A key-operated manual safety feature is located next to the break-down lever and 2 keys are provided with each pistol. An integrated Picatinny rail allows for simple mounting of a laser or light and slide-racking grooves on the back of the slide allow for a firm grip when manually operating the action.

You can identify up to 50 CTCSS tones and 104 DCS codes.Direct Access - lets you directly access any channel.Lock-Out Function - lets you set your scanner to skip over specified channels or frequencies when scanning or searching.Temporary Lockout - makes it easy to temporarily lock out any channel or frequency. The lockout is cleared when you turn power off, then back on so you don’t have to remember to unlock the channels later.Triple-Conversion Circuitry - virtually eliminates any interference from IF (intermediate frequency) images, so you hear only the selected frequency.Text Tagging - you can name each channel, using up to 16 characters per name.Service Banks - frequencies are preset in 10 separate Police, Fire/Emergency, Ham, Marine, Railroad, Civil Air, Military Air, CB Radio, FRS/GMRS/MURS, and Racing banks to make it easy to locate specific types of calls and search any or all of these banks.Priority Scan with Do Not Disturb - lets you program one channel in each bank (10 in all) and then have the scanner check each channel every 2 seconds while it scans the banks so you don’t miss transmissions on those channels. Do-Not Disturb keeps the scanner from interrupting transmissions during receiving.Priority Plus Scan - you can set the scanner so it scans only the priority channels.Scan/Search Delay/Resume - controls whether the scanner pauses at the end of the transmission to wait for a reply. You can set the Delay time for each Channel, Close Call Search, Custom Search, and Service search. You can also set a negative delay where the scanner stops on transmissions for a set time then automatically resumes.Custom Search - lets you program up to 10 Custom Search Ranges and search any or all of these ranges.Quick Search - allows you to enter a frequency and start searching up or down from that frequency.Turbo Search - increases the search speed from 100 to 300 steps per second automatically for bands with 5 kHz steps.Search Lockouts - you can lock up to 200 search frequencies: 100 temporary frequencies and 100 permanent frequencies in Custom Search, Service Search, Close Call Search, or Quick Search Modes.Weather Alert Priority - the scanner scans active WX channels every 5 seconds to check for the presence of a 1050 Hz Weather Alert Tone.Weather Alert Standby - the scanner allows you to monitor for weather alerts broadcast on NOAA channels.Display Backlight - You can turn on/off the LCD backlight, set it operate on squelch only, keypress only, or both.Signal Strength Meter - shows the signal strength for more powerful transmissions.Flexible Antenna with BNC Connector - provides adequate reception in strong signal areas and is designed to help prevent antenna breakage. Or, you can connect an external antenna for better reception.Memory Backup - keeps the frequencies stored in memory for an extended time if the scanner loses power.Two Power Options - let you power the scanner using the included two AA rechargeable or alkaline batteries or the supplied USB cable.Built-In Charger - allows you to charge Ni-MH batteries in the scanner using a USB port on any computer and the supplied USB cable.Key Confirmation Tones - You can turn on/off a tone that sounds when you perform an operation correctly or if you make an error.Key Lock - lets you lock the scanner's keys to help prevent accidental changes to the scanner's programming.Battery Save - works when there is no transmission for 1 minute in Scan Hold Mode and any Search Hold Mode (without Priority Scan). This feature turns off RF power for 1 second and turns on it for 300ms to extend the battery life.Battery Low Alert - the icon will blink in the display and a tone warns you every 15 seconds when the battery power gets low"

This 640-1 is in very good condition with a bright and shiny bore and shock absorbing Pachmayr rubber grips. Comes with a nice leather paddle holster. Description  The Smith & Wesson Model 640 is a descendant of the “J”-framed S&W Model 40 and was first introduced in 1990. The Model 640 differs slightly from its ancestor, the Model 40 (also known as the Centennial), in that it features a stainless steel frame. The Model 640 was only offered as a .38 Special revolver until 1996 when it offered in the .357 Magnum caliber as the Model 640-1. The S&W Model 40, 640, 640-1 and all similar variants are ideal pocket firearms due to their distinctive “hammerless” feature. While the phrase hammerless is misleading since they contain enclosed hammers, this feature allows the user to safely fire from within their pocket without worrying about the hammer snagging. It also alleviates any worry that lint or other elements may breach the firearm, rendering it disabled. As sales records from S&W show, the Model 640-1 and its variants are tremendously popular revolvers among those seeking a reliable backup firearm or personal defense weapon.
