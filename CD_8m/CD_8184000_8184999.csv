It seems to have a charge left in it, so a few years ago, I made it inert by dumping oil down the barrel and in the nipple.I am selling as a parts gun only. I was going to throw the barrel away, but if you want a go at it, your more than welcome but at your own risk. I have not tried to use a ball puller, maybe that's all it needs. But there is rust around the nipple area, so again, why I am selling as parts.The wood has a really beautiful grain, one of the nicest I have seem on a Hawkins. Nicer than the ones I have seen on eBay for more money. The stock and parts alone are easily worth $175 seeing what these are going for on eBay. Even the walnut ramrod is going for $30 alone. Also has a nice double set trigger. And these Hawkins parts are getting harder and harder to find every year that passes, especially excellent condition stocks like this one is.$175 FTF in Allendale, will not ship nor will I meet half way. The price is set low so this is a no fuss deal for someone.Thanks."

The rifle is very nice and I have only 150 rounds through it. I now want a SBR and need to sell this complete upper to afford a SBR upper.  You can see from the pictures it is brand new looking and you can hardly tell it has been used. My ebay account is Bkinn1990 and you can see I have great feedback, and I have sold a few firearms on this website. I am willing to let this go for $800 shipped/$750pickup or meet. You will receive the complete upper and it's the same listed on Daniel Defenses website. Get a practically new upper for a great price!   The pictures I have a vortex magnifier with a EOTech XPS2-0 under a scoapcoat. I really didn't feel like taking them off since I will still be shooting this lovely rifle. They are not included. I need to update the pictures with the bcg and charging handle since i was originally selling it as stripped, but now im going to sell it complete with the BCG and charging handle that came with the rifle that I bought new from online.   So $800 shipped or $750 pick up takes it. This exact upper is over $1,000 new and Ill throw in the BCM Gunfighter KAG grip as well as a vertical grip. Daniel Defense V11 LW Upper Receiver Group"

Since then, I never fired it. It's been sitting in the safe unused. It does show signs of wear, particularly on the heel of the handle where the blueing is fading a bit. However, it is in otherwise excellent condition. I never got into .380 but always loved the ppk design, so I bought this on a whim but since I always shoot 9mm and 45 on hand guns I decided to just consolidate my calibers and stick with what I know for economical and practical reasons. BTW, this fits in your hand like a glove! If it were 9mm luger I'd keep it!
 
This is no longer in production from either Walther or S&W. Comes with standard magazine and extended magazine, both original. As well as a Desantis black leather shoulder holster which adds about $100 value to the package. I might still have the box, I am unsure I will check but no guarantees. I am looking to sell or trade. Since these are out of production for a while, their values fluctuate especially the blued or two tone versions like this one. A growing collectors item. Will do $600 shipped or $550 FTF(you pay transfer locally in the Downingtown area, I have a great FFL here that offers discounts on transfers for NRA members).
As for trades, I am looking for any of the following. I will add cash on my end depending on what you have to trade. Or, if the trade value of yours is lower than mine, you will have to add cash or ammo. Most of the handguns on the trade list I would be willing to do an even trade on. I'm pretty fleixible on trades, cash, etc. So send your offers.
