Not interested in shipping this will be face to face only cash sale.  Buyer MUST have permit to purchase, carry permit and MN DL; no exceptions.  Will complete bill of sale at time of transaction.
Not much interest in  trades except for something in a .454 casull lever gun, T/C rifle in 460 sw mag, entry level OU 12ga trap gun, coonan 357; i have no need for more ARs or low end semi autos.  I dont forsee any trades being something I would be interested in but if it were can add cash on either end to amke it work.

It also has a very low round count. It is one awesome handgun! Barrel length is 8 3/3” long with two muzzle compensator inserts, and 15” overall length. The barrel and frame is made from stainless steel and grips are synthetic rubber and it holds 5 shots. Comes with original case. The following is taken from the Smith & Wesson website describing this 460XVR revolver. Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot! Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver. An excellent choice for competition shooting or hunting.

MSRP is $829. Bought new for $640. Selling for $480 cash.I have less than 200 rounds through it. I love this revolver but am going through a divorce so it needs to go. From the manufacturer:*Triple-locking cylinder is locked into the frame at the front, rear and bottom for more positive alignment and dependable operation shot after shot.*Patented grip frame design easily accommodates a wide variety of custom grips.*Takedown of integrated subassemblies requires no special tools and allows for easy maintenance and assembly.*Patented transfer bar mechanism provides an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge.For this sale to happen I will require you sign a Bill of Sale. You will need to show me identification to enter details about yourself on the Bill of Sale. This Bill of Sale and it's information will be for my own personal records as a safeguard in the unlikely event the gun is stolen or lost and used illegally and traced back to me. I will also need you to show me an Idaho Concealed Weapons License OR be willing to conduct a FFL transfer at a local gun shop. Sorry, I won't budge on this. I don't know you and I want to make sure you are legally able to make this purchase. If we do a FFL transfer you will pay for the transfer fee to the FFL dealer (typically about $20-25) BUT I will deduct that cost from the sale price of the shotgun if you successfully pass the background check. Lastly, I will also choose the place of transfer. If you have a CWL the transfer will likely take place in the parking lot at the Meridian Police Station. I have confirmed with the police station that it is acceptable to conduct private gun sales in the police parking lot for safety with surveililance cameras. If we are doing an FFL transfer then the transaction will take place at a gun shop of my choosing somewhere in either Nampa or Meridian."

Make no mistake though- while some might consider a single-shot an entry-level proposition, we build these to the same high standards as all of our fine centerfire rifles, and not to be a budget model in any sense of the word. These new rifles use a familiar locking lever on top of the frame, behind the external hammer spur, to break the barrel open. We’ve added our own touch here though- the lever can be pivoted either left or right from its center position to unlock, which works well for both lefties and righties. The action has no external manual safety; it uses a rebounding hammer that can’t touch the firing pin unless the trigger’s deliberately pulled, and an interlock system that doesn’t allow the barrel to open if the hammer’s cocked, or the barrel to close if the hammer’s cocked while it’s open. Quick to load or unload, safe to carry, and simple to operate."

When those trials were postponed in 2006, Taurus decided to sell this next-generation service design to the civilian and law enforcement markets. If the gun fails to fire it has a double strike feature allowing you to pull the trigger again like a double action revolver to strike the primer again. These advanced pistols are no longer being manufactured, but I have one. Pistol is used but in very good condition. Exterior finish of slide is like new. I can send more detailed pictures on request. A rough estimate is maybe 300-500 rounds through the pistol.This pistol is a dream to shoot.

You will need to show me identification to enter details about yourself on the Bill of Sale. This Bill of Sale and it's information will be for my own personal records as a safeguard in the unlikely event the gun is stolen or lost and used illegally and traced back to me. I will also need you to show me an Idaho Concealed Weapons License OR be willing to conduct a FFL transfer at a local gun shop. Sorry, I won't budge on this. I don't know you and I want to make sure you are legally able to make this purchase. If we do a FFL transfer you will pay for the transfer fee to the FFL dealer (typically about $20-25) BUT I will deduct that cost from the sale price of the shotgun if you successfully pass the background check. Lastly, I will also choose the place of transfer. If you have a CWL the transfer will likely take place in the parking lot at the Meridian Police Station. I have confirmed with the police station that it is acceptable to conduct private gun sales in the police parking lot for safety with surveililance cameras. If we are doing an FFL transfer then the transaction will take place at a gun shop of my choosing somewhere in either Nampa or Meridian."
