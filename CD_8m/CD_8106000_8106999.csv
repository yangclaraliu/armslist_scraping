You can see in 2nd pic the Cabela's ""candy cane"" wrap is intact. The reason being it was made by Glock to compete against Sig Sauer's P320 to be the US Army's new gun to replace the 9 millimeter Beretta, well after extensive testing, our armed forces chose the Sig, dumb move. But Glock has made an announcement in January that they will bring the Glock 19 X to the civilian market, and ever since then they have been flying off store shelves. Check out this news snippet about this ultra reliable pistol: Glock’s commercial pistol, dubbed the 19X, is the company’s first stab at a crossover model, combining the Glock 17 frame with a Glock 19 barrel. With a “marksman barrel” and ambidextrous slide-stop levers, the pistol is designed to be as versatile as it is powerful, “almost like a [1911] Commander-style situation where you’ve got the shorter barrel with the full-sized grip frame,” as national sales manager Bob Radecki Army Times on Jan. 2
 
Anyways, what is being offered here is a BRAND NEW Glock 19X with everything it comes with for $690, which is currently the lowest price for an in stock one in Wisconsin. The other WI dealer may deceptively ""list"" it for $680 but then there is the small matter of the tax which is $37 and then a ten dollar background fee so you can readily add $50 for $680 making the true price closer to $730. I do not have to do a background check according to WI law and being a private seller, I do not have to collect sales tax as required by law. I already paid sales tax on this item when I bought NEW from the store. I just really hate the color, so decided to sell at a small loss.
The master gunsmiths at GLOCK have created their first-ever crossover pistol. The 19X Centerfire Pistol combines the GLOCK 17's full-size frame with the compact GLOCK 19's slide for the best of both worlds. Not only does it come in the striking Coyote color, its ambidextrous slide is factory colored to match. Plus, it's decked out with a high-performance PVD coating for corrosion resistance. Design features slide-stop levers, a lanyard loop and no finger grooves. Includes a pistol case, one 17-round magazine and two 17+2 round magazines.

This is achieved by means of weighted wads that you can insert in the buttstock. The result is a shotgun that will truly feel like an extension of the body--your body.Micro Core Recoil PadThe Micro Core recoil pad is designed to do two primary things. First, to reduce recoil as much as possible, so that even a long session at the range will not tire you and leave you sore. Secondly, and thanks to the type of polymer of which it is constructed, it is engineered to flow smoothly to your shoulder without snagging or catching as many rubber buttpads do.Armlist for a new versatile Sporting lefty!call Bill @ 919six28six 99three"

The gun is in good shape with some handling marks. I purchased this gun from Classicfirearms . Com the reason this gun appealed to me over some of the other surplus m57’s I have seen, is the lack of the frame mounted safety. The tokarev was originally designed with out a safety. But this one came with a trigger safety similar to a Glock but much much worse and could be removed so it would be a little more accurate to the original pistol. So I removed the trigger safety originally intended to get a m57 trigger with out the safety to replace it but I haven’t got around to it. With all that said This gun functions great and has no known issues   Please let me know if you have any questions and thanks for looking."

This is Ricardo Mata in Charlotte. I got this pistol at Hyatt Guns just over a month ago. FANTASTIC gun but, honestly, a bit too much for me. I have put exactly 112 rounds on it on two trips to the range. I know the exact number because I was able to shoot only 4 full magazines (56 rounds) on each trip and I had to stop due to arthritis on my hands and wrists. The gun comes with its box, manuals, and 8 14-round magazines. It came with 4 magazines and I bought 4 more. I also bought a Sig Sauer holster (Right hand) and a Sig Sauer double magazine case. In total, I spent just over $1500. FIRM PRICE: $1300. You must have a a valid North Carolina Driver License and a Concealed Carry Permit or an ORIGINAL Purchase Permit. If you have a Purchase Permit please know I will keep it. We will both sign a Bill of Sale and you will receive a copy. I'm not interested in any trades. Please do not ask. Please call me or text me at my mobile 704-431-7393. Please identify yourself with your full name when calling or texting. I will not answer any messages without a full name and I will block your number if you want to waste my time. Scammers refrain from contacting me. Why would you want to mess with a guy with a .45?  I am having trouble uploading the pictures I took but I will be happy to send them to you. The pistol looks exaclty like the one I was able to get from the web. Thanks!"

That particular rifle has been pillar bedded in a laminate stock.  It has been free floated.  We converted it from a 2rd blind box to a 10rd detachable box magazine...  You can use either the AI mags or the alpha industries mags.  It is the standard 308 magazine, but in the 10rd mag you will only get about 7 due to the wsm size.  Also it is an accutrigger rifle...  That is important info to have when looking for accessories as the older non accutrigger models are significantly differentMagazine is not pictured but have it, rifle also comes with just over 80 rounds of ammo.  I am not looking for a trade, must have valid DL and will do a bill of sale for the rifle to the new owner.  I had a vortex scope that I purchaed for this rifle and will be reusing it on my new rifle once this one sells.  Rifle has had very few rounds put through it, reason for selling is that I just don't use it to its fullest potential, no low ballers, serious inquiry only."

HK VP9 9mm LE version - has 3 mags, night sights  - no more than 100 rounds fired through this......went to the range one time, brought home and cleaned and into the safe....out of all the striker fired guns I have owned the VP9's have by far the best trigger of any!comes with everything it originally came with.....3 mags, box , papers, night sights....this is one very nice gunonly selling because I have to thin my collection some of my ""shooters"" and I already have a couple USP's and I am just old school and prefer the DA/SA triggers over the striker fire.....to each their own but I love my USP's...more than double the money for them but I have thousands of rounds through the USP's I own and I am not going to sell those......so just makes sense to part with this oneselling for $625  call or text 515-229-9336
I have a number of guns I will be listing over the next couple weeks that have either been to the range one time and are still like brand new , or have never been shot at all.

it also has a brand new Trijicon Red Dot that can also be sold with or without. 
this gun has been to the range one time since all the work was done and had less than 200 rounds fired through….its a UNREAL shooting gun! and the upgrades take it to a whole new level….this is NOT a carry gun, its a dead accurate range gun and would make a great competition gun!
I have each and every upgrade parts packing…..all the work was done by ZEV….if you don’t know their work, do a goggle search and look them up.
 
 
the only trades I will consider are older, pristine safe queens - like Browning , Colt , Smith & Wesson and again , only if they are 95-100% condition

I have a number of guns I will be listing over the next couple weeks that have either been to the range one time and are still like brand new , or have never been shot at all.
 
Each have their original box and all the paper work that they originally came with.
 
HK VP9 9mm LE version - has 3 mags, night sights  - no more than 100 rounds fired through  $625
 
HK VP9sk 9mm - compact version of the HK VP9 - has never been fired $550
 
Dan Wesson Pointman Carry - 
commander sized compact 9mm - fit and finish on these are second to none - compare with any Ed Brown, Les Baer or Wilson Combat! These are FINE pistols and super hard to find - never been shot or carried  $1400
 
Dan Wesson Specialist 9mm- 
commander sized slide with full sized frame …has had less than 100 rounds fired through. $1450

Zev stainless match grade threaded barrel
Zev stainless guide rod
Zev beveled mag well
Zev stainless pin set
Zev slide release
I have all the original parts as well and can sell the gun stock or with the upgrades. 
it also has a brand new Trijicon Red Dot that can also be sold with or without. 
this gun has been to the range one time since all the work was done and had less than 200 rounds fired through….its a UNREAL shooting gun! and the upgrades take it to a whole new level….this is NOT a carry gun, its a dead accurate range gun and would make a great competition gun!
I have each and every upgrade parts packing…..all the work was done by ZEV….if you don’t know their work, do a goggle search and look them up.
 
 
the only trades I will consider are older, pristine safe queens - like Browning , Colt , Smith & Wesson and again , only if they are 95-100% condition

the only trades I will consider are older, pristine safe queens - like Browning , Colt , Smith & Wesson and again , only if they are 95-100% condition

Comes with shoulder holster, holster shown, approximately 250 cartridges, 3 Mags, cleaning tools and ammo can.Price $2000 for everything.Lists for $2200 to $2400 for the pistol if you can find one.Roberts Defense (Review from truthaboutguns.com)The Roberts Defense Super Grade isn’t going to muscle its way into the market on looks alone. Not that there’s anything wrong with its appearance. The Super Grade’s satin stainless steel’s warm sheen gives the gun a subtle, business-like look. Paired with black cherry grips and classic 1911 cues, the Super Grade is a modern take on a timeless design. Which, of course, it is. Like a lot of high-end 1911s.Roberts Defense’s motto is “never compromise.” If hand-fitting means never having to say never mind, they’re living up to their creed. The Super Grade’s clearly benefitted from a lot of hands-on care and attention. The frame-to-slide fit is exceptional, with no hang-ups and no rattle. None. Racking the Super Grade’s slide isn’t like manipulating a greased lightning Cabot (what is?) but the 1911’s action is at least as smooth as a Wilson Combat custom.Like most 1911 guys, I worry about tight-fitting guns; a John Moses Browning meisterwerk with tiny tolerances can foretell future function failures. The barrel bushing was so tight on Robert’s blaster I couldn’t remove it without a bushing wrench. Like a town bicycle, it will loosen up over time. The grip safety is blended very well to the frame, but it isn’t as well-sorted as it is on a higher-priced custom gun – yes there are many – like an Ed Brown. With a price of “just” $1649.00 I’m willing to let it go.Roberts Defense fashioned the Super Grade Pro’s hammer and sear from D7 tool steel. According to diehlsteel.com, that’s a “high carbon high chromium die steel with added carbon and vanadium for abrasion resisting qualities. Useful for applications involving extreme abrasive wear.” Roberts says the metal maintains its shape and angles much better than other steels.The trigger feels like a gunsmith-tuned go pedal, though it’s got a lot of wiggle inside the frame. The trigger pull is as clean as an airline pilot’s kitchen and as sharp as Saville Row suit. It has the perfect amount of take-up leading to to a solid wall, followed by a crisp break. If your sights are moving when you fire the Super Grade, it’s all you.Perhaps this is a good time to mention that all Roberts Defense guns come with a transferable lifetime warranty. If your third-hand Roberts Defense has feeding problems or the sights come loose – perish the thought – you can send it in for free warranty work. As customers of high-end 1911s will attest, personal and prompt service is one of the major benefits of working with a small gunmaker; they’re willing to take responsibility for any and all issues and fix the problems fast.The first thing I look for in any gun I shoot: reliability. The Robert Defense Super Grade has it in spades. RF ran 250 rounds of Winchester White Box RF through the gun (“just warming it up, Wes”) sans problem. I fed it another 500 rounds. In addition to standard 230 gr. ball, I shot three popular self-defense rounds: Hornady TAP FPD 230 +P, Federal Hydrashok 230, and my personal favorite Federal HST 230 +P. All of these loads fed through the pistol without the slightest hiccup. There were no malfunctions whatsoever.The pistol is ridiculously accurate. It shot so well I had to compare it side-by-side with a Les Baer Thunder Ranch Special with a 1.5 inch guarantee (a gun that will be getting it’s own review sometime soon). The Les Baer was slightly more accurate, but that could be down to user familiarity (i.e. it’s my gun). Considering the Baer’s $800 premium over Roberts Defense, that’ll do.A lot of TTAG readers balk at paying a grand-and-a-half for a gun. Any gun – never mind a 1911. Especially when they can find perfectly serviceable 1911 for $800 to $1000. But the Roberts Defense Super Grade has “it”: the high-quality hand-fit feel and rock-solid performance buyers expect from guns that sell for $2k and up. The company is fast, friendly and passionate about their product, willing to stand behind their gun for as long as ye shall live. And beyond.The only potential problem: the Super Grade Pro’s extremely aggressive checkering and grips. As they say about strange sexual practices, if you don’t understand it, it’s not for you.

The stock and bluing are in great shape. I have also recently replaced the spring buffer with a brand new one which is a must do for these rifles (look up on youtube if you want to clariy). The rifle comes with the original 4 round hunting mag and the original manual. In addition I am including a sling, 20mm scope mount, and two 14 round magazines. Also included are the flat top reciever screws if you choose to take the rail off. I will only meet at a gun store or gun club and will require the buyer to fill out a bill of sale with driver's license, address and signature on it as well as my information.

I have personally owned this gun for about 15 years but have RECENTLY added over $1,200 worth of accessories to it (not including labor to install):- Zeiss HD5 3-15x42 Scope - $999- Timney 1.5-3 lb adjustable trigger - $125- Vais Stainless muzzle brake - $110- Limbsaver recoil pad - $38Over the years I've probably shot 3-4 boxes through it and killed many animals along the way. The gun is very lightweight and weather proof, therefore an excellent candidate for stalking elk or other bigger game. With addition of Vais brake and Limbsaver pad, recoil is very manageable and comparable to a 243 currently. The trigger is a dream as well. For the most part, I've done everything I can to upgrade this 7mm for accuracy and recoil management."

It is intended for use only to resize cases which have become increasingly difficult to chamber after repeated firing and neck sizing.Competition Seating Die - The bullet guide to seating stem fit is so precise that the seating stem can actually be demonstrated to float on a column of air.  The micrometer is calibrated in .001"" increments.  It also has a zero set feature that allows you to zero the micrometer to your rivle or favorite seating depth.
