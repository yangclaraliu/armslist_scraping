Serial Number: 22059. No import marks. All components match: barrel, frame, and slide. It was an improved version of the CZ 22, which had been licensed from Mauser. Production of the CZ 24 started in August 1925. The original order for 20,000 pistols was completed in June 1926. More orders followed, and by the end of 1929, 100,000 pistols had been accepted by the Military and Gendarmerie, called in Czechoslovakia the “Četnictvo”. Overall, approximately 200,000 CZ 24 pistols were made. An inventory on January 1, 1939, showed the Czechoslovak Army and Air Force had on hand 171,756 CZ 24 pistols. The regular serial number range for the CZ 24 pistol is: 12,000-190,000 (there were some pistols produced as part of small international orders/contracts in a separate serial number range, for example, all 9-shot CZ 24 pistols range from serial number 1 to about 3,100, and are dated from 1929 to 1931). The serial number of this pistol is 22,059. It was a part of the original order for 20,000 CZ 24 pistols completed in June 1926. The pistol is factory dated 26 (1926) and it stayed in the factory warehouse until purchased by the Military also in 1926. It displays the 1926 acceptance “J, rampant lion, 26” mark of Czechoslovak Military. The pistol is unit marked to the Czechoslovak Army’s 6th infantry regiment (6P 615). CZ 24 is a meticulously crafted, well-built, robust, and reliable pistol that was very highly thought of at the time. During the German occupation (March 1939 – May 1945), the Czechoslovak Armed Forces were disarmed, and all the weapons were utilized by Germany and its allies. The CZ 24 pistols were not marked by the Germans, in any way, except for those used by the German Navy. CZ 24 pistols were also issued to the German Air Force, and Waffen-SS. The pistol is fitted with one-piece, smooth wood grips. Magazine capacity is eight rounds, and a Mauser Model 1910-style safety switch is mounted to the left of the pistol. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap holster containing one extra CZ 24 magazine."

Serial Number: 192925. Quite possibly, this is the very last CZ 24 pistol ever manufactured. No import marks. All components match: barrel, frame, and slide. The pistol appears to be an old re-blue of excellent quality. While similar looking, this is not a CZ 27 pistol. CZ 24 was an improved version of the CZ 22, which had been licensed from Mauser. Production of the CZ 24 started in August 1925. The original order for 20,000 pistols was completed in June 1926. Overall, approximately 200,000 CZ 24 pistols were made. An inventory on January 1, 1939, showed the Czechoslovak Army and Air Force had on hand 171,756 CZ 24 pistols. According to various sources, the regular serial number range for the CZ 24 pistol is: 12,000-190,000. The serial number of the featured pistol is 192,925!!! The pistol displays the 1937 acceptance “J, rampant lion, 37” mark of Czechoslovak Military. CZ 24 is a meticulously crafted, well-built, robust, and reliable pistol that was very highly thought of at the time. During the German occupation (March 1939 – May 1945), the Czechoslovak Armed Forces were disarmed, and all the weapons were utilized by Germany and its allies. The CZ 24 pistols were not marked by the Germans, in any way, except for those used by the German Navy. CZ 24 pistols were also issued to the German Air Force, and Waffen-SS. Magazine capacity is eight rounds, and a Mauser Model 1910-style safety switch is mounted to the left of the pistol. Unlike early CZ 24 pistols fitted with one-piece wood grips, our later (production) CZ 24 is fitted with original one-piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. The pistol is housed in a P-64 Polish Makarov black leather holster containing an extra CZ 24 original mag."

Serial Number: 125897. No import marks. All components match: barrel, frame, and slide. It has 90% of its original bright blue finish remaining. The trigger, hammer, and extractor retain about 90% of the original straw color. While similar looking, this is not a CZ 27 pistol. CZ 24 was an improved version of the CZ 22, which had been licensed from Mauser. Production of the CZ 24 started in August 1925. The original order for 20,000 pistols was completed in June 1926. Overall, approximately 200,000 CZ 24 pistols were made. An inventory on January 1, 1939, showed the Czechoslovak Army and Air Force had on hand 171,756 CZ 24 pistols. The regular serial number range for the CZ 24 pistol is: 12,000-190,000. The serial number of this pistol is 125,897. The pistol displays the 1937 acceptance “J, rampant lion, 37” mark of Czechoslovak Military. CZ 24 is a meticulously crafted, well-built, robust, and reliable pistol that was very highly thought of at the time. During the German occupation (March 1939 – May 1945), the Czechoslovak Armed Forces were disarmed, and all the weapons were utilized by Germany and its allies. The CZ 24 pistols were not marked by the Germans, in any way, except for those used by the German Navy. CZ 24 pistols were also issued to the German Air Force, and Waffen-SS. Magazine capacity is eight rounds, and a Mauser Model 1910-style safety switch is mounted to the left of the pistol. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts (straw color is generous). Unlike early CZ 24 pistols fitted with one-piece wood grips, our later (production) CZ 24 is fitted with original one-piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. While CZ 24 pistols are quite common, it is difficult to find one in such exceptional condition. It would make a fine addition to any collection. Comes with a small plastic pistol case."

It is the same gun as the SR9 except the slide has fewer serations. All original box, packaging, owners manual and an extra SR9 magazine. Exactly 50 rounds through it.  Ruger brought this gun out as a lowewr cost option for those looking for a quality, polymer, striker fired hand gun. They put fewer serations on the slide and shipped it in a box with one magazine instead of a plastic case with 2 magazines. But if you handle it and shoot it you will realize that there are no corners cut on this firearm. The trigger is better than a Glock 19, lighter with a shorter reset, it holds 17+1 rounds, has a trigger safety and manual saftey. Think of what you liike about a Glock and a 1911 and that is what this gun is. It is striker fired with an amazing trigger, but it has a familliar feel in the hand like a 1911. Ruger replaced tis model with the Security 9. The big difference is the Security 9 has that heavy SA hammer fired trigger like the LC9. Not this beauty. If you are looking for a real duty quaity, EDC, vehicle or home defense gun, this is a steal at $300. You will NEVER find more pistol for $300 anywhere. Please, no lowballs, we all know that this is a smoking deal for this gun with the extra mag. Trades.....depends on what you have."

Serial Number: 21417. All serial numbers match. This firearm has been completely disassembled “down to the last pin and spring”. Each part has been inspected for excessive wear and tear, and then cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner to insure a smooth functioning pistol. Most parts were blasted with aluminum oxide to remove the old finish and custom Duracoated for a fine and durable finish. The pistol was then safety and function tested to ensure your satisfaction on the range. Manufactured by the Czechoslovak firm Česká zbrojovka the vz. 83 replaced the 7.62x25mm Tokarev vz. 52 pistol in Czechoslovak military service in 1983. It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blow back action. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the vz. 83 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous. Comes with a black leather holster for the CZ 83, two (2) factory 12-round magazines (with regular and aluminum base pads), and two (2) extra “CZ” wood grips. The plastic original grips are in great condition."

Non-matching serial numbers: 67685 (frame and slide) and 18904 (barrel). No import marks. It was an improved version of the CZ 22, which had been licensed from Mauser. Production of the CZ 24 started in August 1925. The original order for 20,000 pistols was completed in June 1926. More orders followed, and by the end of 1929, 100,000 pistols had been accepted by the Military and Gendarmerie, called in Czechoslovakia the “Četnictvo”. Overall, approximately 200,000 CZ 24 pistols were made. An inventory on January 1, 1939, showed the Czechoslovak Army and Air Force had on hand 171,756 CZ 24 pistols. The regular serial number range for the CZ 24 pistol is: 12,000-190,000. The serial number of this pistol is 67,685. The pistol is factory dated 27 (1927) and it stayed in the factory warehouse until purchased by the Military in 1928. It displays the 1928 acceptance “J, rampant lion, 28” mark of Czechoslovak Military. CZ 24 is a meticulously crafted, well-built, robust, and reliable pistol that was very highly thought of at the time. During the German occupation (March 1939 – May 1945), the Czechoslovak Armed Forces were disarmed, and all the weapons were utilized by Germany and its allies. The CZ 24 pistols were not marked by the Germans, in any way, except for those used by the German Navy. CZ 24 pistols were also issued to the German Air Force, and Waffen-SS. The pistol is fitted with one-piece, smooth wood grips. Magazine capacity is eight rounds, and a Mauser Model 1910-style safety switch is mounted to the left of the pistol. Comes with a brown, durable, padded pistol case (rug) with zip closure."

Serial Number: 172960. No import marks. All components match: barrel, frame, and slide. The pistol has 90% of its original bright blue finish remaining. The trigger, hammer, and extractor retain about 90% of the original straw color. Very good overall condition. It was an improved version of the CZ 22, which had been licensed from Mauser. Production of the CZ 24 started in August 1925. The original order for 20,000 pistols was completed in June 1926. More orders followed, and by the end of 1929, 100,000 pistols had been accepted by the Military and Gendarmerie, called in Czechoslovakia the “Četnictvo”. Overall, approximately 200,000 CZ 24 pistols were made. An inventory on January 1, 1939, showed the Czechoslovak Army and Air Force had on hand 171,756 CZ 24 pistols. The regular serial number range for the CZ 24 pistol is: 12,000-190,000. The serial number of this pistol is 172,960. The pistol displays the 1937 acceptance “J, rampant lion, 37” mark of Czechoslovak Military. CZ 24 is a meticulously crafted, well-built, robust, and reliable pistol that was very highly thought of at the time. During the German occupation (March 1939 – May 1945), the Czechoslovak Armed Forces were disarmed, and all the weapons were utilized by Germany and its allies. The CZ 24 pistols were not marked by the Germans, in any way, except for those used by the German Navy. CZ 24 pistols were also issued to the German Air Force, and Waffen-SS. The pistol is fitted with one-piece, smooth wood grips. Magazine capacity is eight rounds, and a Mauser Model 1910-style safety switch is mounted to the left of the pistol. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap holster containing one extra CZ 24 magazine."

So, we decided to offer a very high quality rifle, based on a forged upper and lower receiver that fits in the price point that is accessible to the majority of our supporters. We will also offer an “upgrade” package that can be purchased at a later date, to upgrade the MILSPEC components to bring the ELC in line spec-wise with the RPC."

Dillon Precision is famous for their high quality equipment and incredible NO BS lifetime warranty. Right from their website. They don't care if you are the 1st owner or the seventeenth owner.... the equipment has a lifetime warranty that will go with the equipment where ever it goes. I can't think of any other company that stands behind their products and customers like this. They don't want serial numbers or registration cards.... they want to make it right, and right now. I have personally dealt with their customer care department and was very pleased and impressed. We discussed the issue, the customer care operator worked with me to troubleshoot an issue, two days later I had a brand new replacement part on my doorstep without paying a dime (for the part or for the shipping). I didn't even need to send back the old part. Needless to say, I can't say enough about their warranty policy. Second to none!
This is what  all this equipment goes for if you purchase it from Dillon. You can have it all for $1,200.

This weapon has been upgraded with a rare FBI designed AMBI semi auto trigger pack & US Navy Seal lower housing, Sig Brace tactical folding brace, 3 additional 30 rd mags, a dual mag coupler, front night sight.  Included in the offer is a rear sight adjustment tool, small pin sling hoop, single point sling, and soft carrying case.
The AMBI feature means that the selector switch is ambidextrous, allowing control in both right and left-handed shooting situations.  Standard lower and trigger packs are referred to as SEF and the selector is only on the left side.  The AMBI system takes more than a different selector, is requires a trigger box that will accept the ambidextrous selector.  AMBI was a requirement of the US Navy to purchase the MP5 & MP5K-N for use by the Navy SEALS.
The lower housing for this weapon is true US Navy SEAL.  The pictogram shows only safe, semi, and full auto.  The SEALS do not use burst fire weapons; the extra complexity of the trigger groups lower the weapon reliability.   Having this lower housing, does not trigger a NFA issue.  It is not capable of full auto fire. 
FAB Defense TZ-5 9mm/MP5 Magazine CouplerSig Brace Folding, SBTK-5Trijon Night Sight, frontHK Rear Sight Tool – Military ContractHas both the standard trigger pack and AMBI set 
This weapon has had approx. 500 fun and flawless rounds through it.  With the brace folded, this allows using the butt of the brace as a legal front grip.  With the brace extended, accuracy is through the roof.  I am in no hurry to see this go, just wondering if there is any serious shooters looking for the ultimate MP5K clone package.
