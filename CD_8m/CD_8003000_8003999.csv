The large aperture and tapered light path maximizes the viewing area in such a small optic, allowing for fast target engagement – especially from non-standard shooting positions. Advanced lens coatings and electronics produce a crisp red dot. The brightness control dial on the MRO is specifically designed for ambidextrous usage. With a mid-adjustment “off” position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments. The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools. Hard-anodized, forged 7075-T6 housing is fully sealed and waterproof, providing durability in demanding conditions.Package Includes:1 Trijicon Logo Sticker (PR15)1 Lens Cloth1 MRO Manual1 Warranty Card1 MRO Mount Guide"

I have for sale one Dan Wesson Specialist .45ACP 1911. It’s a great, reliable, and pretty pistol. The gun shoots fantastically, the trigger is great, and overall it’s just a lovely pistol. It’s in good shape, there’s no big cosmetic issues to speak of, but it’s a used gun and will have finish wear. Mostly looking for cash, but I’m looking to fund a new mountain bike so if you happen to have a recent Santa Cruz Tallboy in an XL frame feel free to offer it up. Will come with the pistol, two magazines, and case."

I think that’s about it. Now about  The Glock 17.  It’s a gen 4.  Comes with case and everything you would expect to be in it.  Only upgrade is has is it has a skimmer trigger installed and is super nice. I put Aprox 200 rounds through it without any issues with different types of ammo.   The mags count between the two are 2 32 Round glock mags, and 4 17 Round glock mags.

I’ve exchanged a few positive emails with some good people. Yes I know, I am selling at great prices. Just for fun, I’ve also exchanged a few emails with people trying to send me worthless cashier’s checks in the hope that I would spend a lot of money to give them some of my property. Don’t send me questions about my best price. If you want to make me your best offer, go ahead although I’ve already priced my items to sell and more than reasonable price. If I said that I wanted $200 for an item, then I want to $200 for an item. Your offer of $50 cash isn’t really an offer. Anyway..........You can order these on the Internet and wait, wait, wait and see if you received a good one or not. It seemed like that It took forever for me to get used this police / military gun.Don't confuse this with the ""acceptable version"" that you can pick up cheaper, this is one of the -V ""very good rated hand selected"" pulls from inventory. The only mod that I performed, I removed the magazine safety.This is a great 1911'ish shooter.Lots of fun, but I'm more interested in real 1911s that have plenty of aftermarket options, like sights.If you want to own a bit of history, you can pick up mine locally and avoid the wait, the luck of the draw, shipping fees and FFL transfer fees.The Star BM 9mm is the compact version of the famous Star Model B. Loosely based on the 1911, the Star BM has been used all over the world for quite some time. The Star Model BM is an all-steel single-action semiautomatic that resembles the 1911 pattern pistol. Star BM’s are solidly built and a good performer pistol for the price.Firearm Features• Compact all steel 1911 Commander style slide and frame• Blued finish• Dovetailed rear sight• Fixed front sight• Black plastic checkered grip panels• Manual safety lever• Checkered spur hammer• Comes with one 8 rd. mag.Firearm Specifications• Manufacturer: Star• Model: BM• Caliber: 9mm Luger• Barrel Length: 3.77""• Overall Length: 7.25""• Height: 5.063""• Frame: Steel• Action: Single-Action with Locked Breech• Sights: Fixed (notched rear blade and serrated front ramp; plain black on black)• Beveled Magazine Well: Yes• Magazine Capacity: 8• Weight: 2.14 lbs.
This is a great price on this gun. You won’t be disappointed in the gun itself. I have extra mags and items that I also bought, that I am selling on eBay. If it doesn’t sell, I will probably buy a few more of them. I either need 0 or 4 of them.
It is a heavy gun. Perfect for the range. Maybe not for an all-day carry.
I bogged the tractor down the other day while wearing this gun on my hip, after a few trips back and forth to house wearing boots and fetching / carrying stuff and toting this chunk of steel, I put this gun down and picked up my EC9S."
