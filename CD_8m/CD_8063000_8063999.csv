Price is OBO at $1400, meet FTF in Fort Worth. Not looking to trade. No shipping at this time unless I cant move it within a decent amount of time, will update if/when that changes. Will update with better pics, currently my LG V20 has suffered the broken camera glass issue and the lens is damaged so they come out super fuzzy.
Note that it does have some light scarring in the magwell from fiddling with mag inserts since I wasn't used to the rocking motion. Could easily remove with light sanding/filing but I'll leave it as is for transparency.Please note that I work graveyard shift, so it may take a while to respond (I'll either be at work or sleeping during the day). Typically I'm on from 6am to 2pm but sometimes I'll take a nap between those times. I do check reddit during my breaks and lunch at night depending on work load. Thanks."

I would consider separating and selling as a complete upper or complete lower assembly. Complete specs are as follows:UPPER ASSEMBLY: JP Enterprises CTR-02UA“When we released the CTR-02™ (Competition Tactical Rifle of 2002), it represented an industry milestone for AR-15 rifles and is still considered the benchmark of tactical competition rifles. It has been used by the nation´s top shooters to win many matches, including the likes of Daniel Horner and Robby Johnson from the AMU. Its reliability and accuracy have become legendary.Now, other manufactures are offering similarly priced rifles that do not compare or compete, making the CTR-02™ an incredible value. The CTR-02™ upper assembly mates well with a standard forged lower receiver for an easy upgrade, and we now also offer both the CTR-02™ upper and lower as stripped receivers for the home builder. There is no doubt that the CTR-02™ will continue as a premier top-charge rifle system well into the future.”• Receiver: Machined from 7075-T6 billet upper/lower receiver set• Receiver Finish: Matte black hard coat anodizing on aluminum components• Barrel: 20” JP Supermatch™ 416R air-gauged, button-rifled, cryogenically treated barrel with Thermo-Fit™ installation and Heat sink• Barrel Finish: Polished stainless• Muzzle Treatment: JP Compensator, blended and polished BC Tactical• Caliber: .223• Hand Guard: JP Modular Hand Guard System HG-1M, JP TACTICAL RAIL, SHORT• Gas System: JP adjustable• Operating System: JP Low Mass Operating System (LMOS™)LOWER ASSEMBLY: Seekins Precision SP223 Gen2 Billet LowerPrecision CNC machined from solid billet aluminum, the SP223 Billet Lower is the best AR lower receiver available. Far exceeding Mil-Spec requirements, the SP 223 has features not found on standard lowers such as the Seekins Precision Enhanced Bolt Catch, receiver tensioning screw, ambi-bolt stop assembly and an oversized trigger guard.

Stopped carrying as it was just too valuable for something that gets left in the truck at times while parked. I liked these so much that I had a second built after this one on another alloy frame. The alloy frame is perfect for concealed carry as it removes nearly a half pound of weight from the gun.
This gun was partially built by Ed Vandenberg at Vandenbergcustom.com who has been doing pistols for me for nearly 25 years. He recommended having the gun sent to Doug Jones from acc-u-rail.com to further refine this very special build. This gun shoots flawlessly and is buttery smooth. This pistol has one of the best hi-power triggers I have used. The night sights are still bright but have lost some glow in the years it has been sitting in the safe. The cerakoting looks good but has a few nicks and some holster ear. She happily eats every ammo I have tried. Has that legendary accu-rail frame to slide tight fit.
Accurails installed by Doug Jones and spare set of rails included, Magazine safety Removed, cylinder & slide extended safety, front dovetail cut and Novak night sights installed, frame cerakoted FDE and slide cerakoted black, some wear and nicks from being an everyday carry pistol for a year. Comes with 2 magazines. 1 magazine is the rare type with spring drop assist and the second is one which came with the gun and has markings from the Austrian group for whom this pistol was originally built.Cash preferred but willing to consider interesting trades. If asking about a trade please send exactly what you are considering including any cash offered or needed to make up a value difference.I'm located near Mansfield Dam on Lake Travis, nearest cross streets being Hudson Bend and RR620. I either work from home or at the Capital Complex during the week. I will want and happy to provide a bill of sale."

All three main serial numbers are original and match. Includes shoulder strap, magazine pouches, bayonet, oil can, tool pouch, and a hard case.   The “7, 62 mm Rifle, Model of the Year 1891-30” (more easily referred to as the M91-30) was originally issued to Soviet soldiers in 1930 as an update to the previous Dragoon rifle, with changes including flat rear sights, restamping of sights in meters instead of the now-obsolete arshinii, a cylindrical receiver to replace the octagonal one used previously, and a hooded post front sight instead of a blade sight. Production ran until 1944 at only two arsenals in the Soviet Union- Tula and Izhevsk.   This particular rifle was made at Izhevsk and is the sniper model of M91-30, distinguishable by the bent bolt. Most M91-30s and other rifles of this era would have a shorter, straight bolt, but this would interfere with the PU scopes mounted above it. The bent bolt allowed easy operation without any interference."

Also the original McKeever cartridge pouch that was issued with this rifle. These are on consignment from the original owner's great grandson (he did not wish to be mentioned so I can't provide the local history). The rifle is in very nice shape. Missing the cleaning rod, but in fine shootable shape with a good bore and rifling. There is pitting in the barrel, but it's not bad for the age. Nice cartouches on the stock and all the markings are very clear and readable. There are over 50 pictures showing every detail inside and out of this package. This would make a great representative instant collection from the Indian War era. Bannerman's and other places bought surplus parts and built rifles apparantly. These rifles can be told by having the ""Model 1884' on the receiver. Its a model 1873 as evidenced by the rear sight style and the serial number which dates it to 1875 (an early one!). Also and more importantly, real Springfield 1873s and 1884s for that matter do NOT have a date on the lockplate as this one does. There's no dates on them at all.Read item #9 in this list for more info on the lockplate stamp: http://www.trapdoorcollector.com/FAQ.html$450.00 PLUS ACTUAL SHIPPING or state tax in VT, for the ENTIRE PACKAGE.

It’s in very good condition with clean metal surfaces and features a crisp trigger with a pull weight of approximately 2.5 lbs. The walnut stock has a few minor dings but otherwise is excellent. A big plus is that the original plastic buttplate was replaced by a classy Pachmayr Old English rubber pad expertly installed by Master Gunsmith Dennis Erhardt. The bore is very good with strong, sharp rifling and the muzzle crown is undamaged. The actual weight of this rifle is 5.9 lbs and the stock’s length of pull is 13.5 inches. Sorry, but I don't have the box or manual. I’m selling this rifle because I have several CZ varmint rifles including two others in 17 HM2 and a 17 Hornet, and I just don’t have time to use them all…LOL! For only $375, you can buy this rifle and be out blasting varmints. For an even better deal, I’ll sell my 17HMR ammo (over 1400 rounds) and the rifle for only $645! A trade for a nice lever action rifle in 22 Mag, 25-20, 32-20 or 357 Mag might be considered. I will ship but the shipping and full coverage insurance charges are not included in the selling price. If you want to see different pictures of the rifle let me know and I’ll try to send them at my earliest convenience. Please call REDACTED with your questions."

991,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8063991,For Trade:  .308 ammo,"NKY to Cincy, Cincinnati, Ohio",Offer,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 6, 2018",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a good bit of .308 / 7.62x51 ammo that is all factory loaded ammo, no reloads. It is all loose and mixed between lake city, federal and Winchester roads. I will not dive in to look and see how many of each I have or if they are stamped .308 or 7.62 because it would take forever and I don’t have the time or energy or mental capacity for such a task. So please do not ask as you will be ignored. I am looking to trade these for .45 ACP ammo. I know I’m not going to get what I paid for it, but I’m willing to value it low at about $0.60ish a round. So with that in mind, I’d trade 1 of my .308 rounds for 2 of your .45 ACP ammo. I just looked at field and stream, Walmart, Dunham’s, Cabelas, and rural king and can get cheap .45 target ammo for around $15.99 a box of 50 which is $0.32 a round. So if you are interested in making a deal, I’d trade up to 500 rounds of my .308 for 1000 rounds of your .45 and I will only accept factory loaded brass ammo. Sorry not interested in wasting my time to meet to trade for anything less than 500 rounds of .45call or text is preferred anytime at REDACTED and please leave a message if I don’t answer. I will return the call shortly."

The clean metal surfaces are in very good condition and the rifle has a crisp trigger with a pull weight of approximately 2.5 lbs. Unfortunately before I owned this rifle, a piece of the nice walnut stock split off from the left side of the forend but it was glued solidly back into place. It doesn’t look pretty but is very functional and not rubbing on the barrel. The bore is very good with strong, sharp rifling and the muzzle crown is undamaged. The actual weight of this rifle is 5.9 lbs and the stock’s length of pull is 13.4 inches. Sorry, but I don't have the box or manual. I’m selling this rifle because I have several CZs along with many rimfire rifles in other brands. They are very accurate but I just don’t have time to use them all…LOL! For only $275, you can buy this rifle and be out having fun this spring plinking tin cans and blasting varmints. A trade for a nice lever action rifle in 22 Mag, 25-20, 32-20 or 357 Mag might be considered with cash added on my end as needed. I will ship but the shipping and full coverage insurance charges are not included in the selling price. If you want to see different pictures of the rifle let me know and I’ll try to send them at my earliest convenience. Please call REDACTED with your questions."
