The Ranger's blade has a 9"" blade with a full .25"" thickness and a parkerized aluminum guard. Overall length 14.5"", handle 5.5"" weight 1.18 pounds. The bottom edge is plain, as is the sharpened top edge. The blade is made of 440C stainless steel, with a flat gray bead blasted finish. The blades are heat treated, sub-zero stabilized and double drawn to 57-58 RC. This gives a combination of toughness, edge holding and corrosion resistance that is hard to match even with much more expensive steels. The handle scales are black canvas micarta. Black Canvas micarta not only looks good but it also provides a very good gripping surface as well as being impervious to heat, cold, oil, water and other things that would destroy most handle materials. The sheath is made from black Kydex and features a belt loop. I bought new for $275 thinking I'd take it on my next deployment, but my health had other plans.

The improvement reduces projectile deformation as it passes through the bore during the firing sequence and the projectile stays uniform instead of squeezing material on opposite side grooves. Hence, the more uniform projectile, the better the accuracy.   All Finished Barrels go through a 100% Inspection Process.   Inspections Equipment includes CMMs and Air Gauges for the Bores.   Our expectations is that our Barrels, 16 inch or longer, will hold a 1.000"" MOA at 100 yards with appropriate ammo and shooting techniques.

I have all the items that came with the ""kit"" (bayonet, oil cans, strap, field tools) that comes with the gun. All numbers are matching.This is a interwar built gun which typically has better build quality than war time weapons due to it not being rushed out of the factory door. Looking for 300 OBO.

The action is also smooth and enjoyable. The seriel number places the rifle as manufactured in 1917 at W+F in Bern. The rifle comes with a correct non-matching bayonet thats very sharp and a sling. I've personally fired less than 100 rounds through it, since I kept it as more of a wall hanger to enjoy. I do not believe the wood has been sanded or altered, and there is not troop tag underneath the buttplate. The only issues are a couple of small mark and the bakelite has a few very thin cracks, and the usual water damage on the metal buttplate. Otherwise, the rifle is very solid."

I've put roughly 500 rounds of 5.56 on it. I also have a KAK industries blade type arm brace, and a 5.56 destroyer muzzle break I'd consider working into a deal. The arm brace was purchased and used on the lower since new, and the break has only had 40-60 rounds thru it. To be completely honest, I don't recommend using this break on a pistol length AR. It's absolutely obnoxious for the shooter. Yes this is a built lower, not a factory assembled lower. I do understand some people's reluctance. Im a experienced builder, this isnt my first by a long shot. I take my time and pay attention to detail. I take the time to use magnifying appliances and jewlers files to smooth ruff edges the factory lets out the door and cold blue touch up to help with rust prevention. I built this to be something I would stake my life on and its never missed a beat. I'm only offering it up because I built a little nicer lower and dont really need this one too. I have no pressure to make a deal, just figured I'd see if I can swap it out to something I could use more right now. Cash prices are $150 for the lower, $180 for the lower with either the brace OR the break, $210 for all three. These are the meet me with cash in Danville city limits prices.  Because of trolls and just a$$holes in general, I don't travel very far, no deal is final until we shake hands and say it's a deal in person. Due to spam, I don't respond to the ""still available"" ""bottom dollar"" or vague offers."

In development for more than four years, the VP Series is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP, but the VP Series breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. Heckler & Koch pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP40 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six grip side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP Series has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature found on VP pistols is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. VP40 pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines; either 13-round or reduced, 10-round capacity magazines. VP Series pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces (160 grams). VP pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP40’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. The VP40 is essentially the same dimensions as the 9 mm VP9 model. The overall height of the VP40 is one millimeter (.04 inch) taller. The VP40 also weighs 2.37 ounces (67 grams) more, 28.93 ounces for the VP40 versus 26.56 ounces for the VP9. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the VP Series is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The VP40 has a suggested retail cost of $719. A law enforcement configuration VP40 with tritium night sights and three magazines is also available for $819. New for 2016 are Flat Dark Earth (FDE) models, VPs with special colorants added to the frame during the molding process creating the tan/brown color scheme increasing used by military and security units. The frame’s color is indestructible, permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change.Length: 7.34""Height: 5.45""Width: 1.32""Barrel: 4.09""Sight Radius: 6.38"""

I have since gone in a different direction all together with my collection.
 
Rhino Arms was a very innovative company based in the St. Louis MO area. They made Ridiculously over engineered products, with the highest quality components. I Never heard of them until I had a friend who did their photography that showed me the quality and the accuracy of their products.The rifle is crazy accurate, my best group was .648 with a few handholds I had left. The rifle is not light and the whole thing is built like a tank. Its the tightest tolerance and upper and lower fit I have ever seen. The rifle doesn't wobble or move at all, you can tell the quality is there. The company unfortunately ended up going out of business from what I heard was poor management of R&D and sales. Way to much R&D, no advertising and high priced components didn't mix well. This is the hybrid between the DMR model and the regular RA-5R, the sticker price was $3400.
 
The rifle has a nickel boron coated factory BCG, a 2 stage match nickel boron coated trigger as well as the PRS stock. This is Their 16in fluted heavy Match barrel as well. The picture below is the exact rifle, my friend used to take all of their photos and this was one I found of the rifle before I got it from him. The round count is around 300 on it, with about 2 mags ran suppressed. The sale if for the rifle only and does NOT come with the bipod, optic. This sits in my safe as I shoot other things much more. If you know about Rhino, their short reputation was all about their crazy good accuracy and the rifles even came with a .5 MOA guarantee from the factory, ballsy claims but several reviews on their old website support the claims.
 
Wanting to trade towards a Larue PredatoOBR or towards KAC items. I would also sell the rifle outright for 2000. This rifle was $3400 new, trade value at 2800.NOT an SR25, LMT MWS, Larue, or a GAP rifle."

It is quite simply one of the most badass rifles out there. With a 16"" barrel you are able to maneuver this firearm much easier than the fullsize 22"" M1A, and it is softer shooting than the 18"" Scout with its incredible muzzle brake. It will be loud...but you're not a pussy who worries about such things. You're the kind of person that wants a .308 that is hard-hitting, accurate, and small enough to fit inside an AR sized case or inside your car. It has a picatinny rail on top so you can throw other cool shit like red dot optics or scout scopes on it, but I enjoy the iron sights that are outfitted with a tritium front post from XS Sight Systems. I used this for about 8 months now and fielded it only once to take out some pigs that were terrorizing the ranches up in Paso Robles, CA.  And I can assure you that this firearm is sighted in and ready to go. I've put less than 100 rounds through it. I have some extra goodies that come with this thing, but I'm only interested in selling this to someone who can appreciate this firearm. If you're a serious buyer and you have your ID and FSC card ready to go for a PPT then feel free to contact me. If you didn't understand what I just said in that last sentence, then this might not be for you. Here's what it comes with...-Original Springfield Armory bag, lock, and instruction manual-Original 10 rd Magazine-And some other goodies *I have over 500 rounds of Hirtenberger .308 that I can sell to you for $200*If you're thinking about getting a lower deal on it may I suggest purchasing a Smith and Wesson SD .40 cal. This is a big boy toy for adults so that means the price is firm. THE PPT WILL TAKE PLACE AT TURNER'S OUTDOORSMAN IN TORRANCE. 18305 HAWTHORNE BLVD, TORRANCE."

Rifle comes with hard case, (2) 5 round magazines, sling attachments, and a 2-7 x 32 long eye relief Tacfire scope. Scope is a great value scope that with its long eye relief pairs nicely with this rifle. Rifle is new unfired from the factory:The Steyr Scout provides the ideal solution for versatility, durability, accuracy and reliability in a compact and lightweight bolt-action rifle platform. Developed in a nearly decade-long collaboration with legendary Marine Corps Lt.Col. Jeff Cooper, the Scout boasts an extensive list of innovative features.The lightweight bolt-action, all-purpose Steyr Scout rifle was designed to accept a low-powered, forward-mounted scope for accurate fire and both-eyes-open operation to detect flanking dangers. Backup “ghost-ring” iron sights integrated to the top rail can be deployed within seconds should the optics fail. The rifle can also be fitted with a standard scope, should the need arise.In keeping with Cooper’s requirement for a magazine cutoff, Steyr incorporated a two-position magazine system that allowed the rifle to be fed individually with the five-round magazine in a lowered position. The magazine could be seated one step further with minimal pressure, allowing the bolt to feed cartridges directly from the magazine. A second five-round backup magazine is contained in the buttstock in case of an urgent need to reload.With a fluted, cold-hammer-forged barrel measuring 19 inches, an overall length of 38.6 inches and an out-of-the-box weight of just 6.6 pounds, the Scout is a breeze to pack out on long adventures, patrolling the farm or taking a quick trip to the range. The compact design of the stock features an innovative integrated bipod that is hardly noticeable until it is folded out from the stock. Between the bipod legs is a UIT rail for attachments, and the stock is outfitted with five press-and-twist sling-swivel attachment points that allow the addition of Cooper’s favored Ching Sling on either side of the rifle.The Steyr Scout is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety’s release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position.Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card. Please add 3% for credit card fees."
