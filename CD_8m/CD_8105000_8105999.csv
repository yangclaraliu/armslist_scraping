LN Smith & Wesson Shield in 9mm, with a manual safety. I am the original owner, purchased new from Cabella's. I carried this for work in a high risk job, and trusted my life with it. Due to a change in position, I no longer need to pocket carry. Never failed me once at the range. It didn't need a ""break in"", it was perfect out of the box. It shot anything I put through it. Never fired reloads.Cash sale price includes the firearm, with all the original packaging, manuals, and lock. 3 - 8 round and 1 - 7 round magazines. I have an additional 7 round magazine somewhere, and will include it if I can find before it sells. Also included, 40 - Sig Jacketed Hollow Points, 2 holsters, and a soft carry case. Also included is a small cell phone case that clips to your belt, and VERY discreetly holds 2 - additional 8 round magazines. Sale is face to face, cash, preferably in my Palatine home, which is the address on my FOID. I'm open to safe and reasonable alternative locations. We will not be loading the firearm in my home. I have some snap caps if you wish to cycle a few dummy rounds through it.All laws followed, 3 day wait after we agree, and you send me your FOID card. No sale to anyone under 21. Validity of your FOID will be checked prior to meeting on the Illinois State Police website. Bill of sale will be completed.I don't know why I bother, because the scammers will try anyway... I won't ship, under any circumstances (being deployed, out of town for a funeral, offer me way too much $$$ many to ship). ""I'm a cop, so the 3 day does not apply to me"". Uh-huh. No, I won't drive into the city and meet you on a corner, even if you offer me extra $$$. Not looking for any trades. I do not need or want anything other than cash.If it's listed, it's still available. I am not in a hurry sell it, I just no longer need it.Pricing is more than fair. That being said, I will lower the price $10 each time it does not sell and I bump this to the top of the listings.Let's keep this simple & straightforward. Additional pictures can be taken if there's something you need to see. These pictures were taken by me, today (the day I listed it).Thanks for looking,Bill"

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semi-automatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

I first bought this shotgun brand new two years ago as a stock VEPR 12 with a folding stock. Since then I had the professionals at Legion USA cut the barrel to 13"" and re-thread it for a ""GK-02 Ilyin"" that was welded and permanently attached giving it the overall legal shotgun barrel length of 18"". I also had a gunsmith professionally fit and install a Zentico B-20U hand guard as well as a Molot competition magwell. The grip has also been replaced with a Zenitco PK-3 pistol grip for the AK. I also have a Zenitco PK-1 front AK grip on the hand guard. The trigger is an ALG AKT trigger that makes this thing an absolute dream to shoot! This VEPR also has the snake hound machine heavy springs kit as well as a KNS precision front ball sight post. I may have missed some upgrades but all in all I have just over $2,400 in this with all the parts and gun smithing labor. I have fired less than 100 shells out of this gun so it is basically brand new. I am asking $1,600 cash no trades.
