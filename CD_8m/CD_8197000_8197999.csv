Looking for trades only and I'm not interested in any handguns but maybe a Glock 19c or a Glock 23c and will need add cash to those in a trade. Do your research look online these are not made this is not a blued model I have the original grips and a couple other sets of Reps for it and a holster and speedloaders and some ammo. Only looking for modern firearms no shotguns or muzzleloaders for bolt actions. Sp89 what interest me also brother exotic firearms but no interest in AK-47 or AR-15. I am not shipping this will be a local face-to-face deal and if you're from out of state in your in this local area it'll have to go through an FFL dealer.

This pistol looks and works great. It's a solid, metal replica that is accurate and feels very satisfying to shoot.  I have probably only put about 7 CO2 cartridges through it. It has been oiled per the manufacturer’s recommendations, using RWS Air Chamber Lube on the tip of each CO2 cartridge, and RWS Spring Cylinder Oil on the moving parts of the gun. This gun has never been dropped, mishandled, jammed, or had issues of any kind.  This gun gets great reviews at PyramydAir, averaging about 4.5 stars with over 90 reviews.When I Chrony tested the gun, it fired 5 16-shot magazines starting at 444fps and ending at 400fps.  On the sixth magazine, the speed steadily dropped below 400fps.  This means it gets about 80 shots per CO2 cylinder.Also included are some extras: UTG 1x30 Tactical Dot Sight with Red/Green Dot Reticle (Model SCP-RD40RGW-A)Umarex Universal Airgun Laser SightUniversal Pistol Tactical Rail Mount (Made of Aluminum)(2) Full Bottles of 1500 Steel Umarex BB's(1) Partial Bottle of 1500 Steel Umarex BB'sThis would all cost about $150 new."

Though at this time someone I carefor needs the money, and well a gun just isn't worth family need. So I'm hoping to find this amazing rifle a good home. It's in great condition, and with the stainless steel bore I've never had issues. Trigger is crips, and works great. I take it apart and clean it after each competition use."

Most after market parts are made for this model   While this may not be the ""latest and greatest"" glock for you to spend your money on, but its a proven shooter for people how are   more concerned a reliable EDC than buying the latest marketing ploy. Lets face it, as long as you do your part I doubt a criminal trying to kill you  is going to know   the difference if they take two rounds to the chest from a gen 3 or gen 4.   2.

I'm not going to meet in a parking lot,  field, or in the woods. Meet me in my apartment. I'm not a criminal. If I was, I'm not so stupid to rob someone after having an email trace and on arms list.

You can conceal carry when you pick  up the weapon, just take your shoes off so you don't ruin the floor. I don' t want my wife kicking my ass.4. Yes, I'm black, contrary to youtube videos, and world star hip hop shit, I speak proper english and I'm an American first. I don't hate you because you    are white, and i could give a shit as long as the content of your character has integrity. I'm a conservative even though I don't trust any politician.7. You need to have no criminal record, and have a ID and sign a bill of sale/trade. So incase you sell the gun or do something illegal I can show the    authorities that it not my gun anymore. 8. I work all the time so I will only be able to answer email once a day, this doesn't mean i'm ignoring you. Just means I prefer not to spend my free time   checking email and using facebook. I will do my best to respond to everyone, if I can't its nothing pesonal.  I'll also be very honest and to the point    as not to waste your time.

Most after market parts are made for this model   While this may not be the ""latest and greatest"" glock for you to spend your money on, but its a proven shooter for people how are   more concerned a reliable EDC than buying the latest marketing ploy.

I'm not going to meet in a parking lot,  field, or in the woods. Meet me in my apartment. I'm not a criminal. If I was, I'm not so stupid to rob someone after having an email trace and on arms list. In addition, odds are you are a concealed carrier and I don't want to get shot or go to jail because I'm not a criminal. You can conceal carry when you pick  up the weapon, just take your shoes off so you don't ruin the floor. I don' t want my wife kicking my ass.4. Yes, I'm black, contrary to youtube videos, and world star hip hop shit, I speak proper english and I'm an American first. I don't hate you because you    are white, and i could give a shit as long as the content of your character has integrity. I'm a conservative even though I don't trust any politician.7. You need to have no criminal record, and have a ID and sign a bill of sale/trade. So incase you sell the gun or do something illegal I can show the    authorities that it not my gun anymore. 8. I work all the time so I will only be able to answer email once a day, this doesn't mean i'm ignoring you. Just means I prefer not to spend my free time   checking email and using facebook.

The multi-configurable M1 variant of the AUG A3 platform is the latest generation of the venerated bullpup platform. Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is available in a Short-Rail version, a High-Rail version as well as an Integrated-Optic version with either a 1.5X or 3X scope. The AUG A3 M1 Optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate accessories like a close-quarters holographic sight. With 16 numbered slots, the High-Rail version was designed to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-slot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver. The AUG A3 M1 boasts an overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG’s matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions. The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger. The receiver was also updated to replace the permanently affixed front sling swivel with a VLTOR Quick-Disconnect Sling Swivel, which makes two-point sling attachment or removal extremely fast and easy, and users of single-point slings can remove the front sling swivel entirely, if they so desire.

The Es340b is a single shot trainer type rifle. BUG proofed. EXCELLENT bore and rifling. has some very minor spots of surface rust and dirt. These are THE Rolls Royce of .22 target rifles. Some says even better and more accurate than Anshutz rifles! They are built amazingly well. This particular one, according to some dated rifles, was made in the summer of 1938. Now, this WAS a bringback from WW2 that came out of an estate sale. Thus the mismatched bolt. I have read many veteran's accounts of these rifle being used by snipers because of their deadly accuracy and low noise. Also there actually ARE verified rifles that were used by Hitler Youth outfits. Just some back stories, not saying this one was! Buy the rifle, not the story. The BUG/459 marks are the proof stamps from the Oberndorf-am-Neckar proofhouse where Mausers were and are built. The little letter you see between Oberndord and Neckar is 'a' - the abbreviation for 'am' - on. The Neckar is the river that runs through Oberndorf, and was the early power source for many industries there. The D.RG.M. is a stamp applied to most, if not all, German-made items between the beginning of the 20th century and the outbreak of WW2. They mean Deutsches Reichs Gebrauchsmuster - 'German Kingdom [sic] registered pattern'. DRP means Deutsches Reichs Patente - patented pattern. The receiver, barrel and stock numbers all match. It's doubtful you will find a more accurate rifle built like a brick $h*thouse! These rifles can bring $900-$1,000 in excellent shape. The bolt, rear sight and metal are worth my asking price alone!$450.00 plus actual shipping . I NEVER charge more than it costs ME to ship!
