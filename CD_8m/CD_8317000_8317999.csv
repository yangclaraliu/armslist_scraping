It includes a the complete bolt carrier group (BCG) and VLTOR/BCM Gunfighter charging handle with extended latch. The round count is relatively low, and it has been meticulously maintained by a US Marine. This is a complete upper receiver assembly, but it is not a complete firearm. A lower receiver assembly is required.The PWS piston system operates by a gas piston attached by a rod to the BCG, rather than a gas tube. This keeps the gasses away from the BCG keeping the action clean, cooler, and functional after countless rounds. A piston operated AR15 is exceptionally reliable and requires far less cleaning.

LOL  Overall, I would say excellent condition and has a low round count, very clean.  Very handy pistol caliber carbine for home defense, to keep in your vehicle or even use for light short distance hunting as the 16"" barrel gets you 200-300fps more, depending on the load, which equals a lot more energy on your target.  Perfect addition if you have one of the Ruger pistols that use the same mags.  These were produced from 1997-2006, this is a '99 model.
$680 in cash.  Did a quick check and most of the current listings I found on GB and others places are going from $700-$800, some higher, so price is firm at this time. Will trade for a clean basic model Sig P938 and $200 or another Chiappa Pak 9 with folding brace, extras, if just the pistol, I'll need $240 cash with it.Not interested in other trades, unless it's a worthwhile offer.  On trades, let me know what you have and EXACTLY what the deal is up front and I'll get back to you either way. Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX and have valid ID.Thanks for looking!"
