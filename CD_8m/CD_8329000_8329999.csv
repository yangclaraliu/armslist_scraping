A built-in infrared illuminator with 3 power levels makes the Pulsar Digisight N750A Rifle Scope usable even when there's no ambient light available, illuminating targets of any size at a considerable distance. The Pulsar N750A Night Vision Scope is no slouch on the optics and mechanical ends, either. The scope gets you on target faster with its one-shot zeroing method, and gives you a generous 67mm of eye relief and a 50 mm focusable lens. ThePulsar N750A also features a high-power digital zoom capable of increasing the magnification from 4.5x to 6.75x. Combined with the powerful detection range of up to 600 meters, this makes the Pulsar Digisight N750A Night Vision Rifle Scope an ideal sight for long-range nighttime shooting.SPECIFICATIONS FOR PULSAR DIGISIGHT DIGITAL NV RIFLESCOPE N750A:Generation: DigitalMagnification: 4.5-6.75xObjective Lens Diameter: 50mmField of view: 5 degrees angularEye relief: 67mmBuilt-in IR flashlight: Laser 780nmResolutions: 55 lines per mmMax detection range: 600mDiopter setting: +-4 DClose-up range: 5mOperating voltage: 3.7V .... 6 4*AAExternal power supply: DC 9VPower consumption: 15W / 3WWater intrusion rating (IEC 60529): IP44Operating temperature: -20C to +50 CDimensions: 340x95x94mmOperating time with IR: 3.5 hoursOperating time without IR: 4 hoursFEATURES OF PULSAR N750A DIGISIGHT NIGHT VISION RIFLE SCOPE:* Superb image quality; high resolution* 1-shot zeroing* Long eye relief* Built-in laser IR illuminator with three-step power adjustment* Resistant to bright light exposure* Built-in and external power supply* Lightweight and durable composite housing* Intuitive easy-to-use interface* Wireless remote control* Wide range of operating temperature* Internal focusing* Additional weaver rail for accessories* Video output* Built-in flip up objective lens cover"
