This gun has about 450- 500 rounds through it. I also put $165 trijicon night sights on it that are Brandnew and have the packaging for that along with the factory plastic sites. I also have got the box and all 3 magizines for it. I’m asking for $620 OBO mainly because the gun sells for $579 new and I have upgraded the sights and with all money added up I have $744 in the gun.  So if you buy this gun from me as a cary gun then you end up with a good deal because you get great night sights on a practically brand new gun for $120 less.
