If you want a thermal rifle scope to give you the ultimate advantage, Put the Pulsar Apex XQ50 2.8-11.2x42mm Thermal Riflescope at the top of your list for detecting targets through fog, rain and total darkness. The APEX XQ50 uses Increased Recognition and Detection Software (IRIS) capable of detecting heat signatures from big game at a distance of up to 1700 meters.
Introduced as the first Pulsar thermal imaging scope, the Apex continues delivering vivid images using an uncooled 384x288 microbolometer and 50 Hz frame rate together with an AMOLED display. By using heat signatures instead of available light, the Apex is not affected by bright light exposure and provides three operating modes (Identification, Forest and City) to match your conditions.
Along with the standard one-shot zeroing feature, you can save three zeroing profiles at up to five distances. The internal focus adjustment gives you a 2x continuous digital zoom along with a Picture in Picture function to provide both a magnified view of your reticle along with a virtually unobstructed field of view image.
The 384x288 microbolometer and 50 Hz frame rate detects heat signatures for viewing on a 640x480 AMOLED displayAn array of reticle choices ensures quick target acquisition and a contrasting sight pictureThe zeroing profile memorization lets you save up to 5 zeroing profiles to ensure accuracyPicture in picture function uses just 1/10 of the display area to offer a close-up view of your reticle areaThree imaging operation modes improves imaging based on your current conditions and situation"

These are actually Military & Police Models of 1905 with change four that were chambered for the 38 S&W cartridge with a 200 grain bullet. The factory called it the 38/200 British Service Revolver and it was designed to fire the British service ammunition. The K-200's were built to commercial standards as the British Service Revolver during early 1940 till 1945 in the 38 S&W caliber. A normal 38 special round will only go about 3/4 of the way into the cylinder. These revolvers have 5 inch, pinned barrels, a six shot cylinder, fixed sights, case colored hammer and front serrated case hardened trigger. Both are marked ""Made in U.S.A."" on the forward right side plate with the standard size S&W Trade Mark in the larger rear area. Also stamped with flaming bomb and ""U.S. Property G.H.D."" on left side of top strap. They also have a ""P"" stamped on the left side frame just forward of the hammer. One weapon has been British Proofed with the appropriate stamps to include each cylinder. The second revolver has no country proof marks so it may not have made the trip overseas or to Canada like most did under the Lend-Lease Program. Both are in very good 85%+ condition with scattered finish wear. Both have the smooth grips with typical usage marks/dings and lanyard rings attached. Both bores are in excellent condition with good timing and lock-up. Serial number V584xxx has the British proofs and serial number V702xxx does not. $450 for individual purchase or will sell both for $800. No shipping."

Roughly 100 rounds of Russian steel core surplus and a few boxes of modern commercial ammo as well as some soft point Winchester hunting rounds. Total close to 1000 rounds. Unsealed ammo will come in a .50 cal can.The rifle is like most Chinese type 53 carbines in that it looks rough but never endured multiple wars (started production in 1953, this one is 1955) so they are exceptionally accurate and also have very clean, light trigger pulls. This one is far more accurate than I am. Bolt is not sticky, cycles cleanly. Would be a good candidate for a scoped target or deer rifle. Optimistically asking $900 and will listen to reasonable offers. Info says norinco, closest I could find."
