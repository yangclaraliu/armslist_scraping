Caliber: 9 mm para (9x19)
HISTORY
Perhaps the most successful military handgun of all time is the Browning High Power. The Browning Hi Power has saved the lives of many allied troops. In terms of sheer numbers the Browning stands alone. The pistol was adopted by over one hundred nations and remains on the front lines in many third world nations as well as a favorite of collectors, shooters and citizens.
Its origins begin with manufacture in Belgium. Among a very few license built copies of the Browning is the FM Browning from Argentina.
Argentina loves the High Power 9 mm – the model that I’m selling.  This started in Argentina in 1937 when the Federal Police ordered Browning High Powers from Fabrique Nationale (FN) in Belgium for its officers.  Later in the 1960's Belgian made High Powers were ordered for Argentine Army officers.
The licensing agreement between Argentina and FN specifically permitted the export of Argentine made High Powers. 
FEATURES
The pistol has a reputation for excellent ergonomics and comfortable to handle as in the tradition of the Browning Hi Power.  The High Power settles into the hand as though it had been custom fitted.  It points naturally, and balances perfectly.
Extremely fun to shoot!  Comfortable, accurate, and have a tendency to make the shooter look good. 
As you might expect, recoil is very manageable.
Sights:  Has the excellent and proven three dot high visibility sights offer a good sight picture and can be acquired quite quickly.
Diamond pattern neoprene grips for a sure fitted feel and nice control.
High capacity magazine included.
Definitely a worthy gun on all counts.

This is a de-banned Norinco NHM90 that started life as a pre-ban 56S (Triangle 56 Factory rifle. Polytech Factory). The rifle was caught up in customs at the beginning of the import ban in 1990 hence the birth of the post ban NHM90. (Norinco 56S xxx'd out NHM90) The NHM90's still possessed a threaded barrel that was covered in a barrel cap and came with the hideous thumb hole stock's. This rifle has had the furniture swapped with the correct Chinese wood and the barrel cap has been removed and correct slant brake has been added with the detente pin still intact. Comes with one magazine and original Chinese sling. The rifle was a 56S built rifle and shares the 1.5mm thick receiver and heavy chrome lined barrel. Just like the Mak 90's and Polytech rifles. You will never get closer to the real thing.

Everything pictured is included (minus the kids' toys in the back.....come on now) - Sig CP1 3x scope (red/green illumination), Diamondhead flip-up backup sights, angled foregrip and bipod, MFT Adjustable stock, an SA15 lower, and of course the Drago bag behind it all.Included, but not pictured, are 330 rounds of 300BLK set in 10-round metal clips for easy loading, 6 Lancer magazines in FDE, and a second barrel in 5.56.If this rifle is new to you, its special feature is that it takes AR parts, but operates like an AK. There's no buffer tube assembly, it has a non-reciprocating forward charging handle, and you're able to run it in .223/5.56, 300BLK, 7.62, and even 9mm if I'm not mistaken. The barrel is interchangable without need of a shop making it quite versatile.I've put around 400 rounds through it without any hiccups and it's a great rifle - I simply don't shoot anymore as much as I'd like to and need to start downsizing before moving in the future.I'm asking $1600 or /reasonable/ best offer, more pictures available upon request! I'm not in a big hurry to sell so if this posting is up then it's still available.Feel free to contact me with any questions!"

DESCRIPTION
First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.
Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lbs. pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.
Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.
Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9 mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.

No import mark anywhere, this was surely brought back by a member of the US military after WW1 ended. These revolvers were issued to Austro-Hungarian NCOs, Officers, and machinegunners to use as a sidearm during the war. An extremely cool piece of history. Shoots 8mm Gasser. The revolver is in pretty good condition for being 103 years old. Patina is all original, never messed with in any way. All matching numbers. Also comes with an original WW1 production (STS) Austro-Hungarian holster and 40 rounds of 8mm Gasser ammo.

In many applications it will advance modularity past the current 1913 rail system.The BCM KMR Alpha also allows for a larger range of modularity offering 4 different offset mounting positions between traditional 3,6,9, and 12:00 positions.In the most basic of applications the KeyMod™ system allows for universal modularity between various manufacturers of accessories, and accessory rails. A big win for the trigger puller. As the industry advances the modular accessories will mount directly to the KeyMod™ instead of picatinny, allowing for a lighter, cleaner, and less bulky weapon system.*Includes BCM® KeyMod™ Sling Mount “Please note: Nylon/Polymer Picatinny rail sections are for NON-load bearing accessories only.

The removable booster extension allows the user to configure the length of the suppressor to fit their needs. The silencer is user serviceable ensuring long, high performance service life. The front caps can be interchanged for a smaller 22 caliber front cap, available separately. 17-4 stainless heat treated baffles, with anti-rotation RTZ™ (Return To Zero) Geometry features, ensure maximum strength and sound performance. The booster assembly includes a piston for a turnkey suppressor system out of the box. Included take down tools allow for an easy and satisfying end user maintenance experience. Additional pistons, fixed barrel spacers, an integral 3 lug adapter, and fixed direct thread mounts are available to support the Revolution in any configuration the end user could desire. High quality, industry leading performance, strength, unparalleled feature functionality, build quality, and price make the Revolution a clear winner in the modular class of silencers.    The Revo 9 can also be configured into a short (K) configuration by removing the stainless black oxide external booster housing extension and collapsing the booster housing or 3 lug assembly into the silencer tube. This configuration is best used wet. By adding 5cc's of rem oil, wire pulling gel, or some other ablative medium sound suppression can be dampened extremely well in the short configuration.    The Revo 9 is shipped in it's full size configuration with an included 1/2x28 booster piston to run on your 9mm pistol barrels. However the user can swap out the included piston with other pistons for use on metric threaded barrels.

The removable booster extension allows the user to configure the length of the suppressor to fit their needs. The silencer is user serviceable ensuring long, high performance service life. The front caps can be interchanged for smaller calibers with 9mm and 22 caliber front caps, available separately. 17-4 stainless heat treated baffles, with anti-rotation (Return To Zero) Geometry features, ensure maximum strength and sound performance. The booster assembly includes a piston for a turnkey suppressor system out of the box. Included take down tools allow for an easy and satisfying end user maintenance experience. Additional pistons, fixed barrel spacers, an integral 3 lug adapter, and fixed direct thread mounts are available to support the Revolution in any configuration the end user could desire. High quality, industry leading performance, strength, unparalleled feature functionality, build quality, and price make the Revolution a clear winner in the modular class of silencers.    The Rev 45 can also be configured into a short (K) configuration by removing the stainless black oxide external booster housing extension and collapsing the booster housing or 3 lug assembly into the silencer tube. This configuration is best used wet. By adding 5cc's of rem oil, wire pulling gel, or some other ablative medium sound suppression can be dampened extremely well in the short configuration.    The Rev 45 is shipped in it's full size configuration with an included .578x28 booster piston to run on your 45acp pistol barrels. However the user can swap out the included piston with other pistons for use on 40 S&W, or 9mm. Additionally our integral 3 lug 9mm QD assembly can be interfaced if desired to run on 9mm MP5's, AR carbines, or any 9mm wearing a standard 3 lug coupler.   The Return to Zero baffles key together so that every time you disassemble the silencer and put it back together you can achieve the same baffle orientation so that your point of impact shift will remain the same negating the need to re-zero your carbine or pistol after servicing.

It is one of the lightest most durable, accurate, and high performance 5.56mm suppressors on the market.

The included Taper Mount ensures minimal and repeatable point of impact shift with only minor weight gain. The Recce 5 achieves out of this world sound performance vs its size. Utilizing our Patented Efficiency baffle technology this compact suppressor drops SPL by 35db on a 14.5"" M4 while keeping gas blow-back to normal levels. To increase performance for military users a high efficiency low profile flash suppressor was integrated into the front of the suppressor. This feature reduces flash, providing minimal signature for the user in low light environments. Also new to the Recce 5 (MOD 4) is a tuned, Patented baffle system offering the apogee of multi-caliber sound performance. Elite tactical units requested minimal flash signature and Griffin responded by developing a low-profile flash reducer integral to the suppressor.    For users seeking a dual role suppressor that can run on both tactical carbines and precision varmint rigs this is the ticket. At 14.5 ounces the Recce 5 is extremely light on the end of the gun keeping your muzzle fast on target, and enabling fatigue free carry for extended periods of time.    The Recce 5 is CNC machined, and TIG fusion welded for maximum thermal transfer and unparalleled strength and durability. Every component in the Recce 5 is manufactured from solid billets of strong, heat treated, high temperature corrosion resistant 17-4ph Stainless Steel. The Recce 5 suppressor has a precision bore ensuring maximum accuracy, as well as minimum, consistent, and repeatable POI shift.
