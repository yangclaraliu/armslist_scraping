The Highway Patrolman! It is a 4” with target trigger and hammer, adjustable sights, and is pinned and recessed. The Model 28 is the twin to the famous Model 27, but with a factory brush polish type finish and no checkered top strap. The serial # dates it to about 1972.  I bought it as a shooter because I didn’t want to shoot my collectible Model 27. This gun was previously owned and carried on duty by an LEO here in Tennessee, so it does have some light wear and tiny marks from the holster and the web of his hand. Still, it is a beauty, the perfect type of old Smith you’ll be proud to own and show off but not afraid to shoot due to value. If you pick it up in Crossville I will include the vintage S&W ammo shown in the picture. It came with the gun from the LEO and still has 38 nickel cased soft points in it. If you’ve ever wanted a Model 28 that you can shoot or a Model 27 type without the price, don’t hesitate. Priced to sell immediately, below value.  Meet in or near Crossville. Please Text/Call 931 881 Six Nine32 or email through the site. As always, buyer must be legal to own a firearm in Tennessee. Check out my other listings and thanks for looking at my ad!"

I did fire it 60 times with Federal Fusion 165 grain factory ammo and it groups an honest 1"" at 100 yards. I'd assume it would do better with some load tweaking/experementing but who knows. It comes with Talley rings/bases as pictured. No ammo or scope included. I just don't have a use for it as much as I'd like to keep it. I'm mostly looking to trade but I'd take around $550 cash for it. Be a Montana resident legal to own/purchase a firearm. No shipping and I am not looking to travel to make a deal. Trades that would interest me would be a lever action in 45/70, 45 Colt, nice bolt action 223, 308, or maybe a Glock in 9mm. Revolvers too."

390,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8161390,For Sale:  TPU Throw Lever for Vortex StrikeEagle 1-6x Scope,"Tyler, East Texas, Texas",$ 16,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 28, 2018",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"PRICE INCLUDES SHIPPING!These are introductory prices and feedback/testing is more than welcome! Please EMAIL/MESSAGE me with any questions or concerns. Shipping is free to the lower 48 states.3D printed zoom levers SPECIFICALLY for the Vortex StrikeEagle 1-6x, as well as enhanced mag releases for all AR platform rifles. These are printed from unbreakable Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) which is a semi-flexible 3D printing filament. Designs were created by my brother, a graphic designer, and are Pat. Pending. We know there are similar levers out there that other individuals/companies are making but our levers have subtle differences that we know make them superior compared to the rest. We know this because we’ve done comparison testing, and none of the other slip on zoom levers have been nearly as secure and functional as ours! We have multiple colors to choose from, and can even do custom splice prints, including Red/White/Blue, Black w/ Thin Blue Line (or red), etc. I personally use both the throw lever and mag release on my AR rifles and absolutely love them. I replaced my Seekins mag releases with these because there’s no scratching sound from two anodized finishes rubbing together. These are practically silent! And as for the zoom lever, it is much more cost effective and safer to use than a bolt-on aluminum zoom lever. If you have ever ran 3 Gun competitions or even accidentally dropped your rifle and it landed on your scopes zoom lever, or the lever banged up against, or has been snagged on a fixed object, you will appreciate how forgiving these zoom levers are!The TPU material has self healing properties and a low friction coefficient which allow them to return to their previous state/position even when snagged, banged, hung, etc. on something. And even if you baby your rifles and just want the ability to EASILY & QUICKLY zoom in and out with your StrikeEagle 1-6X scope, then this zoom lever is a great choice. They also allow you to easily customize your rifle with all the different colors to choose from!Most other 3D printed zoom levers are printed out of polymer which is breakable. They are often printed way to fast (fast = sloppy) and are only made to the dimensions of a scopes zoom ring, and then bolt in place, which isn’t the case for these. They are custom made solely for the zoom ring on the StrikeEagle 1-6X scope and will NOT work on any other scope, unless of course it has the exact shape and dimensions as the SE 1-6x magnification ring!"

Now to the specs:
 
Decorated with a 24kt gold-plated ring and a medallion, the matte black 3-18x44 VX-6 Riflescopefrom Leupold is designed for distance shooting, features a TMOA reticle, and a side focus parallax corrector. The proprietary Xtended Twilight Lens System offers index-matched multiple anti-glare coatings that maximize light transmission in low-light conditions. In order to improve contrast and reduce stray light, the eco-friendly, lead-free optical elements have their edges blackened. The DiamondCoat 2 protective coatings on external surfaces protect optics from scratches. To help you compensate for wind drift and ballistic bullet drop, the scope offers 75 MOA windage and elevation adjustment ranges with a 1/4 MOA impact point correction. Located in the second focal plane, the TMOA reticle provides a total range of 20 MOA from side to side for windage and elevation compensation. The minor hash marks on the center crosshair are separated by 1 MOA.The 6061-T6 aluminum housing is lightweight and durable, waterproof and fogproof, and features a twin bias spring erector system that increases holding force by 30%. To prevent fogging-up of optics when you are moving through environments with changing temperatures, the housing is filled with a mixture of krypton and argon gases. Moreover, this riflescope is equipped with a Custom Dial System (CDS) which allows you to quickly switch the elevation of your sight-in ranges.

Took these in on trade a few years back (before Obamas EO banning these Russian imports). Ran a mag or two through each to test function and haven't touched them since. Now that there is a big commotion over gun control again, I think it might be time to pass these on to an AK shooter before it's too late.Saiga IZ132 base rifles. Guy who built these used a lot of nice parts from Midwest Industries, Rifle Dynamics, Ace RifleStocks, Stark Grips, Custom MuzzleBrakes.com, etc.I don't think these are Cerakoted but are painted with a high-grade military type coating. The green one is pretty much flawless. The tan one has the typical scratch at the safety area. To even things up, I'll throw in an Arsenal SL-13 Side mount sight mount for free.Asking $675.00 for each. If one buyer would want to take both, I'll cut them a break and sell both for $1300.00.I will also throw in a free soft case with each rifle.Thanks for looking."

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.
First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.
Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.
Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.
Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.
It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

High night sights and extended magazine capacity round out the package.
Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.
First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.
Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.
Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.
Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.
It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

The Shadow 2 features a higher beavertail and undercut trigger guard to get the shooter's hand as close to the bore axis as possible. With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. It has a swappable mag release with an adjustable, extended button and three settings to allow shooters to set it in their most comfortable spot. Also included in the box is an extended ambidextrous safety set and a number of buffers for use with lighter springs and/or hotter rounds. The Shadow 2 has target sights - fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage). Best of all, the trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset. A hardy nitride finish coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion. This model has a black nitride frame and slide finish with thin, blue aluminum grip panels.    Action: Semi-Automatic Brand: CZ Capacity: 16-20 Rounds Cartridge: 9mm Priming Method: Centerfire Action: Single/Double Barrel Type: Cold Hammer-Forged Brand: CZ Caliber: 9mm Luger Capacity: 17+1 Frame Finish: Black Nitride Frame Material: Steel Grips: Blue Aluminum Item Model: CZ 75 Purpose: Personal Protection/Sport Safety: Ambidextrous Series: Shadow 2 Sight Configuration: Fiber Optic Front, Adjustable Rear Sight Style: Fiber Optic Slide Description: Black Nitride Type: Pistol Unit of Measure: GN"

It shoots smoother than any mp5 I've ever had and has a very soft felt recoil. It is chambered in 9mm and folds up nice and tight. I am only getting rid of it because I want to start a new project/build and I need the money to do so. I hate getting rid of it because it really is the Bently of the PCC world, but I have enough guns that shoot 9mm. As you can see by the pictures it comes with 3 30 round magazines, unused cleaning kit, folding SB Tactical Brace and a Sig Romeo4 red dot optic. You can find these new for $2,200 on gunbroker with the stock. I'm asking the same. I realize that might sound ambitious, but this already comes with a high quality red dot and an extra magazine that usually runs about $60 each. I am not going to be low balled on this by any means, I do not have to sell this pistol althought that is what I want. If I cannot get a descent price for it, I won't sell. I may be open to trades considering extremely high quality pistols If it's a glock, don't bother. No, I don't want any old revolvers, shotguns, or bolt action rifles so please don't offer. I will determine the worth of the trade at the time of offer. If you would like to purchase this from out of the state of Alabama then we will need an FFL transfer. I am willing to meet with you so you can shoot it before purchasing but will only do so for serious buyers. The best way to contact me is through my cell number 816-309-0340"
