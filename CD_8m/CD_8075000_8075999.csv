Barrel: 23” Yes, I double checked and measured by placing a rod in the bore, from the breech face to the muzzle end. Length: 42” Sight / Optics:Front sight is missing. Rear sight does not have the slider. Stock / Grips:Front end of the stock has been cut down and has been wrapped in twine. There are various brass pieces that have been added to the stock. Some of the brass has some age to it, while other pieces appear to be newer, but not recent.There are a lot of dings, marks, scratches, and marks throughout the stock. Bore Condition: Bore has a lot of rust. Mechanics: The rifle should be professionally evaluated, as it may need repairs. The firing pin protrudes slightly and will not fully retract into the breech block. The tip of the firing pin is also deformed (flattened a bit). Overall Condition:Rifle is in the same state that we received it. Aside from running a patch down the bore (to better determine the condition), rifle has not been cleaned.There is some surface rust that is present on the barrel. There is also a little bit of surface rust in the chamber area. The hammer and trigger are both working properly, but the firing pin will need to be evaluated, as noted above. Most of the original finish is gone and there are signs that the rifle has been painted over the years. On the receiver, you can see slight signs of a green paint, along with good amount of brown paint. There are also signs of the same paint on some areas of the stock.The serial number on the rifle is: 24679 If anyone has any information on this that I don't know or haven't mentioned, please let me know as I am not an expert on this.Many More Pictures of this item, in our gunbroker listing, linked below. Click Here To View Our Complete Inventory.P35-304906-1"

Howco was a 'police supply' outfit that snagged an import agreement with FN to bring in about 6000 FNC's for the NJ State Police.

Stock / Grips:The stock is not original. It is a Boyd's laminate stock. Overall the stock is in pretty good condition, but there are some small scratches and a couple of areas where the clear coat has chipped off slightly. Bore Condition: Very good condition – no rust or pitting – strong rifling.Bore is clean and looks great. Mechanics: All of the functions are operating correctly. Overall Condition:I contacted Remington and they told me that the rifle was manufactured in 1978.In the last image below, I will post their response. Rifle has been fired, but well cared for. It is not perfect, but has minimal wear. Towards the top center of the barrel there are some small nicks to the barrel. On the left side of the rear scope ring, there is a small scratch that was probably caused by the screwdriver slipping. Finish is otherwise in very good condition throughout the rest of the barrel and the receive. The bolt action is smooth and locks up well. There is no damage or alterations to the barrel crown. The Boyds stock is very nice, but not original. Magazines & Accessories: Does not include any accessories.Many More Pictures of this item, in our gunbroker listing, linked below. B35-303763-1Click Here To View Our Complete Inventory"

C&R eligible. Lovely, clean stock that has been renumbered to match the receiver #, the bolt is electro pencilled to match. Metal finish about 80-90%. Bore is dark & frosty, but it shoots well with surplus or commercial ammo. Fast straight pull action.These handy carbines are hard to find these days, have plenty of history, yet can still drop a deer when needed. The only reason I'm selling is because some a**-hole damaged both my car & my wife's car one night in a hit & run, so I need the cash for repairs :(Buyer pays FFL transfer Fees. I ship to C&R FFL-03 holders, send a copy with payment. I do not have an FFL so any FFL-01 holder you may use must accept delivery from a non licensed individual. Shipping $35 via UPS.Payment by cash face to face, or USPS Money Order, no other MOs will be accepted due to forgeries. Once burned, twice shy.I've also got some ammo for sale separate from the rifle's asking price, some Pri Partisan, $25/box of 20rds, plus some Nazi 1939 ammo in boxes on Manlicher clips (clips a mix of Nazi-Austro-Hungarian) at $20/10 rounds. Some of the Prvi Partisan is on clips, I'm not sure how many I have, but they'd be $15/10 rounds. Still digging them out of my stuff. Anyone who buys the rifle & a few boxes of ammo will get any spent cases I can find for re-loading.I can ship ammo, but I'd prefer face to face. Buyer pays actual cost plus $5 for my time, gas money, packing materials & the energy expended in endlessly showing the shipper it's legal to do this & actually a service they offer (you listening, FedEx?)The Nazi ammo can give hang fires, but I've only ever had 3 actual duds out of about 60 rounds. It's powerful stuff compared to modern 8x56r ammo & corrosive, so needs cleaning after. The Partisan stuff is reload able & Non Corrosive. FYI I'll be listing an M95 long rifle next week, comes with a very hard to find bayonet (non matching #) & spare extractor. Watch this space."

It has about 1200 rounds through it and is definitely a used rifle. I have had my fun with my AR but need the money to put towards other pursuits now. This rifle was bought used from a friend and has some cosmetic damage from when he owned it. There is some light marring around the takedown pin, and the finish on the castle nut is mostly worn away. There are some minor nicks on the rails and handguard from where accessories have been mounted. However, it's a fun gun to shoot and is a perfect stepping stone for a first time AR owner. It comes with a ton of extras and a decent supply of ammo for some range fun. I'm asking 950 for the rifle and everythign with it. The price includes the following rifle and accessories, and will throw in some safety glasses, ballistol, and a quick-detach flashlight mount: Delt-Ton Sport, Optic Ready ($649.99 new)Odinworks 12.5 KMod free float handguard ($149.99 new)Magpul CTR stock, commerical buffer ($59.99 new)Vickers Combat Applications Sling ($45 new)A.R.M.S #71 L-R back up iron sights ($99.99 new)BCM Keymod Stubby Grip ($39.99 new)Magpul B.A.D.

It is one of the predecessors to the fairly popular Bersa Thunder line of handguns. DAs are pretty uncommon now, and the magazines, even reproduction ones are becoming quite expensive. The finish on it isn't great, but it's still mostly there, no rust. The grip plates still have the BERSA symbol, which seem to go missing or get damaged. The barrel is still in good shape with not pitting.Be advised, other bersa firearms are in almost no way compatible with this one. If you want a new magazine, you need a 383-DA magazine specifically. The same goes for most of the components of the gun. The barrel retaining pins are in different positions than newer models, and length is slightly shorter than a Thunder.I'm asking $300 firm, or an old .380 or 9mm glock in trade. Please only Virginia residents, I'll be asking for drivers license as proof of residence."

I bought this new firearm from Palmetto State Armory a few months ago and still have not shot it. I'm looking for cash or trading for something I might want more. This is a Glock dedicated lower, not an AR15 lower with the magwell adapter. You can't use this lower for anything other than as a Glock dedicated 9mm pistol or rifle. This factory firearm has the 4"" barrel, Keymod free float handguard with Midwest Industries hand stop, Kaw Valley flash can muzzle brake, Magpul grip, a BAD style lever, Magpul front and rear BUIS, and of course the SB Tactical PDW pistol brace. Will also come with the three 9mm hi-cap magazines in the pic. I have $1100 into this new/unfired AR9 pistol. The new PDW brace was $250 plus tax by itself. I WANT $699 FOR THIS PACKAGE CASH. That's $400 off retail! You will not find an AR9 off the shelf factory rifle or pistol (not one home built from AR15 lower) at this price anywhere with the PDW brace!As far as trades, I'm trading at $800-$900, which I think is fair for such a rare set up. Firearms related only. No generators or chainsaws please.Transfer will take place near me and that cost is on you. No shipping."

The SPAS-12 was specifically designed as a combat shotgun and anti-riot measure but eventually marketed as a sporting system to civilians. Production of the series - handled by Luigi Franchi Development of Brescia, Italy (Franchi S.p.A), known for good quality shotguns - ran from 1979 to 2000 to which global operators became Austria, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and the United States.
