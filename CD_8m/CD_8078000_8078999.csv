Has a brand new castle SCT sidewinder esc with an older castle 3800kv motor. Very fast, and very durable. Differential has been filled with putty for locked rear feel. Was built for SCT racing, but have been playing around with speed runs recently so it has become mostly a basher. Currently needs rear tires. The ones that are on it have come unglued, and are fairly slick.2wd slash - $150Mostly stock except for aluminum shock caps and esc. Has an XL5hv from a trx-4 that makes it 3s capable. 3s on the brushless is very fast for a stock slash. Revo-erevo build - $400Started out as a revo platinum that I bought as a conversion project. It is now a full conversion with the erevo chassis and transmission. This one is a monster! It has a team Orion 4s capable esc with a 2250kv team Orion vortex motor. Has MIP CVD axles in the rear, and traxxas steel CVD shafts in the front. The diffs are fully built with LEM guts and hot racing aluminum diff halfs. These diffs have been 100%, and I have around $300 in the diffs alone. Has 2 proline trenchers that need reglued and 2 proline badlands that are fairly new. Has tactic ttx300 tx/rx that works good and has good range. Electronics are waterproofed. Extra partsSlash: extra lcg chassis and a ton of extra parts, some new in the package. With electronics and a motor, you could almost build another car from the pieces. Revo: 80% of the parts from the nitro truck. I have an OS max .18tm engine. I know nothing about nitro, but I know enough to know that I think the engine may be low on compression. Might be rebuildable, might be for parts, I just don't know. Have 2 slash bodies and 2 revo bodies. All 4 are pretty beat from bashing, but would get you by. 1 original nitro revo body and 1 proline GMC top kick body.

The gun has a little holster wear on the slide, but nothing major and is in great over all condition. I don’t know exactly how many rounds I have through the gun, but I would guess 1000-1500. It was carried more than it was shot. Let me know if you have any questions. It really is a sweet shooter, and I'm asking a very reasonable price (was $700 new).I would also entertain trade plus cash offers.  I need at least $150 cash, but beyond that, I would be willing to do some sort of trade agreement for the right offer.  Guns that I have a specific interest in are .38 or .357 revolvers, pistol caliber lever guns, and probably some other guns too (not .22 rifles, bolt action rifles, or shotguns). Things that I could include into a trade deal would be a 200 round box of Winchester white box .45acp 230 grain FMJ ammo, a left hand IWB hybrid holster, and/or sharpening services.  I run a sharpening business (knives, chainsaw chains, household scissors, garden tools, hand trimmers, manual hedge trimmers, etc.) and could offer a certain amount of credit toward sharpening services.  A combination of any or all of these things could be arranged to work out a deal that both of us would be happy with."
