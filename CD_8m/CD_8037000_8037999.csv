Only 680 down the pipe, all upgrades are steal housing and well built.

This gun has no mount hole for a stock, one can be added easily, but this is my CQB firearm so it's built perfectly for its purpose, still has a very similar range to my longer barreled AKs. The only reason I am parting with my one of my favorite AKs is because I have my eye on a new project, so I am a very motivated seller, can meet at a local ffl for a legal transfer asap, comes with one parts kit empty 30rnd mag, and a 10 round mag. It has never once jammed, or had a FTE, FTF, well maintained, cleaned when needed, and kept in dry Gunsafe. If you think my price is high you are wrong, this is literally the exact price of the original firearm+the upgrades minus $100 because I am ready to sell fast. I have better photos, and more info if needed, comes with original box. And I will thow in 100 7.62x39 rounds. I am moving so I need to sell!! Shoot me an offer!"

That's what happened to me with this bow. I got nearly everything an archer would want, but life got in the way. But my loss is your gain.
 
This bow is an Elite Tempo (2017 model) - It is like new, with 200 arrows through. It has been tuned up after the 200 shots, and never shot again. This is not your typical armslist cheapo fodder. All of the components and accessories are quality items, so please take that into consideration before making an offer.
 
The bow:
60lb draw
String 60 3/8""
Cable: 39""
IBO Speed: 325 FPS
Weighs 4.4 pounds
Winner's Choice strings
All of the details can be found on Elite's website
 
Accessories
CBE TL3 - 3 Pin Sight /w waterproof cover
Ripcord Ace Drop Down Arrow Rest
Bee Stinger front stabilizer + Quick detach Mount
Bee stinger rear stabilizers + Quick detach Mount
Trufire Hardcore Bow release
Allen Quick-fit Bow Sling
Paracord wrist sling
Truglo Bow Jack
Allen carrying case
6 Quality Arrows
Basic 6 arrow quick detach
 
This package easily exceeds $1500. I'm only asking for $1100 cash. I will trade for a quality crossbow (no $500 junk) + cash (if necessary). I will also trade for a quality lever action gun in 30-30, 44, or 45/70. Possibly an AR-15 depending on the quality.

To do this you would simply select which BCG & CH you want to be shipped with your upper plus you will save money buying them together. We do offer custom builds as well!! However you would have to call us for product availability and a quote. Need magazines?? Check out our magazine section and add some to your cart before you check out.  Please note most of our uppers are currently in stock and usually ship out within 24hrs of purchase. However, because our stock fluctuates frequently we ask that you be patient and please allow 5-10 business days to build, test fire, and ship your upper. If you're worried about lead time please call us for updated inventory.   WARNING!! If you use reloaded ammunition with upper and lower assemblies all warranties and returns are null in void."

Stainless .357 Magnum, 2"" barrel. Has the Hogue Mono-Grips that have a nice pebble texture and thick rubber to cushion the .357. Was known as being the best small 357 conceal carry revolver that still had a decent grip to hold on to.They were first introduced in 1999 and because of financial trouble they had to discountinue them the same year. They were the first and the last Colt double action Magnum revolver to use their small frame, known as the ""SF"" frame. Due to its very short production and the rare magnum chambering for such a small revolver it has made the ""Magnum Carry"" highly collectable and sought after by both collectors and shooters wanting very nice high end and powerful concealed carry revolver. These don't come up very often for sale but bring a premium when they do. The value of these has been increasing non stop making them them a excellent investment.

Used in very good condition.
 
The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
 
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and checkered grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine will remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
 
Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.

Two 15 round mags are included and factory CZ +2 extensions are installed. A third +2 extension is included for another magazine you may buy in the future.Exactly 50 rounds (1 box) of American Eagle 147gr were fired through the pistol. There are two tiny dings on the finish of the rear sight (picture link below) that were there when I picked up the pistol from my FFL. Since the backstrap retaining pin is a non-standard fastener and is so difficult to remove (it's a ~2mm slotted pin with fingers, if you will), I inserted a dowel pin inside the right side of it in order to quickly and easily swap out backstraps with only a 1/16"" punch and hammer. This pistol has all of the updates that CZ has offered so far to the P10C line (beveled striker retaining plate, hidden shepherd's hook spring in frame, striker safety spring correctly assembled, etc).$625 or best offer via PO Money Order SHIPPED to your FFL or $600 cash with pickup in west Michigan.

Reason for selling is I could use the money and just looking for something different. I am selling EACH for $200. That’s what I have in them so I’m trying not to budge. If you have something to trade, I will listen but idk thatim going to be trading. The one on top has a 30 inch barrel and no issue. The one on bottom I believe is 28in. It fires but is missing the friction ring so it doesn’t eject shells every time. I have purchased a part before for this gun so I know parts are available and really not bad priced, the other one worked so I never had a reason to go seeking the ring for this one.
