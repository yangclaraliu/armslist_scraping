This rifle is immaculate with no scratches, dings, or wear of any kind. Beautiful wood on this one! I bought it two years ago and it has been in a gunsock in a climate controlled safe ever since. This rifle will come with the box, manual, cleaning kit/rod, and two factory mags. It will be delivered just as it would new from the factory. I would prefer a cash deal but I would be interested in partial trades for interesting and/or unique firearms. This means nothing that is readily available (Glocks, XD40s, AR's, and similar). I am interested in less common AK's in new to like new condition. The cash value is $1275 and the Trade value is $1400. These rifles have exponentially gained value since they were banned from import about one year ago, and will continue to rise. It is a sound investment for one to make, especially in unfired condition, the Russia sanctions are not going to be lifted anytinme soon.   I would prefer an FFL transfer (I will cover the cost) but I may consider a NH resident of upstanding character with a current NH DL and CCL. Anyone out of state who would like to buy, I will have an FFL ship it to your FFL at your expense. I will take USPS money orders or Paypay gift for payment for out of state buyers and cash only in NH. This transaction will be only conducted in a lawful manner, following all state and federal laws.  Make me an offer, worst I can say is no. **Is it still available emails will be deleted with no response, I will delete the ad once sold**"

I want to keep this as I collect unique and different firearms, but I just made a big purchase on broker so I need to sell a few things to recoup the cost of my recent purchase. This full conceal frame is as it came from them. I added a custom slide with front serrations, trijicon ghost ring night sights, lone wolf internals and stainless guide rod, and to top it off, a Faxon fluted barrel. I was suprised on how accurate this pistol is, between the Faxon barrel and the good trigger pull it shoots really well. I fired approx 150 through it, so it is just starting to be broken in. I just want to get out of it what I put in at $1275. These are going for $1400 with a stock Glock slide so this is a good deal for this particular set up.  I would prefer a FFL transfer (I will cover cost) or I may sell to a NH resident of upstanding character who has a current NH DL and CCL.

Caliber: 9 mmMags:  TWO high capacity 17 round mags (17 +1)Condition:  like NEW!  A real Gem.
The PX4 is the latest and greatest design by the famous Beretta firearms maker. Using short recoil, locked-breech action, it has an innovative rotating barrel lock proven for performance on the Beretta Cougar to close up the chamber for reliable performance.
Gun is built with all the the quality and workmanship that Beretta is famous for.
ERGONOMICS AND RECOILHandles and shoots extremely well.
Slide mounted ambidextrous safety/decock.
Contours in the slide make the PX4 Storm look sexy and sleek — just what one would expect from an Italian-made Beretta. There are slide cuts both fore and aft that are neither too sharp nor too slippery, and the slide is virtually snag free for an easy draw.
Grip angle facilitates a natural point-of-aim for me, more so than the grip angle of a GLOCK, which tends toward the high side. The upper rear of the grip has a curved recess that creates a beaver tail of sorts to give a snug fit and prevent hammer bite.
Mag release can easily be switched for left-handed shooters.
INNOVATIVE AND RELIABLE LOCKING SYSTEM
Very unique barrel locking system – it uses lugs on the barrel and a peg on the locking block that fits into a channeled groove fitted on the barrel. This creates robustness and long-life: Extremely robust locking lugs, located at 180° in order to ensure the best distribution of locking forces when firing. The reduced friction areas between the barrel and the slide, as well as the central block, guarantee a remarkable fluency of operation and great reliability, even under poor climate conditions. In addition, the barrel features an enlarged external muzzle diameter that ensures a precise and constant barrel-to-slide coupling, shot after shot, considerably enhancing the accuracy of the pistol.  Furthermore, the reduction of the external barrel diameter for its remaining length guarantees an improved rear and forward travel of the slide during the operating cycle.
Additional benefits include a lower bore-axis and the channeling of recoil energy into the rotation of the barrel, which decreases muzzle flip and recoil, allowing for faster and more accurate follow up shots.
EXTREMELY SOLID build due to the rotating barrel and locking lock design – it has no rattle and almost no side-to-side play between the slide and frame rails.
Really a sweet, smooth trigger pull smooth, without any take-up and a clean break.
TRIGGER AND ACCURACY
Unlike many guns today, the PX4 is not striker fired and instead uses an exposed and traditional hammer that cocks after the first round. It’s more of a low profile, modernized hammer and provides a nice mix of an authentic gun experience and modern design.
Nice clean trigger break for shooting and great overall experience in both single and double action.
One of the most unique features is the rotating barrel, which contributes to less felt recoil.
Three dot sights: Super-LumiNova sights are rechargeable alternatives to more expensive night sights.
RELOADING AND DISASSEMBLY
Magazine well is cavernous and takes well to indexing the feed lips by feel in field conditions.
Field stripping the PX4 is rather similar to that of the Glock, using two small pegs, one on each side of the frame, as a takedown lever. When reassembling you will notice the exceptionally tight tolerances under which the gun was designed – this is where your accuracy comes from.

Brand: Springfield
Caliber: 9 mm
Model: This is the 4.0 MOD 2 Springfield
Condition: like new! A real GEM.
 
Includes TWO high capacity 16 round mags (16 + 1).   You also get the the plastic factory case, owner’s manual, etc.
This is Springfield’s latest version of the XD that took the gun world by storm with new benchmarks in handling, accuracy, reliability, and safety.
Gun is built with all the quality and workmanship that Springfield is famous for.
FEATURES, ERGONIMICS, HANDLING & CONTROL
 You’ll first notice the new styling (in contrast with its predecessor’s blocky design (similar to the Glock ‘brick in your hand feel’).   An excellent job modernizing the gun’s graphics, cut angles and ergonomics. The Mod.2’s a much sexier pierce than the prior one.
The new gun is cleaner. Note the rounded the trigger guard. The indent aligned and supported the shooter’s trigger finger; the square trigger guard offered secure purchase for a shooter’s support hand’s index finger (especially when gloved). 
The Mod.2 replaces the old XD’s straight-up reat sight with a slinky, low-profile extended sight, which is snag-free and holster friendly.
It also has a slimmer slide. Note the new “posi-wedge” serrations are a lot easier to work.
A slimmer takedown lever for increased snaglessness. The “high-hand beavertail” positions the shooter’s hand better.
The Mod.2 builds on the XD’s ergonomic excellence to be even better. Perfectly balanced for rapid fire and rapid fire exercises and shot recovery.Trigger breaking point is sharp, clean and predictable. Easy for follow up shots and tremendous accuracy, especially rapid fire.  With the pistol’s high-hand grip reducing felt recoil and the XD’s natural pointing prowess, shooters can reacquire their sight picture and return to target with life-saving speed and efficiency.
Sights: Springfield’s excellent 3 DOT sight system that has been proven again and again as a favorite among shooters, law enforcement, and owners.  Reflecting Springfield’s well established reputation for quality and workmanship, the BOTH the front and rear sights are dove-tailed into the slide.
Just as you’d expect, recoil mitigation is top-notch.
SUMMARY: Overall, it is a nice improvement on the older XD. Greater ergonomics, aesthetics and increased controllability. Still a better buy than a GLOCK 19 if you ask the experienced field person.
