For the basics, this is a 10.3"" barreled AR-15 pistol, chambered in 5.56x45/.233 that is free floated, and equiped with a KAK shockwave brace. It includes magazines (details below) a sling, ammuntion, and a basic PDW case.Upper and lower Reciever - Aero precision Gen 2 Lower reciever, and Aero precision gen 2 upper reciever with no forward assist (to save weight), basic Aero precision lower parts kit, as well as a set of anti-walk pins.Bolt and carrier group - Fail Zero Nickle boron Bolt and carrier groupCharging Handle - Geissle Airborn black charging handle, I can't stress enough how awesome this thing is, it's ambidexterous, and is built up for use with a suppressor.Barrel - 10.3"" Ballistic Advantage .650 barrel, with their cross pinned lo-profile gasblock, this is a suberp barrel, and much more accurate than I'll ever be. Ballistic advantage comes with a 1"" MOA gaurantee (with match ammo) with all of their barrels.Brace - A black KAK shockwave Brace as well as their 12 point adjustable buffer tube:Buffer - I've replaced the buffer with a spikes tactical T2 tungten filled buffer: Handguards - Basic, but sturdy guntec USA Ultra lightweight 10"" handguard, also outfitted with some magpul grip pannels, as can be seenGrip - Magpul K-gripMuzzle Device - Kaw Valley Precision Linear compensator, this greatly reduces the amount of blast felt in the short barrelSights - Griffin Armament M2 Flip up sightsOptics - Holosun HS403A red dot, awesome sights with a 50k hour battery life, I have them set on a basic quick detach mountMagazines - 4 lancer systems L5 LWM magazines (2 in smoke translucent, 2 in transparent)That's about it I think, I also have about 200 rounds of factory wolf gold .223 ammo I can throw in, the non-magnetic stuff, so you can use at indoor ranges. I've put a lot of work into making sure this rifle (pistol) is just perfect, for either home defense or plinking at the range. Sadly, due to work I haven't been able to get to the range very often, and I feel like it's not being put to any good use. I only have about 400 rounds or so of range use, and every piece that I've bought was purchased brand new. I've also yet to have a malfunction of any kind at the range. As far as short barreled AR's go, this one runs perfectly. If you have any questions about this, or would like to shoot me an offer, feel free to do so. I can provide links to the manufacturers website for detailed information on each of the parts if you're interested. You can also text me at 320-twonineeight-2101. Must have ptp or ptc, not interested in trades at the moment."

The KKM compensator makes the gun the length of a Glock 34, so it fits in 34 holsters. The Comp-Tac is a 34 holster.

Lower receiver is fitted with Magpul® MOE® grip and MOE SL™ collapsible buttstock on the Mil-Spec buffer tube.   Handguard is free-floating for accuracy and the slim, 15"" length provides enhanced ergonomics and support.

The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Ruger® muzzle brake is a radial port design that significantly reduces felt recoil and muzzle movement. The 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.

The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this pistol an absolute pleasure to shoot. As the next generation P226, the Elite builds on the exceptional reputation of out-of-the-box accuracy with the addition of SIG's new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The SRT provides you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. Other key features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P226 Elite.

Elegant simplicity and cutting-edge design unite in a stunning example of modern weaponry. With a distinct focus on the needs of the shooter the all new Hudson H9 is not simply a new contender in the firearms industry, with multiple patents granted and pending, it is a pistol that is engineered to advance.
The trigger can make or break a pistol so why not have the best? The well-tuned 1911 style trigger found on the Hudson H9 offers a short take up, a crisp release, virtually no overtravel and a tactile but short reset. The patent pending integral trigger safety is engaged instinctively and doesn’t take away from the smooth straight pull trigger that allows the shooter steadier and more consistent follow-up shots.
The H9’s unique design is not simply aesthetic. The unconventional nose of the pistol allows for the barrel and recoil spring to sit drastically lower and closer to the hand than heritage designs. This, coupled with its striker-fired design, creates an extremely low bore axis which reduces torque about the wrist when firing and contributes to unparalleled precision in the shot process.We will ship anywhere in the ConUSA.  Call to request a shipping quote.  You are responsible for knowing your own local laws and regulations and must be legally permitted to own this pistol.  Call or stop by our store with any questions.  Thanks for looking!"
