I am sorry for this trouble but I don't want to see my rifle fall in the hand of someone who is not eligible to have firearms.If you don't want to do it, please get it somewhere else but not me. No exeption on this requirement (even you have pistol permit or what so ever). Apology again if my word is a bit harsh. If you click in you might already know what SSG69 is...For those don't know, at 1970 era, Austria Military ask if Steyr can make them a sub MOA durable sniper rifle so they can hit head target at 300m and chest at 600mSo Steyr give them SSG69, it is said to be the most accurate factory mass make .308 rifle at the time. Based on my experience it is very, very accurate. The barrel is float design and made by cold hammer forge. I have shot around 200-300 rnds with it and it is a very nice crisp rifle. Trigger is hair light for accurate shooting. It is civilian version so there is no iron sights seen on military version. But it comes with factory rail and bipid slot.Price is firm as this rifle usually sell for 1k+, steyr doesn't make this rifle anymore so grab one while you can. You can reach me through armslist email thingy."

No exeption on this requirement (even you have pistol permit or what so ever). Apology again if my word is a bit harsh. This is my build trying to replicate military style AR rifle. I eventually stop my project cuz a military ACOG scope is more expensive than rifle itself... I have put around 400 rnds through it. This rifle is way better than most entry level ARs you can buy on the market. The barrel is made my FN with cold hammer forge (CHF), who is the contractor that makes actually military M16A4.  CHF barrel is more durable than most market barrels. The trigger comes from Geissler  (model is G2S, 4.2lbs non adjustable 2 stage, same feeling with military trigger) Lower receiver is made by Ruger. I burn a lot of money on this build but I have to let it go cuz I just got a new car and need some money....Price is firm as I spend more than $1000 on this rifle, it also comes with 2 magazines, one is from magpul (worth $20) and one is those aluminium one."

Price is slightly flexible.I will ship if desired.DESCRIPTIONThis holster is for a Glock 19 with a TLR-1 or TLR-1 HL weapon light. It is inside the waistband and uses a soft leather loop for the belt. The loop makes it impossible for the holster to move or become accidentally ""unclipped"" during movement or drawing like holsters with clips do. It is extremely secure while still maintaining convenience with the pull-dot detachment. The ride height is adjustable with simple screws. The loop strut is spaced from the holster to allow easy shirt tucking. The retention is tight and is adjustable with a screw.SUMMARYNSR makes extremely high quality, durable, long-lasting holsters. I used this holster for EDC briefly with the light very comfortably. I am selling it becasue I no longer need it, but it still works great as it is like new.

Canted sights/gas blocks - This rifle's sights and gas blocks are dead straight.2. Bad/incorrect barrel - This rifle's barrel is appropriately sized (not a 5.56) and there is no keyholing.3. Mag lockup - This rifle has the nicest mag lockup of all my AK74s4. Overall rivets - On this rifle they all look good and the over all quality of the build is great5. Headspace - This rifle's headspace checks good.It has less than 100 rounds through it give or take - bore is mint.  Has an authentic Bulgarian half moon AK74 muzzle brake.  Comes with a sling and I'll include three Tapco mags that are nothing fancy but have worked 100%.NO TRADES PLEASE

Caliber: 9 mm
Condition: Excellent!
Design:   Very Innovative
 
This is a very unique and “Difficult To Find Pistol.” This was Llama’s attempt to break into the premium segment, and they did it with fervor. They also wanted to show the world they could innovate and build a very high end pistol with features that rivaled even the best.  They chose the gun to carry the popular 9 mm para (9x19) cartridge.
The Omni was the most original and sophisticated Llama ever designed, incorporating very innovative and unique (and costly) features such as:
 Micro ball bearings for the hammer pivot create an exceptionally smooth action and very long-wearing durability.
 Separate draw bars for the single and double action sears.
 A deeply undercut trigger guard to allow high hand positioning for recoil control.
 ""Buttressed"" rifling, which used a 2-stage ""step-down"" from the lands to the grooves, for less bullet deformation and a better gas seal.
 An almost space age design and appearance.
 Solid steel frame.
 
These features and construction impart excellent reliability and smooth functioning. The solid ball bearing pivot, separate single/double action sear draw bars produce an exceptionally smooth, controlled shooting experience. The solid steel frame takes up a lot of the recoil, further enhancing the shooter’s feeling of stability and control.
Most of these features have never been found all together in any other single design, and they provide this pistol with an extremely smooth and reliable action.  Shooters who have the gun praise it as an excellent weapon.
As a result of all these high end features, the Omni production costs were very high (much higher than other guns they produced) and it was difficult to compete with more established rivals.  The Omni could not command the price or attention away from the top end gun manufacturers, and Llama has since shied away from trying to compete nose-to-nose with premium brands.
** Their loss is your gain in the form of the feature-rich Omni!   The list price of the Omni 9mm in the 1983 Gun Digest was $599.99,
Includes high capacity magazine.

This shotgun features a robust, solid machined (not stamped) steel receiver, elevation & windage adjustable ghost ring sight, and an 18.5"" inch improved cylinder choke that tightens up the groups a bit versus a cylinder / no choke and can still be used to shoot rifled slugs.  Perfect set up for home defense.  Plus with the ghost ring sight and the newer rifled slugs, you can hit with near rifle-like accuracy to 60-80 yards and with serious game harvesting power. Solid, reliable, built to last. It is by no means ""cheap"" ... the price is simply reflective of labor rates in China.  This is made by Hawk Industries, a division of Norinco, the long-time maker of firearms including the SKS and AK.  The Chinese Police use Hawk shotguns. Imported by IAC (Interstate Arms Company). When you handle this, it communicates the feeling of being ""over built"" for its purpose. I am selling this because I lucked into a Mossberg 590A1 shotgun at a great price, and this will help fund that purchase. No issues with the Hawk at all, I intended to keep it forever, but I don't need two of the same type of shotgun and now want to find a good home for the Hawk.  An in-depth review of the Hawk 982, one of many, but by someone whose reviews I've come to trust :>> Go to YouTube and search: MrGunsnGear IAC Hawk 982 Shotgun 12ga Remington 870 ClonePrice is fair, low ballers ... no thanks.  I have exactly 60 rounds through it (I maintain a spreadsheet on round counts), no scratches, and 100% reliable.  As you can see in the target, it shoots and groups 00 buckshot quite nicely. It is currently sighted in for ""hallway"" distance. Nothing to fuss over, ready to go. Used of course, but in some ways better than new as proper function and accuracy are proven, and there's peace of mind to that vs brand new.  It was cleaned after every use, and is freshly oiled. Stored in safe indoors.Price includes the box, original contents of box, addt'l technical resources I found online and printed, the shell stock sleeve and I'll throw in a length of VCI rust proofing tube I keep in the barrel for good measure.  I added some bright nail polish to the front sight which you can see if look closely ... if not desired, can be removed with paint thinner or finger nail polish remover. I helps me, you may find helpful as well. When these are available in store or online, they sell out quickly ... is very much regarded as a ""best buy"" choice.   Includes everything that came with it if bought new, plus a couple of deal sweeteners.Buyer must be a MO resident and legally able to buy and own a firearm, and sign a bill of sale to that effect.

783,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8207783,For Sale:  Sig Sauer Ultra Compact Carry 9 mm,"dallas, Dallas, Texas",$ 409,"Listed On: Sunday, April 8, 2018",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"Brand: Sig Saurer
Caliber: 9 mm (9x19)
 
This is Sig’s smallest 9mm – excellent for concealed carry, the P290RS. Includes factory carry case and factory magazine with pinky extension.
Gun is built with all the quality and workmanship that Sig Sauer is famous for.
The trigger mechanism is the defining feature on the P290 RS. The suffix in its designation stands for Re-Strike. . The trigger gives an immediate second “shot” at a recalcitrant primer in the event of a misfire. Some don’t see this as a big deal, because they follow the doctrine that a bad round that’s failed them once doesn’t get a second chance, and their preferred response to a “click” instead of a “bang” is a fast “tap-rack-assess the situation in front of you.”
Friendly for dry fire. Instead of having to interrupt your trigger pulling practice by breaking your hold and retracting the slide between dry “shots,” the P290RS owner can roll the trigger continuously.
Following Sig's allegiance to craftmanship and quality, both front and rear sights are MILLED and DOVETAILED into the steel of slide for durability and easily visible.
Subtle, rounded beavertail at the rear of the grip tang that accommodates smaller-handed shooters and those with meatier paws, where it could be a deal-breaker for other little 9mm guns.
The lower rear edge on the slide-lock lever of the earlier P290 had a rather sharp corner, and I can see where that would have been a problem for those who shoot with straight thumbs. That corner has been very nicely rounded slide-lock lever feels great any way you hold gun, including those who shoot with straight thumbs (something other manufacturers ignore on powerful subcompact pistols).
Big, easy to find magazine relearse button is easy to find and press, especially when you are in a hurry. Mag release button has just the right height above the frame: not too low that you can’t find it and not too high where you accidently pop the mag.
Rounded slide stop is easy to use and comfortable to feel.  No sharp uncomfortable edges – incorporates all the Sig workmanship and attention to detail that you’d expect.
The perfect trigger pull you expect from Sig Sauer. Comfort is exquisite: no sharp edges anywhere.
Ergonomics are brilliant: Sig really paid a lot of attention to ergonomics (included the smartly rounded, smooth edges all over), especially in this gun where the compact frame makes shooters more sensitive to good design. But it works well and feels comfortable for large and small hands. Easily concealable in jacket pocket or holster. Also, you can put your thumb on the flat hammer and holster the P290RS without fear of an unintended discharge if a drawstring from a warm-up jacket or something like that got fouled in the trigger area.
This handy little 20.5-ounce seven-shooter is a definite contender in the currently hot niche of subcompact 9mm carry pistols.

This affordable Browning Rage OneTM compound bow was rated new as simply the best single-cam bow for the buck. Because the Browning ® RageTM has all the features of high-end bows in an incredible affordable package, featuring an IgnitorTM 6 Cam with 6"" of draw length adjustment in 1 / 2 "" increments without a bow press and precision manufactured Contour XPTM limbs.
The machined aluminum riser of the Browning Rage compound bow provides stability in each release, and durability for years to come. The cam system is quiet and efficient, while the VibraCheck grip reduces vibration, making this a good choice for the hunter who loves target practice almost as much as the hunt, and doesn’t want sore hands after 50 to 100 shots. Hunters with arthritis may also appreciate the VibraCheck technology. The 4.2 lb Rage is available with draw weights up to 70 lbs. (I shot from 60 to 70 lbs.), all dressed in camouflage finish the makes it disappear in the woods.
