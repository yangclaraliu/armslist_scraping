It has 4 mags (one with picnk extension)all loaded with .357 SIG ammo (mostly Hornady FTX) original case and back straps. This has been my carry gun for a while, so there is very MINOR holster wear on the slide. It has a low round count and functions perfectly. It is the same size as the Glock 26 and 27, but it has the real deal power of the .357 SIG round. If you aren't familliar with the round do your research. Some simply call it a necked down .40 with a 9mm biullet. That is the simple answer I guess, but what you don't hear is that the case is twice as thick as a .40s&w becasue it is a high pressure round. That makes it faster, flatter shooting and higher energy expediture that almost any auto cartridge.  It was designed to have the same stop in your tracks authotiy of the famous .357 magnum. Difference is you have 9+1 capacity in this little beast and can use any Glock .40 or .357 mag to get up tp 30 rounds. A simple barrel swap and you will have a .40 s&w Glock 27. Same mags, same everything except the barrel. This is for sale for $500, no lowballers or stupidity. In person, cash only, CCW preffered, DL and signed receipt required. Trades....Maybe , depends on what you have."

Its patent-pending design provides three valuable functions:   It provides over 99% reduction in muzzle flash compared to a plain muzzle, which helps to conceal the shooter’s location and preserve his dark-adapted vision.    It virtually eliminates muzzle rise, which enhances monitoring of target reaction and staying on target for faster follow-up shots.    It serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for all SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56mm Fast-Attach® suppressors, including our SOCOM556-RC model, which placed first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted by US Special Operations Command.  Precision machined from US Mill-certified heat-treated stainless steel bar stock — including high-precision single-point cut threads for optimum thread interface — the WARCOMP-556-1/2-28 features an Ionbond DLC coating to provide maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions and to facilitate cleaning even after extreme use.  When used in conjunction with a SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach suppressor, the WARCOMP provides multiple bearing surfaces to ensure superior suppressor alignment and prevent any ringing of tines inside the suppressor. A rear labyrinth seal mitigates gas leaking from the back of a suppressor, minimizes potential carbon buildup in the indexing system, and facilitates suppressor removal after extended firing. Every SureFire WarComp is individually inspected for concentricity and alignment.  For rock-solid mounting of a SOCOM Series suppressor, unparalleled flash reduction, and minimizing muzzle rise, there’s literally nothing like a SureFire WarComp—the world’s most shootable flash hider.  FITS: M4, M16 and variants with ½-28 muzzle threads  For WarComp model fitting 7.62 mm (.308 caliber) rifles with 5/8-24 muzzle threads, see WarComp 762.  MOUNTS: All SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56mm /.223 caliber sound suppressors  NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors and current-model WarComps, muzzle brake and flash hider adapters are NOT compatible with previous (non-SOCOM) SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders.

This is a purpose built and left configured as it did from the factory. A true mil-spec battle rifle. This rifle is in exellent condition and 100% original with ALL factory boxes and paperwork (for both the rifle and EOTech). This is the roller stamped ""M4A1 Carbine"" and comes exactly how it did off the assembly line, Knight's Armament Company (KAC) quad rail, Colt side sling swivel, Colt ambi safety, Matec rear sight, SOCOM profile barrel. The EOTech ($750) is protected by (itself) and a add-on GG&G protective cover with sealed protective flip up caps. This EOTech 553 is one of the most rugged they made and is the most water proof (at a depth of 66ft, all other models only good for 33ft) and was one of the only models made by EOTech specifically for MWS SOCOM. Finally the rifle comes with a GPS.LE front hand grip/bipod and about 400rds of standard 5.56NATO. It will also come with a BNIB never mounted SSAR-15 SlideFire Solutions bump stock.Considering this rifle was produced in limited civillian run and value of modifications, I am asking $1800 cash at this time but open to partial gun trades as well. Can trade up or down. Text anytime 330.614.6246. Thank you for reading my post. I can send a shit ton of detailed pictures on request. Associated Literature: **Copied from EOTech Website**Model 553™ was originally created to withstand extreme and rugged situational conditions.  The Model 553 is battle-proven and offers features required by U.S. Special Forces to meet the stringent requirements of our elite fighting forces.**Copied from Grip Pod Website**The Grip Pod® is still the only weapon stabilization system to achieve total adoption by the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. National Guard, U.S. Air Force, British Army, Special Operations Groups, FBI, DEA, U.S. Customs/Border Patrol, plus many federal and state law enforcement agencies. U.S. forces have procured over 900,000 Grip Pod®s.In 2005, the U.S. Army at Picatinny Arsenal tested all known bipods in an open competition for use on the m16a2, m16m4, and m16a4, in CQB, medium, and long range applications. Very harsh testing was conducted for over 9 months. One of the many tests consisted of a m16m4 rifle equipped with 30-round full magazine, issued acog optic, peq4 IR laser, and bipod with fully opened legs was dropped from a height of 4 feet onto concrete. Unlike the Grip Pod®, most of the bipods broke. The Grip Pod® passed the drop test and only weighed 7 oz. It was the lightest of all the bipods in testing, with some weighing up to five times more. Also, the Army had used vertical foregrips on m16s for years finding that they absolutely aided the soldiers in CQB target acquisition. The Army decided that the conventional bipod was a problem when used with the vertical foregrip as one got in the way of the other, and also increased weight. Thus the Patented Grip Pod® prevailed against all other bipods and provided the U.S. Army with a dual-purpose, much stronger vertical foregrip and bipod all in one small light package which deployed with the push of a button."

With a distinct focus on the needs of the shooter the all new Hudson H9 is not simply a new contender in the firearms industry, with multiple patents granted and pending, it is a pistol that is engineered to advance.      Motivated By the Past Mankind’s collective experience as soldiers, as frontiersmen and as firearms enthusiasts have contributed to where we stand today. Taking cues from its legendary predecessors the Hudson H9 does not stray from its roots. From its steel frame, to its straight-pull trigger, to its striker-fired design the H9 will feel instantly familiar to firearms enthusiasts.       Inspired By the Future We live in a rapidly evolving world, yet pistols have remained relatively unchanged for the better half of a century. At Hudson we see opportunity in the future, an opportunity to rethink and improve upon the process of building a pistol. Every detail and every feature of the Hudson H9 is purposeful leading to a pistol that is practical in its delivery yet advanced by its design.   1911 Style Trigger The trigger can make or break a pistol so why not have the best? The well-tuned 1911 style trigger found on the Hudson H9 offers a short take up, a crisp release, virtually no overtravel and a tactile but short reset. The patent pending integral trigger safety is engaged instinctively and doesn’t take away from the smooth straight pull trigger that allows the shooter steadier and more consistent follow-up shots.   Striker-Fired Design Patent pending striker and sear design is optimized for less wear and tear of parts. The lack of a hammer spring also allows a more slimline and higher grip on the pistol giving the shooter more control while diminishing felt recoil.        Low Bore Axis The H9’s unique design is not simply aesthetic. The unconventional nose of the pistol allows for the barrel and recoil spring to sit drastically lower and closer to the hand than heritage designs. This, coupled with its striker-fired design, creates an extremely low bore axis which reduces torque about the wrist when firing and contributes to unparalleled precision in the shot process.      Unrivaled Modularity From purists to mavericks and everyone in-between the Hudson H9 has been designed to accommodate any shooter, allowing them to tailor the shooting experience to their own unique style.        Configurable Safeties The H9 comes standard with a trigger safety, but for 1911 purists or for those who just want an added measure of assurance we offer patent pending thumb safeties that can be equipped for left, right or ambidextrous shooters.       Interchangeable Grips For some it’s about function and for others it’s about style. Either way, the Hudson H9 makes it easy to change the look and feel of the pistol quickly and easily with interchangeable grip panels.       Ambidextrous Operation The H9 features ambidextrous slide releases and a reversible magazine release.       Accessory Rail With the accessory rail equip the H9 with aftermarket lights or lasers to better suit your needs making the pistol versatile in any situation."

It also features stippled-textured soft rubber grips that further absorb recoil while affording a firm and positive grip. Besides being one of the most photogenic handguns ever made (it appeared in countless movies and TV shows), it is perfect for home or personal defense, as well as concealed carry and recreational shooting.   Superior Reliability The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.       Packed with Useful Tactical Features This pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster or at the range. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its satin stainless finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. A pistol that is designed to work hard, be easy to maintain and perform flawlessly, the 92FS Inox is a premium-quality handgun that will be the jewel in any shooter’s collection."

By using the operator’s forearm, it provides a stable support to reduce felt recoil and minimize accuracy-robbing spin and shift. The stabilizing brace sits on the receiver extension, and the flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the brace to be custom fit to any user. The receiver extension has a water proof storage compartment with a sealing threaded cap. It is accessible when the brace is removed or pushed all the way forward.The SAM7K-03 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K-03 is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K-03 pistol is ideal for sport shooting, self-defense, and for pistol hunting. The SAM7K-03 adds a new chapter to the best pistol of its kind in the world.Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged ReceiverEach SAM7K-03 pistol receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receivers are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.Each SAM7K-03 forged pistol receiver starts out as a blank and requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is very complex and time-intensive, but with our meticulous attention to detail, we deliver a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.Summary: SAM7K-03 - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, Sig Sauer pistol stabilizing brace, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, peep rear sight, scope rail.

I bought this back in November but ended up getting a better gun and didn't shoot this one as much as I thought I would. Since then, I've only taken it out maybe 5 times with less than 100 rounds through it each time. This is the drop-safe upgraded version as well.  Refer to pictures, but there is minimal wear on the barrel and slide. Magazines have a little bit of wear on the baseplates from mag change drills, but they all function perfectly and have minimal wear everywhere else. Includes everything in the original box (gun lock, dawson replacement fiber optic, Sig Manual and other goodies), and I never even registered under Sig on their website so it's in your name with their warranty once you register.  Features of the P320 X5 include: - Detachable Magwell Extension - (4) 21-round magazines - Stainless Slide with Nitron Coating and Lightening Cuts - Dawson Precision Windage/Elevation Adjustable Sights (zeroed at 25yds) - Flat-faced/Straight X-series P320 Trigger - X-series grip module with trigger undercuts  Again, nothing wrong with the gun, but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would so I'd rather have something else taking up space in my safe. Price is $800 OBO, and an additional $25 if you don't have a CCW and need to run a background check for the sale. CCW holders will take precedence over others. Gift Letter will be provided for ""official"" purposes that you or I may need in the future. Feel free to contact me with additional questions or more details/pictures.   775-346-2159 Text only, as this number won't accept any calls. Email works fine for contact as well."

One is a full size CZ 75 BD. That means it has the decocker/ safety. Comes with two 16 round magazines and factory box and paperwork. The other is a CZ 75 Compact. It comes with two 14 round magazines and owners manual. I like these guns very much, but they both have the regular beavertail, which for my very large hands starts to dig into the web between my thumb and forefinger the more I shoot them. I didn’t realize this when I bought them. Most people smaller than me have no problem with the beavertail. I would like to trade one or the other for an SP-01 or a CZ75 B omega. Those have the upswept beavertail. I would also do a trade for an HK VP9, VP9SK, HK P30 or P30SK/SKS in 9mm, Steyr L9/M9/S9, or a Glock 43. Would also be interested in an FN Five Seven. I am possibly open to others, but make a good offer if it’s not on the list. I will consider bundling both pistols or adding some cash for obviously more valuable pistols. I also have 500 rounds of 12 gauge 2.75” target&game shotshells and up to 10,000 rounds of .22LR if you want either of those calibers instead of cash on my end. I’m not particularly interested in any rifles or .40 cal pistols unless you make me an offer I can’t refuse. Trade or trade plus cash only. I’m not interested in selling outright. I respond to all trade offers even just to say no thanks, so text me at 808-936-228zero. Please include your name, which gun you’re interested in, and your offer when you text."
