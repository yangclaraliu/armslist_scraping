Through years of modification and iteration after iteration of “improvement,” the industry has created variations on the original John Moses Browning design tailored for carry – accomplished in part through modification of the internal design and function of hallowed 1911. At Cabot, this departure from perfection was deemed unsatisfactory. At Cabot, instead we do it right, and we do it better. With those words on our lips and that promise in our blood, we birthed the Cabot S103 Commander – a reengineered vision of the perfection embodied in John Moses Browning’s pistol model of 1911.What separates the Cabot S103 from an industry oversaturated with imitations truly lies beneath. Where other Commander models fundamentally alter the 1911 design by shortening frame rails, adjusting the cycle length to shorten rearward travel, and affecting the timing of recoil and feeding, the Cabot remains true to internal ordnance prints. To the eye, the S103 appears a standard commander-length slide and frame, but upon takedown the shooter discovers that the internal dimensions of a full-size 5” barreled 1911 have been preserved. Your Cabot S103 Commander has the same cycle length and internal function as the ever dependable sidearm designed by Browning which has served armed forces worldwide for over a hundred years – “full cycle technology” as our engineers have termed it. The proven pedigree of the 1911 has been re-engineered in carry-size to ensure better feeding, consistent ejection, and above all – reliability. You’ll sacrifice nothing in electing to carry the Cabot S103 at your side. Second only to the importance of reliability in a gun designed for carry is that of grip – one which is easily obtained, effortlessly maintained, and repeatable ad infinitum. To this end, the Cabot S103 has created a functional beauty, all the while sacrificing neither. Cabot’s premier wire-EDM cut Tristar trigger set to 3.5 – 4.0 pounds of pull is housed in a trigger guard contoured and relieved for the shooter’s hand – a high-rise cut underneath provides for a more positive grip on the pistol. With precision machined rhombus checkering along the main spring housing and full face of the front strap, a firm and consistent grip is the hallmark of Cabot’s entry into the 1911 carry game. Further expanding on Cabot’s attention to detail, the S103 comes wrapped in Fibonacci inspired spiral designed grips, featuring the Cabot shield beautifully inlaid into the wood.Standard atop this innovatively-classic-carry piece is Cabot’s front Blind Sight – fitted from the front of the pistol leaving no unsightly exposed dovetail along the side of the slide, no potential snag points, and eliminating the possibility of sight drift. This feature allows Cabot engineers to run serrations along the entirety of the top of the slide – from the rear sights to the chamber, and on to meld seamlessly with the front sight in an arrow pattern – eliminating the potential for slide glare, and naturally leading the shooter’s eye to target. No detail goes overlooked in Cabot’s S103 Commander. This pistol is hand-fitted frame to slide, adding a touch of personalized craftsmanship to an already perfect design. The barrel is beautifully crowned flush to the bushing, the magwell beveled to enable faster and more consistent magazine swaps, and the full-length guide rod with a hand polished end is a final touch of class to the functionality you’ve come to expect from Cabot Guns. The S103 brings to those hunting for daily-carry perfection a compact, reliable and concealable 1911. Take command of your daily-carry decision. Available in left-handed configuration and finished in stainless or as an option Cabot’s black nitride finishes, the S103 Commander awaits your orders. Take full advantage of Cabot’s mirroring process, and for the first time bring home a pair of perfectly matched left and right handed 1911 Commanders.1911 Styling, 45 ACP or 9 mmHand Fit Frame and Slide Constructed from 416 Stainless Billet SteelCNC Machining, EDM wire, EDM Sink, CNC Surface Grinding4.25 in.

I like it and it shoots amazing. However I prefer to ankle carry and looking for other options in single stack.  Ameriglo Spartan pro style night sights. Ghost bullet slide release, Zev race connector, Zev power spring, trigger is nice and smooth. I’ve tried few different setups over the years this seems to be the most reliable while still safe for CCW gun and not getting light primer strikes. Allows for very quick follow ups. Hyve plus 2 baseplate and Hyve billet mag release. Two different barrels one LWD super accurate stainless barrel. It truly made groups tighten up. Will come with 6 mags 3 OEM 1- has Hyve plus 2 the other 2 have XL Pierce extended plates, 2 p-mags 12 round really liking these also have Pmag or OEM Glock 19 mag with x-grip makes it same size as 19. 2 Holsters. One new Desantis ankle holster just bought it second is a Remora style holster can be used for pocket or I like it with shorts and inside waistband.Over 450 -500 in Upgrades to include 6 mags. Plus 90 dollar worth of holsters. Factory goodies include with speed loader and Glock tote. Looking threw my add ons this 26 with Holster has over 1100.00. Cash price with everything and 350 range ammunition plus 40 critical defense would be would be 700.00 obo however looking more for a trade. I’m more the reasonable I’ll always look out in trader favor but trade value would be little higher.please must have good guys and sign Bill of sale."

I don' have the title, child support has a lien. If you file for mechanic lien, you will have the title in 2 weeks. Or use it to part it out. With car running and moving it' worth more than 3k.

Good hunting.
The AN/PSQ-20B Enhanced Night Vision Goggle is a helmet-mounted and/or hand-held device that combines the light amplification capability of image intensifier night vision devices with the heat-sensing capability of thermal imaging systems.  It allows for observation, detection, and target identification under adverse conditions including light rain, light smoke, light snow, and low light to total darkness.  As a fusion system, the ENVG allows the operator to adjust the viewed image from 100% night vision (I2) to 100% thermal, or a varying mix of the two.  It amplifies available light and thermal signatures, and fuses them together to produce a clear viewed image.  This cutting edge technology provides operators a tremendous advantage on the battlefield because he gets the best of both worlds, increasing the odds of mission success and survivability.
The ENVG provides better increased situation awareness capability due to the improved threat detection of the fusion technology. It allows the operator to see through more battlefield obscurants than any other device. On their own, standard L-3 Gen3 Infinity Auto-Gated I² tubes produce high quality images with superb resolution, providing excellent recognition capability. However, even these latest tubes are still dependent on available ambient lighting conditions. The more available light, the better the image will be (more detail and further distance resolution). But, battlefield conditions do not always allow for optimal ambient light. Cloudy nights with less moonlight, dense foliage, or internal/underground structure rooms can cancel out enough light that standard I² is defeated. Also, heavy rain, fog, snow, smoke, etc, will limit I² capabilities. This is where Thermal Imagers shine. Thermal identifies infrared energy (heat) and is not dependent on light at all. Thermal will see through most obscurants that would otherwise defeat I² and can create images in complete darkness. However, thermal imagers do not produce the same level of detail as I² tubes, limiting recognition capabilities.
The ENVG fuses these two technologies, providing the operator with all the benefits of I², while producing a thermal overlay. This gives the Warfighter substantially increased situational awareness because threats can be detected in virtually any environment. Bad guys that would normally be camofluaged in foliage, rock formations, etc can now be easily detected from a safe distance. Pitch black rooms or caves that would normally defeat I², causing the operator to use an IR illuminator (which can give away his position to anyone else using night vision) can now be easily negotiated with the thermal overlay. It is especially effective in urban operations.
The fused image has three modes: thermal overlay, thermal outline, and full thermal. The Overlay produces an otherwise standard I² image with orange thermal heat signatures over anything that is producing heat. This mode is extremely well-adapted to identifying threats quickly through obscurants. The outline mode produces a thin orange thermal outline around anything that is giving off heat. The rest of the image is standard I². This mode is especially useful when using an IR laser pointer because the operator can identify threats while still having recognition capability and can engage them with the laser. This is important because IR lasers are not seen through thermal. The full thermal mode overlays a complete thermal image over the I² image and is used when little to no ambient light is available, reducing the operator’s need to employ an illuminator.

A simple range finder and spin of the elevation turret will clear your mind to focus on the wind. If you're running short on time, there's a mildot reticle for easy referencing your elevation holds. These will run $1300+ brand new. The only blemish on this gal is one tiny scratch on the exterior of the tube. Like a dimple in the ass of a A-team stripper... you only noticed because you can't take your eyes off her.

Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip. The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16” barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine.

If you want to buy one outright, come at me with a reasonable offer. I have an FN FNS-40, a S&W M&P .40 Shield, and a Ruger LC9s. All are striker fired. The FN is a full size duty pistol that comes with factory case and 3 mags. The Shield is a compact that comes with one 6 round flush, and one 7 round, extended grip magazine. The Ruger Is also a compact and comes with two 7 round magazines w/the flared grip extenders. The Ruger has some holster wear. The others are very nice. All have been cleaned same day after EVERY trip to the range. I am willing to do 2 or even 3 for 1 if the offered pistol is of greater value and is something I want. I also have over 5000 rounds of 22LR ammo, 475 rounds of 12 gauge 2-3/4” target/game shotshells, a couple hundred rounds of 7.62x39 steel case non-corrosive, and a 50 round box and 20-ish loose rounds of .40 cal ammo to add to any trade to even things out. I can send more pics on request. I’m mostly just interested in 9mm but will consider a few others. At the top of my trade list is a HK VP9 or VP9SK. I would also like a Sig Sauer P320 xcarry. I would also like to own a .44 magnum. I would be open to a lever action or AR trade as well. After that I’m pretty much open-minded and will respond even if only to say no that I’m not interested. I don’t have any interest in Taurus, other than maybe a Judge or .44 magnum, so please don’t bother with those. I also don’t like cowboy style revolvers or Hunting rifles. I’m not a hunter. I do ask that you Please be willing to negotiate, because if I like something and you offer what I believe is too little of an offer, I will counter offer with what I would consider fair. You should do the same if you like what I have but feel like the trade is not quite fair. I’m usually willing to come to some kind of agreement unless I’m just not interested in your offer.I didn’t know I needed to add a disclaimer but recent interactions on armslist suggest I do. YOU will pay for YOUR FFL background check. End of discussion, unless I OFFER to pay in order to strengthen a deal. Don’t try to spring it on me last minute after we settle on price. My pistols are all in used condition. I don’t have time to worry about if it has a nick somewhere because you want a perfect gun for damn near nothing. Look at the pics, if you want a close up, just ask. None of mine have any major damage, and I’m up front about any known holster wear, but they are used and may have tiny nicks or scratches if you pick them apart and look real hard.

This is NOT an ex-military rifle. The manufacturer, National Ordnance, as listed in the first line of this ad, never had a contract to supply rifles to the US Gov’t.  This is a small batch of commercial receivers with military parts assembled to them from the 1960’s.  It runs and shoots extremely well, all mil-spec parts interchange, but no, it didn’t serve in WW2/Korea/Vietnam etc...  Those guns sell for significantly more than I’m asking. I’d be willing to swap it for a good lever gun in .308, .270, 7mm-08, 7x57, 45/70  May be open to other calibers, just not 30-06. May include cash up or down depending on values. Also may be interested in Vepr/Saiga shotgun, HK pistol, revolvers.also interested in 3 inch gp100 or 3 inch Smith revolvers No shipping, Vancouver FFL only, if the ad is up it’s still for sale. People asking if I’ll ship, if it’s still available, or if I’ll sell illegally don’t get replies, so please don’t bother."
