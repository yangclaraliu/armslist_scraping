Was bought for my wife, but she doesnt like the kick of micro pistols, and as such we have decided it's better off we sell it and find her something more her style. Personally, I find it much easier to shoot than my Ruger LCP, but alas, her gun, her rules. The gun has had approximately 250rds through it, around 200 of those being various brands of FMJ and the remaining being Sig V-Crown JHP rounds. It performs flawlessly and is really a nice gun, ergonomic and perfect for pocket or IWB carry. It comes with both of the original magazines (1 7rd extended mag and 1 6rd flush mag) as well as an additional ext 7rd mag I picked up at a LGS. It also comes with an additional recoil spring assembly. Being an engineer and gun fanatic, it has been maticulously taken care of, full cleaning after each range trip and thoroughly maintained. It is the closest to a new pistol you can get that has been fired. The only ""mod"" was a tiny bit of orange nail polish applied to the front site to help target acquisition, but that can be removed prior to sale if you wish. The holster included is a dual pocket/IWB holster. It comes with 2 different belt clips that are held on with a button, one for deep IWB concealment, the other for standard depth. Remove them completely for pocket carry. It is a very nice holster, very grippy outer material to stay put in the pocket. My favorite feature of the gun is that it can be racked with a round in the chamber, but there is no ""precock"", meaning the striker is not cocked back. The trigger on this gun pulls the striker back and then releases it, so there is no chance of drop-fire. It was an extra piece of mind for my wife when carrying with a round chambered. Overall, this was a nice, fun little gun but I don't have the space safe to keep it when it has no purpose in our hands. My loss is your gain. Total paid for gun was $260 (including FFL fee) in February, $20 for the holster, $35 for the additional 7rd mag, and $14 for the extra recoil spring assembly. Still have the box and all paperwork. Looking to get $220, but will entertain offers that are close to asking.Would prefer to sell in person, possibly through an FFL. Please feel free to contact me for more information or photos."

What is there is rusty crusty - probably Rhodesian battlefield pickup but serviceable. Tumble the small parts and sandblast the large. Parts are availble from DSA, Falcon Arms, Ernst Armory and numerous others. Included are 2 new old stock barrels - 21"" nonbipod cut gasblock mounted. 2 new old stock Argentine handgrips and buttstocks. 2 new Falcon Arms USA forearms.2 new Falcon Arms USA gas pistons.2 new Falcon Arms USA and hammer, trigger, sear sets. 2 new DSA 20 round mags3 new old stock Argentine hammer, trigger, sear sets.And several other spare this and that (see picture).Also included are , one FAL receiver wrench and a set of 10 sizing pins to determine headspace and order the correct size locking shoulder. You would need the mentioned missing parts and 2 FAL upper receivers to build 2 FALs. These are available from several sources. I have used the Coonan receivers (http://www.e-sarcoinc.com/highestqualityfalreceiverswithcarryhandlerecess.aspx) on three different builds. They have proven to be excellent.With the Falcon USA forarms, gas pistons, and hammer, trigger, sear sets and the DSA magazines you would have all required US made partsfor 922r compliance.I would tumble/sandblast and cerrocoat or custom paint with a bake on finish. If I had all parts prepped/painted and the locking shoulders ready (you have to build the weapon before you can measure for/order this) I could build both rifles in a day.$850 CashThe rifle pictured is an example of my work.

They are 20wks old, vet checked, up to date on shots and de-wormings, well socialized, started on house, crate, and basic obedience training, and fed a premium grain-free diet.

Price is $1000 firm and includes full AKC registration as well as a written health guarantee/contract. Their siblings sold for $1300 so this is a steal for the two picks of the litter.

Thanks!Please, be able to have an intelligent conversation about pricing, values, basic guns and ammo information and item descriptions. I try to list everything of importance in my ads and do not want to have a week long back and forth discussion because you cannot articulate an acceptable explanation of your items or questions about my items. If you refer to magazines as clips, cartridges as boolets or send photos of your guns with your finger on the trigger, I will assume we are off to a less than desirable start. Sorry if I sound rude, but I have bought and sold a fair amount from Armslist and the sheer amount of people that cannot seem to follow the golden four rules of firearms safety or use correct terminology is an ongoing issue.If you decide to purchase a handgun from me, I will take down your ID and CPL/PP info, I will fill out the pistol transfer forms as is required by law and I will write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. If you decide to buy a long gun from me, I will check your ID and write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. The bill of sale will include identifying information for both parties and there will be a copy for me and a copy for you. This is only done as a measure of protection for both parties. This is something you should welcome in an honest transaction. The registration paperwork and bill of sale on handguns is not negotiable. I don't like the laws any more than the rest of you but I intend to follow them as well as maintain accurate records of the firearms I own and where they came from. If you read this and are still interested and have any questions, please let me know.If you want to test fire a gun that I am selling, that is perfectly acceptable in most cases. I am happy to meet with you at Chief Okemos Sportsman’s Club on a weekend with you as my guest or at a range of your choosing at your own expense.Thank you for looking!

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher”rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons.According to H&K, this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch’s American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components. The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable butt stocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and either the HK Modular Rail System or the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard.WHAT’S INCLUDED The MR762A1-LRP is a standard Heckler & Koch MR762A1 equipped with an essential accessory package to function as an enhanced “long rifle” precision shooting platform.

The thread pitch is 13.5 x 1 LH (left handed). That means this works on most “Factory”Sig, Glock, and HK 9mm threaded barrels. Which means they are NOT Aftermarket other-brand barrels. I have used it for all of 3 mags at the range. It’s only 1 month old and these cost $50 brand new. Comes with several spare set screws screws and an Allen wrench. My price is $30 firm. Please no trades unless you want to trade 4 boxes of 9mm. Yes trade value is higher than cash value. I can find most major brand of 9mm ammo for $9.49 per box no tax or shipping. I can meet at the academy by 281 N and 1604. Sorry but it’s only $30 and I’m not going to drive all the way across town for that haha! If you’re interested please text me at (210) 268-5131"

This special order rifle came from the factory with a half round/ half octagon barrel, takedown option and a Lyman 38( I believe) receiver sight. The barrel is a standard 26"" length barrel. Bore is good and will clean up even better. The front end of the receiver and the takedown ring have been cleaned a little as seen. There is some protected blue on the receiver behind the sight mostly. Barrel and mag tube retain much more bluing than the receiver. This time frame was still noted with blueing issues on the receiver so thats probably one of the reasons for more loss. This gun is a also one of those rare takedown versions WITHOUT adjustment screws in the takedown collar. Takedown is extremely tight.

It's a straight blowback, singlestack, single-action semiautomatic handgun that is both comfortable and concealable. It features a 7+1 round capacity, a light trigger pull you'd expect from a single-action, and is chambered in .380 ACP. It sports a european-style heel magazine release, a last-round slide-hold-open feature, as well as a fixed barrel. Takedown and cleaning of the pistol is a breeze. It has both a frame mounted safety, slide mounted firing pin safety, as well as a magazine disconnect. These were imported in the 1980s under a number of names and with a few cosmetic differences, the most common variant being the ""Titan II"". They're all the same mechanical design, which I believe is based off the Beretta 1934 model.
The pistol functions very reliably with the proper ammunition. Blazer Brass, PPU, Hornady American Gunner hollowpoints, and Winchester White Box all feed through it fine, the only ammunition it's jammed on was Fiocchi and some Blazer aluminium cased (which tend not to preform well in straight-blowback firearms). The handgun does not seem suseptable to ""limp wristing"" failures as many straight blowback pistols are. The bore is in good condition.
There are some dents and scratches in the wood grips, and the grip screws are not original, but this is only a cosmetic problem, they stay on just fine. There are a few small scratches on the slide that are barely noticeable. The sights shoot a little bit high, but not enough for it to be an issue at pocket-pistol range. I'm selling this gun as I have no need for it, and I'm personally not a fan of the two safeties, but I think this could be a good carry gun for the right person, or a good backup piece."

Ser# 396127. Made during WW1. This pistol is all correct and original (except lanyard stud, see below). All numbers match throughout the gun. The finish is original and is 85% overall. Alot of the fire bluing remains on the small parts. The rifling and bore do have corrosion, as almost all of these do, but the rifling is still very good and the bore is as well. I have shot this gun personally and it is still pretty accurate. Functions fine too. It is RARE to find one of these with ANY rifling left and a barrel that is not a sewer pipe. The lanyard ring shown is NOT INCLUDED. It was not an original anyway. But any keyring type ring of the correct size should be fine as a replacement. I believe repros are available as well. As far as the lanyard stud/ grip area: I have asked the experts and there seems to be a 50/50 mix of this just being a Civilian modification (as apparently modifications were done all the time on these), and a possible Military Armorer having done this specially for some unit or soldier. Either way, it is fine workmanship and was not done by some ""Bubba"". The craftsmanship that went into cutting the correct, matching angles into the grips and the hand filing of the stud enclosure are very finely done. You can see the wear on the grip from the original stud ring wearing on it. I can only guess that this might have been done for concealability, or for a different holster enclosure? I don't know, but in the years to come, with all the info that is discovered each year, maybe someone will dig up what the real meaning is. That's the fun of collecting I guess. Either way, this is an excellent example of a hard to find pistol at a bargain price!

I assembled several months ago.  All parts on this rifle were purchased new.  The DPMS lower receiver is a few years old, but sat in my safe until I put this rifle together.  The parts list for the build is as follows

Criterion 20 inch hybrid contour (.750"" at gas block) chambered in .223 wylde.  Rifle length gas system.  Chrome-lined and parkerized finish.
Griffin Armament linear compensator.
Seekins SP3R V3 15 inch handguard.
Seekins IMRT-3 V3 Billet Monolithic upper.
Seekins Adjustable gas block and melonited rifle length gas tube.
Seekins Enhanced lower parts kit (trigger guard, mag release, bolt catch, ambi safety selector, take down pins).
Bravo Company bolt carrier group.
DPMS Lower receiver.
Timney 3 pound AR-15 trigger (small pin).
Accu wedge.
Lancer Carbon fixed Stock - A2 Rifle length.
Aero Precision rifle length buffer tube, rifle buffer, and buffer spring.
Ergo Grip tactical deluxe pisto grip.
Primary Arms 1-8x with the ACSS reticle (very nice scope)
Vortex Cantilever scope mount.

I had the handguard, lower, trigger guard, and dust cover cerakoted in Midnight Bronze.

I have shot exactly 100 rounds with this rifle.  I have tried four different ""models"" of ammunition.  I shot Hornady Black 75gn BTHP, Hornady Match 73gn ELD-match, Federal Premium with 73gn Berger bullet (2 boxes of this ammo), and PPU Match 69gn match.

All the tested ammo shot well except the PPU.  I had hoped the PPU would shoot good because it was the cheapest at $11 per box, but it shot like crap out of this rifle.  Groups were anywhere from 1.5 to 2 inches with the PPU ammo.  The best was Federal Premium with Berger bullets, the next best was Hornady Black followed by Hornady match.

Hornady Black - Avg velocity 2654 fps with an SD of 20 fps and extreme spread of 82 fps
Hornady Match - Avg velocity 2670 fps with an SD of 37.6 fps and extreme spread of 143 fps.  I really exptected the Hornady match to perform better.  I think I got a bad batch.  I literally had a dud.  Ran it through my rifle twice and nothing.  If I keep this rifle I will most likely try this ammo again just to be sure.  Groups were good, right at an inch, but the Black grouped just slightly better.
Federal Premium - Avg velocity of 2676 fps with an SD of 19 fps and extreme spread of 69 fps.  I ran two boxes because the first box I messed up with the chronograph data and didn't have definitive/reliable data.  This ammo shot the best.  I had one group right at a half inch (3 shot group though).
PPU Match - 2731 fps with an SD of 21.5 and an extreme spread of 82 fps.  Consisitent ammo, but consistently produced poor groups.


It's a great/fun rifle but I've decided I want to build another bolt gun.  I just have a preference for bot guns. 

I would like $1,100 for the rifle as described and pictured.  The magazine pictured is actually a 6.8spc magazine and not included (I used it for pictures for the Cerakoter).  I have 2 5 round magpul magazine that will be included.

Any questions please let me know.
