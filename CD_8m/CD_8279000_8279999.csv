I have multiple 300 Blackout AR’s and am looking to trade for a AR Upper chambered in 5.56x45(.223) or 9mm so I can have some versatility at the range. Since the transition from one caliber to the other is as easy as changing the upper Receiver(technically the barrel) I am hoping to find someone to trade this pretty much brand new upper with so I can go to the range with both 5.56 and my other 300Blk. Please let me know if you have something that we can work out a deal with. If you have any ammo for the 5.56 I have 80 extra 300 AAC Blackout new from factory(not reloads) rounds i can throw in to sweeten the deal(4 boxes of 20rds). I am looking to meet ASAP as I’m itching to go to the range lol. Thanks for your time. Please text me at 25384459two zero so that the response time can be quick as emails are not always checked quickly, thank you"

This was a parts kit I had purchased and had professionally built on an Ohio Ordinance heat treated AK receiver with an AK fixed stock trunnion.This means this krink is able to accept virtually any type of stock you desire. Fixed wood stock, side folder, etc. It has had a 9” faux suppressor professionally spot welded and pinned to keep it legal length.if you desire to SBR this in the future it is already set up for it and it would require the tax stamp and ATF paperwork in order for you to remove the weld and pin to make it an SBR.I also had the wood professionally sanded down and painted to give it the red Russian wood look which I know is something a lot of AK enthusiasts are into. I have had it down to all of my AK’s. It was painted with heat resistant paint and clear coat and should last a lifetime.If you have any questions or interesting trades I am open to hearing offers. I’m looking into another build at the moment and could use the funds to start that project. Cash is king**bumpski stock not included**419-558-3818Mike"

There are also minor nicks, cuts, and scratches throughout the length of the rifle's wooden stock. This rifle does come with the original iron sights, as well as clips for a strap to be attached. The rifle also features a trap-door that allows rounds to be loaded, and the inside of the chamber, as well as the inside of the barrel appear to be in great shape, with little to no rusting or pitting. Even the rifling looks good! This rifle DOES NOT feature an attachment at the end of the barrel to allow for a bayonet to be attached, but other than that this rifle is in fantastic condition.

Not a .38 super conversion. Grips have gold medal from the MR Gold cup range from colt of that time. I do not know if that was part of the kit when it was supplied by colt. Kits were supplied to then famous competitors and pistol builders, Jim Clark Sr and Gil Hebard.  I do not know who built this pistol, I have scoured the internet and publications records are hard to come by for these custom built guns,  the factory colt gold cups have tracable serial numbers and came in factory boxes.  This pistol features rings in the barrels throat to delay blow back for accuracy.  It was and is a purpose built auto pistol to compete in the bullseye match to replace revolvers as the service pistol category.  The mags are 5 shot capacity.  I have 4 mags 2 of which are original Colts the other two are remanufactured. All of which are now extinct and command prices of up to $100 per mag.  I bought this from a collection arms dealer in Illinois in 2012.  I have shot it and it is amazingly accurate.  I have stocked up on wad cutter ammo as it is hard to find on the shelves.  Will sell some seperate of gun if interested at $25 a box.  I am a Delaware CCW holder if you are too we can deal in person, otherwise can meet you at XRing in Newark delaware to transfer.  Contact me to further inspect the pistol or for more pictures as I can only upload one on armslist, price is firm."

It is Remington’s ‘Mil-Spec’ factory rifle, as it features a stainless steel action, bolt, and heavy profiled barrel, which is 24” long, has the 5R rifling profile, 1:11.25 twist rate, and made from 416R stainless steel; all of which are features found on the true Mil-Spec M24. The action is set in an HS Precision stock that has a CNC milled full length aluminum bedding block. I received the gun BRAND NEW directly from Remington in October of 2017, as it was a replacement for a defective firearm I had purchased from them. Since I have had the gun, I have put 130 rounds through it, including barrel break-in rounds, and it is in absolutely perfect condition. The accuracy of this gun is remarkable for a factory rifle. With handloads I’ve tuned, it is truly a 1/2 MOA gun on 5 shot groups with regularity. I’m selling this gun because I simply have too many precision rifles chambered in .308 Winchester, and I want to finally build one chambered in 6.5 Creedmoor. Comes with original box and owners manual. For any questions or if you would like additional pictures, please contact me via call or text. Don’t hesitate to make an offer. 859-556-9974Thank you!"

Sterling is a company that was only around for a short while in the late 60 s and early 70s making a very reliable and well built handgun in a rather cheap and inneffective firearm market, thus leading to their ultimate downfall and not very many of them being around at all for 2 reasons. 1. Those who do have them have come to love their dependability and their reliability. Can't be topped. 2. Anybody in the pocket pistol world has these up high in their must have list and they're highly sought after. They generally sell for anywhere from $250-$300 and I have included with mine an OWB holster and a Bianchi Leather shoulder concealment holster plus a good bit of ammo. I'm looking to trade her for a Heritage 6 shot with a 4 inch barrel or any type of revolver. Lemme know what you got. Thanks!"

An added benefit of the Secure Action system is that it's easier to rack the slide, compared to a similar size striker-fired pistol. The pistol's frame is constructed with glass-filled nylon with a precision machined, hard coated, aluminum chassis that contacts the slide with full-length guide rails. The slide is made of through-hardened alloy steel and blued; front and rear serrations provide a non-slip hold while loading or clearing the weapon. Front and rear sights are dovetailed to the slide, and drift adjustable. Sharp edges have been beveled to aid in concealment, drawing the pistol and holstering. The Security-9 Semi-Auto Pistol comes equipped with a trigger safety and a manual thumb safety. The slide stop serves as the takedown pin to easily fieldstrip the pistol for cleaning. Ships with 2 magazines.

Having features in line with the wartime Mauser, the Weimar-era guns were sanctioned by the Treaty of Versailles as the only long arms permitted to the German military. Apart from a replacement cleaning rod and barrel band, the gun is composed of all-matching components, including the furniture and screws, and has seen no refinish or restoration. Remaining in German service during the inter-war period, this rifle would have been inherited by the Third Reich, and is typical of the weapons issued to the SA/Brownshirts, EWB, and early Waffen SS units. Having no import mark, this rifle is a fine candidate for having been brought back as a GI's war trophy. Always a scarce find for the Mauser enthusiast, examples in this condition are virtually rare, and this fine, Reichswehr-issued Gew.98 represents a strong investment as well as a superb addition to the dedicated public or private collection."
