It is sighted in with plain old Remington 2 3/4 sluggers. Deer dropped with one shot about 90 yards or so. It will also come with a Bushnell Banner 3x9 scope.

Like new in the Box. I purchased this rifle new . A Total of 20 rounds fired to break in the barrel properly and sight it in. The first 100 yard group fired for accuracy with Hornady Super Performance 143 grain ELD-X measured .778 off the bench and bags with a 3x9 scope. As with all these rifles the trigger has some initial take up but then breaks crisp and clean. (This is Not the Accu Trigger). I Have the original box and documents from Savage. As near perfect as any used rifle can be. This will make a great hunting rifle that will out shoot a lot of others costing much more. Reason for selling is to help fund a new project.  NOT TRADES PLEASE.Text me at 615 477 Seven 89 two and I will forward pictures.The deal is for Cash. Face to face. Willing to sign a bill of sale. Tennessee resident.I can meet in the Nashville/Brentwood/Franklin area or in the McMinville/Smithville/Cookville area.Thanks for looking.NO TRADES

This a great rifle.  Well made and fun. I bought it assembled.  I've always wanted to try black powder and I'm glad that I did but I enjoy other hobbies more and just don't see myself shooting this much.  Function perfect and is in like new condition.   The rifle comes with a nice fiberglass ramrod, powder, powder measure, ball starter, 200+ prelubed patches, 20+ lead balls, 200+ ignition caps, extra nipples, nipple wrench, original box and paperwork.  Everything needed to go shooting. 
If your interested in purchasing this rifle please text me at (541)771-one433I will return emails and phone messages but texting is the fastest.***** NO background check needed on Muzzleloading firearms so no extra fee *****
The Kentucky Rifle matches classic beauty with outstanding performance. The octagonal barrel is rifled 1:66"" for patched-ball loads. The long sighting plane between the blade front sight and fixed notch rear sight adds precision shooting accuracy. The color case hardened lock features a V-type mainspring for fast lock time. The full-length two piece stock of walnut-finished select hardwood is accented by solid brass furniture. This finished rifle comes with percussion ignition and is great to take out in the field or simply hang up on your wall.

Manufacturer's info:With the 686 White Onyx over-under shotgun, ambitious hunters wanting to finally trade up to a Beretta no longer have to dream. Available in 12 gauge, this shotgun will fit any hunter’s budget while offering the features and benefits that have made the 680 line a legend among shotgun aficionados the world over. The strong, low-profile action is at the heart of this shotgun, while the proportions, balance and handling make it second to none in its ability to do its job--hit the target whether this is a game bird or a clay target.
Strong, Low-Profile Action:The 686 White Onyx is built around an action that has become an unrivaled benchmark for over-unders. It features a dual locking-lug system that ensures both strength and sleekness: the dual lugs in the middle of the action dispense with the need of a cross-bolt on top, thus enabling the receiver to be thin and low-profile. The point of balance is right at the hinge-pin, meaning that this Beretta shotgun will shoulder and point better than other brands costing several times as much.
Classic, Attractive Looks:Sometimes, you don’t need extra embellishing to bring out beauty. The 686 action is a perfect example of this. With its trim proportions and its lines, with its flawless contour and harmonious geometry, you get a sense of form following function, resulting in a truly classical object. Add to this the rest of the shotgun--with its components in harmonious proportion with one-another--and you see why the 680 line of sporting guns has become something highly prized in the gun-cabinet of the most discriminating collectors. Put another way: the 686 White Onyx is something you can brag about even when you are not shooting it.
Easy to Shoot and Maintain:The White Onyx comes with barrels equipped with the Optimachoke system, to let you easily swap choke tubes to match the type of hunting or shooting you intend to do. Also, the cold-hammer forged tubes are super-resistant and with withstand any kind of shell you put through them. The single selective trigger further enables you to put two different chokes on the barrels, thereby tailoring each shot to the intended distance and purpose. Lastly, the 686 White Onyx is extremely easy to maintain, since we have constructed it of highly-durable materials designed to last for generations. So, whether you are an upland hunter, a turkey or waterfowl hunter, or even a clay shooter, the 686 White Onyx is a shotgun that will give you both top performance and pride of ownership.
