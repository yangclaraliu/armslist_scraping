It is the A variant.  This is a semi-automatic rifle that takes all standard AR mags, but is piston operated more like an AK.  It folds down for smaller storage (even fits in the saddle bag on my motorcycle) and makes a great backpacking gun.  It is very lightweight, weighing just 5 pounds unloaded.  Other unique features include a pair of 10-round magazines that stow in the stock and a forend that opens up into it's own bipod (where typically, adding a bipod to a rifle adds bulk and weight).  It has a rear peep sight with a shrouded front blade, and also a rail molded into the polymer receiver for mounting a red dot or other sight.This a great lightweight rifle that has given me no trouble (just put 60 rounds through it this afternoon).  The only reason I'm selling it is because I have my sights set on an RDB.If you're interested, email me and ask specific questions about the rifle, or about when and where we can meet up.  Don't ask if it's still available 'cause I will pull the ad immediately upon a completed sale.  Any email of 6 words or less will be ignored.  Sorry to sound harsh, but tired of the annoying stuff."

This revolver is in very good shape with virtually all of it’s original blue finish. There is even traces of the case hardening colors on the trigger and hammer. The grips are in great shape too without any chips or cracks. It’s totally functional with a shiny bore that isn’t pitted, dark or corroded. This one was made in 1899 as stamped on the barrel therefore it misses ATF antique status by one year so it is considered a handgun and is subject to all the same rules as a modern revolver. It comes with an original holster that’s in good shape but that is somewhat fragile just as any leather is that’s over 100 years old. Finally there are two full 50 round boxes of 8mm Lebel ammo made by Fiocchi. I bought this ammo a few years ago the last time Fiocchi did a limited run. It’s hard to find and goes for around $75 a box by itself and maybe more now.All in all this is is is a true collectors item and especially so for those who are into French miltary items. I’m asking $700 for everything which is quite reasonable for a MLE 1892 revolver in the very good condition like this one along with the ammo and holster. This is is a face to face sale only with pickup in the Brandon area. If this revolver were one year older and an antique then I would consider shipping it, but it’s not so I will not ship. So no sense in asking as I won’t change my mind. Payment in USA CASH only, no money orders, credit cards, PayPal, bank checks or anything else accepted. Buyer must be a Florida Resident at least 21 years old with a valid Govt issue ID. A proper bill of sale will be provided."

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating ""pusher"" rod which virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The HK Modular Rail System (MRS) is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The MRS handguard has a more ergonomic design, yet retains many features from the previous FFRS. It uses an HK proprietary keyhole design to allow the attachment of Picatinny rail segments to the handguard. The MR556A1 also has a Picatinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Major subassemblies, including the upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. The MR566A1 is produced in the USA from both American and German-made components. The German-made, unchromed barrel is produced by HK's famous cold hammer forging process with the highest quality steel for a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. This model is supplied with one 30-round magazine, a 9"" MRS handguard, and Troy Microsights."

Email me for in depth pics or questions. I am NOT interested in hunting rifles, shotguns, or crappy handguns. First up is a 1950 Enfield No4 Mk2(F), serial range 211XXX. Ive shot maybe 50 rounds of Greek surplus through it, and some Wolf .303 which performed fine and surprisingly did not keyhole. Mostly matching, bolt does not. Pretty good shape, a few light nicks on the stock. Front sight guard has a little bit of wobble to it. Includes new repro sling.$550Next is a TNW Suomi KP-31, 9mm. Comes with a drum and stick mag, as well as original green leather Finnish sling (not pictured, its an AK sling in the pic). The drum has been 100% reliable for me, but the stick has issues about halfway through. I'm guessing its the feed lips in the mag itself; new ones are about $20 apiece but I haven't bothered to try yet. I've put probably 500 rounds down it. Essentially it's just getting broken in. It's heavy and awkward, but extremely accurate, even with the rudimentary iron sights. Bought it to SBR, but 41f discouraged me from doing any more NFA stuff.$865Ruger GP100, 6"" barrel stainless .357 magnum. Added some wooden grips, as well as an aftermarket spring kit to lighten the trigger pull. Its not pictured, but I will include the spring kit as well as the original springs. It currently has the lightest hammer and trigger spring installed, so the pull is quite light. Original Hogue grip is included, but unfortunately I lost the screw for it. Also have a speed loader for it. Not exactly sure of the round count, but I think it's around 400. I'll include all the empty brass I have with it too$550Tapco SKS stock kit with 20rd duckbill magazine. I believe the mag can accept stripper clips but don't quote me on it. I also have a scope mount dust cover with a cheapo 4x scope somewhere, but, spoiler alert, I lost the screws for that too.$70 for stock and mag. $90 if you want the dust cover and scopeCheapo 4"" AR quad rail$5Magpul STR stock with QD sling swivel installed$70BCM Mod 0 grip$20Brand new PTR-91 green stock set with recoil pad installed$70Not pictured, 1120 rounds of corrosive Yugo surplus 7.62x39 ammo in a sealed tin on SKS stripper clips in a wooden crate. $350.Trades listed at the top.

Introduced in 2009, the CZ P-07 was the first handgun to feature the convertible Omega trigger system. A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools.
 
The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa.
 
All sharp edges were removed and a forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps were added. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before.

The rifle features a 24 inch heavy fluted barrel with a muzzle break, a one piece picitinny rail, digital camo AccuStock, AccuTrigger, and an all steel construction 10 round detachable box magazine by Accurate Mag Company.  In addition to that, I have a 6-18 Vortex Crossfire II scope with a level attached, a cheek riser, and an imitation Harris bipod.  I zeroed the rifle at a hundred yards last August, cleaned it, oiled it, and put it away.  The only adjustment I never made to it is on the magazine feed lip.  I never bothered to buy the adjustment tool because I feed the ammo by hand one round at a time when I shoot long range.  The mag feed lip probably needs to be opened up about 3 thousandths or so to get the cartridges to feed more smoothly.  The adjustment tool costs about 25 bucks.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale.  1000 dollars gets everything I listed in the ad.  900 gets you everything but the optic.  Not looking for trades at this time.  And thanks for your interest."
