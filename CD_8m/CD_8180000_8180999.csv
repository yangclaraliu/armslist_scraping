Has all parts just can’t seem to fix it to where the trigger catches the hammer and pulls it back. Trigger is dead and hammer doesn’t move at all. Other than that the gun is in pretty good shape. Comes with box and one mag. I don’t have the time to fix it or take it to a gunsmith so I’m willing to take a reasonable offer for it if any gunsmiths on here think it’s an easy fix. Shoot me an offer if your interested. if not sold I’ll probably take it to a gunsmith down the road once I have time and money. Thanks for looking

I’m the original owner and have been using it for a range and IDPA/USPSA competition gun. I haven’t kept a formal round count, but I’d guess it to be between 2,000 and 3,000 rounds.
It’s a stock stainless build with a Dan Wesson two-piece magwell funnel that I added shortly after purchase. It fits well but is not gunsmith blended. I still have the stock mainspring housing, too.
I have the original double-diamond cocobolo tapered-bottom grips for it and a set of Fusion red cocobolo ranger cut magwell bottom grips on it.
The two original 9-round Dan Wesson magazines don’t fit with the magwell funnel very well (they seat up inside way past flush). But I have 3 Tripp 10-round magazines with base plates that fit perfectly that could be part of the deal. The magwell funnel could be removed, of course.
I bought it new in November of 2017. I'm switching to 45 ACP for competition."

If you search gunbroker-advanced search-completed auctions - you have to have an account to see completed auctions - there's only one other one and it sold for about $3000. This has about 90% bluing. Dragoon marked sights. The buttplate says ""27"" which could be off of an M28 stock, civil guard, or maybe the 27th Jager battalion. It also has a ""1"" inscribed under the buttplate. Finnish wartime round finger spliced stock. Nice tiger striping on handguard, arctic birch stock. KAB marked rear sight indicating cossack or Dragoon. It is a bit shorter than a regular M91. This was most likely used in the winter war, Finnish civil war, world war I, and WWII, if not all. It's counter bored, no import mark. I have shot it about 5 times and is a consistent shooter, but still would only buy as a collectible and not something to eat a bunch of lead. This is probably a bring-back since there's no import mark. It has the Finnish army SA mark on the side of the barrel shank, imperial tula crest, tang matches receiver and marked 1895 so this considered antique and requires no FFL to sell, but I will not ship. Only trades I'm iterested are Suomi KP31's, M1 Garrands/Carbins(depending on make & condition), Swedish or German mausers, Swiss K31's, FN49's, Russian SKS's, SVT-40's, Romaian PSL's, other mosins, M1917 revolvers, WWII pistols, - Pretty much anything WWII/WWI and/or slight-postwar military weapons. No sporterized or tacticoolized weapons unless it's something super rare. Can add cash to trade or I can add cash to trade depending what you got."

(The bipod is not included and was only used to take pictures)Right out-of-the box, the second generation SIG716 DMR features an improved gas system, lightweight handguard, and an overall weight reduction of more than two pounds. The two-stage match trigger and muzzle brake help shrink groups to less than a single minute-of-angle, accuracy simply thought impossible from a gas piston. This two-position adjustable gas system keeps carbon, excessive heat and other fouling out of the chamber, enhancing reliability and accuracy.

I would also like a Sig Sauer P320 xcarry. I would also quite like to own a .44 magnum. I would be open to a lever action or AR trade as well. After that I’m pretty much open-minded and will respond even if only to say no that I’m not interested.  I don’t have any interest in Taurus, other than maybe a Judge or .44 magnum, so please don’t bother with those. I also don’t like cowboy style revolvers or Hunting rifles. I’m not a hunter. I do ask that you Please be willing to negotiate, because if I like something and you offer what I believe is too little of an offer, I will counter offer with what I would consider fair. You should do the same if you like what I have but feel like the trade is not quite fair.

There are no markings on the scope from mounting the rings, as the rings have a protective tape on their inner surfaces.Manufacturer info:Versatile, practical, utilitarian, and just plain cool—Scout rifles hold a special place in many hunters and shooters hearts. So we created a scope specifically designed to optimize the performance characteristics of the platform. With an incredibly generous 9.45” eye relief to accommodate forward mounting, and a 2-7 zoom range, the Vortex Scout Scope is the perfect optic for any job you and your scout rifle want to throw at it.Magnification 2-7 xObjective Lens Diameter 32 mmEye Relief 9.45Field of View 18.3-5.2 feet/100 yardsTube Size 1""Turret Style CappedAdjustment Graduation 1/4 MOATravel per Rotation 15 MOAMax Elevation Adjustment 60 MOAMax Windage Adjustment 60 MOAParallax Setting 100 yardsLength 10.5 inchesWeight 12 ozI used this on a .22LR for maybe 200 rounds during a single range session.

I might be interested in trading for a standard eye relief optic in the 7-9x range, maybe a red dot for the 10/22, or even a higher-end optic 1-6x or 1-8x (such as a Vortex Strike Eagle) with cash on my end for a different project.

The N-PAP DF has a custom fit slot muzzle break, wolf spring kit, Tapco G2 trigger and Hogue furniture with picatinny rails for adding accessories. This M85 pistol is “NOT” the M85 PV that’s commonly available and uses a proprietary steel magazine that’s heavy and expensive too boot. This is the very sought out version that excepts standard AR-15 magazines and drums. Also included is a brand new SBM-47 stabilizing brace from SB-Tactical, a $150 value. These are no longer being made anymore and becoming harder to find and quite collectible, especially in this condition. Not to mention they will only increase in value like the Chinese Mac 90s did. Both firearms are in “FACTORY BRAND NEW UNFIRED CONDITION”. The M85 is still in it’s original box with tags. This is a package deal and I will “NOT” split them up. I’m not interested in trades unless it’s an M1 Garand or a Springfield M1A in very good condition with minimal throat & muzzle erosion and a good barrel with sharp rifling. Only reason I’m thinking of selling is because I would like to add an M1 Garand or Springfield M1A to my Collection. Asking price is $1700 and the price is firm. Bill of sale and FL drivers license required. All federal and state laws apply, not willing to deal with persons under the age of 21 or convicted felons. CWP holders preferred. I’ll only meet you FTF in a public place during the day light hours for your safety and mine, preferably @ my local gun range or something similar. Located in Melbourne FL.

Meaning there is simply no tolerance for parts that do not perform as if someone's life depends on them. Using the powerful .357 Magnum ammo this quick-draw revolver has plenty of muscle to back it up. Features include fixed sights, crisp single-double action trigger and a transfer bar for added safety.Features:- Taurus Security System (TSS)rs: Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with Taurus's revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun- Transfer Bar: The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rearSpecifications:- Action: Double/Single- Caliber: .357 Magnum - Barrel Length: 2""  - Capacity: 5 Rounds  - Sights: Front and Rear: Fixed- Rate of Twist: 1:16.5""  - Grooves: 6  - Grooves Turn: Right- Safety: Taurus Security System,Transfer Bar  - Trigger Type: Smooth  - Grips: Rubber  - Finish: Blue  - Length: 6 1/2""  - Weight: 24 ozMSRP: $375"
