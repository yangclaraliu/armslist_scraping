Professionally cerakoted in Patriot Brown mixed with Crushed Silver. Custom trigger job performed by a local gunsmith, and all springs or worn parts replaced with Wolff springs or Ruger parts as needed. No hammer push-off and functions flawlessly. Excellent trigger pull/break for accurate shots. I recently put a rubber Hogue Monogrip on it for target shooting, but it will come with the real carbon fiber grips as shown. The cerakote coating shows slight wear on the front of the cylinder from smoke, but to me it adds to the look of the gun. This is the model to have, as it has a transfer bar that allows the hammer to rest on a loaded cylinder. This is also a convertible model that accepts the 9mm cylinder available online. Heavy enough that .357 magnums are very manageable and .38 specials feel like .22lr. Adjustable rear sights, very accurate and fun to shoot. Single action only. All original parts, receipts, and original box are included along with the Hogue and carbon fiber grips. Can include 250 rounds of 148gr 38spl target wadcutter ammo for the right deal. Only offering for trade/sale because I want something more suited to NRA Bullseye competition.

I am the original owner of this EMP and it is in exceptional condition.  Very low round count, flawless function, never holstered or carried.   Novak style night sights still shine bright.  Original factory hard case with (4) 8rd magazines ( one more than came with it from the factory), paperwork, outside the waistband holster and double magazine carrier. None of the accessories have ever been used. 
The EMP changes what a compact 1911 should be.  The action of the EMP is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP to believe how controllable and accurate it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. All of this in one of the smallest 1911's out there.
The EMP features:
Low profile 3-Dot tritium Novak style combat sights
Match grade fully supported and ramped barrel
4 magazines of 8+1 rounds of .40 SW, an amazing amount of punch in a small 1911s.
Dual Spring recoil system w/ Full Length Guide Rod
Forged Stainless Steel Slide with a Satin Finish
33 Ounces  /  Height 5""  /  Length 6.6”
3"" Stainless Steel Match Grade Barrel, Fully Supported Ramp, Bull Barrel

FN Forty-Nine is a modern service handgun, intended primary for police/security use.
It is recoil-operated, locked breech firearm that uses improved Browning linkless locking principle. The gun is striker fired, and unlike many other striker-fired guns, like Glocks, Forty-Nine is a true DAO gun, with availability of re-striking the misfired cartridge simply with another trigger pull. The striker is completely at rest until the trigger is pulled, so gun is safe. It has no external safety switches or decockers for simplicity and readiness to use.
The frame of the gun is made from black polymer, the slide is made from stainless steel. Gun also has acessory rails on the frame under the barrel, for quick and easy mounting of the laser designators and flashlights.
Type: Double Action Only (Repeatable Secure Striker)
Chambering: .40 S&W

Reliability and simplicity have made GLOCK® semi-automatic pistols a favored sidearm for law enforcement, military, and civilian use all over the world. The GLOCK 22 is a full-size service pistol, shooting the .40 S&W pistol cartridge, a standard defense round with proven knock down power. The Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol utilizes a dual recoil spring assembly that substantially increases service life of the pistol, and helps take the snap out of recoil, reducing muzzle flip for faster follow up shots. A modular back strap allows shooters to instantly customize the grip to an individual shooter's hand size, or to cold weather gloves. Rough grip texturing on the polymer frame provides a sure hold on the pistol when hands are wet or sweaty, and the enlarged magazine catch is reversible, accommodating left- or right-handed shooters. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of a plethora of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The dovetailed rear sight is drift adjustable and has a white outline around its notch; the fixed front blade has a white dot. Sight acquisition is quick in any light. The GLOCK 22 Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be for field carry, at home, or in a vehicle. The model 22 Gen4 comes with two standard 15-round magazines.

REDACTEDDESCRIPTION:Finally available for public consumption is the much anticipated Scorpion sub-gun. Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Starting in 2016, Scorpion Pistols feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck.Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants.The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.Product NameCZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol SKU 91351 Firearm Type Handgun Purpose Home Defense MSRP $849.00 Chambering 9mm Luger Magazine Capacity 20+1 Magazine Type Double stack polymer Frame Fiber-reinforced polymer Grips Polymer, adjustable for reach to trigger Trigger Mech SA Sights Low-profile fully adjustable aperture and post, 4 rear aperture sizes Barrel Cold hammer forged, muzzle threaded 18x1 right-hand and 1/2x28 Barrel Length 7.72 Weight 5.0 lbs Overall Length 16.0 in Height 9.4 in Safety Ambidextrous thumb safety"

On top is the rare Parker Pin Point 1.5-4 red dot scope with the adjustable turret. Instead of the clunky cantilever mount (that I will include), I used Burris Signature rings with the +/- inserts to point the scope down. Instead of using a Scorpyd type washer, at the rear of the scope rail (which is the longer version I got from Barnett), I tapped the rear for an Allen screw so I could fine tune the 20 yards initial sight in procedure.Instead of the factory cast Recruit cams, I got the CNC machined Raptor cams (they’re identical) from Barnett and installed them as well. I also got a spare rear butt which I modified with longer shafts for a longer length of pull for an adult.Accessories include:- 11 20” Executioners, 5 w/factory fletching, 6 with 2” Quickspins plus the original 3 Barnett bolts- original 3 bolt quiver plus an extra 4 bolt quiver, and a Bohning top mount that I didn’t use- sling, extra Red Hot roller cocker plus factory original cocking rope- old factory cables included plus original string that I reserved with .036” AG- a compact Allen case that fits great"
