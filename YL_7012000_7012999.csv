KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM RAIL 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.Kryptek patterns utilize a multi-directional design to effectively conceal in a multitude of terrains that have either a lateral or vertical flow. The bi-level layering of the patterns incorporate background transitional shading and sharp random geometrical foregrounds to create a three-dimensional effect that ensures the utmost in concealment at both close and long ranges. These components, combined with colorations selected and matched based on input from testing and observations from Operators in the field, make Kryptek patterns optimal for many different environments.

The barrel is a Rock ola. There is proof marks on almost all components. Which is correct for the rifle. For example IO on barrel band and IO underneath hand guard. There is a shield with an H on the rest site. This a fat boy M2 stock used mostly through the Korean war and early Vietnam. The hand guard and stock were cut from the same wood., so this is not some parts gun. The wood has not been sanded, no swirl marks and the edges on the wood are sharp. The scews are not splintered from excessive take downs. I took it apart one time to clean, there was a little carbon on the bolt and showed minimal use. The barrel / bore is bright with no pitting. There is no import markings. This rifle came from a friend/ long time collector and hand selected this rifle from DCM years ago. I have a mint unissued m4 imperial bayonet for sale as well that matches the rifle perfectly. That is an additional 200.00. This can be a shooter but also a highly collectible rifle too.

It screams to be used out to 800 + yards! None of the Red Dot's that I know of are for targeting at that distance. SO I purchased a Leupold 4x18x40 Scope to reach out. This however is a blast. THe one picture shows the red dot setting on the front post at it's top. Sighting through the rear sight hole sight through the Red dot and onto the front post sight is always right on. This sight mount and Red Dot are taken off and reinstalled on the handle without as much as a peep of movement. But, alas, I need the money for more long distance ammo. The mount sells for `$40 and the Primary Arms Micro dot sells for around $95.....the combination, I will sell for $110 and you pay ($10) shipping! Continental US only.

From what I can tell, the rifle was made in January of 1972 based on the barrel stamps and lack of alphabetical prefix in front of the serial number like on newer rifles. The rifle is in very good condition given its age, but it does have some minor scratches on the stock. No cracks or major damage though. The rifle I decided to use is not in as good of condition as this one even though it is about 10 years newer.This rifle has a 24"" barrel with blade sights, chambered in 7mm Magnum with a twist rate of either 1:9 or 1:10. The trigger has been worked over / polished and has a pull of maybe 1.5 pounds. It is a rather light trigger, but the pull is nice and tight with no creep or slack at all. Despite the light pull, you need to pull directly in the middle of the trigger and it is difficult to set off by just pulling the edges - this means there is little chance of accidently bumping it. A vintage 2-7x Redfield Widefield rifle scope is currently mounted on the gun as well and is included. I paid exactly $575 for this rifle and I am just looking to get my money back out of it. If you were to part the rifle out. the barrel is worth $75+, the scope is about $120, the original stock given its condition is around $80, and then the action (receiver, bolt, trigger) is worth $375 give or take some. Recoil lug and bottom floor metal are also worth some money. This is cool old gun that has clearly been cared for and not abused, hence the reason I bought it and why I was hesitant enough to not rip it apart for my build. 7mm is also a power house of a round. At 3,000 fps at the muzzle, even with light hunting charges, this gun will drop any animal in the state with ease. Please email, I will be out of town from July 1 to 21, but will make arrangements for anyone interested in the gun for when I return. If the ad is up, the gun is available."

Stock is a retractible and foldable! I basically bought this, replaced the standard wood parts with the Magpul parts and had a couple range days with it. That's it. Comes with the stock aluminum mag. I also have the rail attachment, as you can see from the picture, Midwest Industries side-mounted rail. Check out the video if you want to see it, I explain some things and show a little bit more than the pictures.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4SytgMsBxE 
Asking $800. Consider that the price of a WASR without any extras is usually somewhere around $600. The Magpul stock is $100 alone. The Magpul handguard/gas brake attachment is $100, Magpul stocks are about $20. Please don't try to lowball me.

Many shooters with small hands are forced to carry a revolver for self-defense because the grip of a semiautomatic is too large. Enter the Aegis, a 9 mm pistol that combines the real-world advantages of a 1911 in a platform with a smaller grip. Small, light and accurate pistols get carried. Bulky guns get left home. Light weight, compact and absolutely reliable, Aegis models are built in the Kimber Custom Shop for shooters with small hands. Thin grips, altered controls and rounded edges make them easy to shoot. A great single-stage 1911 trigger that breaks clean at 4-5 pounds makes them easy to shoot accurately. Standard features include night sights, premium two-tone KimPro II finish that is both self-lubricating and extremely resistant to moisture. Self-defense is no place to compromise.Model number: 3200164Caliber: 9mmClass: HandgunBarrel length: 4”Action Type: SingleFinish: Satin Silver/ Matte BlackCapacity: 9+1Trigger: StandardSights: Self-Illuminating Tritium Night Sights"

Like new with a low round count (less than 200) and very light holster wear. I also installed Talon grips over the stipple for a more confortable concealed carry (I don't wear a t-shirt underneath and move around a lot) but that can easily be taken off if you prefer.

These have a full-length double zipper that allows one to access the whole bag. For anyone who has used an Army duffel, there are times where what you need is at the bottom of the duffel, and essentially one has to dump the whole duffel to be able to get at it. These duffels don't have that problem, you can unzip the bag to see what is in it from top to bottom. However, the hasp where you can put a lock to prevent others from getting into the bag is retained and the zips can be situated so that they are under the hasp when closed. Also, these duffels have backpack straps, just like the old ones, so that the bag can be carried on the back. There are also handles on both ends for pulling the bag in and out of storage and a handle on the top for carrying with one hand. On one side of the bag there is a clear document holder that can be used to slip in either the name of the owner, or perhaps the contents of the bag. Essentially one can put whatever one wants in the document holder, presumably to idenfity the owner or contents of the bag.  Can ship for $5.  This bag is new, but may show some storage marks from being in a tote. It originated with the US government, and is the same bag that they sell at AAFES clothing and sales for $40. I have more pictures if needed.If you see the ad, the items are availible.  Queries such as ""Is this still availible,"" will be treated as attemps to phish my e-mail and ignored."

Local shop has this gun new for $799.00. This gun is beautiful and shoots amazingly but I just am not a huge fan of the 1911 style. I was talked into getting one and I don't regret it at all, but there are some things I would rather have so I'm putting it our there to see if there is interest. Its mint, has 100 rounds down the pipe. Fiber optic front sight and adjustable rear. Has the factory upgraded grips too.  Has two 8 round factor mags, the box and paperwork and an aftermarket case. Its flawless and honestly its a menacing looker and accurate as a can be. I was shooting through holes at 10 yes and 2"" groups at 15 my first time out with it. The trigger is quite nice and I have the take up adjusted really short. Too short maybe. So trades only please in order of first choice. SKS Rifle, Russian or Romanian, Yugo (with some cash), Norinko with 200 cash minimum.. FNH FNX-.45, H&K in .45, maybe a S&W .45 TSW in really excellet condition. Nothing striker fired. 357 magnum revolver with 6 or 7 round capacity and at least a 3"" barrel. 686 or the like, GP100 and a 150 cash. I'm open to ideas but please no small caliber autos or bolt action rifles."
