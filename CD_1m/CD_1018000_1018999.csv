3.8"" match-grade barrel
Rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite finish
Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System
The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case.
   This sidearm is brand new (like new) in every respect. Close inspection will reveal NO scratches or imperfections of any kind. A barrel light will reveal that this weapon has only been fired at the factory. Your opportunity to obtain a highly respected brand name sidearm for a reduced price, pay no tax, produce no record of the sale.

This gun is about a year and a half old and has had only one box of ammo through it. It fed and functioned perfectly, for the little I used it. It is in excellent condition. It uses AR-15 magazines and comes with two ten round magazines. It does not come with the high capacity pre-ban magazines shown in the pictures. They are for sale separately, but only if you are an out of state resident. It includes a built in bipod that works pretty well.

This is the ""CA"" model and cannot fire from the folded position, it has a heavy contour chrome lined barrel and nice ghost ring sights.

    Gun has approx 200-250 rounds thru it, It has been safe kept, 
    It is in better condition now than when it was new, because of how well I take 
    care of my guns.
    Gun runs simply awesome. And looks even better.
    It has factory open sights with long range and short range peep sights.
    Barrel is 1/8 twist barrel, and shoots about 1 1/2 inch group at 100 yards
    and about 4 inch groups at 200 yards.
    Smith and Wesson makes very quality AR's, from very quality and accurate barrels.
    Very highly quality machined upper, (I've compared my ar to several other brand 
    Ar's and you would be supprised at the level of perfection to the naked eye over
    many other brands that are supposed to be better)
    The bolt is shot peaned and magnetic partical tested,(most AR's are not)
    The extractor is the 'Black Extractor' (Most are the inferior 'blue extractor')
    the ""Black"" is the most high quality extractor made, it is much more reliable 
    for firm and solid extraction of every round.
    And of coarse a adjustable position stock.
    And yes, all these specs I've mentioned are specific to this exact model.
Gun also has a good adjustable shoulder strap.

relief for night vision modules.

February 2013 Newsletter 
 Office of Illinois Lt. Governor 
 Sheila Simon 


February 7, 2013 

Dear phil, 

Across the nation, people are talking about guns. Illinois is no exception. The U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals declared unconstitutional our ban on carrying concealed firearms. The court has given lawmakers until June to pass a law on when and where Illinoisans can carry firearms. The Governor used his State of the State address yesterday to say that guns have no place in our schools, shopping malls or sports stadiums. 

Firearms Working Group: Because of the deadline set by the court, I formed a Firearms Working Group, comprised of new members of the General Assembly, to learn about different perspectives and bridge the geographical divide on gun ownership and use in Illinois. Over the next two months, we will meet with stakeholders on all sides of the debate – from hunters to law enforcement to domestic violence prevention advocates – to promote dialogue and work toward consensus on pending legislation. We started our dialogue yesterday with representatives from the Illinois State Rifle Association and Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence. Meet the working group members and send us your thoughts here. 

Legislative Agenda: This session, my office is pursuing three proposals to increase transparency. We’re developing an “income tax receipt” that will show Illinoisans who e-file their tax returns how their tax dollars are spent. We are fine tuning a bill that will make it easier for taxpayers to determine if public servants have financial conflicts of interest. And we’re continuing to push for College Choice Reports, so students can easily compare cost and graduation information for all the degree-granting institutions in this state. 

Military Communities: To strengthen and protect our state’s military installations, I have called on Illinois’ newest Congressional members to join the federal Defense Communities Caucus. The group advocates to ensure our installations remain active and the voices of our troops, their families and our defense communities are heard. In my capacity as chair of the state’s Interagency Military Base Support and Economic Development Committee, I look forward to working with Reps. Cheri Bustos, Bill Enyart, and Brad Schneider whose districts include Illinois’ largest military installations: Rock Island Arsenal, Scott Air Force Base, and Naval Station Great Lakes, respectively. 

If you are free Tuesday, I invite you to join me for breakfast at the Union League Club in Chicago. I will be announcing three game-changing reforms to make college more affordable. If you cannot make the speech but want to get in touch, feel free to call, visit or email with questions, comments or concerns. 

Sincerely, 

Sheila Simon"

It has a metal roof added on top of the original roof (which was in good shape) but I was going to set it in a permanent location so the rafters and metal roof on the top would eliminate the need to reseal the roof (as on a regular camper)  This camper has a kitchen (the propane refrigerator is missing) but everything else is there.  It has a dining room area that makes into a bed, a couch that makes into a bed, a full bathroom, closets and a rear master bedroom.  Doors in the living room and in the master bedroom.   I removed the built in bed in the bedroom thinking I would add my own bed arrangement.  The only negative issue (besides needing a refrigerator and propane tanks - I got rid of the small propane tanks because they were outdated and I was going to use bigger bottles) is that the previous owner cut a hole in the bedroom side wall to either add a sliding glass door or to add a building to it.  I have the opening sealed with a canvas.  When they made the opening, they disconnected many of the electrical wires, which I have traced and matched up.  This has 110V lighting, gas lights and 12V lighting, so you could use it hooked to power, or remote on 12V (with solar panels) or off the grid and primitive with gas.  If you wanted something to live in, I think with a little TLC this could be pretty nice.  The previous owner had used it to live in for 6 months out of the year.  I am willing to consider a REASONABLE cash offer or a trade for: 
• AR
• AK
• sniper rifle
• Mini 14
• other offers

I know this needs some work and I'm not looking for a premium price, but I am using it for storage and given the current economics, someone else could put this to a much more productive use.  I will get pictures to interested parties.  It is sold ""as is"" - but I have listed everything I know that might be a pro or a con.  It will be the buyer's responsibility to move it.  I have a friend who can move it but you might need to negotiate with him if you need it moved (he's really good and unbelievably fair)."

Made by or for Colt, Star, Iver Johnson and FI. Locked breach, adjustable rear sight, all steel consruction. Serial number CPA 023*** (Colt Pony Automatic = CPA). In the middle 1970s, Colt decided to offer a .380 auto, and chose to partner with Star. The gun (to be called the Pony) was to be assembled in the US, presumably by Colt, from a Star DK slide & associated internals, with a U.S. made frame. A fixed lanyard loop was added to increase height of the gun and the adjustable sights are typical of features added to get points for the 1968 Gun Control Act, which placed restrictions on importation of small handguns. Safety cams hammer off sear for extra protection. Mechanical condition is excellent, pictures tell the story. No operational issues, and everything works as it should.

The pistol isn't even considered broken in according to WCC, this has less than 100 rounds through and will come with everything shown in the pics - including four mags, two with bumpers and two without.  A couple of mags are Kimber and work just as well as the factory WCC mag.
Add-ons for this pistol include tritium night sights with the back sight being the semi-rounded for snag free pulls and stainless hex grip screws.  
This was not carried in a holster so you will not see any wear marks on the frame/slide from a holster or body sweat.
You can refer to the WCC site for more details, but if you are looking, you most likely know what you are seeing… retail is about 3350 as configured - black over gray armor-tuff.

This is the best AK-based rifle. VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty reinforced receiver and hammer-forged heavy duty barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. The engineering of the Vepr has produced a receiver that is more stable than a machined receiver. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with beautiful walnut stock make these rifles the best AK-based rifles available in the US market. The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope.

This SAIGA 12 was on my bucket list for a while. I had this custom built with the best parts avaiable. I told the custom builder ""I want the best Saiga 12 money can buy! This is definately not your run of the mill ""converted gun"". First the brand new stock Rifle was sent to a professional milling shop to do the conversion, which included a full professional conversion moving the trigger group forward with Tromix parts and a Tapco G2 trigger. Next the entire gun was sand balsted and professionally refinished with bakelite. The bolt and trigger group was sent off to Pauly's Custom Steelin' to have a trigger job and ""glass bolt"" service performed, which makes the action silky smooth and able to cycle low brass. Next a Chaos Titan Full Length Qaud Rail was added, (which is IMO the best and sleekest on the market). A Chaos Warthog Muzzle Brake was professionally welded to the barrel during the conversion so it was finished with the rest of the gun. This gun has a very high end steel folding mechanism with a Tromix skeleton stock. High end HK adjustable sights. A hogue AK grip was also added. An MD Arms Charging handle, upgraded PUCK and 4 Postion Gas Regulator were also added. This shotgun is 100% 922 compliant and all US parts were used in the conversion. This project was custom built with no expense as concern and was stategically built using only the best parts on the market for the ""dream build"". Comes with one 20 round MD ARMS drum, one 12 round SGM Mag, 8 round Mag, and one 5 round Mag.

Ergonomic and lightweight stock for a comfortable fit and delivers quick, easy handling. Grip serrations offer a positive hold in a variety of conditions. Soft-rubber recoil pad dramatically reduces felt recoil. 

Three-lug bolt has a short 70° throw that easily clears your scope. Dual-cocking cams for smoother and easier cycling from the shoulder. Power Bedding™ integral block system solidly locks the receiver and free-floats the barrel for unrivaled accuracy. 

Hammer-forged barrel is ultraprecise and delivers exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. Four-round, rotary-bolt magazine fits flush and complements the smooth feed cycle. Receiver is drilled and tapped to accept optics mounts. Tang safety is user friendly. Scope bases are included."

Listen up:

Folks, there will be NO ban on ""assault"" rifles and HIGHLY unlikely there will be any magazine bans either. Haven't you noticed even the most hard-core leftist democrats have already taken a step back? They want nothing to do with this. There was a very serious house cleaning in politics when they did this under Clinton and they know better than to every do it again. 
By now you have all heard what is in the ban proposal. It's a long and rediculous list that everyone knows is a joke. No fool would propose such a bill if they didn't fully expect it to be laughed out of congress... the bill is just to appease the pansy liberal voters... in fact, it's practically dead already.
The Illinios magazine ban fell dead in congress without even going to a vote. If a leftist cesspool like Illinois can't even pass it, what do you think is going to happen at the federal level with this current proposal? Federal democrats are already starting to redirect everyone's attention to immigration reform because the gun-grab battle is already lost and they know it. They were trying to run all those news stories about how 90% of all Americans support background checks trying to make you believe it and it didn't work becasue there are 10 of us to every 1 of them. Politicians may be bastards, but they aren't stupid. One thing they know very well is how to stay in office and every single one of them knows a vote for a gun ban will end their career.

The gun culture is suffering a setback right now brought about by the same people who buy up the newest toy every year at Christmas and try to gouge you on Craigslist so your kid can have one. This practice is utterly disgusting and is seriously damaging the sport. 
STOP buying this stuff from them at these outrageous prices. Seriously... 1500 bucks for a Bushmaster? 1.00+ per round for .223?
All they are doing is causing a short-term shortage and the end is near for them, now they are asking 3 grand for a simple AR-15. Don't fall for it! It's over and I hope none of you paid these stupid prices. This ban proposal will mostl likely be officially dead before March and by mid-summer, there will be a surplus of firearms on the market at very reasonable prices. As soon as the ban proposal fails, no one will even want these rifles anymore and you'll be buying them for discounted prices. These jokers who are trying to rip you off know it's over and are getting desperate. The more intelligent ones are already starting to drop their asking price while the rest hang on for dear life knowing they are going to be stuck with a gun they don't even want. HAHAHA ! Cross your fingers and hope they end up losing money when this is over.

So, just relax, calm down and wait a few months... let the hoarders and ripoff artists get stuck with their scheme to rob you. Most of them don't even realize that a Bushmaster is a bottom of the barrel AR platform... they think it's gold plated... they went and bought one at the gun shop thinking they could flip it and double their money.
I assure you, by this time next year, you will be buying 30 round AK and AR mags for 4 bucks again at the gun shows and semi-auto rifles will be plentiful and reasonable priced... IF you can control yourselves. Stop feeding these animals and they will go away... eventually. DO NOT pay double and triple for these weapons, ammunition and magazines. Believe me, I'm tempted to sell my own at these stupid prices but I refuse to participate in this orgy of idiocy. Keep calm and wait them out. Let them eat the ammo they are hoarding when they get hungry... then maybe those of us who are serious and love our sport will be rid of the baseball card traders trying to get rich off of you overnight. 
Let's all stand together and fight this plague in unison.
Peace"

I have a brand new, only fired 20 times AAC handi rifle in 300 blackout w/ a Redfield Revenge 2-7x34mm on Burris Xtreme extra high rings. Purchased new in November 2012.

Marlin 1895 Guide Gun in .45-70 with about 50 rounds through it. It is in perfect condition. Purchased new December 2011.


1942 Izhevsk 91/30 Mosin Nagant w/ a Reproduction P/U scope installed by a competent gunsmith. To the eye the barrel looks brand new and Im 99.99% sure It has full rifling. It has normal wear on the stock. The bolt is bent and not a ""screw on knob"". I only have about 10-20 rounds through this one to sight in the scope, and it held a very nice 1in group at 50. Im sure if i took more time it could of been a lot better. (no corrosive ammo used) Purchased in early 2010.
*just to be clear, this is a normal wartime 91/30 and has no markings of an ""ex sniper"". I wanted to make a P/U repo and this mosin was fresh out of a crate at a local store and i picked it because It had a perfect barrel and I liked the action. 



Excellent Winchester M1917 Enfield in .30-06 marked 1-18. This rifle is absolute beautiful and is the best condition I have ever personally seen one in. The stock has only minor scratches.

This is the Piston driven rifle (like the AK) not the standard AR gas. It has the OEM Sigtac halo sight, SIG folding & adjustable rear stock, and 3- 30 round Sig mags that can attach to each other.  I also have a Nikon P223 scope that I may include if the deal is right. Will come with the hardcase as well: The case still has the price on it from the shop new in 2009 it was 2399.  I just came back from shooting this and when my friends Colt,  and Daniel Defense were having issues with the ammo ?  the Sig just ate it up.
