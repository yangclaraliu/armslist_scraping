If your sitting on one gun or twenty, and you don't have a sufficient stock of ammo for each gun, then what real good is the gun to you except as a collector or an investment? 

What we are seeing now with ammunition could happen again at any time. Be it natural disaster or governmental calamity. If you can't get to walmart, if they are out of stock, if the electricity is off and they won't open the doors....ANY Reason... How much use is that .22 rifle?, that deer rifle?, that AR or AK?. And let's be real here, one day the gun grabbers are going to figure out that the Gun Control they want so badly could be easily accomplished by ammo control. Wehether its the EPA coming in with a trumped up charge and shutting down an ammo factory, or an Executive Order issued by a socialist Muslim wannabe dictator or Taxes on bullets like we see on cigarettes. Bullet control equals gun control.

Put up all the ammo you can. Put it up for your children. Put it up for your grandchildren. It's just like a gun....BETTER the money in the bank. Properly stored it will last longer then you will. Look at what we are seeing now and most of us would agree that this is just a temporary shortage. I've seen .22 bullets listed for a dollar a round. If you have a deer rifle how many rounds would you need for a year? Two?    You can have a two thousand dollar custom rifle that ain't worth a tinkers damn if you need it and don't have ammo.

Heads up boys, life is giving us a lesson here. Lets learn something here."

The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines (15 rd, 13 rd), magazine loader and a black hard case."

This is a NIB Windham Weaponry AR-15 SRC model: R16M4FTT.  It comes with the factory hard case, one 30rd factory mag, sling, owner's manual, and 2013 catalog.  I just received this yesterday and paid the current market price for one of these fine guns, so I'm not ""gouging"" any more than I have been gouged.  If you don't know Windham, do some research.  They are one of the best AR type rifles you can buy.  Certainly better than DPMS, Spikes, and Bushmaster.  They have a lifetime factory warranty that goes with the rifle, not the owner.  In other words you could be the 10th owner and you still have a lifetime warranty from Windham, same as if you bought it new.  This one is the flat top optics ready model with no front sight post to get in the way of your optics.  After watching his majesty, lord-god Obama's speech the other night, I'm now really worried.  Add to that the crap going on in our own State of Colorado and I'm pretty well convinced that you will not be able to buy an AR for much longer.

The price is $1,550 firm.  Which is about what it cost me after all shipping, credit card, and FFL fees.  A limited number of extra mags are available:  Windham factory mags or P-mags for $45 each.  I will also sell some ammo with it, if needed.  The good stuff, not that Russian steel case crap.  Don't shoot that filthy ammo in an AR.  It's ok to use in AKs though."

Why? What could possibly be wrong with ""universal background checks"" to buy a gun?

For starters if all sales require a background check, then all sales can be halted at governmental whim simply by taking the background  check system offline. What are you going to do about it? This administration has already enabled gun trafficking to drug cartels in order to blame US gun owners for Mexico's violence in an effort to try to undermine your constitutional rights. Do you think an administration that will knowingly put guns in the hands of drug cartels will have the slightest hesitation to use NICS availability or lack thereof to halt firearms sales? No, they won't. They will take it offline with the slightest excuse and the court challenges will take months. That doesn't even include the ""technical difficulties"" the system can mysteriously begin to have which can take if offline and let the administration deny all culpability. 

When you have to ask permission to exercise a right, it is no longer a right. Every year numerous bills are introduced to expand the categories of prohibited persons to include, among others, those on the terrorist watch list and no fly list. What's wrong with that you ask? Anyone can be put on either list with absolutely no due process of law, that's what's wrong with it.  Pretty soon the list of prohibited persons will include everyone with a traffic ticket. 

Registration - Registration now would be very difficult to enforce because of private sales. Not so with a universal background check. All sales going through one system begs for comprehensiive record keeping on the whereabouts of every gun sold. Think it can't lead to confiscation? It already has. The Australian firearms registry was a central component of enforcing their ""buyback"" of semi auto firearms and pump action shotguns when those were banned. Those who did not turn them in got a knock at the door because the government knew exactly where the guns were.

Universal background checks are a looming disaster for gun rights, a perfect example of a so called ""reasonable restriction"" that can very easily be turned into anything but with no need to even pass further legislation."

I believe in telling you everything I can think of about a rifle when selling...so prepare for a long description!

About this Rem 740:

Obviously the main attraction to a 740 is that it's semi-automatic. Semi-auto action in 30.06 is obviously quite powerful. Made in the 50's, they are old rifles, but many of them still shoot well. Being semi-auto, they are not as accurate as a bolt action (but they aren't extremely inaccurate either). I would rate mine personally very good for deer size game for 200 yards (maybe more, but 300 would be pushing it since you may miss the vital area you were aiming at). Only you know your hunting habits, so if you normally hunt in woods, where 99% of your shots are ~200 yards or less, then this is a good rifle for you. If you normally hunt in fields where over 300 yards is the norm...then personally semi-auto action isn't worth the bit of accuracy decrease for you, and you shouldn't buy this.

Reliability: 740s are known as hit and miss on reliability. Half of them are bad and jam a lot, half very good and don't jam at all. I've shot Garand era surplus ammo and hand loads and had good results with both, so I strongly believe this is one of the ""hits"" on reliability. I've only had 1 jam, and that was my own fault for experimenting with dry lubes. This doesn't like dry lubes, stick with the normal oil lubes (I use Gunzilla, which can be used dry or wet, I recommend using it and using it wet).

Personally I believe they are all reliable, but that half of the people don't treat them properly. Do not run the gun (or any semi-auto) un-lubed, make sure it's lubed. Do not store it for long periods (long as in between hunting seasons) with a round in the chamber or it may end up stuck since it's a chamber with tight tolerances. And don't store the magazine loaded for long periods, since the feed lips are sheet metal and the constant pressure will bend them slightly over time leading to less reliable feeding. Follow those rules (good rules for any rifle) and they are reliable guns. 

Longevity: 740 barrels typically last a couple thousand shots. Because of this, they are hunting rifles, not target rifles (which is why I decided I should sell, since I love to target shoot, yet I refuse to target shoot with this rifle because I don't want to increase its shot count that much...so I'm not getting as much use out of it as I'd like). I'd estimate a couple hundred rounds through this one currently, and guns lubed with Gunzilla (which I use) often can have barrels last double the normal shot count. So this gun still has plenty of shots left in it, but will suit a hunter much better than someone that likes to let off 40 rounds every weekend for fun.

Magazine: 4 round capacity (so 4+1 with 1 in chamber). 10 round magazines are available, but wait to buy them. The magazine ban craze has increased demand for the 10 rounders and made them cost a ridiculous amount right now (which is dumb, since even if the bill passes, 10 rounders are still legal, why hoard them?). But once it settles down 10 round magazines are very available from multiple companies. It comes with the standard 4 round magazine which holds the action open after the last round and has a button on the magazine to allow it to shut the action if you don't want it held open. Helpful because after the last magazine round it's held open, then you can put a round in by hand, then hit the button on the magazine to close the action. So even after expending the magazine you can operate it one shot at a time without taking the mag out and reloading it. It's a nifty feature that I love. Do not store loaded for long periods. The spring is gonna last pretty much forever on this thing, but if left for months loaded the strong spring can slightly change the angles of the lips just enough to change reliability. This magazine was never stored improperly and has never ever failed to feed, it is a great magazine.

Cleaning: I clean and lube religiously with Gunzilla cleaner/lube. I also use a boresnake so that I don't do any rod damage to the muzzle area. You'll find this thing extremely clean and lubed, to the point where you'll have a hard time believing it's ~60 years old!

Scope Mounts: These rifles have no scope rail, they have scope mounts that screw into the top (and therefore stay zeroed better in my opinion). This rifle comes with a set of scope mounts (worth about $20, included for free). They are the see-through mounts: you can still use the iron sights even with the scope mounted.

Current Worth: In the current market I've seen these for sale on 3 occasions. Twice at gun shows, and once privately online like I'm selling. The gun show prices were $425 and $450 (the latter including a second magazine) and the online seller's price was $450. None of these included the scope mounts that I am including for free (cost me $20) and I am selling for the lower $425 price. Therefore I have to be pretty firm on that price, since it's very very fair already! I'm not in the gun selling busines or trying to make profit, I'm just trying to get fair value for a gun I don't get as much use out of as I should, so I'm not going for the high end of the going prices at all. You can make another offer if you'd like, but in all likelyhood unless it's the full $425 I likely won't take.

What's included?

This does NOT include the accessories in the picture (except the scope mounts, it does include those). But I can include some of them as follows:
- Recoil Pad/Reducer (brand new): $20 extra
- Stock cover with loops for extra rounds (brand new): $15 extra
- Sling + Sling mounts (about 1 month old, as if new): $25 extra
- Scope: not for sale, not included (family heirloom)
- Scope Mounts: Free/included (as if new condition)
- I CANNOT include any ammo in the deal since I hand load and therefore it would be illegal for me to sell the ammo I own, sorry.

Trades: I am interested in trades. 30.06 only since that's what I load! Like I said, I'm selling because I love to target shoot, and this is more of a deer rifle. If you have a cheaper bolt action 30.06 with a long barrel life then I'm willing to look up the normal going rate and take that amount out of the $425 asking price as a trade. Not looking for trades where I'd have to add money to the transaction though.

How to make the transaction?

I live in West Branch, MI. The fastest and best way would be to meet me there and do the transaction for cash in a safe public place. It's on I-75, so chances are if you drive much you probably drive by it and we can make the transaction then.

I can ship from my FFL to your FFL if you want to ship instead of meet, but you'd be responsible for paying the 2 FFLs/shipping and paying up front before shipping (you can use escrow if you pay the escrow fees). I'd assume that's not the most desirable way because of the extra cost for you though...but it's an option if you want it.

I also end up in the Flint/Lapeer area and the Ferndale (metro Detroit) area at least once every few weeks, so can do the transaction at either of those two places if you're willing to wait a week or two. I may need a deposit to be sure you're serious about buying before I'm willing to say it's no longer for sale though. Of course, there's more logistics/time involved if we go that route, but we can work it out on an individual basis if that's what works best for both of us."

Those who are familiar with M4 rifles know that Daniel Defense builds one of the premier rifles produced today. Daniel Defense supplies M4's to the U.S. Military and they are a favorite among U.S. Special Forces. While everyone advertises that they build to MIL-SPEC, Daniel builds their weapons to what they term MIL-SPEC Plus.

The truth about Mil-Specs -

Mil-Specs are a convenience for the federal government when sending out bid solicitations. The do not denote a higher quality, merely the minimum acceptable level of quality and/or performance. There are Mil-Specs on nearly everything the government buys - from powdered eggs, ice cream, and chocolate to aircraft parts.

Mil-Specs are just a convenient way for the federal government to purchase things that are guaranteed to meet the minimum acceptable quality or performance level - they're a way to specify something without the need to write a complete specification every time because the Mil-Spec is the specification. 

So, when buying a weapon you intend to use for defense, I hope you'll remember that Mil-Spec is just another way for the government to spend less of your tax dollars for the minimally acceptable product - not necessarily the best product."

This is a NIB Windham Weaponry AR-15 SRC model: R16M4FTT. It comes with the factory hard case, one 30rd factory mag, sling, owner's manual, and 2013 catalog. I just received this yesterday and paid the current market price for one of these fine guns, so I'm not ""gouging"" any more than I have been gouged. If you don't know Windham, do some research. They are one of the best AR type rifles you can buy. Certainly much better than DPMS, Del-Ton, Spikes, and Bushmaster. They have a lifetime factory warranty that goes with the rifle, not the owner. In other words you could be the 10th owner and you still have a lifetime warranty from Windham, same as if you bought it new. This one is the flat top optics ready model with no front sight post to get in the way of your optics. After watching his majesty, lord-god Obama's speech the other night, I'm now really worried. Add to that the crap going on in our own State of Colorado and I'm pretty well convinced that you will not be able to buy an AR for much longer.

The price is $1,550 firm. Which is about what it cost me after all shipping, credit card, and FFL fees. A limited number of extra mags are available: Windham factory mags or P-mags for $45 each. I will also sell some ammo with it, if needed. The good stuff, not that Russian steel case crap. Don't shoot that filthy ammo in an AR. It's ok to use in AKs though."

Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 16” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.  Features a walnut thumbhole buttstock and foregrip. Can be modded to accept ""surplus"" AK magazines. Requires modification of the magazine latch and the installation of a bullet guide. Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. One 10-round magazine, a cleaning rod, and a cleaning kit."

From what I can find out about this gun is it probably started its life out as a .357 Magnum Highway Patrolman, then during the Dirty Harry days, it was converted to a .44 Magnum, new barrel, cylinder then nickel plated.
 This was apparently a fairly common conversion but don’t see a lot of them for sale, so for that they are somewhat uncommon but very cool.
This gun has a little bit of the nickel either worn off of the cylinder or came off some other method. (see pic)
Comes with a Pachmayr grip and a Blackhawk holster, A face to face sale or trade I will include the ammo I have for it, only about 40 rounds, but still with the price and availability of ammo right now, it’s something.
I took it on trade for a vehicle I was selling and am more of an auto guy, so I have decided to sell it or trade it for something like that.
If is a very fun to shoot hand cannon with devastating results at the receiving end.

I can send more pictures if you would like.

I can also take payment with a credit card if that helps."

It is in new condition from all appearances with wood and metal finishes at 100%.  There are no scuffs or scratches at all. This is a very nice rifle/scope combination.  So far .22 Magnum ammo is available at normal costs, so at least you can buy it and take it out to shoot if you wish.

My rifle features a heavy barrel, wood laminate stock, sling swivels and one magazine. I think I might have a second magazine and I'm looking for it, but no promises.

I've added a new Bushnell 6 X 18 X 50 scope that features adjustable eye piece focus, and a fully adjustable objective lens. I might have the box for the scope, checking.  Scope base is Remington and the rings are quality units.

Unfortunately I've never fired it, not even to test it and of course it is not sighted in.

Chambered in .22 Magnum.  No box, no extras, and no papers, however the owners manual is easily downloaded from the Remington website - I just checked this a few minutes ago.

Terms and conditions:  Face to face preferred with a buyer of appropriate age, not otherwise restricted from purchasing a rifle.  $650 cash, not interested in any trades.  I travel frequently between Eugene and Portland for work so other arrangements are possible.  I will ship to FFL if you prefer for additional cost.  I do not take PayPal.  I'm a private owner, so no credit cards etc."

I have for sale or trade a Mossberg 715t AR22. It has one 10rd mag (you can get 25rd mags for it), an ATI 6 position tactical stock, a full length quad rail, and the carry handle with a Tapco brand rail mounted on it for a scope/red dot. The gun has only had 70rds through it! (not even broke in yet) it has been kept clean and oiled and stored in a case with oxygen absorbing desiccant packs. This is a great shooting gun that is accurate and has had no failure to feed/fire/eject. I don't have to sell it (kinda don't want to) but l want something different now. I can throw in 300rds, a paracord sling and a tactical case for the right trade. 
$400 cash firm or $450 trade value. I have seen these for $450-650 so $400 seems reasonable especially since these are increasing in value due to the proposed assault rifle ban. 
No lowballers. And if you're not serious then don't waste my time.

The MAG Tactical Systems GEN 4 receiver is the newest receiver to hit the market. The GEN 4 is approximately 35% lighter than a GEN 1 aluminum receiver and is still a metallic component. No plastic, carbon fiber or polymers. The GEN 4 receiver is made of a proprietary Tactical Alloy. MAG Tactical Systems owns the patent on the coating process for this material which gives it the excellent corrosion characteristics.
The GEN 4 receiver has the integrated trigger guard that will be able to be used with cold weather gear.
The GEN 4 receiver has reinforced trigger & hammer axle pin placement points.
The GEN 4 front pivot pins are reinforced to eliminate any fracturing during torque when receiver is in the break down position.
 The overall design of the GEN 4 receiver has been stream lined for the Modern War Fighter!

Built to the same tough military specifications and embodying the solid reliability that the U.S. Marines rely upon, the MR1 has no equal among home defense weapons. It features a stainless steel, self-cleaning piston that operates directly against the proven rotating bolt, thereby eliminating the need for complex linkages found on other, inferior gas systems. This piston-driven system, perfected by Benelli, incorporates a gas port located just forward of the chamber, where the gases are hotter and cleaner, resulting in less fouling and more reliable cycling. The result—a Benelli carbine with features rivaling all other home defense rifles, including Marine—tough reliability and the ability to function in the harshest environmental conditions. Also, included is both a 30 and 5 round Magazine and a 3-9 Leupold Mark AR fine duplex scope with weaver mounts. This rife has been taken care of and has had <100 rounds shot through it.

The UTS-15 tactical shotgun is a 12 ga. pump action shotgun with two 7-round alternately feeding or selectable magazine tubes, that measuring 28.3” in overall length with a 20,5” barrel chambers for 2 3/4” and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation (sights and choke tube pictured not included).
