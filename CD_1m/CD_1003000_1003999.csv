The Interceptor body armor system consists of an Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and two Small Arms Protective Inserts (SAPI). The OTV is lined with finely woven Kevlar aramid, these two parts of the vest are both bullet and heat resistant. The vest was tested to stop a 9 mm 124 GR full metal jacket bullet (FMJ) at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the armor panel. These plates also come in five different sizes and go into the front and back of the vest."

These are BRAND NEW to the market. They are loaded loaded by Fiocchi using Fiocchi brass (and I would assume other components as well) and are branded for Tula (box is marked ""Made in Italy""). Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 14 boxes available (700 rounds total). Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush. I would be willing to negotiate if you take everything I have.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 2 box minimum on orders I have to ship.

If you do some research online, you will see how high the quality of the SLG95 HK91 is. Many say their quality is even above the original HK91, and I agree. IGF is the top name in HK rifle builds, and this one shows why. This rifle was assembled in 2001 at IGF, and has been shot under 100 times since. It has never had a claw mount installed, so there are no marks on the receiver. 

In addition to the quality work by IGF, this also has had the trigger setup by the biggest name in HK triggers, Bill Springfield. Bill took a Navy Trigger Group and performed his magic, this has the nicest trigger you will ever feel on an HK91 rifle. The pull is smooth and consistent and it breaks like glass. With this package you have the ability to set the rifle up for any situation, from close quarters to long range. You can change out the stock and handguards in just seconds giving you tons of options. Also with the additional stocks and trigger group it wouldn't take much to assemble another complete rifle. 

What is included:
IGF SLG95 HK91
Collapsible Stock
Black Synthetic Stock and handguard
Wood Stock and Handguard
Bayonet and Sheath
10 - 20 Round HK G3 Magazines (More Available if Needed)

Target Sports Claw Mount
Tapco Muzzle Break
HK Navy trigger group with a Bill Springfield trigger job 
Extra Steel Trigger Group
Sling with HK Style Clip

Please keep in mind this is one of the rifles that will be illegal to purchase if Feinstein gets her way. This is your chance to have a quality rifle that will only continue to increase in value.

with every possible feature that is desirable in a rimfire suppressor. It is 
lightweight, being made with over 95% titanium in its construction, this 
suppressor virtually disappears on the end of your weapon system.  We utilize 
a stainless steel replaceable blast baffle that will allow the suppressor to last 
several lifetimes with virtually no wear on the critical parts.  It has world 
class sound reduction on BOTH a pistol AND a rifle.  It has reduced blow back 
due to the high efficient baffle design that redirects high velocity gasses into 
the suppressor and not back into the gun. It comes apart for cleaning with 
minimal effort.  The tube is not threaded, but rather the endcap threads 
directly into the core,  nor is the tube exposed to the blast energy at the 
muzzle. It has a tapered bore to allow for slight variations in alignment."

389,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1003389,For Sale:  Silencerco Osprey .45,"South, Louisville, Kentucky",$ 800,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 5, 2013",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"With the modern combat handgun in mind, Silencerco set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. Silencerco went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP.

Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun.
The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length."

Gun shoots very well.   Some holster wear at barrel end of slide.   Action/trigger solid and wonderful!   AntiStress trigger -  the factory: The decisive innovation: When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon loading, the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot; not only in the double action trigger mode, but also in the single action mode. The trigger travel is .551"" long in the anti-stress mode (at 4.4 lbs. trigger force), preventing inadvertent firing. On all subsequent shots, the trigger travel is reduced to .314"" (at the same trigger force) and this permits firing in rapid sequence, due to the quick reset of the P99 trigger. Very nice!

I recently purchased this gun from J&G sales out of Prescott. I have literally put three rounds through it to function test, and decided that I don't really need two AK pistols, so I'm selling the newer one. Unfortunately, this AK did ship with the front sight far to the left, the Yugo's do have a handy flip-up dot sight just behind the front sight post which can be used for the mean time, I have not fixed this because I do not own an AK front sight tool. It will come with the 30 round magazine that it shipped with, and the box with the contents it shipped with (manual, cleaning rod, chamber flag).

I can be called or texted at 6O2.8I8.42I4 if I don't answer send me a text. 

After tax (not including FFL transfer fees) It came out to about $895 - due to it being basically brand new, and you will notice this when you see it, I'd like to get no less that $775. You're essentially getting this at $25 below retail cost, with no tax, and no FFL transfer fees saving you more than $100 in the end.

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE is at the forefront with Tapco's 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but Tapco has made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, they made the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, they redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, they made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But they didn't just stop on improving the spring, they also totally revamped the follower.

Tapco has kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won't be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag.

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

The price is very firm and I will only sell face to face to an Ohio resident with proof of ID. Please only contact me if know what this is and you plan to buy. In other words, I really can’t drive around “showing” it to potential buys who just want to see it (that happened a lot when I sold something here a year ago, so sorry). It is exactly as described and factory new. Please do research on the web before asking questions that are better answered by people who know more about ARs than I do. These seem to sell all day long on gunbroker for 1400+ dollars without the rear flip up sight and ammo. I think for the price it is as good a deal as you can find."

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE is at the forefront with Tapco's 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but Tapco has made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, they made the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, they redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, they made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But they didn't just stop on improving the spring, they also totally revamped the follower.

Tapco has kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won't be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag.

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

Among the most unique magazine designs, the 30/45 magazines were designed with an extendable bottom section that would allow the magazine to be fully loaded to 30 rounds and stored (with the base extended) with the spring under minimal pressure. This allowed long-term storage of fully-loaded mags with no wear to the spring or the feed lips. They can also be loaded with 45 rounds when the base extended, though they shouldn't be stored in this configuration.

"" BOB"" advertises that he will pay you TOP DOLLAR for your gun and urges you NOT to go to pawnbrokers or gunstores. ""BOB"" does buy guns on here.....,the catch is you will not get top dollar for your gun, in fact he will offer you less than you can get from a REPUTABLE gun dealer! 

He sells guns on here too. 3 issues; 1st, he gouges people, sells at inflated prices for his own profits. Do your research online. The prices he insists on are way more than your pay buying online and having them shipped to a dealer, way way more than if you found it locally!!!! 

2nd- no FFL licensure. He is buying and selling for profit. This hurts mom snd pop gunstores that we have all relied upon and he is not properly selling these guns by not being an ffl dealer. I dont know about you but Id be leary of big brother watching this guy.

3rd- he false advertises. Right now he is advertising a GLOCK 22 gen 3. Look at the picture of what he is selling. No finger grooves, no rail......hmmm.....looks like a gen 2 to me! And selling it for 575.00 FIRM....a police trade in?! Last gunshow in jan, police trade in GLOCKS were 425.00 for gen 2s...... Inflated.

OBAMAS' GUN BAN IS COMING! This auction is for a DPMS ""Oracle"" model AR-15 .223 Remington/5.56x45mm NATO caliber M4 Carbine-style semiautomatic rifle (DPMS model RFA3-OC) having a six(6) position collapsible buttstock and a 16"" light contour 1"" in 9"" twist chrome-moly barrel in Excellent ""Like New"" condition. It has the A3 style flat-top receiver with picatinny rail and ""Glacier Guard"" forearm. The receiver has a forward-assist button and an ejection port cover. Comes with two(2) DPMS black steel 30-round capacity magazines. DPMS (Defense Procurement Management Systems) manufactures some of the highest quality AR-15 rifles and carbines available, being the equal of Colt, Armalite, S&W, Bushmaster and any other big name manufacturer. DPMS firearms are all built to military specifications (mil spec) and are extremely rugged and reliable. I have fired 200 rounds through this carbine while breaking it in, with no failures to feed or failures to eject. This is a very reliable and accurate carbine! Mounted on this carbine is the Burris ""Fullfield TAC-30"" 1X-4X-30mm variable/adjustable riflescope sighted in at 100 yards. The ""FullField TAC-30"" riflescope is a high quality scope and offers rugged and reliable performance for precision target engagement when it counts. There is an illuminated red ring around the target reticle, which has varying degrees of brightness controlled by a switch located on the left side of the scope. This illuminated red ring works beautifully in low light conditions. The ring is there even with the switch turned off, although it is black instead of red. This black ring works quite well for sighting a target in normal sunlight. There is also a Burris ""FastFire II"" 4 MOA miniRed Dot sight mounted ""piggyback"" above the riflescope sighted in at 30 yards. You can use this ""FastFire II"" miniRed-Dot sight for super-fast target acquisiton with both eyes open in any light. The dot is always in focus and properly aligned for superior accuracy. It is the only waterproof unit in its' class and weighs only 1.6 oz. I took the pictures through the optics (pictures 6 & 7) while holding the carbine in one hand and taking the pictures with the other hand. Not the best way to get good pictures, but it is the best I could do. The bright spot just left of center is actually the red dot in the Red Dot sight. It is really a bright red dot located in the center of the sight, regardless of the poor picture I took. I have shot the ""X"" out of the ""X-ring"" of a target at 30 yards with this sight. The round red circle shows up fairly well in the 1X-4X scope sight. Using this sight at 100 yards, I have shot a sub3"" group. The mounting system is the Burris P.E.P.R. (Proper Eye Position Ready) rail-equipped system with integrated top rails. This mount provides 2"" of forward scope positioning space. You will be ready for any shooting situation in any light with this combination of sights and mounts. Use the Red Dot for up close work and the illuminated 4X scope for longer range work. This is an excellent sighting system for anyone with versatile sighting needs. It is very similar to the ACOG (Advanced Combat Optical Guidance) system used by our military warfighters on M4 carbines and M16 rifles, at a much lower price. A high quality system for nearly any type of shooting you may enjoy, including tactical shooting."

The All-N-One Deer Call also features buttons that show the user where to squeeze the call, (F) for fawn, (D) for doe, (YB) for young buck or just blow without squeezing for a mature buck. The opposite end also has a volume button for volume control. Now you have the flexibility to produce a full range of vocalizations with one deer call. The Flextone All-N-One Deer Call will, with just the squeeze of a button, accurately produce a fawn bleat or distress, a doe bleat or grunt, as well as a young buck or a mature buck grunt. Not only will you appreciate the natural sounds this call makes, but also the sounds it does not make if accidentally coming in contact with your gun or bow."

More on this rare and coveted 9mm: When it was introduced early in the 20th century, the Browning Hi Power 9mm pistol was a revelation. The perfect balance of handling, size and firepower, with an impressive 13-round magazine capacity. Whether you are a novice or a seasoned shooter, you will appreciate the fine craftsmanship and function of these classic pistols, the sure heft of the machined steel frame and slide, and their natural pointability. Even with the double-column magazine, the grip is narrow to neatly accommodate nearly every hand size, and the single-action trigger provides a smooth, consistent pull. As reliable, accurate and easy to shoot as ever. Sure, there are many, many other full-size 9mm pistols on the market that are made to meet many different requirements. But in the end, every true firearm enthusiast should have a Hi Power in their collection. Having and shooting the best just means something.
Sights
Hi Power pistols are available with fixed, low-profile three-dot sights. The Hi Power Standard is available with optional low-profile target sights that are adjustable for windage and elevation.
Safety
A large, ambidextrous manual thumb safety is conveniently located just above the grip.
Magazine Capacity
Double-stack magazine design. 13-round magazine standard in 9mm. Follow state and local laws regarding magazine capacity when ordering.
Trigger
The light single-action trigger breaks clean and crisp. This is the system preferred by professionals around the world.
Frame and Slide
Forged from solid steel, yet still lightweight. The heft of the Hi Power keeps recoil light and manageable for accurate firing, even at a rapid rate. The balance in the hand is impeccable."

This tool is the fastest, easiest way to disconnect the anal alimentary canal from deer or similar-sized game. Immediately after harvesting game, insert the Butt-Out Tool into the anal canal and twist until it grabs the membrane. Continue twisting another half turn, then steadily pull the Butt-Out Tool out of the canal. Extract 10"" of membrane, tie the membrane off and cut. Its time-saving ease of use makes this the tool every deer hunter needs in his/her pack. Works for deer, Antelope, Bear, and Hogs.
