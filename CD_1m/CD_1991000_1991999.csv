I just don't have time to restore it. It has a crack to the fore-end of the stock and would make a great fixer upper, if you have time to glue it up and refinish it. Apart from the stock, the rifle is in great shape, rated as Good. They shoot great and are pretty accurate and are probably the best flavor of SKS around (light compared to the yugo, for example). If you did nothing to the stock, you could simply get a Tapco bayonet fit stock and do this up. It would be about an hour's worth of work at most. You could also just get a replacement wood stock and it would take five minutes to field strip and put it into a new stock. The current stock has some really interested flecking in the wood itself, kinda like quarter sawn oak ray fleck, it has a ribboning effect which is pretty attractive looking. It might be worth doing it up?

They come with one 7 round magazine and one 8 round magazine.  They are perfect for concealed carry, whether carrying on your person, in a purse, or in a vehicle.  The Shield offers a clear audible and palpable trigger reset, unlike the majority of the M&P series.  See below for more specific product details.

Price is $499 plus 5.5% tax.  Must be an Oklahoma resident with valid ID and willing to submit to NICS background check.  

Product Overview: 

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

Detailed Product Overview: 

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

more info The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

Also have the original box for the Nikon scope.  Also including an Allen rifle case that I used with the rifle.  

This rifle was great.  I used it hunting a few times and it shot true every time.  Its lightweight so easy to carry out into the woods and the free floating barrel makes for great accuracy.  I am looking to leave the bigger game hunting field and move into smaller game and varmint hunting- hence why I will be selling the .308.  The rifle itself was $375 new and the scope was $230 new, don't remember how much the scope rings were ,and bipod was $40.  After tax the setup was just over $700.  Pretty awesome rifle for a pretty good price.  

It has about 50-60 rounds down the barrel- when including sighting it in.  

I am looking to get about $500 for it (rifle, scope, bipod, case and original boxes.)  I have the original receipt to prove my expense if need be.

The LDA refers to the 7.45's light double action trigger, a feature that differentiates it from stiff, hard to use double-action-only pistols. The LDA trigger has a long arc of movement with a relatively low level of resistance to pressure from the shooter's finger both through the stroke and, most critically, at the point of release. And the 7.45 still features the thumb safety and grip safety of the original 1911A1, making it easy to secure against unintended discharges, and fast into action from the holster. The incredibly accurate fully ramped, match-type barrel is also crowned and forged, something normally seen only on a custom 1911. The gun is very smoothly finished and its sight has deep lateral serrations.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

The PMAG 20 GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring for commonality, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Designed for professionals in the field, the Lancer L5 magazine has a list of features that is hard to beat. The translucent body is impact resistant even to extreme temperatures from -50F to +180F, which is excellent for storage while loaded in unconditioned vehicles. The translucent body and round count markers at 20 and 30 rounds allow the operator to quickly identify the ammunition status of the magazine. This unique design features corrosion resistant steel feed lips permanently molded to the magazine body. Unlike many other magazines, this design enables the magazine to withstand 5' loaded drops on the feed lips without damage. A rubber coated floor plate, textured body, and drop free design ensure rapid, reliable magazine changes under varying conditions.

The L5C was developed for 3-Gun and tactical rifle competitions where the 48 round capacity eliminates magazine changes during stages. A standard 30-round L5 body is connected to a second, modified body using a precision machined coupler. The coupler (designed and made by Nordic Components) ensures the two pieces are perfectly aligned for reliable feeding. This assembled unit comes complete and ready for action."

I bought the 1911 to use as a concealed carry weapon but quickly realized it was too large and heavy for my smaller frame. I have shot 8 rounds total and it fired flawlessly. I am reluctant to give it up because it is such a nice firearm to have, but I simply cannot afford more than 1 gun at the moment and I am moving to something much smaller to carry with me as an everyday concealed carry.

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly.





The MUR comes in two models: one with Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector (part# MUR-1A) and the second with Shell Deflector only (part# MUR-1S). Vltor offers the selection at the time of purchase, but does not offer a service to exchange the Bolt Assist or Shell Deflector. 

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door.

I shot this gun for about a year in trap leagues.  This BT-99 is very tight and was not shot very much.  Feels like a new one.  Probably under 3000 rounds through it, including the previous owner who had it sitting new in a safe.  For those not very familiar with trap shooting and target shotguns, 3000 rounds is not much.

This BT-99 started as a micro, then had the full sized stock with the comb added later, so the barrel length is 30 inches.

Gun comes with a Muller number 2 choke tube and patterns beautifully.  

Never had a misfire or failure of any kind, the gun works flawlessly, like stated before, it feels and shoots like new.

There are several handling marks on the wood, nothing serious, but this gun is for working on the trap line, not for looking fancy.

I am asking $850, this gun sells brand new for over 1300 without an adjustable comb.

Great shotgun, but I just do not shoot it enough and have too many guns so I hope it goes to a good home and breaks some clays.

During World War I, like many nations Italy faced a shortage of modern infantry rifles. As an stop-gap measure, hundreds of thousands of Vetterli-Vitali rifles and a few carbines and musquetoons were converted in Rome and Gardone to fire the 6.5x52mm Carcano round, by adding a 6.5mm barrel liner and a Carcano-style magazine."
