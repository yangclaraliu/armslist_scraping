Completely assembled by Sig Sauer, this rifle is one of just 250 built from new-in-box Swiss SIG SG 551 rifles that were stuck in customs before WCA and SigSauer rescued them and built these limited edition collector's pieces. Learn more at www.sig551.com.

Do not confuse this Sig Sauer SG551 with the latest release by Sig Sauer, the 551-A1. This rifle is comprised of a Swiss made lower with matching serial numbers on the upper and lower receivers. This is truly a collector's piece that has the capability of being your everyday rifle as well. This fine rifle features an adjustable gas operated piston driven long stroke system that is considered the most reliable system made today; it is very accurate and fires from a closed bolt. The trigger mechanism has an ambidextrous safety and fire selector switch that has four settings: ""S""—safe, ""1""—single fire, ""3""—3 round burst and ""20""—fully automatic fire. Note: this rifle is semi-automatic and has a factory guard installed that prohibits the selector from moving to the burst or full-auto positions. The trigger is enclosed in a pivoting trigger guard which can be folded down to the left or right side allowing for unhindered operation with winter gloves.

LIKE NEW IN BOX: SG 551 semi-automatic 5.56 x 45mm NATO Rifle with a 16-inch barrel and side-folding stock. Overall length is 24-inches with the stock folded and 32.5-inches with the stock extended. Weight: 7.5 pounds. Length of pull: 13.4 inches. Beautiful black Swiss Style furniture. This particular rifle is like new-in-box and has been fired less than 50 rounds to verify function. The finish of this rifle is immaculate. The internal parts of this rifle are flawless.

Auction includes everything you see in the photos, including hard case, three 30 round magazines, trigger lock, Certificate of Authenticity from SigSauer."

Includes everything from the factory new.

The makers of the American made ""Baby Browning"" pistol trade here in the USA under the brand name Precision Small Arms and the pistol is known as the ""PSA-25"". Outside of the USA the pistol carries the Fabrique Nationale name on the slide and sports Browning labeled grips. The ""Baby Browning"" pistol has been in production since the early 1930's and has spawned many imitators throughout the world. It is an exquisite firearm highly prized for its sleek lines, beautiful finish, precision craftsmanship, diminutive size and exceptional close range accuracy. When utilized with modern high-velocity ammunition, the Pistol can achieve the effectiveness of a .380. It should not be under-estimated with regard to lethality.
PSA has been manufacturing this timeless classic since 1984, most recently in the fresh Rocky Mountain air of Aspen, Colorado. In a small workshop, they use state-of-the-art, computer numeric controlled machinery supported by in-process dimensional control inspection technology to assure near perfection of all machined parts. After machining, each Pistol is hand fitted, tested and inspected in an effort to provide a flawless product for a highly discriminating clientele.
The ""Baby Browning"" pistol is a single action, semi-automatic, self-loading, blow-back mechanism manufactured from all steel alloy components (with the exception of the ""Featherweight"" version which utilizes a 7075 forged aluminum receiver). It is striker fired and has a smooth faced, single stage draw bar trigger with pull weight of 5.25 lbs. The Pistol can hold seven rounds: six in its magazine and one chambered.

119,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1166119,For Sale:  M1 Carbine,"Fontana, California, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Friday, March 1, 2013",Handguns,Remington,no type,no type,no type,"I have my dads 45, 38, and M1 carbine. I have his discharge papers showing the 45 and 38 checked out to him. The 45 and M1 carbine come with extra stuff. The 38 is a S&W made for the government in October of 1943. I am selling all three for $2000, no trades.
The 45 is a Remington Rand. According to the serial no 1016319 and what I have been told it is a sand cast model. All the items that are in the picture with it were brought home at the same time except for the pair of grips on it,camo holster and the extended clip. The US holster is the one my Dad got with the gun. The rest was all my Dads personal gear issue to him. The three clips are the original clips that came with the gun.
The S&W 38 serial no is V424979 and according to that it was shipped in October of 1943. Guns without a top strap marking usually shipped per contracts with the Defense Supplies Corporation or the U.S. Maritime Commission. This would make sense as my Dad picked up the Mine Sweeper from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Washington around Christmas 1943. I know this because he shipped out on the Mine Sweeper right after he married my Mom in Puget Sound. He only had a week before he shipped out.
The M1 Carbine was issue to him at the same time. It is an Inland Division of General Motors serial no 46458. The receiver was made somewhere between October, 1941 - April, 1942. The barrel is marked 5-43. The carbine was usually assembled and tested within two or three months after the barrel date. This is a very early one and is quite rare in this shape.
Do your homework on these guns. You will see that I am selling them below market value. Just the carbine alone is worth around $2000 in the condition it’s in. Go here to check: http://www.scott-duff.com click on M1 Carbine at the bottom of the page or anyone of the many internet listings."

I am constantly looking for good deals on large quantities of new .45 ammo to resell at a reasonable fixed price, regardless of the brand of ammo. My intent is to hold the line at or below $30 per 50 round box during this weird shortage for as long as possible. Yes, I make a couple of dollars per box, I make no apologies for that, but a small profit enables me to locate other supplies and quickly purchase good ammo for resale.

I have no purchase limits, if it's in stock and you have the cash, I will sell as much ammo as you want. It might be a good idea to email or text message me first if more than 20 boxes at a time is wanted.

At this time I do not stock any other calibers other than .45 (sorry, no 9mm or .22), I have enough problems finding .45 to keep supplied. Thanks to all of you who have bought my ammunition recently."

I'm not a dealer just a guy with an expensive hobby. I look for mostly black guns but if you have a nice hunting rifle / shotgun I might be interested. Anything I buy, trade or sell goes through an FFL dealer only and I only accept cash FTF or certified funds before I ship anything.

I'm only looking for quality firearms or brass ammo. Please don't try to sell me a bushmaster or s&w. Here's a list of rifle manufacturers that I am interested in: Armalite, Rock River, Colt, Knight / Stoner, HK, FN, Sig Sauer, Browning, or most custom shop rifles. Here's a list of handgun manufacturers: HK, Kimber, Sig Sauer, FN, Wilson Combat, Kahr, Para Ordnance, or most custom shop pieces.

If you have something you want to sell just shoot me an email and we can talk. I'll consider certain trades. Please include pic and price in the email. Also, please don't waste either of our time asking $900 for a used Glock that I can buy at the local shop for $550. I know what these weapons cost and I know what they're worth used so let's be reasonable. Email me at REDACTED, all emails are answered same day."

There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

 You can bring your own pistol for the shooting portion along with 50 rounds of ammunition. I recommend using a .22 however any caliber is accepted. If you don't have a pistol yet or would just like to borrow mine I have a .22 Ruger.

The Px4 is built around a modular concept so these pistols can be adapted

the rifling. The light frame employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced
polymer with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail and a modular grip system for a
custom fit. The manual lever safety and slide stop lever are both
ambidextrous while the magazine release button is reversible. The Bruniton
non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion
and wear.

It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox™ comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function.

custom fit. The manual lever safety and slide stop lever are both
ambidextrous while the magazine release button is reversible. The Bruniton
non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

I have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view. Using this mount I have developed a variable power scope kit for the Ruger 10/22 semi-auto rifle which offers a great value for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This mini-scope package is also an ideal application for your Ruger 10/22 Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

I have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view. Using this mount I have developed a variable power scope kit for the Ruger 10/22 semi-auto rifle which offers a great value for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This mini-scope package is also an ideal application for your Ruger 10/22 Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled.

Specs- 
EOTech's most popular holographic weapons sight, the Model 512 is perfect for people who want the best in close-quarters-combat speed and versatility but don't need night vision. The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip.

The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS – which stands for 1911 Compact SAS – comes from the SIG SAUER® Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability"

Here's the way this will work. I already have two standing offers of $300 (this $ amount will change as higher offers come in) for this can. This can will stay on arms list until Sunday afternoon or until someone buys it now for $420 whichever comes first. You can make cash offers or handgun offers or a combo. If you have a handgun values at more than what the ammo is worth to you I will throw cash in if I want your gun. I hope this is fun for all and no one gets mad for a unique approach to selling this extremely rare and highly sought for ammo :)

I will provide proof at any time that the offer that I post is legit if you request. No moogy foogy here!

I can probably take a cc on my new square if that's important to you (add 3% to cash discounted price)

Finally... If there are enough people that want less than 420 rounds at $1 a piece I will consider splitting the box.

The two-piece modular construction of the 30 round magazine allows for maximum strength and integrity to be achieved while simultaneously allowing the magazine to drop free as well as solve feeding issues. The straight upper piece of the magazine allows the magazine to drop free while also presenting ammunition to the chamber in perfect form. The curved lower portion of the magazine allows the remaining rounds to stack naturally which breeds precise feeding. The functionality of the magazine is only half of the battle, this magazine is constructed from the latest aerospace polymers which are impervious to the detrimental effects of solvents and lubricants. The waffle style molding on the exterior of the magazine helps ensure a positive grip.

This is a Law Enforcement version of the carbine. It was a limited run honoring the first responders. You CANNOT get these from Rock River anymore. And even if you were able to, you would have to be in LE and there is a current wait time of 2 years.

Its BRAND NEW. The only rounds fired are to test if it works which are done by all manufacturers. I have the receipt from the original purchase to show you that I am not price gauging. 

I just want to unload this quickly because something else has caught my eye. So ideally FTF cash and be done with it. And please only contact if you are serious. 

The quality and reliability of Rock River Arms firearms continues to win new admirers. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) put a variety of different manufacturers rifles through an exhaustive trials process, and based on those trials awarded Rock River Arms with a 5 year contract as their primary supplier. Since that time Rock River Arms has received additional federal contracts.

Rock River Arms is one of the fastest growing firearms manufacturers in the country, but remains committed to continuing to provide it`s civilian, law enforcement and military customers with the kind of custom products and services on which it`s reputation has been built.

About:
""Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize in standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 URG is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.""

As you know this is the premier 1911 to have. I wish I could keep it but another firearm I've been looking for just became available to me. Therefore the wife says I can't have both. This is the latest version of the Colt Gold Cup series model 05070X. From Colts site: The Colt Gold Cup is known as the finest shooting semi-automatic in the world, and is the standard for competitive guns. The first Colt Gold Cup pistol was introduced in the late 1950’s to give competitive shooters a gun to take directly from the dealer’s showcase to the firing line. Colt Gold Cup pistols have been used to compete in local club matches through the National Matches at Camp Perry. It features an Adjustable Wide Trigger, National Match® Barrel, Adjustable Target Sights, and many other refinements as standard. It is your responsibility to know if you are legally allowed to own this gun in your state. I will ship fedex 2nd day air for a flat rate fee of $40. I will only ship after payment has cleared and I have verified the FFL you will use for the transfer. I accept money order. Magazines are a 7rd and an 8rd. It is stainless steel.Thank You."
