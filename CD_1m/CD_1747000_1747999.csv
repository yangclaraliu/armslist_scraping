Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

The PMAG 20 GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring for commonality, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

44,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1747044,For Sale:  Custom Stippling,"New Bern/Jacksonville, Jacksonville, North Carolina",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 11, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Stippling is the creation of a pattern simulating varying degrees of solidity or shading by using small dots. Such a pattern may occur in nature and these effects are frequently emulated by artists. Stippling is typically performed by using a soldering iron and a lot of patience. It requires a steady hand and TIME.  As the soldering iron burns a dot or other pattern into the polymer, it leaves behind a raised surface that enhances the texture and aids in your ability to “grip” the stippled product.


I specialize in custom work on any polymer or plastic components available. The majority of work I have done has been on Glock's, M&P's, Polymer magazines, and pistol grips. I will customize your pistol or component any way you choose. I can take your requests and perform the work to your specifications, or I can come up with a custom look on my own if you prefer. I have many different types of soldering tips available, which enables me to put different designs into the component. 

You may ship your items to my home address, or we can meet FTF. I will be happy to provide referrals if needed. If you see a design or texture on the internet, please send the link to me and I will stipple that pattern to your component. If you are wanting a firearm stippled, I prefer you dis-assemble  and send only the part receiving the stippling. Example: Remove the slide/barrel from your pistol and send only the frame. It is not necessary to dis-assemble the firearm completely, unless you prefer to. 

I ship with the method you prefer, but I always use tracking info, and insurance is considered.

I am a 31 year old Actice Duty Marine stationed on Cherry Point NC. I am experienced with this type of work. I have been stippling for several years now and do excellent work. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I perform this work at my shop with the proper equipment. This is not a kid ruining people's firearms in his mom's basement here. 

Here are general prices. These can vary depending on customer request.
But to give you a general idea. 

AR Pistol grip $15
Complete frame stippling $50
Back strap and front strap $30
Magazines $10

There have been several requests for a full power 44 mag. Load that recoils substantially less than our other Heavy 44 mag. Loads, but will still penetrate deeply and be deadly on game animals.

When S&W introduced their model 329PD, we noticed that some of those scandium revolvers would experience sticky extraction with our Heavy loads and the recoil in the light weight scandium 329PD guns was horrendous, to say the least. This recoil would some times cause bullets to ""jump crimp"" thus tying up the revolver. 

In order to alleviate the recoil, crimp jump and sticky extraction, we have developed this load. It is still full power, but uses a lighter weight, super hard cast, gas checked bullet and will still penetrate very deeply in big game despite its lighter weight. This load is ideal for those of you who carry the S&W model 329PD. This load will not lead your barrel.

This load falls well under SAAMI pressure specs and is safe to use IN ANY 44mag. While we love to hear from our customers, please do not phone/email us and ask if this load is safe in your particular 44 mag. - it is - providing your gun is in normal working condition.

Now there exists a serious full power 44 mag. load that will penetrate big bones (including a bears skull) and drive deeply into living organs and tissues, that has minimum recoil."

A rugged polymer body and follower make the magazine capable of handling prolonged use and almost any environmental condition. The steel magazine feed lips are engineered to withstand thousands of rounds without significant wear, drastically reducing ammunition feeding-related malfunctions and solving a problem that has plagued increased-capacity 10/22 magazines since their inception. The BX-25 magazine's 25-round capacity and excellent functional reliability are certain to make any trip to the range more enjoyable, with greater time spent shooting and less dedicated to clearing malfunctions and reloading.

144,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1747144,For Sale:  Custom stippling work,"new bern, Jacksonville, North Carolina",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 11, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Stippling is the creation of a pattern simulating varying degrees of solidity or shading by using small dots. Such a pattern may occur in nature and these effects are frequently emulated by artists. Stippling is typically performed by using a soldering iron and a lot of patience. It requires a steady hand and TIME.  As the soldering iron burns a dot or other pattern into the polymer, it leaves behind a raised surface that enhances the texture and aids in your ability to “grip” the stippled product.


I specialize in custom work on any polymer or plastic components available. The majority of work I have done has been on Glock's, M&P's, Polymer magazines, and pistol grips. I will customize your pistol or component any way you choose. I can take your requests and perform the work to your specifications, or I can come up with a custom look on my own if you prefer. I have many different types of soldering tips available, which enables me to put different designs into the component. 

You may ship your items to my home address, or we can meet FTF. I will be happy to provide referrals if needed. If you see a design or texture on the internet, please send the link to me and I will stipple that pattern to your component. If you are wanting a firearm stippled, I prefer you dis-assemble  and send only the part receiving the stippling. Example: Remove the slide/barrel from your pistol and send only the frame. It is not necessary to dis-assemble the firearm completely, unless you prefer to. 

I ship with the method you prefer, but I always use tracking info, and insurance is considered.

I am a 31 year old Actice Duty Marine stationed on Cherry Point NC. I am experienced with this type of work. I have been stippling for several years now and do excellent work. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I perform this work at my shop with the proper equipment. This is not a kid ruining people's firearms in his mom's basement here."

Such a pattern may occur in nature and these effects are frequently emulated by artists. Stippling is typically performed by using a soldering iron and a lot of patience. It requires a steady hand and TIME. As the soldering iron burns a dot or other pattern into the polymer, it leaves behind a raised surface that enhances the texture and aids in your ability to “grip” the stippled product.


I specialize in custom work on any polymer or plastic components available. The majority of work I have done has been on Glock's, M&P's, Polymer magazines, and pistol grips. I will customize your pistol or component any way you choose. I can take your requests and perform the work to your specifications, or I can come up with a custom look on my own if you prefer. I have many different types of soldering tips available, which enables me to put different designs into the component. 

You may ship your items to my home address, or we can meet FTF. I will be happy to provide referrals if needed. If you see a design or texture on the internet, please send the link to me and I will stipple that pattern to your component. If you are wanting a firearm stippled, I prefer you dis-assemble and send only the part receiving the stippling. Example: Remove the slide/barrel from your pistol and send only the frame. It is not necessary to dis-assemble the firearm completely, unless you prefer to. 

I ship with the method you prefer, but I always use tracking info, and insurance is considered.

I am a 31 year old Actice Duty Marine stationed on Cherry Point NC. I am experienced with this type of work. I have been stippling for several years now and do excellent work. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I perform this work at my shop with the proper equipment. This is not a kid ruining people's firearms in his mom's basement here."

You can run across these occasionally on Craigslist but not often and almost never with the bench. These are so well made that when people get them...they keep them.

I have a like new (75 rds) Benelli Super Black Eagle 2 with Comfort Tech stock.

This is the most versatile shotgun out there. Great for turkey, goose, ducks, dove, and pheasant. Also amazing for trap and sporting clays 

These sell new for $1749 plus the 4.7% sales tax. 

Look at the link above for info on the amazing shotgun. 

The Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility, and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. Utilizing the proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"", and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments. The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech system which reduces recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less on average; that's more than a pound less! The ComforTech system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest-shooting, most reliable shotgun ever.

Beretta
Nano 9MM

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

The Nano's extremely low profile, snag-free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The light, durable frame employs thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass-reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano's sights are user-adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine release button can be easily reversed. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The USA.

The 5.56 Mid Length Evo Ultra Lite 16"" Rifle is a .625"" lite profiled rifle that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution 12"" extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome.

The PPQ comes with interchangeable sculpted-grip backstraps for a custom fit that meshes smoothly into the hand. For greater control and handling, there are front and rear slide serrations and extended ambidextrous slide stop. This German-engineered pistol is perfect for the right- or left-handed shooter and features three automatic safeties, three-dot sight with adjustable rear sight, Picatinny-style equipment rail, loaded chamber indicator and tough polymer frame. Comes with two magazines and a thumb loader.

This is the original tritium dot sight for tactical ops and although it is older, it is still a good effective design and allows a clear view to use your iron sights if necessary. It was designed for the shooter to keep both eyes open day or night. I have used this sight for many years and found it to be a great quick acquisition sight in a smaller pachage than an Aimpoint or ACOG, but now that I have switched over to a flattop AR, I can not use this anymore. The tritium lamp has gone dim, but Trijicon handles their replacements for less than $50 bucks the last time I checked and the new Armson Company will offer the lamps also. This model will not fit on a flattop AR, so I no longer have a need for it. Pardon the quality of the pics, but you can see what we are talking about now. The Carbine is not included.

The GLARE® MOUT is a non-lethal visual disruption laser (dazzler, ocular interruption device [OID]) ideally suited for small-arms weapon integration as well as mobile crew-served applications. When a suspect individual approaches a restricted or controlled area, the GLARE MOUT is able to hail and warn that person before shots have to be fired. Its shockingly bright green dazzler beam sends an irrefutable, multi-lingual, cross-cultural message that ""you mean business"". Reports confirm that the GLARE MOUT has saved numerous lives of both soldiers and non-combatants in Iraq and Afghanistan. A hand-held kit is also available for non-weapons-mounted deployment. 

The GLARE MOUT is compact and lightweight and is already approved for use by all branches of the U.S. Armed Services.

Tactical Tailor: Close Quarter Battle: CQB Sling: Tan / Coyote Brown 

P/N: 61019-14

RATED #1 BY TACTICAL RESPONSE MAGAZINE! 

Our CQB Sling is an ambidextrous single point sling similar to our Urban Ops Sling but with the added benefit of heavy duty elastic cord added to each side of the weapon attachment point. The elastic creates tension that keeps the weapon secured close to the body when released with little or no slack in the sling to get caught up on equipment when you need to shoulder the weapon. Designed to be used with weapons equiped with sling mounts behind the receiver and will fit most factory or aftermarket loop style attachment points. 

Features heavy duty nylon webbing, steel powder coated 'HK' style hook and a Fastex buckle to allow the weapon to be dropped without removing the sling. 

Available in Coyote Brown

This home defense shotgun is built for heavier loads so the lighter bird shot most likely wont cycle in it from what ive read online. The gun is in like new condition and comes in its original box with everything that it originally came with. Any questions, feel free to ask...

Larue PredatAR 5.56 Overview 

The PredatAR 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle. 

The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached 

The handguards on the PredatAR extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section. 

XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls. Facilitates reliable extraction through a wide range of temperature / chamber pressure extremes. XTRAXN™ extends extractor life, while having no effect on the firearm's accuracy. All this, and it dovetails well with the OBR's world-famous accuracy. 

Caliber: 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Rifle Weight: 6.25 lb. (based on 16.1” barrel version, unloaded without optics) Barrel Length: 16.1“ Barrel Material: Stainless Steel, Blackened. Rifling Twist Rate: 1/8 Muzzle Thread Configuration: ½ x 28 * Barrel Life: 10,000 (approx) Gas Semi automatic Magazine Capacity: 30 rounds

This is a very good rifle.  I had the scope on a different rifle temporarily, which is why it is camo. This rifle has had mixed reviews, and has gotten criticism for being a ""budget rifle"".  Well, I'll tell you what!  I can hit 1"" groups @ 100 yards with it.  I even used a different (older 4X) scope and got the same results out to 200 yards, so whatever.  So, even if you want to comapre it to the 710 (takes the same magazine), go ahead both are still quality Remington firearms.  Anyway, I got an awesome Savage 110 in 30-06, and I don't have a need for this  rifle anymore. It's funny how people always dog things they have never tried, even though they knbow they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with snow shovel. Anyway $300 is the price.

If you would like for me to give the rifle the same paint job as the scope it will be $350"
