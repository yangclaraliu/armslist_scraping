The one I am selling is new and still sealed in the factory plastic, the bag in the pics is the one I am using. This listing is for the case only, the firearms seen in the pictures are not for sale or trade. Email me or text 210-Four-Zero-Nine-2389 with offers. I will consider any reasonable trade."

Made for Rifle hunter's, The Sniper doesn't need replacement bulbs because they will last 100,000 hours of use and if one ever happens to go out.
Unlike other Companies that will make false claims about how far you can see with their lights, We will guarantee that with a average scope, you will be able to see the animal you are after at the max yardages we give. No, we don't mean that you can light up just their eye's but you can actually see the animals body in your scope. Our Guarantee is that if you are not happy with our Sniper light we will refund your money as long as you return the light in new condition. Here are the specs below.
Sniper with Red or green LED - 150 + yards with a average scope.
Sniper with white LED- 190+ yards with average scope.
If you have a scope that does well in low light these distances will be greatly increased and we have customers that have told us with their scopes that do excellent in low light that they can see animals out to 200 yards with our Sniper.
Hunting in Rain,Snow and high humidity will lower the max yardage you can see with The sniper or any light.
The Sniper is about 7 inches long and weighs about 9 ounces with battery(s).
Runs on one 18650 rechargeable battery or two CR123A batteries.
Run time with one 18650 battery- 2+ Hours at full power and then another 2+ hours with the light slowly dimming over that time.
Run time with 2 CR123A batteries will vary depending on brand but you will get about 1 hour of run time at full power.
Works great in all weather conditions. Hot or very cold temperatures will not effect the light at all but temperatures below 10 degree's will shorten the battery run times a little.
No more carrying those big bulky spotlights with heavy battery packs No more trying to use lights that wont reach the distance."

I bought this rifle because I didn’t think I would ever be able to afford my dream rifle.  The day I bought it, I got a good deal on a used GAP-10 (My dream rifle).  I no longer need this rifle.  The first thing I noticed when I first handled this rifle was how smooth the action is.  It’s among the smoothest I’ve ever felt.  FN made it right.  I fired one box of 168gr Sierra Match King through it on 2-15-13 and its been sitting in the case ever since.  It cycled great and this is a surprisingly accurate rifle.  It hovered around ½”MOA.  I was very pleased with the accuracy but I think I could have done better if I had taken the time to get used to the rifle.  
This FNAR comes with everything that it came with from the factory.  Hard case, 3 comb pads with different comb heights, 3 recoil  pads with different length of pull, 20 round mag, 6 shims, lock and manual are all included.  It has been in the cushioned hard case the whole time I’ve had it with the exception of taking it to the range the one time.  I paid $1800 for it at Gander Mountain so I’m taking a loss.  I just can’t afford to keep both rifles.
This FNAR has a 20” fluted, chrome lined barrel.  It is stamped 7.62x51 but it says in the manual that it is safe to fire .308 through it.  I called FN to confirm this and the lady confirmed it.  So, It is safe to fire .308 through it."

This gun is a ONE OF A KIND piece because no where else on the market will you find a chrome tommy gun for sale that is fully functioning and in brand new condition. I have worked with my partners to do this project before and it came out great (the pictures/videos you see are from the 1st one we did). The entire gun from every screw to everyyy visible part is done in chrome which has that beautiful mirror finish. This gun is GUARANTEED to turn heads and will be the most beautiful gun in any room. Please remember that is a ONE OF KIND and you will not find this rifle at any gun show. The way it would work is that I would need a partial deposit of $500, I would then begin the process and in about 4-6 weeks when it is done I will send pictures and ask for the remaining balance, upon which I will expedite ship the gun to your FFL. This purchase includes the entire chrome rifle along with 1 chrome stick magazine. Other accessories I have include the chrome 50 round DRUM magazine for an additional $500 as well as a beautiful display stand that keeps the rifle standing upwards for $100. Please take a look at the pictures but remember that the Chrome Drum magazine and Display Stand are added costs (will still take the same amount of time to create). I accept chase quick pay, check (preferably certified), and money order. 

Please email or call me with any questions (small or big). This gun is unique and I do not mind answering any questions. REDACTED

The increased length of the EMOD is a major benefit when used on scoped rifles (SPR/DMR), as it increases the available comb for any given length of pull. 

The buttplate of the EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready feel much more natural. The EMOD was given enough weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated with negative pitch buttstocks.

The toe of the buttplate is rolled under; giving the EMOD a superior feel when the weapon is held in the ""out of pocket"" heads up hold. The buttplate is covered with a removable rubber buttpad that is molded over a metal strike plate. The shape of the buttplate and the rubber buttpad give a solid stock purchase in all situations. 
The EMOD features more storage in the removable, waterproof side compartments; the EMOD holds up to four CR123 or three AA batteries. There is also an additional weather proof compartment in the clubfoot area of the stock, this compartment can be accessed quickly and holds two AA batteries or other small parts. 

Constructed from the finest materials, the EMOD will stand up to the most rugged demands. The EMOD is available for the aftermarket ""Commercial"" size tube. Available color is Black. The EMOD is only available in the Clubfoot model."

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, a Mil-Spec backup iron sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

I bought it from a friend who needed the money, and I don't need the caliber, between my 30-30, and my .375 H&H, I have most things covered.

He bought it new last year, and has shot a total of 20 rounds through it. 17 to zero in the scope he put on, one to take an elk last season, and two more last week to make sure it still held zero.
He replaced the factory scope with a great Bushnell 3-9x40 that can produce MOA at 200 yards, and has great groupings at 300.

I am aware that you can find this gun for in between $300-$400 online, but after taxes, shipping, FFL, and the new background check, that will come out to $450+.
It's stocked at local gunshops for $430 or so, depending on store. Which comes out to near $480 after taxes, which is what my friend paid.
The aftermarket scope he put on, he got for $130.
Comes out to $610.

PR2020M OPTIMA V2 .50 Cal Blued/Black - DEAD-ON Mount
Additional Information:
While the new OPTIMA V2 shares the name of its popular predecessor, the “Version 2” gun has a completely different design in many ways. Modeled after CVA’s top-of-the-line ACCURA V2, the OPTIMA V2 features the same trigger-guard actuated breeching lever, internal parts, and “neutral center-of-gravity” trigger. Add in CVA’s Quick Release Breech Plug (which is finger removable without any tool what-so-ever), 100% ambidextrous stock, and CrushZone recoil pad, and you’ve got a gun with more quality features than any other muzzleloading rifle in its price range. Equipped with a 26” 416 grade stainless steel barrel, the OPTIMA V2 is easy to maneuver in the tree stand and comfortable to carry in the mountains. And it comes standard with a DuraSight®DEAD-ON™ one-piece scope mount and CVA’s solid aluminum PalmSaver Ramrod.
