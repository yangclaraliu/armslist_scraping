I have had this gun for 10 plus years and never shot it.  I just did a further inspection of it and noticed a slight bulge down at the end of the barrel.  It is barely noticeable except by running your hand over it.  I know this is common and often is not noticable when shooting.  Any potential purchasers are free to shoot it prior to buying it and I will even pattern it if you wish.  I lowered the price due to the new found issue.   This is still a nice example of a classic shotgun.  Most users would not even notice the bulge.

These guns are now approved for WILD BUNCH cowboy action shooting.  This will make a great candidate."

This is an M4A1 Patrolman's Carbine, and is the most popular civilian model AR.   This is quality forged Aircraft Aluminum upper and lower.  It is NOT the Carbon Polymer model.

I have added some items to this gun, but have never had the chance to shoot it.  I'm looking at a different AR now, so I'd like to sell this one, but don't need to.

EXTRAS

-  I removed the factory foregrip and installed a lightweight UTG Aircraft Aluminum Alloy quad-rail.  It includes rubberized rail covers, and is ready for mounting rail accessories such as laser sights, led flashlights, etc.  The original grips are included as well.

- I am including a Magpul PMAG molded 30-round Magazine with dustcover.  These are far-and-away the most sought after mags for AR's, and can't be found in retail locations or online because of the high demand and lengthy backorders.  You can get them in private sales, but will pay $40-$60 ea.  The factory 30 round magazine is included as well.

-I am including two (2) boxes (40 rounds) of new Remington .223 UMC 55 gr brass ammunition to get you started.  AR ammo has gotten almost impossible to find in stores and online, and will likely cost you $1.00 per round or more.  

DESCRIPTION

The Bushmaster M4A1 Type Carbine combines light weight with plenty of .223/5.56mm caliber firepower. The chrome lined barrel offers maximum longevity and accuracy.  A telescoping buttstock brings light weight, ease of carrying and quick handling. Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation. They incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, last round bolt hold-open and raised ridges for magazine release button protection. A mil. spec. Manganese phosphate outer coating insures complete protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all other critical steel parts of the weapon. This carbine includes a permanently installed Phantom Flash Suppressor for a civilian legal 16” barrel. It is shipped in a Bushmaster hard plastic, lockable storage case complete with Black Web Sling, 30 Round Magazine, Operating and Safety Instruction Manual.

  This is a sporterized version of the military Lee Enfield of WWII fame in .303 British.  It has a 6 X 32 gas filled scope mounted to the receiver.  States ""Monoscope"" and Made in Japan.  Very clear and accurate.  The open sights are accurate however they are slightly off of vertical with the receiver.  I have always used the scope but many who have shot it prefer the open sights still.  Bottom line, this is a great shooter!!! And that's a no kidder too.  Great Enfield action and nice trigger pull.

I purchased this pistol new 20 years ago, in 1993. It has NEVER malfunctioned and has been totally reliable with a large variety of full metal jacket and hollow point ammunition. The Interarms version of the Walther PPK is highly desirable compared to the current S&W version (which I've owned as well and had nothing but problems with). These Interarms versions are going for a premium on Gunbroker right now, but I'd prefer a local sale if possible. I have quality holsters and ammo to sweeten the deal as well (and you know how hard it is to find ammo right now). With my entire package, you'll be completely set up and ready to go. The pistol is freshly cleaned, lubed, and ready for use. I have additional, more highly detailed photos of the pistol that I can email to you if needed. Here is everything I'm offering:

- Walther/Interarms PPK .380acp in original box with paperwork and factory test target
- (4) factory magazines with flat base installed
- (4) finger rest conversions for the magazines
- (1) set of extra factory grips
- A-Zoom snap caps for dry fire practice

MAK 90 w/ati fiberforce stock converted to slide stock. also has original wood furniture $1250

Bulgarian SLR 95 milled AK with Steyer barrel $2200 (very low round count, like new)

FAL .308 (metric pattern) excellent shooter, has the grenade sight and bayonet with it.

Each rifle comes with 2 mags and 100 rnds of ammo, the SKS, will have 100 rnds on stripper clips with it. So you get 4 awesome rifles and 400 rnds of ammo. That's a gun for mom, dad, brother and sis in case of zombie apocolypse or other similar social meltdown.

   Here's the deal, I don't just want to sell one of them, because then I'm just out a rifle and won't have enough money for what I'm trying to get. I need to sell all 4 of them or, even better, trade some or all of them for a Harley in the  $3500-$6000 price range. I'd rather just trade them for the bike and be done with it but I'm not going to turn down cash. I prefer later model bikes, like late 90's and up, but may consider something older if it's nice."

Designated with the “AM” (Anderson Manufacturing) moniker to set them apart from traditional “AR” (Armalite Rifle) models, Anderson Manufacturing rifles offer design and build quality that exceeds that of other firearms manufacturers around the world along with a proprietary metal treatment. Known as RF-85 (reduce friction 85%), the treatment offers significant benefits such as faster cycle rates and cooler operating temperatures. 

This results in significantly less wear on the weapon, thereby increasing its life. In addition, an RF-85 treated weapon does not need any lubricants. As such, the weapon experiences fewer failures due to excess dirt and carbon fouling in the action, thereby increasing its reliability.

The rifles have a lifetime limited warranty

Low serial number Belgium BAR.  This is a BELGIUM not portugal or any other location of manufacuter.  I have had this verified and it is ""stamped"" on the barrel.  
The furniture does have signs of wear due to the age and it was used for hunting.  I have spoken with a local gunsmith and it would take about $100 to get the furniture repaired and back to original looking condition.  This is a middle grade rifle, as in it does not have all the extra scrolling and etching.
This firearm belonged to my grandfather and was handed down to me, and he said he had gone deer hunting with it 5, maybe 6 times and sighted it in every year, he said that there is MAYBE 50 rounds of ammo through the rifle.  
Was originally asking $800, but due to the cost to get back to excellent condition, I have lowered it an additional $100."

STOP PAYING THE HIGH PRICES FOR GUNS AND AMMO!!!! This crazy bill is not going to pass with enough teeth that it is going to really effect those of us in Kansas at all! 



This crazy stuff of buying ammo for triple the value is crazy and you are going to make the price go up and stay up when shop owners see that this is a newly accepted price. 

You know whats happening dont you? These guys are going to stores and finding out when the ammo shipments come in, then they are standing there and when they get their chance they are buying it all. 

Then they come on here and they sell it for 3 times as much. Start sticking them with that ammo! Let them sit on 30 boxes of something they dont shoot. Next time they will leave it at the store and you can buy it for $10 a box, not $40. They are calling it a convenience fee... no it is being a thief. Call it for what it is. 



Same with guns. We all see the gun dealers on many internet sites with 20-30 guns at a time. Some of them do not even have a store front, all he has is these sites to sell guns on. I promise you his guns are all at least 100 over MSRP and most of them are 200-300 over what any other Donaldson dealer can sell them to you for. 



We all think this price gouging is madness, so do your part to stop it... dont buy over priced guns, dont pay triple for ammo than its worth. If you stop paying that much, there will start being ammo in the stores again, and prices will settle back down. 

Everyone do your part, and it will be better for all of us in the end."
