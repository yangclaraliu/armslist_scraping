Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers.

It was gifted to me a number of years ago and I pretty much only bump fire it when I shoot it.  Seeing as how 2013 is gonna be a rough year for ammo, bump firing just isn't in the picture for me anymore haha. I'm the second owner and the previous owner shot it very little. I however have put a couple hundred rounds through it since then and have only seen the occasional jam when the gun was starting to get very dirty from carbon build up. Its in great shape, always cleaned by me after the end of a shooting day and always put in the safe. The metal all looks great, but of course there are some minimal blemishes on the metal from normal use, wear and tear and what not.  The lower part of this gun is made of plastic, and the right side of the gun has a few scuffs on the plastic. Nothing deep, and you can't feel any difference because the grip is checkered anyways. Included is a removable barrel shroud and two 32 round magazines (good luck loading more than 30 haha it gets hard). Anyways on to what I want. I'm looking for a semi automatic pistol. full size, subcompact, compact, whatever. something in 9mm, .40 , or .45 acp is preferred, but I'm open to hear offers outside I that. Beretta anything is a plus. While I would prefer a semiauto pistol, IM OPEN TO ALL TRADES. gear, ammo, whatever you got, I love to barter. BTW I'm in Shreveport.

1: Black Belleville ECW Boots. (New)
    They are lined with Gortex and have two pairs of gortex inserts for Extreme Cold Weather Conditions. The boots are oversized to accommodate for the liners. 
    Size: 8.0-8.5 W/XW (I am unsure of the boot size without the liners, this is WITH the liners inserted.) - $100.00

2: TAG M4 Drop Leg Rig. (Used)
    This holds 4-6 30rnd AR mags. The mags are held with elastic around the sides and fold over flaps with clips. ACU Pattern. - $30.00

3: Buttstock AR Mag Holder. (Used)
    It holds one mag and velcros to the buttstock of your AR. It works best for fixed stocks, but I have had it attached to adjustable stocks as well. - $10.00

4: Thales Radio Pouch. (New)
    This pouch holds one Thales radio. It will hold Harris and other large handheld radios as well. If you are unsure if it will hold your radio, bring it and try if you can. ACU Pattern. - $30.00

5: Revision Sawfly Ballistic Eye Protection. (BNIP)
   These are current USGI issue and are still in the wrapping. It contains tinted and clear lenses and Op Drops to prevent fogging. - $40.00

6: ESS Locust SDW Goggles. (BNIP)
   These are Foliage Green Goggles used to block sand, dust, and wind from your eyes when you are exposed to the elements. Also current USGI Issue. - $60.00

7: Adjustable NVG Plate. (Used)
    It is just as it says, adjustable. It fits most ballistic helmets. - $10.00

8: CamelBak Mil Tac M.U.L.E. (Used)
   This is JUST the bag. No bladder comes with it. You can buy a new bladder, or use it as a small day pack. It's up to you. It's in great shape, and still does it's job. ACU Pattern. - $60.00

9: Safariland Model 6034 SLS Holster. (Used)
    Foliage Green dropleg holster for M9/M92SF with or without light attached. It has the Self Locking System. Check the site for more details. The only issue is I lost the metal rail on the inside of the holster to guide the weapon in. It should still hold just fine. Again, you can see if it fits if you bring your bang. I'm marking it down due to this issue. I marked it used for this reason but it has never had bang inside of it. I have contacted Safariland to see how much it will cost for the parts to fix it. I will update the page when I have gotten feedback. If I fix it I will relabel as new and adjust the price accordingly. This is around 150-190 NEW FYI - $100

10: Gerber Strap Cutting Tool. (Used)
     A green seatbelt cutter. It cuts through pretty much anything that will fit in it. It can strap to your vest, or you can keep it in your car for that unplanned accident. - $10.00

The parts list is below, but this has some very nice parts in her. The barrel is a match barrel from Denny's Global Tactical (now out of business). If you do some research you will find these barrels have a good following and are very accurate. Turned from Douglas stainless blanks they feature a mid-lenght gas system, 1:7 twist, Wylde Chamber, and only weight in at 4oz more then normal carbine barrels. They also have contour shelves for Ops Inc Brake and collars for both the 12th and 15th,16th these will also work with the Spikes Tactical Suppressor mounts. I put 10 rounds down the barrel to test funtion and that is it as of right now, she shot great! Free Floating Rail is a Larue 11.0 LT15 and the gas block is a Larue LT202. It has a Magpul aluminum trigger guard installed as well as KNS Anti-Rotation Pins and a Ergo Grip, M4 stock is by CMMG. 

Lower is a Surplus Arms & Ammo ""Reaper"" with bullet markings Keyhole Marked(Cerro Forge), upper is a keylole forged lazer T-marked with M4 feed ramps. Buffer tube is 6-pos mil-spec diameter. Lower part kit is either Palmetto or Armalite. BCG is a Semi Auto and the bolt only has 10 rounds on it. The buffer is currently a Spikes ST-T2 Heavy buffer and i have a CQD Mk18 Sling plate installed in the pictures. I will be changing the sling plate out to a standard retainer, and if i have a standard buffer in my bin i will change that out as well. If i put a standard buffer in i will adjust price and do another test/fuction fire so i know it is GTG for the buyer. The Larue rail was off a old build and has some use dings scratches but still solid. Past that everything has a very low round count on it or is new other then the 10rd test fire.

I also have 10 NIW Brownells 30rd mags with magpul followers and 60rds of Winchester 55gr FMJ ammo to get buyer started. This is a very nice rifle and will hate to let it go. This would be a great target, 3-gun rifle or Home defense rifle. I will put a optic on a test for accuracy if you are seriously interested.

I have posted some photos taken a few days ago for reference on PhotoBucket...(http://s269.photobucket.com/user/Raiderftbl/library/Sig%20Sauer%20P220R-45-%20BSS%20SIGLITE?sort=3&page=1). I would be able to throw in (3) 7 round magazines (purchased slightly used on GunBroker) and a 10 round extended mag that came new with the pistol. I paid $865 for the pistol, $103 for the magazines and $119 Rosewood grips. I cut the the Sig tag to put the new grips on the pistol. Lastly, included is a voucher for Sig Sauer for a free magazine with 10% off for a purchase from the Sig Sauer store due to the back order issue with magazines. With all that said; I know most dealers mark up the guns 15-20% and then I'd maybe lose another 10% for the pistol not being ""new"" so I have really lowered the price for this listing. Will only ship to an FFL if not local. Also, I play by the rules, so Please have a FOID permit before inquiring. The pistol is brand new and has never been fired... Everything listed and in photos is included in price. Thank you for checking it out!

An amazing and fun to shoot ""AR platform"" 22. I bought this about 6 months ago to plink and train while keeping my ergonomics and muscle memory for my M4. You just cant beat the price to go to the range and drop several hundred rounds. 

If you have read up on these you no doubt have heard about the ""blue spring,"" included is a picture of said spring. If you don't know anything about it, then you have nothing to worry about. (Early models had issues, this fixed them.)

I take very good care of all my weapons. I clean them after every range and I store them in a climate controlled basement in waterproof cases. I keep all original packaging, which is yours should you choose to have that shipped also. 

***THE PELICAN CASE IS NO LONGER INCLUDED IN THIS BUNDLE. I WILL SEND IT IN A GENERIC HARD CASE.***


The following are included:
*Obviously the rifle, Model #811034 which is the MOE / Magpul version, upgraded with adjustable stock, grip, and flip up front and rear sights that do not interfere with low optics   -   ~$600

*A reflex style red dot, not expensive, but holds a zero and works well in conjunction with the Flip up sights in case optics break, or battery dies.   -   ~$70
*You can see I also had the 'FIRE'/'SAFE' Color coded so that there is no mistake what position it is in, whether you are the one handling the weapon or not.
*4 extra magazines   -   ~$60
*661 rounds (611 shown, 50 in 2 mags, will be taken out when/if shipped)   -   ~$50
*A forward grip that doubles as a bi-pod    -   ~$60

This is an absolute joy to shoot, I'd hate to see it go, but It will fund another home project now that I have a baby.

I WILL ONLY SHIP TO AN FFL DEALER OUTSIDE OF NORTH CAROLINA. I'm military and cannot mingle in illegal activity, especially with federal crap. I can and will meet locally but a BILL OF SALE with copy of DL will be required to purchase. You may black out some sensitive information. Only need Pic and name, and I will give you mine in return.

I have stumbled across several, and found that the best way to assure that a deal is legitimate is to contact a gun shop in the area of the seller. Most are very happy to deal with the transfer (if it's a modern gun, an FFL dealer is required to do so), and the few I've worked with charged $25 for the transfer plus actual shipping. I had the seller bring the gun to the shop and once they had it and confirmed to me that it was as advertised, I sent the shop two certified checks, one for their fees and the second to the seller. He picked his check up from them and the item was shipped. Safe for everyone, legal, and sensible. If a seller won't do it that way, they're probably a fraud. Good luck."

When the AWB was announced everyone went and loaded up on guns and ammo, fine.
Then the scheduled shipments took a little longer than expected to arrive and people freaked out. Now where we are is every outlet that sells ammo, Walmart, Dicks, BassPro, Gander Mountain etc have lines of people waiting every morning for them to open and all ammo that arrived the night before is sold out in 20 minutes. Guess where it goes next ? Here. The ammo you see here was bought the morning it was posted for one quarter of what it is sold here for. I used to flag overpriced ammo but now everyone selling is doing it. Why, because you people can't chill out long enough for manufacturers to catch up. Stop paying these ridiculous prices and let the supply catch up with demand. Or maybe you enjoy paying four times what something is worth ?"

I thought someday it may become something unique following the expired assault ban.  I have noticed through the years several other types of the AR pistols have become available on the market.  

The latest Type 97S offered by Bushmaster has a ribbed hand guard, whereas this one is smooth.  There are other variants of the Bushmaster pistol without hand guards, and one without the lower rails.  These were offered for less money.

Before posting this Bushmaster for sale I searched Gunbroker to see the latest offerings and prices. I searched other websites offering these Bushmaster pistols for sale and haven’t been successful. Not in stock and no back order.  My best guess is if you want a Bushmaster 97S pistol like mine you are likely to buy one here on Armslist or another auction.

I believe I priced this one $100 below all other listings for a quick sale.  I am asking $998.  If you can find one in stock at a lower price please send me the link to verify and I will let the Bushmaster go for that price once verified.

I am selling my Pre-Ban (date code IC – 1982) all original Heckler & Koch H&K-93 rifle that was made in Germany. The riffle is in excellent condition and shows virtually no wear with a clean/bright bore. There is the normal line where the fire/safe selector made to remove the fire control unit and very minor claw marks.  I bought the rifle in 1991 and I have had it in my collection since. I have shot two clips through it and must day that is it a true pleasure to shoot.  The rifle is at 98% and has been stored in a humidity controlled safe in a smoke free home.  It comes with a factory bi-pod, three - 30 round clips, a factory clip loader and a  factory clip unloader. It has the standard H&K rotating diopter rear sight and the protected front post sight. There was only about a 1/3 of 93’s imported by H&K as there was 91’s, so these are rare to find, especially in such great condition. This is a collector's rifle and is sure to not disappoint.  Anybody who knows of H&K reputation knows that this is a rock solid .223 and will last for many years to come. This rifle will go fast, so act soon as it will not be available long. I will ship to FFL of your choice; just ensure that they will accept a rifle from an individual. Rifle will be sold as is, where is. No returns, not that you'd want to return it. I will ship it anywhere in the US that it is legal to own for $150.00 USD shipping costs and insurance up to $3000. If you are in the Charlotte area, it can be picked up and you will save the shipping.  If you can find a better H&K 93 with all of the original equipment that I am offering, you should buy it. Asking $2500.00 and no trades please. No reasonable offer will be refused."

This is a custom CZ-75. It started life as a CZ-75b, but has since been transformed into a very nice competition gun. Customizations include:

CZ Custom Competition DA/SA Hammer $70
CZ Custom SA Trigger with adjustable pre and over travel $30
CZ Custom Firing Pin Safety Removal Spacer $5
Wolff 15lb Hammer Spring (Reduced Power) $5
Hogue Grips $20

Includes all the custom parts as well as the original factory parts in case you want to revert it back to stock. 

This CZ-75's trigger is extremely crisp and clean. It rivals that of most 1911s! There's about an eighth to a quarter of an inch of travel from the reset to the break. This is made possible by the tuning of the trigger, the removal of the firing pin block safety, and the competition hammer. You could re-install the firing pin block safety, but it would increase the amount of travel in the trigger. You could also re-install the factory trigger. This would give you a long, but smooth double-action trigger and a crisp single-action trigger with a bit of pre-travel. The reduced power hammer spring will greatly reduce the amount of pull required for double-action. 

Comes with factory case, 2 magazines, and cleaning brush. 

I'm a CCW holder and I try to take good care of my firearms.
