DETAILS:

The UTS-15 tactical shotgun is a 12 ga. pump action shotgun with two 7-round alternately feeding or selectable magazine tubes, that measuring 28.3” in overall length with a 20,5” barrel chambers for 2 3/4” and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation (sights and choke tube pictured not included).

I can show most of my work, so you can see the quality of my work. Anything that is polymer I can stipple. I can also do two types of stippling, one is the deeper stipple and the other is a shallower stipple, you can see the difference in the last picture of the grip. If your wanting a gun stippled, just bring me the stock, or lower part of the gun. Not the whole firearm. This way you don't have to worry about giving a whole firearm to me. We can meet somewhere, or you can drop off and pick up at my work in manitou. I will do most jobs for 10$ an hour. If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

Sir, 

As a combat veteran of our military, I was quite disgusted to hear that you had the audacity to blame the sequestration for the training deaths of the US Marines who recently were killed in a horrible accident.

That you would use this for political gain is disgusting Sir - I am appalled and saddened that you have taken their accident and tried to turn it into your DC Politics.  

This is both sad, and unfortunate for their families and for all our veterans.

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch that there is a round in the chamber. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied. A grip safety allows the XD to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. 4-inch barrel calibered for .40 S&W ammunition. Includes an XD gear package."

This is not your standard AK WASR it was built on an RPK receiver..hence the 1.5mm thickness vs. the standard 1mm on a WASR or other AK. It has a very comfortable thumbhole stock, a lot like it! Being Piston driven the Ak can go folding stock. I'll tell you how and what product is best.

We do not waste time teaching subject matter you already know, and we do not accept just anyone willing to pay the fee on the firing line either. 

If someone accused us of placing high standards on our clients, we would have to enter a plea of guilt. We require every student to pass a handgun safety and proficiency test before the class starts to ensure the safety of all of our clients. 

Because all of our Concealed Carry-Handgun (CCH) instructors are Marine Veterans who possess Criminal Justice expertise, we know first-hand how best to prepare you for two of the worst fights you could be in; a gun fight in the Civ.Div. and the legal fight that will surely follow. 

If all you want is the certificate, this is NOT the course for you. There are 'anyone will pass' classes for that and they are cheaper, too. If what you are looking for is both a challenge of your handgun skills and an educational course that will teach you much more than the N.C. CCH curriculum requires, this is your course.

Because it is a variety of calibers, I will sell the lot at a very fair (below pre-Obama) price.  It is all clean and has been properly stored. (I am selling the rounds because they’re in calibers for which I no longer have a gun.)The whole lot goes for less than the online price just for the 113 .380 ACP rounds (except they’d add shipping charges, and they’re probably sold out!).  If you want only some of these calibers, the rate per round will be higher, yet lower than the price you can find online. 

Rifle:
48 rounds 7.62 * 54R (e.g., for a Mosin Nagant) (10 rounds Hansen FMJ; 38 rounds Hansen Posifeed Soft Point)
6 rounds .303 British Boxer SP

Very accurate gun and the trigger has to be felt to be believed. Very good condition with some minor marks scattered on the gun and scope from use over the years.

Ruger has added a hammer forged heavy profile barrel and a stock that is well-suited for bench work. The twenty-two inch barrel measures .786 inch diameter forward of the gas block, and .669 inch under the hand guard to the rear of the gas block. It has a one-in-nine-inch rifling twist to accurately stabilize long, heavy bullets, but still works well with short, light bullets also. The heavy barrel profile adds stiffness and a greater ability to absorb heat than does the standard barrel profile used on the original Mini and the Ranch Rifle. The most noticeable feature of the Target Rifle is the harmonic barrel tuner. This device is attached  near the muzzle, and by loosening four Allen screws, a shooter can fine tune the barrel vibrations for the best accuracy with a particular load. The device has a wide latitude of adjustment, and works along the same principle as the Browning BOSS system introduced a few years ago, but the Ruger unit is much more substantial and offers a much wider range of adjustment. The rifle can be fired with the harmonic tuner in any position, or with the unit completely removed from the weapon. In practice, it works just like a handloader fine tuning his load for the best accuracy, but the Ruger device offers the same tuning advantage even when using factory ammunition, with the minute adjustments made to the rifle instead of the ammunition.

813,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1341813,"For Sale:  NIB Bushmaster XM-15 AR-15 (not Carbon) ORC with ammo, below MSRP","Brookfield, Milwaukee, Wisconsin","$ 1,360","Listed On: Tuesday, March 26, 2013",Rifles,Bushmaster                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have a brand new all-metal Bushmaster XM 15 Optics Ready Carbine with 16"" chrome-lined A4-style barrel for sale. Not ""brand new with only 100 rounds through it"" but totally new.  I've never even loaded it!  This is a quality Bushmaster, and not a cheaper DPMS product, or a plastic Carbon 15.  

Comes with the box, empty chamber indicator flag, lock and key, sling, metal 30 round magazine, rail risers in case you want to use a big scope, warranty, owner's manual, and whatever extra paperwork/coupons/etc might be included normally. This model does not have any sights installed - it has a top rail that is ready to accept whatever optics you might wish to add. It comes with the receiver-length picatinny rail, 6-position adjustable stock, A2 flash suppressor/compensator, bayonet lug, and sling swivels attached. And unlike most modern AR's, it is stamped on the mag well so you know it accepts BOTH .223 AND 5.56 ammunition, whatever you can find to use - no guessing that the NATO rounds MIGHT go boom without your gun going BOOM! 

I'm also throwing in 80 rounds of non-corrosive .223 ammo so you can get it sighted in on the range and have some fun banging away without having to wait a couple months to find some ammo, or pay $1 a round.

I found another gun I want even more, so I'm looking to sell this quick so I've listed it below the base model MSRP ($1,391.48). I have some parts already in the mail and once they arrive and I start customizing this Bushmaster, I'll probably be taking it off the market. These have been selling out in hours online at $1300, and I saw them at the last gun show going for around $1600, so I'm listing it at $1360 (with ammo) and you won't have to pay shipping, taxes, or transfer fees. Face-to-face cash sale, prefer you have a CCW but not required. I have a Browning reflex red-dot sight I'll attach and bore-sight for an extra $50 if you want it to come with optics in place to take it right to the range, and I have a brand new mountable laser/light combo with pressure switches I can throw in for an extra $40.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask."
