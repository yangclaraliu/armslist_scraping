Here is a very rare Mossberg shotgun with a factory Mossberg SWAT tactical stock. It has a thick butt pad, fore-grip and AR style sights, really makes this shotgun look mean and superior handling and performance. This is NOT an accessory add-on; it’s an all original OEM model. It is chambered for 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells. Has an 18.5"" barrel and only 28 3/4"" overall length, dual pistol grips with grip safety, heat shield, and other heavy duty features for extreme condition / situational use. Exceptional Close Quarters Combat (CQC) weapon. Only two boxes of shells put though it – like new, comes with original owners manual.

Please feel free to ask any questions you may have. Sale or trade only with adults over the age of 21 and must show valid driver’s license. I don’t deal with, trade, speak to, etc… individuals that are banned from purchasing or owning a firearm – so if you have a criminal record – DON’T waste my time.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs."

Here is a as new CZ 52 with very few rounds through it.  I bought it new several years ago and shot it very little, maybe 50 rounds.  The CZ 52's shoot the 7.62x25 tokarev round.  It comes with the holster, extra magazine and cleaning rod.  I'll toss in a box of ammo also as the ammo is sometimes hard to find.  Looks like the average price on gunbroker.com is around $335.00.  I am going to ask just $300.00 for gun and ammo.  Thanks for looking.

$45 each, and I have 7 of left (updated 3/11).

The EMAG (Export MAGazine) is a lightweight 30-round 5.56x45 NATO polymer magazine that features a number of aesthetic and functional changes from the PMAG®. While EMAG remains 100% compatible with the AR15/M16 platform, its unique geometry is optimized for foreign-made weapons such as the British SA-80 (L85A1/A2, L86A1/A2, L22A1, L98A1/A2), HK 416, FN SCAR, M27 IAR, and others.

The difference between these and the PMAGs you see are that not all PMAGs have windows, and these are compatible with more foreign guns, in addition to the popular AR15 platform.

EMAG features the same pop-off Impact/Dust Cover as the PMAG GEN M2 to prevent dirt and debris intrusion and protect the feedlips from potential impact damage during transit and storage. When not in use, the Impact/Dust Cover can be stored on the magazine's floorplate to prevent possible loss.

For easy and accurate identification of loaded round count via the large, dual-sided MagLevel windows, the stainless steel magazine spring is coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color. Numerical indicators are added to the body to identify 5, 15, and 25 loaded rounds (holds 30 rounds).

Made in U.S.A. by the reputable Magpul.

It is a brand new limited production factory built Spikes Tactical upper in 5.45x39 (AK74) caliber matched to a brand new complete milspec PSA GenII forged alloy lower receiver. It has never been fired and the fit is perfect, nice and tight. These are unofficially referred to as a ""AR74"" and are a very smart buy due to the similar caliber ammo they take which is plentiful and at a much lower cost. It has a top quality Lothar Walther barrel ($375 alone) and complete corrosion resistance treatment, specifically designed to chew through cheap surplus 5.45x39 ammo that is still widely available and only costs $160-$180 per 1080 round can. You will save approximately $500 or more per 1000 rounds compared to .223 / 5.56, so buy the time you have purchased 3 of the 1080 round cans you have saved the entire cost of the rifle, basically making it free. After that, it will continue to pay you back by saving you another $500 or so on every 1080 round can purchased. Instead of feeling gouged when trying to buy some ammo just to go shoot your rifle for the day, you can enjoy taking advantage of the minimal cost of your ammo making it a pleasant experience. This gives you an affordable way to stock up on ammo for your AR15, you can stack it deep in sealed cans and have a lifetime supply for that price. Shoot 3-4 times the amount of ammo (in a better round) than your buddies can with their AR15s for the same cost. You can even afford to waste I mean shoot your ammo using one of those SlideFire stocks with this set up if that is your thing. The 5.45x39 has a very flat trajectory and nearly identical velocity to 5.56, but tumbles violently on impact due to bullet design (as opposed to cleanly passing straight through like 5.56 can). It produces much more devastating wounds, and over-penetration should never be an issue with this caliber. Some people prefer it for home defense due to that fact alone. This is by far the cheapest military spec'd ammo there is to my knowledge. Some batches of this ammo may be corrosive, which really doesn't matter if you clean your rifle after shooting, but in case you cant or don't, this limited edition Spikes Tactical Corrosion Resistant upper has the following features: Melonite finish inside and out, Lothar Walther Barrel with Nickel Boron M4 Extension, Melonite coated F-marked FSB, Melonite coated Gas Tube (stainless roll pin), and Melonite coated A2 Flash Hider. I saw a video recently of a guy that shot 7500 rounds of corrosive surplus ammo through one of these Melonite treated uppers over the course of a year without cleaning the rifle. When he finally did there was zero corrosion present due to the anti-corrosion Melonite finish. Lower is complete milspec Palmetto State Armory, with a nice trigger and 6 position collapsable stock. $1600 cash only, no trades.

It's only had 30 shells run through it. I just added a foregrip. 

Call or text REDACTED before 11 pm if interested. 

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I have the box, sling, paperwork and just added a fore-grip. Gun has had 30 rounds run through it.

This firearm also comes with a letter from Glock (in Smyrna) stating that there was rust found on the slide and the firearm is no longer under warranty.  The rust spots cleaned up nicely; I assume it was an officers backup weapon and was exposed to some elements.  To me, there is really no damage, Glock just won't warranty the parts.

Each discharger is an aluminum casting with six barrels angled to launch grenades in an arc. Smoke grenades are muzzle-loaded into discharger barrels. The launcher uses the vehicle's electrical system.

-For the Sig Sauer I'd like a P220 (CARRY) like one in the picture below maybe SAS?
-and for the Colt Python or Anaconda, like you I'm hoping to own one some day

I'm extremely interested in these guns and I would pay a pretty penny pending on conditions of the firearm. I might even be willing to trade my German Sig P6 if I like what you've got (will trade for Colt Python/Anaconda 100%)

The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case."

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)

M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver

5.56 Chamber

T-Marked Upper Receiver 
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel 
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber 
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish 
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 

5.56 NATO Chambers 
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 

Government Barrel Profiles 
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels 
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

More accurate than an AK47 and half the cost. With the sidefolding stock feature it is super compact and very comparable to an AK47. Comes with a 30 round mag. This is a very versatile rifle for the price, one that will do it all. With the stock in folded position the grip and trigger are still perfectly accessible, it does not interfere with firing the rifle and makes it an awesome and compact high power assault weapon. Unfolding it makes it an awesome deerslayer. Not to mention the functional under-folding bayonet is there if you need it. I figure it is worth $575-$600 trade value and will trade it for a new in box handgun in that price range. Or if you just want to buy it I will sell it for $500 cash FIRM. I have already turned down offers of $450 and $475, please only contact me if you have a new handgun to trade of the type listed below or if you want it for $500 cash. Any less and I will just keep it for myself as these are not going to go down in value and it is a rifle that is both fun and very useful. Plus ammo for it is half the price of AR15 ammo. Most people on here are asking much more for Norincos that have upgraded synthetic stocks and those that I have seen do not have the sidefolding option. Must be picked up in West Knoxville."
