300 H&H MAGNUM-- THE MOST VERSATILE MAGNUM 

300 H&H MAGNUM RIFLES ARE SCARCE and must be custom built if you want one.
The .300 H&H Magnum Cartridge was introduced by the British company Holland & Holland as the Super-Thirty in June, 1925. The cartridge won the 1000-yard Wimbledon Cup Match at Camp Perry in 1935, and the international 1,000 yard competition in 1937.Winchester chambered the Model 70 in .300 Holland & Holland Magnum in 1937.
The cartridge offered superior Ballistics to the .30-06 for long range, and the .300 H&H is almost as versatile with all bullet weights and types, especially if well-developed handloads are used. It excels with the heaviest .30-calibre bullets in the 180–220-grain range."

It's been installed on my AR15 for about 1500-2000 rounds, and has absolutely no wear on it that I can see, other than some discoloration on the piston internals.

Normally the kit does not come with the bolt, just the carrier. I am including the NiB coated bolt, extractor, and cam pin. The extractor has an O-Ring installed, but it's just a $0.60 Ace Hardware part, that I was using when troubleshooting instillation on a 10.5"" barrel.

Speaking of which, the bright orange sticker on top of the can pictured below says: Fits carbine length AR15/M16/M4 rifles with barrels 11.5"" to 16"" and barrel diameter no greater than .875""

This ran outstanding on my 14.5"" carbine, but I would prefer a DI and 10.5"" rather than piston and 11.5"".

Anyway, I'm not trying to gouge, but I really have no idea what this is worth, only what I have in it, and what the current availability is. So, I'll say $425 obo Also, if you bring me your standard mil-spec hammer, I'll trade you for my NiB coated hammer straight across. I would include it at that price, but I gotta have something to put back in my rifle."

I gave him $175 for what i thought was 1000 pieces of once fired brass. I got home that next day and started to load the brass I had just purchased and was short 105 pieces. I started with brick of 1000 primers and of the brick I had 105 primers remaining, this ensures that there is no way I could have miscounted the number of pieces of brass. The 895 pieces of brass I received where in good to excellent condition, so that is not what I am posting this about. What I am posting is how his customer service is! 

I contacted him many times about the shorted pieces of brass. When you are paying a premium price for brass, most people expect to get ATLEAST the 1000 pieces they paid for! In all honesty even if he would have been 10-25 short, I wouldn't have said a word about it; but 105 pieces is over 10% short ($18.37 worth of brass I didn't get that I paid for.) SO, after having to remind him several times about the shorted brass he finally sent the shorted brass A MONTH LATER!! 

I am posting a picture of over 30 of the 100 pieces he mailed me a month after i had originally purchased the 1000 pieces of brass. You make your own decision on buying from this guy!!!"

From Primary Weapons Systems site

The PWS Triad flash suppressor features a revolutionary design bringing true flash suppression together with reduced muzzle flip by redirecting gases exiting the muzzle without the overpressure created by muzzle brakes and recoil compensators. The unique internal design of the Triad provides excellent flash suppression while retaining a great deal of the muzzle control that PWS muzzle devices have become known for. The Triad 556 model is a suppressorcompatible mount for the Gemtech Halo.

The Triad is classified as a flash suppressor under ATF guidelines and should be used in accordance with each state’s firearms laws. Triad flash suppressors ship with the PWS Muzzle Device Alignment Set. Additional mounting devices are not required.

Designed as a purpose-built flash suppressor, the Triad 556 is a great option on rifles where muzzle control and flash suppression are equally important and where the overpressure of a muzzle break is not an option.

These rifles are 100% ready to go, just add ammo. They have been laser bore sighted and test fired for functionality. The barrels are extremely nice and made by FN USA, the chrome lining will keep the barrel in top shape longer than you can afford to shoot it. The upper is built completely to mil-spec and features M4 feed ramps for more reliable feeding. And the bolt carrier groups are of the M16 variety, the gun is only semi-automatic but the bolts are built to be used in automatic weapons and will hold up much better than most which are only built to meet the .223 ar-15 semi-auto specs, they are also coated in nickel boron which reduces friction, requires less lubrication, lasts longer, and is incredibly easier to clean. These are not home brewn parts guns, they are barreled upper assemblies that have been factory assembled and headspaced, with a bolt carrier group installed, and pinned to a complete factory built lower, buy with confidence. Dummy mag is for picture only and not included

I'm in the market for a good, inexpensive plinking rifle.  I'd prefer a .22lr semi-auto with a detachable mag (if the price was right, I'd probably go for a marlin 90)  Something along the lines of a marlin 795, mossberg 702, or a ruger 10/22...probably not a 10/22 since it seems like people are still asking too much for those (btw Academy has 10/22's brand new for $199, 795's for $149, and 702's for $139).  I'm not looking to break the bank and I'm not in a huge hurry or anything.  I'm looking to buy used because it is supposed to be cheaper.  If you have a new one, I am willing to pay new prices plus what you paid for tax, fees and a little extra for your troubles, but I CAN just take a day off (someday hopefully) and buy it myself.  So if you've got an un-used and un-loved .22 laying around, get in touch.   If you're looking to make a ton of money selling a gun to someone who isn't supposed to have one, look elsewhere."

**Brand New Kel-Tec PMR-30 Comes with 2-30rd mags**

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game."

Great gun. Fun to shoot. Only put 150 rounds through the barrel. Looks brand new. Wife is making me sell one of my toys to pay for another recent purchase.

Neos means ""new"" in Greek, and Beretta's American design staff started with a clean sheet when drawing up this new line of .22 pistols. The lines are meant to appeal to a new generation of shooting enthusiasts who are respectful of the past while bringing a fresh attitude to the shooting sports. The Neos pistols feature cutting-edge design, modular construction that allows personalization and the flexibility for many shooting disciplines. Available at popular prices, the Neos is ideal for new shooters, but it won't easily be outgrown as skills improve. 

SOPHISTICATED.
In the unmistakable design and style of Giugiaro. The valuable collaboration between Beretta’s engineers and noted Italian designer continues to fruition. The sleeker and ergonomic U22 Neos with its captivatingly designed gun case is guaranteed to appeal to Beretta enthusiasts.

MODULAR.
Constructed of five assemblies which are easily disassembled without tools, the U22 Neos is manufactured in the classic Beretta blue or inox to satisfy the tastes of all shooters. The ergonomic grips in fiberglass reinforced technopolymer with anti-slip finish can be substituted with optional colored or rubber inlay grips.

PERFORMING.
Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and notably precise thanks to the 6” barrel featuring an integral rail that accepts Weaver style scope mounts, and a fully adjustable target rear sight.
The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack magazine made from inox steel (with a 10 round capacity) boasts a practical device which facilitates loading.  The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged either with the firing pin cocked or uncocked.

Comes with case and all paperwork that came with the gun. Local sale only. 

I will throw in a 100 rounds of .22 hollow points if I get the asking price."

Although Armalite sold their designs to Colt, who manufactured them for the military in the US and other countries, Armalite is the originator of the model, so it comes as no surprise that it's considered one of the best AR's on the market.  The M-15 semi-automatic version is in service currently with many law enforcement agencies due to its accuracy, low felt recoil, and dependability over similar versions.

This is my wife's gun, never fired, never even loaded.  We were going to take this rifle up to the cabin with us this summer, but my wife decided she wanted something else, so on to the market it goes!  It comes with:
M 15 rifle with extendable 6-position stock and receiver-length picatinny rail
Flip-up rear sight
A2 style flash hider
A2 style front sight
M203 step down for launchers or similar types of attachments
Ambidextrous single-point sling adapter with adjustable single point sling
Original stock bracket
Original metal 30 round magazine
New (out of package) 30 round polymer Magpul Pmag with Magpul bumper plate on bottom
Rail riser with two scope rings
Owner's manual
Lockable hard case

I'm also throwing in:
80 rounds of brass-cased Remington UMC .223 rifle ammunition in the boxes
A brand new (in package) lightweight laser/flashlight combo with tactical pressure on/off switches and rail mounting system.  Laser is rated at 100 yards, flashlight has a flip-up red filter.  I'm willing to knock off $50 if you don't want the laser/light combo.

This is chambered in 5.56 NATO, so it will fire both 5.56 and .223 (including armor piercing and tracer), unlike a lot of the newer AR's which are only rated for .223 ammunition.

The NEW standard by which all ammunition will be judged.
Fast

Superformance ammunition is 100 to 200 fps FASTER than any conventional ammunition on the market today, and achieves this performance in EVERY gun, WITHOUT increases in felt recoil, muzzle blast, temperature sensitivity, fouling or loss of accuracy.

Innovative

Superformance is a cutting edge technological advancement in ammunition design that transcends convention and achieves the highest performance of any ammunition on the market today.

Specialized

Superformance uses ultra progressive propellants that take your favorite SST or GMX bullets to levels of performance that are simply unattainable with conventional propellants. In order to get more velocity in the past – shooters have used a brute force approach – large charge weights of a slow burning powder in a larger cartridge case. Ultimately this leads to more recoil and muzzle blast. The Superformance solution is an elegant approach that utilizes specialized powders…at NORMAL charge weights, that impart ALL useable energy to the bullet reducing the ROCKET NOZZLE EFFECT at the muzzle while still increasing velocity!

Versatile

Superformance provides increased performance, and is safe to use in ALL firearms, including semi-autos*, lever gun and pump actions.

Increases in rifle performance, no increases in barrel wear and felt recoil, along with superior temperature stability are all realized with Superformance ammunition."

Hey all,

I bought this rifle from a small shop but decided I'd like something else. Its been used very  little and really looks great, even though it was made in 1979 (ah yes, the good 'ol days when it was actually Marlin making these fine rifles). There are a few slight scratches on the rear stock, but other than that this thing looks FANTASTIC. 

I will be including roughly 40 rounds (thats over $50 worth) of premium Hornady Leverevolution ammunition, 60 once-fired cases (for you reloading types), as well as a nice nylon sling, canvas (think Carhartt material) soft case, and some see-thru scope mounts.

The cost of the case, sling, scope rings, and ammo was $80+. Since these are things you would have to buy anyways for the rifle, this is a GREAT deal for you. Not only is it $45 cheaper than the other 336 in 35Rem posted on here, but you get way more for your money.

Feel free to call me at (206) Three-seven-one 38-six-six. I have more pictures if you are interested."

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

Shipping is via Priority - I am offering a discounted flat rate of $5 for up to 4 magazines, and $10 for 5 or more.

Prices are $25 each, $120 for 5 or $230 for 10."

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.
