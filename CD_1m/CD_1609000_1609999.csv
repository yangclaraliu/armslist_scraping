Priced at only $525 plus sales tax (if purchsaed in Arizona).

This Glock 23, Generation 4, .40 caliber handgun comes with one 13 round magazine and a magazine loader in the factory supplied hard plastic case.  

New Glock pistols have been pretty difficult to come by lately, so get one while it's available.

Seller is a Federal Firearms Licensed dealer, so you will need to show your Arizona Driver's License, fill out the ATF form 4473, and I will need to do a NICS check.  The price is for a cash sale, but I can do a credit card for a 3% upcharge.

Below is the factory write-up for the Glock 23, Generation 4

The GLOCK 23 Generation 4, in .40 caliber, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK Gerneration 4 dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The GLOCK 23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments."

The Equinox is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER P220  Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER Custom Shop. The P220 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox  comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function."

I have a like new (75 rds) Benelli Super Black Eagle 2 with Comfort Tech stock.

This is the most versatile shotgun out there. Great for turkey, goose, ducks, dove, and pheasant. Also amazing for trap and sporting clays 

These sell new for $1749 plus the 4.7% sales tax. 

Look at the link above for info on the amazing shotgun. 

The Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility, and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. Utilizing the proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"", and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments. The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech system which reduces recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less on average; that's more than a pound less! The ComforTech system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest-shooting, most reliable shotgun ever."

The M9 Semiautomatic is a 9x19mm Parabellum pistol that was adopted in 1985 as the ofﬁcial sidearm of the United States military after winning a competition in the 1980s, beating out many other contenders. The 92F survived exposure to temperatures from -40°F to 140°F, being soaked in salt water, being dropped repeatedly on concrete, and being buried in sand, mud and snow. Additionally, the 92F proved a MRBF (mean rounds before failure) of 35,000 rounds, the equivalent to ﬁve or six times the pistol’s service life. It ofﬁcially entered service in 1990. The Chiappa M9-22 is a replica of the US Military sidearm chambered in .22 rimﬁre.

It also comes with a like-new EOTech holographic sight that can be mounted on the picatinny-style dust cover that I'm selling with this rifle (in addition to the original dust cover). This AK is single-fire and is legal in many US states. Get the power of an AK with the quick accuracy of an EOTech! Truly an awesome combination. If you are interested in the AK but not the EOTech, please send me a message with your best offer and I will consider it. I also might be willing to sell you some 7.62x39 ammo with this rifle. Thank you!"
