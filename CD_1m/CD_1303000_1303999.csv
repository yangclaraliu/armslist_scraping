I'm asking 1900 or best offer, even a year ago this rifle was nearly 1,000, and it comes with 1,000 in accessories.. Won't be able to buy any of this new, possibly for the next year due to shortages and huge backlogs of orders. So prices will remain high on the used guns. My price is very fair considering, it's practically what I paid when the items were available.

The rifle has had 60rnds fired since purchased new, it had flawless cycling and function using soft tip HP ammo from Big 5. Super accurate rifle, I held a 1"" group at 100m with a 3-9x40 scope. No scratches or wear other than what 60rnds does. Rifle looks new. 

I have 7 20rnd mags, not the steel ones. I also have a picatinny claw mount that I'll include (currently installed), that way all you have to do is get a scope with rings and you're ready for distance shooting. 

This is a great rifle. It runs perfect, it shoots accurately, mags are cheap. 

I'm interested in AK47's (no wasr's), AR15's, other defense rifles that shoot a medium caliber (5.45, 5.56, 7.62x39) Some trades may need cash on top. Please feel free to make offers. 

(PLEASE NO SKS, BOLT GUNS, OR REVOLVERS)


I would truly prefer to keep this rifle, yet .308 is just too expensive for how often I like to shoot. 

Cash price is $1200 obo"

If you have something similar to a 442, maybe I might have an interest, but I need specific details as to make, model, barrel length, condition, and what you feel is a fair price.  If you are unsure of what your revolver is worth, google is your friend.  Search for it here on armslist or at gunbroker.

-Sightmark Holograph Sight with 4 reticle selection ($160 one, not one of the $40 economy ones)

-The piece of mind that you can fight off the ""zombie invasion""when TSHTF
-The piece of mind that all the stores that I know of have plenty of cheap ammo for this IN STOCK
-A few stray ""Dremel"" marks where I modified the stock to accommodate the scope mount.
(not ugly-but then again, no one ever claimed an SKS was pretty to begin with)
-Shoots great! (did I mention Frosty?)

now owned by a PATRIOT that'll use it for whatever he feels he/she must because the 2nd Amendment says it's your RIGHT!
If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750. If you don't like it....you're free to write ""hate emails"" from yer mommy's basement because THIS IS AMERICA!!! I can then delete them and laugh at your sad, poor self.
Seriously....,if you want this, email me stating your intention to buy, a number that I can call or text, and be prepared to show a valid form of ID and sign a Bill of Sale, because I'm ONLY SELLING to a LEGAL, law-abiding CITIZEN!

For Sale is an upgraded Spikes Tactical ST15 with mid-length gas system in good condition. It functions flawlessly and is very accurate with match ammo. The Rainier Arms Match Stainless barrel can handle .223 or 5.56 and its 1-8 twist is perfect for all AR bullet weights. I built this rifle as a lightweight 0-600 yard SPR and it fills that role extremely well. Weighing just 7lbs (without glass) this is a rifle that can be carried all day then easily engage targets at long range. 

Spikes Tactical rifles are top of the line and carry a lifetime warranty with some of the best customer service in the business.  Round count on the rifle is around 1000. Round count on this barrel is 300. I'll be happy to answer any questions about the rifle or add-ons, and can provide more pictures via email.   

The total retail value of the rifle and upgrades is $1750. The proposed AWB, shootings, and Obama reelection have driven the street prices on these items through the roof, but I just want to mostly break even so I'm selling for $1600 face to face. I'm also willing to ship within Missouri at cost (probably around $30 insured). Wait times on these rifles and components are up to a year but you can have this one in hand in days.

I'm willing to sell the rifle without some upgrades (sights, stock, grip, rail, etc) however, I WILL NOT SELL ANY ITEM SEPARATELY UNTIL THE RIFLE SELLS. 


Prices are fixed but I am looking for a few different partial trade items that I'll work with you on. Value of trade firearms will be considered at pre panic street prices.

Up for sale or trade is a Ruger SP101 w/ 2-1/4"" barrel.  I bought it new late last year and have put literally one box of ammo through it.  Included in the price (or trade) is a quality leather IWB holster from UBG Leather, and I've also decided to add a 20 round box of good 38+P Gold Dots.  Also have the original case.

Face-to-Face meeting is required along with proof of ID, concealed carry license preferred.  If no CCL, I will run your name through the Oklahoma On-Demand Court Records system on my smartphone.  No photocopies or anything like that will be made, just trying to exercise my due diligence in ensuring nothing shady is going on!  Also, PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER SO I CAN CALL YOU!!  Otherwise you may miss out on a deal!  And, as always...first come, first serve.  Thanks!"

If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask.

To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask.

Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

773,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1303773,For Sale:  Original Knight DISC .50 Caliber rifle,"Cumming, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 175,"Listed On: Friday, September 6, 2013",Muzzle,Knight                                                                                ,50 Black Powder                                                                                ,no type,Muzzle Loader,"This is an original Knight DISC .50cal rifle.  This model shoots with the orange primers, it has not been altered to the 209 system.  However, you can buy the Priming loader from Knights in a bulk 100 pack for $13 that allows you to shoot 209 shotgun primers as it is currently setup.  There is also a conversion kit available from Knight to convert it to the newer DISC Extreme for $125.  The absolute cheapest of the new DISC Extreme line has an MSRP of $559, and some of the more fancy models get to near $1000.  I'm not suggesting this is worth that, just a tidbit of info for those who are interested in getting into Black Powder weapons.  This gun doesn't appear to have been used very much, however the original owner most obviously didn't clean it after the last use and there is some rusty crud in a few spots down the barrel, and a spot on the crown of the barrel.  I ran a cleaning rod through it, and got a good bit of it out with little effort. (there is some pitting)  I have been told by some of the folks on the Black Powder forums that rust in this particular gun is common.  They suggested a couple cleaning methods to me, but I don't want to take it down that far and do the work, so I'll just sell it for a lower price and the buyer can take it down and clean to their hearts extent.

The scope is a Tasco WA3-9x40TV.  It is far from a high end optic, however I did take it out and check it, it's clear with no fog or scratching.  A great starter scope.

Price is $175, cash only no trades.  I can ship this directly to buyers house as this gun is not restricted through the delivery systems.  It will weigh about 12 pounds in box.  Email me with any questions, I'll do my best to answer them, but I'm by no means a Black Powder shooter and know little about  them.

Also, I have another BP rifle listed here on armslist currently, as well as a .44cal 1858 Remington New Army Revolver replica from Uberti.  If a local buyer wishes to come see it in person, I will show it at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming, and only there.  They are located just off GA400 exit 13."

Was hoping to piece together another AR15 but an inevitable engine rebuild is going to be setting me back so I need the cash to help cover my repairs.

Looking for $175 for the lower receiver to recoup my costs paid to get it and asking $120 for the stripped upper, again - my cost paid + shipping.  I don't care to gouge people, just looking to get what I put into them back out otherwise I may as well hang on to them until I'm able to afford finishing off my build.

Not looking for trades, cash only - unless someone has an interest in these and has a Subaru EJ25 engine either working pull or in need of rebuilding that they would wish to work out a trade with.

For sale or trade to lawful purchasers 21 years of age or older residing in Wisconsin on the lower receiver.  Must sign bill of sale and show WI ID for the lower receiver as well.  Upper receiver cash and carry is fine.  I live in Evansville and am willing to meet up somewhere in the Madison area, Evansville or Janesville (or somewhere in between these areas).

Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

This is one killer .40cal Glock package! What we have is:


(GLOCK 23 Gen 4 FDE): BRAND NEW IN BOX! It comes as it came from the factory with all paperwork, three 13rd mags, and a brand new/opened Factory Glock 22rd mag. This one is RARE and VERY hard to get your hands on PERIOD! The Glock 23 Gen 4 FDE (not Gen 3), has been going for $700-$850 (minus shipping and FFL) on gunbroker and that’s the only way you’re getting one of these! You cannot order these online and I was told today by Vance’s today, Glock has limited the production of these due to the 8 month back order that they are trying to fill, and that they could order me one at $649.99 if I wanted a nice Christmas gift to myself (you can call and verify)!! 

(GLOCK 27 Gen 4): LIKE BRAND NEW (100rds fired) with Trijicon night nights. It comes in box with all paperwork, three 9rd mags (all have pinky extension), and it has two brand new/opened Factory Glock extended mags (13rd and 15rd with XGrip extentions to make it a full size grip). Glock 27’s are nearly impossible to get right now as we all know let alone with the Trijicons already installed so please consider all factors. These are going for $600+ online (minus shipping and FFL), add Trijicon Night Sights and you’re at $800 with paper trail!!

Also included is a like brand new Crimson Trace laserguard, LG-436, that can be used with the Glock 23/27 models. I also have a custom made kydex crossbreed holster that is fitted to the Glock 23/27 with the crimson trace laserguard installed.

Also included is 317rds of ammo:
(not full) Gold Dot LE Duty HP 165gr (21rds/50rd box)
(not full) Champion FMJ 180gr (59rds/100rd box)

I was having trouble uploading the pics from my phone, I can text pics to you if you're interested. Call or text me at REDACTED. I prefer texts or emails, but if you do call, please leave a message if I don't answer. I'm most likely at work and don't respond to calls without a voicemail.
