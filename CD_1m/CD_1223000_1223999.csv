It is from the 3rd production run of CAI, so it has NONE of the problems you hear about with the earlier Cetme's.  You can tell it's a 3rd Gen from the straight barrel without threading or a flash hider.  The bolt is not ground, cocks as smooth as butter, and fires very smoothly.

It is in great shape.  Has a few spots of ware, but nothing abnormal.
Has recently refinished wood furniture on it, stained in a dark red mahogany color. Also, inside, it has a rubber recoil buffer in it, making it about the tamest .308 recoil out there.  Has a rail on it so scope mounting is possible.

Comes with ALOT of extras:
~Original Cetme black furniture, recoil assembly, and pistol grip. (Top of stock has a crack in it. Can be repaired, just don't know how.)
~G3 Olive Stock with recoil assembly (Has crack on the bottom, but can be repaired), 2 Olive hand gaurds (One is stock, the other one has the vent holes drilled out), Olive Pistol grip.
~G3 Tropical Green Stock, Tropical Green hand gaurd with holes drilled out)
~New, never installed Carry Handle
~3 Aluminum 20 Round HK G3 Mags
~1 Steel 20-Round Cetme Mag
~1 RARE Steel 5-Round Cetme Mag 

G3 and Cetme surplus parts are drying up, so having the black, tropical, and olive parts is a plus.  (Yes the stocks have small cracks, but can easily be repaired. I never messed with them, because they came with the rifle, and I wanted the wood parts on it.) Just consider them extras included in the deal!"

I have a Crosman 38T, that is in pristine condition. In fact, I don't even know if its ever been fired. Includes all paperwork, original box, even original plastic wrapping for the gun! I got this from my uncle who passed away, and its not really what I'm interested in. I thought I would sell it to someone who can appreciate it more than me. This is an all metal gun with the exception of the rear sight and cylinder. The CO2 valve is brass. This gun is modeled after the S&W K-38.

The only issue this gun has, is a cracked plastic grip. I believe these can still be purchased from Crosman, or other online sources. I have the piece taped in place so it doesnt get lost. This would be very sharp with a nice set of wood grips!

With any 30 year + airgun, I would also anticipate the seal needs to be replaced. I cannot verify this, but its preventative maintenance I would do if I was a buyer of this gun. Very easy and cheap to do if it needs it."

Piston systems are pinned on for ultimate reliability.

I paid $80 plus shipping so if you're in need of a handmade IWB holster for your XD/XDm (and don't want to wait the 8-12 weeks Kirkpatrick takes to get one to you) here you go. Following is the description from Kirkpatrick:


Concealment of a large-frame pistol can be a challenge, especially in warmer climates when cover is limited. The TXC holster is designed with offset loops that are placed far enough apart to reduce shifting during use. This design also moves the loops to the front and back of the pistol, minimizing bulk. These features make the TXC our most concealed full-size holster.

I have no idea if that is true or not. Anyways, this is a great gun but I am more into buying for purpose not collecting. It has a 3.5"" barrel, and the complete pistol is in a black matte finish. Top slide marked ""Tank Officers 45ACP"" on left. ""Officer’s ACP"" on right. Completely parkerized from top to bottom and the fluted barrel. It comes with original wood grips, after market black grips, and mag.  Let me know if you have any questions. Asking $1100 or trade. It is worth every penny. Has only had a few magazines fired through it.

This auction is for a UTAS UTS 15 Bullpup 12 Gauge Shotgun. This is a wonderful shotgun and is extremely hard to find. Most of the auctions are for pre-orders with long wait times. I have this gun in stock and ready to ship with no delay!

Specifications:
Manufacturer: UTAS
Model: UTS-15
Caliber: 12 Gauge, 2 3/4"" & 3"" 
Capacity: 15 Round
Method of Operation: Pump 
Length: 28.3 inches
Barrel Length: 20.5 inches 
Rate of Twist: 1in8 
Condition: New

Product Details:
The UTS-15 is a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun weighing in at just over 6.9 pounds, designed primarily for the urban battlefield environment. 

The firearm includes a 20.5 inch barrel despite the overall weapon length of just 28.3 inches. The short length makes the weapon easier to handle in close-quarters situations; however, it can still remain accurate at relatively long ranges. The long barrel length is achieved by using a bullpup configuration, with user selectable dual rear-fed tubular magazines. The selector switch can be set to left, right, or alternating. For example, slugs can be used with standard buckshot in reserve. An optional built in LED spotlight and laser sight provides point and shoot night fighting capability.

Features:
•Tool less modular design
•Carbon fibre reinforced receiver for corrosion resistance and light weight
•Anti glare finish on all exterior parts
•2 sling swivel mounting points
•Chrome lined threaded barrel
•Externally visible magazine counters
•Integrated top mounted picatinny rail
•Top located shell loading ports for accelerated loading times"

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a
standard picatinny rail.

This is not your typical new AR listed for sale, rather it’s a Like-New Law Enforcement Only model that spent its life in the case waiting for action.  I just took this Bushmaster XM15-E2S 20” Heavy Barrel in on trade and have decided not to add another to my fleet to appease the boss/wife so here it is for sale...not interested in any trades.

I have run a mag thru it and it shoots unbelievably smooth without all the recoil, noise, etc you typically find on a Carbine or Light Wt Barrel.  It comes with One (1) GI Mag w/ Stainless Follower and a Hard Case.  It’s truly in fantastic condition and appears to have barely been used.

If you're in the hunt for one, well, here you go.  I will sell FTF to a KS resident legally able to acquire and own a firearm (don't ask me to do anything creative...I won't) or thru your out-of-state FFL.

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a
standard picatinny rail.

I have a new Mega Arms multi cal forged lower marked pistol. It has not been built yet. It can legally and functionally be built as either a pistol or a rifle which is very versatile vs having to register a standard lower as a pistol.  I was going to build out a pistol but decided to go away from that and for a rifle I'd rather have a different brand than this. Just personal preference. Your lower must be new never used and be of equal or better value than Mega so think Seekins, DD, LMT, BCM, Noveske and the like. Would really love a Seekins Billet. Must be able to do a North Seattle area meetup FTF and have good guy paper work to show.

------------------------------------------
This U.S. Springfield Armory Model 1903 bolt action 30-06 rifle, Serial Number # 594XXX was manufactured in 1915. 
With a 24” (?) barrel and a Reinhart Fajen Sporter Stock, it is in “good” condition. The receiver and all mechanical functions are tight, solid, and smooth. 
Joseph L. Lyon’s studied and documented “…Observations On The Failure Of U.S. Model 1903 Rifle Receivers”, (which you can read in its entirety at: http://m1903.com/03rcvrfail/ ), offers definitive proof that there were absolutely “…no failures in five of the years (1908-10, 1912, 1915)…” Springfield Armory productions of the Model 1903.
In fact, when tested under extreme conditions these model years “…withstood pressures well above that experienced with military ammunition, yet none failed until pressure was raised between 50% to 100% above normal operating pressure.” 
Contrary to popular myth, this is a totally safe and sound rifle that is not included in the SA Model 1903 “Failure” list.
(Follow the link and read the study in its entirety.)

The barrel and other critical steel parts are manganese-phosphate-finished for corrosion and rust protection. The Carbon 15's safety levers have color-coded markings on both sides of the receiver for quick visual check of firing condition. Package includes a 30-round .223 Remington magazine and a Red Dot Sight."

I love that new gun smell, don’t you? Ruger announced a new takedown version of the hugely successful 10/22 today. Having an upgradable 10-round semi-automatic .22 LR at your side is certainly a good idea, and now Ruger makes storage and transport even easier than before. Readily separated into two halves, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate as every Ruger 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. Despite the ease of assembly and reassembly, the lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero – even when receiver mounted optics are used.
The Ruger 10/22 Takedown ships in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachments points for the padded, single-shoulder strap offer different carrying options.
The 4.67-pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37″ long when assembled; each half is less than 20-1/4″ when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action, and provided with one 10-round rotary magazine, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a new compact and portable package."
