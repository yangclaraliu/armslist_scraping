This gun was purchased new in March 2013.  Since then I have put somewhere around 1000 flawless rounds through it (did not keep an exact count).  It has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  It does have an idiot scratch (my first 1911) and faint stain in the checkering on the housing.

Offering at $2400 which is a $500 savings over retail/pricing for a new Executive Target  either directly from Ed Brown or from gunbroker, gunsamerica or other online sellers (possibly more if you include potential costs for shipping, FFL, taxes).

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  
The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

The cylinder does not ""lock up"" properly and I am wondering if there is a quick repair I can do.  Here is what I am experiencing:

At half cock, the cylinder spins freely as it should in the loading direction and will lock upon turning it backwards a small distance, also as it should.
The four click cocking sounds are present, but sound ""dull"" instead of ""sharp.""
At full cock there appears to be more ""play"" than in my other SAA models.
With the hammer all the way down, or in the safety catch position, the cylinder can be spun (backwards) out of its catch position.

I have already removed and reinstalled the cylinder to no avail.  I am no expert on SAA models but I do know this isn't right.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated."

I'm not sure when the screw-on blade sight started (70's? 80's?), but the 22"" barrel was reduced to 19"" in the early 2000s.

Would prefer a known shooter, but will take anything with a clean bright bore and an intact bolt, receiver, and action.

Nothing else is important - shot, busted or missing stock - mag tube broken or missing or whatever. Even the barrel and receiver can be beat up and somewhat rusty on the outside. It's for a project. It doesn't even have to have the sight - that's just a way to distinguish the barrel.

The Polish MAG 98 9mm /9x19 NATO caliber pistol is an improved variation of the original Polish MAG95. 
It was produced for the Polish Special Forces, Border Guard and Prison Guard (Straż Więzienna) in the 1990's. 
Made in the Z.M. Lucznik factory 11 at Radom Poland. 

These fine pistols feature a ambidextrous decocker safety, steel slide, alloy frame, and serrated trigger guard front strap.
In 1996 the Mag 98 was evaluated for adoption purposes by the Polish Army. It had advantages over its competition such as 
better reliability, durability and safety (better protection against accidental discharge, when dropped). 

Although the quality was deemed superior,  the MAG 98 was rejected by the Army because the frame was slightly larger
than  the contract qualifications called for. That was a shame because most service members prefered it and in fact 
the pistol has a good reputation among users: It is considered a precise, well balanced and durable weapon 
and its mass leads to good stability during firing. 

This double/single action pistol comes with ONE 15rd magazine."

my draw length is 31 inches so i need one that is around 60 to 66 inches long to safely (i.e.: less stacking and less chance of failure) use it from what i read. my draw length also removes selfbows (made from a single piece of wood) from the equation. would prefer one that is 30 to 35 pounds (since i will be over drawing it by about 3 inches from the factory draw length which in turn will increase the draw weight by about 7-9 pounds) take down models are ok. 
if it is damaged do not bother, i do not want another persons problem. i am somewhat new still to archery but i do know how to research quality/prices so please dont try to over sell me, i will not pay retail for used bows. when responding please put the brand, model, and asking price in your message for research purposes. i am not looking for an ultra high end bow since i am new-ish to this. feel free to send me offers, worst i can do is say no thanks

It is in excellent physical and mechanical condition with a perfect bore. These pistols were imported from Russia by KBI for several years in the 90's and there was two versions: the first was the standard pistol that used a single stack magazine, and the other was a high capacity model that used a double stack 10 round magazine giving it an 11 round total capacity. 

The pistol for sale here is the high capacity model and far fewer of these were brought over making it much more scarce and sought after. Pistol fires single action or double action. It has fully adjustable rear sights and is surprisingly accurate for a military firearm. It also has a hammer block type safety that allows it to be carried with a loaded chamber.

Pistol comes with it's original inner and outer factory box with all the factory literature that was shipped with it. It also comes with three 10 round hi-cap magazines, an original Russian leather holster with matching lanyard (both in excellent condition), the original cleaning rod, plus the multi tool that was supplied by the factory.

Price is $475. FTF only with pickup in Brandon. You must be a Florida resident and at least 21 to purchase. A bill of sale will be provided.

Based on S/N, this rifle should have been manufactured in 1958. The SKS rifle was first made at the Jianshe Arsenal in 1956 under close Soviet supervision, which resulted in quality comparable to the Soviet made rifles.

Parts are milled, not stamped. It has the heavy barrel lug and threaded barrel, unlike the light weight lug and pinned barrels of the Norincos. Early Chinese SKS rifles also came standard with the Soviet style blade bayonet, as shown, instead of the later Chinese spike bayonet. This one is very clean, rust free, and in excellent condition. Barrel is bright and shiny. It hasn't been shot since it was imported to the US in the late 80's. I am the second owner since import.

I own a few Soviet made rifles and I can attest that the steel parts in this rifle look and fit as good as those in my Tulas. These oldest Chinese rifles are hard to find and collectors are holding on to them, so this rifle would make a nice addition to any serious SKS collection.

Face to face in Winston-Salem area only. Must have CCW or Pistol Permit to buy. We'll do bill of sale.

I have an extremely nice, AR-15 that has yet to be fired.... I built this rifle myself using only high quality MIL-SPEC parts and using only Colorado-Made Magpul Furniture. I built this rifle simply to have another battle rifle in my safe for if and when the SHTF but have found that with the two others I already have I'm really in no need of a 3rd. The rifle itself has an aero-precision lower with PSA LPK installed as well as a mil-spec buffer tube and H stamped buffer. The Upper is a Del-Ton A3 chambered in 5.56 NATO with M4 stamped T-Rail as well as M4 feed ramps, 1/9 Twist, chrome lined BCG and Barrel and F-stamped front sight post. This rifle was built with quality and longevity in mind and will provide someone a badass looking rifle but more importantly a LONG-LASTING, FLAWLESS and badass looking rifle!! 

I have made several aesthetic upgrades to this gun which has set me back some major dollars but has made the rifle look absolutely magnificent. And these aftermarket parts/upgrades are: Tapco Intrafuse AR End Plate Sling Adaptor (replaces end plate and has been properly staked with castle nut), Magpul CTR Mil-Spec Carbine Stock, Magpul MOE Handguard,Magpul L5 MOE Rail Section,  Magpul MOE Pistol Grip, Magpul MS3 Sling with Magpul MSA MOE Sling Attachment, Magpul MBUS Rear Flip-Up Sight, Magpul Angled Fore Grip (ordered online and will receive in a couple days) and the optic on top of the rifle is a Vortex Strikefire red/green Dot Scope that I also have on another rifle of mine and I absolutely love it, it is even NV compatable and comes with a 2x magnifier!! I will also be trading WITH this gun: (3) Windowed Gen2 PMags, (2) Non-Windowed Gen2 PMags, (2) Swamp Fox 30-Round polymer Mags ( ALL MAGAZINES ARE NEW AND UN-USED ) and (250) Rounds of 62gr. Lake City Steel-Tip Penetrators. 

Please keep in mind that this is a BATTLE RIFLE and not constructed to be lightweight and is in all actuality fairly heavy in comparrison to some carbines. If interested please TEXT or call...... Aaron @ REDACTED

Cash is King in my situation as of late, but will accept trades of other FIREARMS only and partial trades accompanied with cash as well. Let me know what you have and I'll get back to you as soon as I can, asking $1800 cash..... NO BAD GUYS, FTF ONLY, I WILL NOT SHIP, I will also need to look at your valid Colorado drivers license before sale, NO bill of sale required!!! Aaron @ REDACTED"

This gun was purchased new in March 2013.  Since then I have put somewhere around 1000 flawless rounds through it (did not keep an exact count).  It has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  It does have an idiot scratch (my first 1911) and faint stain in the checkering on the housing.

Offering at $2400 which is a $500 savings over retail/pricing for a new Executive Target  either directly from Ed Brown or from gunbroker, gunsamerica or other online sellers (possibly more if you include potential costs for shipping, FFL, taxes).

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  
The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

All 3 pictures were just taken for this listing.

Please no lowballs, crazy offers, or offers to trade.  I am only listing to put some money into another toy, if there are no reasonable offers to purchase the other toy will wait.

The factory grip was replaced with a hogue rubber one to make it even more comfortable. Many conversions of these shotguns do not change out enough parts to be 922r compliant.

When I took this in it had already been transformed, many years ago, and needed to be cleaned & given a lot of TLC. I cleaned the barrel & trigger guard of any external corrosion and applied a very light (airbrushed) coat of paint (no time to reblue it). I also lightly sanded and applied polyurethane to protect the stock. The bolt was cleaned and oiled and I test shot the gun. Works like a charm! I do not really have a use for it so I am hoping someone else will decide to take this off of my hands and have fun with it.

dan wesson ECO 1911 excellent condition 
200 rounds or so flawless function
factory description: 
The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern.

If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed.

Our hinged quick-release mount also allows the user to quickly flip the goggle up out of his field of view or to detach for use as a hand-held binocular. Designed for use while walking or operating a vehicle, the BG1 presents the user a non-magnified 1-to-1 image with a wide field of view. F 1.4 lenses improve depth perception beyond that provided by standard night vision viewers. And a light sensor automatically cuts power to prevent burning out the intensifier tubes in the event of exposure to a potentially damaging light source.
Features:
• Use with head-mount, flip up or detach completely 
• Enhanced depth perception 
• Wide field-of-view 
• Bright-light protection circuit

From the Magpul website:

The EMAG (Export MAGazine) is a lightweight 30-round 5.56x45 NATO polymer magazine that features a number of aesthetic and functional changes from the PMAG®. While EMAG remains 100% compatible with the AR15/M16 platform, its unique geometry is optimized for foreign-made weapons such as the British SA-80 (L85A1/A2, L86A1/A2, L22A1, L98A1/A2), HK 416, M27 IAR, and others.

EMAG features the same pop-off Impact/Dust Cover as the PMAG GEN M2 to prevent dirt and debris intrusion and protect the feedlips from potential impact damage during transit and storage. When not in use, the Impact/Dust Cover can be stored on the magazine's floorplate to prevent possible loss.

For easy and accurate identification of loaded round count via the large, dual-sided MagLevel windows, the stainless steel magazine spring is coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color. Numerical indicators are added to the body to identify 5, 15, and 25 loaded rounds.

Sleek design with daylight-capable illumination, the Leupold VX-R patented 1 button design minimizes bulk, while allowing users to select between 8 intensity settings, including a low/high indicator. The readily available CR-2023 coin-cell battery produces remarkable run times, while the fiber optic light pipe eliminates the need for an eyepiece-based control module. Proprietary motion sensor automatically deactivates illumination after 5 minutes of inactivity, yet reactivates instantly as soon as any movement is detected. Leupold's legendary Index Matched Lens System combines with edge-blackened lead free lenses for astonishing clarity and light transmission, while the extreme fast-focus eyepiece ensures optimal diopter adjustment in the field. The 30mm main tube and finger-click adjustments assure maximum adjustment precision, while the second generation waterproofing resists the effects of thermal shock much more efficiently than standard nitrogen. Water proof, shockproof, and backed by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee, the Leupold VX-R is the next generation in sporting optics.

About 1 year old. Quite possibly the best carry gun made. Super thin and light. Low count, less then 100 rounds through the gun !!

 Done a few things to the gun to improve it. A Kel-Tec is meant to be ""finished"" by the owner for the most part. All modifications are easily reversible but I doubt you'd want to.

 **This gun shoots MUCH nicer than a stock factory gun.**

 - Fluff and Buffed. Gun has been broken down and deburred. Slide rails and feed ramp smoothed. Hammer surface smoothed

 - Trigger straightened, softened and shortened. Biggest complaint with this gun is the trigger shape from the factory can ""pinch"" larger fingers. 

 The shorter trigger is MUCH more controllable and softer to shoot. A stock replacement trigger is about 2 bucks from Kel-Tec.

 - Hogue grip installed and trimmed. Helps suck up the recoil and improve grip on this little beast.

 - +1 extended magazine bottom not only adds a round but vastly improves the gun grip.

 - Extra +1 magazine. Any defensive gun needs an extra mag. It also has the +1 extension

 - Sights and hammer painted orange. For some reason the white sights and my eyes did not play nicely. Orange is MUCH easier to see and get on target with. Orange hammer means it is much easier to stage the trigger (along with the shortened trigger) for fast accurate shots. Both are ""painted"" with orange nail polish. It's the type that doesn't need remover. Just ""peels"" off with a toothpick if you don't dig orange. You will though.

 - Shimmed rear site. Gun was accurate but this shooter always trended a touch low with it. You may be different. Shim is just a plastic spacer that you can remove if you shoot differently than I do. I'm no marksman.

 - Deburred the grip. Has some ridges on it from the factory that can hurt your hands after awhile. An hour with an emery board really smoothed things out.

 Also included:

 Kel-Tec plastic case

 Instruction booklets

 Face To Face Cash Sale and Buyer Need to Sign Bill of Sale.

In fact the PX-22's frame was made by American Arms, however the slide, barrel and magazine was made in Germany by ERMA. The pistols were assembled and then sold here in the US by American Arms. The factory magazines are stamped ""ERMA"" and the slide is also stamped Design by ERMA.

This pistol is used but in excellent condition and I would rate it's overall condition at 95%. It fires any .22LR ammo and uses a 7 round magazine. It is single or double action and has a hammer block mechanism making it safe to carry with a round in the chamber which gives it a total capacity of 8 rounds (7+1).

Bottom line is that the PX-22 is an Ultra Compact semi-auto pistol that would be perfect for concealed carry, nightstand or glovebox use. When loaded with the Interceptor or Stinger type ammo it would also pack a big punch for a very small package.

Pistol comes with it's original instruction manual, a brand new Bianchi belt clip holster (paid $25), brand new factory spare finger rest magazine (paid $50), and 200 rounds of ammo as pictured (paid $30).

Asking price for everything is $325. FTF only with pickup in the Valrico/Brandon area. You must be at least 21 and a Florida resident to purchase - no exceptions. A proper bill of sale will be provided."
