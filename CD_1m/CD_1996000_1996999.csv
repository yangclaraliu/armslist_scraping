In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Sig Sauer 9389BRGAMBI P938 Ambidextrous 9mm SAO 3"" 6+1 Blk Rubber Grip Blk

With the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic
advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the
best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with
full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger
pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger
gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911
will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in
familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and
right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available
separately. The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938
will be available in five configurations.
tem 90021 comes with the standard 6 round magazine and a 7 round extended
magazine.

Come get this CZ 75 P-07 .40 Caliber in the box with everything shown.

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

This firearm comes with two 22-round magazines; two stocks (standard and a 5-position collapsible stock); and 1000-rounds of Winchester M-22 40-grain black copper plated round nose ammo.  This is the hard to find ammo that is supposed to be made for these types of firearms.  The rifle also has a choice of four rear sight options that can be changed on the go but lock in to place. Firearm also has a rail system for the top for easy mounting of optics or whatever else makes it a little more fun to squeeze the trigger.  

This rifle was inspected by the factory on 04-10-2013 and is checked off as being fully operational.  The factory (ATI / GSG) replaced the trigger plates with metal ones, I don’t have a clue what this means, but I know there are no misfires.  This was done through Ahlman’s and I will provide proof of the service from both American Tactical Imports and Ahlman’s.  

I’m just moving on to the next firearm to try, and selling this to make money for that purchase.  I’m not desperate to sell this.    

If you would like it without the ammo the price is $400.  

I’ll need to see a PTP or PTC and a valid MN ID.

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

So, we are looking either to sell it outright or trade it for a single stack 9mm compact. For the majority of of trades there will have to be some cash added on your end (just looking at prices alone). We know she does not want a Kel-Tec so please no offers on those. I believe she is either interested in a Kahr CM9, a Ruger LC9, or other single stacks. This gun comes with the factory case, original receipt from bass pro, the extended mag and compact mag, the mag holster, the easy loader, the original holster, and the lock as well. It also cones with a conceal.carry in the pants leather holster that is form fitted for the gun. The holster alone cost 59.99. It will have everything it originally did when bought new that is. Also, depending on your cash or trade offer we might include some ammo if desired. Please no Lowball offers, these still sell for more than what we are asking in shops all around and on here. We arent trying to swindle anyone, just trying to not lose a bunch of money on it and hopefully getting someone a gun they need.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
This model is designed to provide physical indication if there is a bullet loaded in the chamber. The product is designed with a lever mounted on the top of the slide. The lever is marked as Indicator in red lettering. When a bullet is chambered it pushes the lever upward and out of position. The operator will visually see the lever as it is raised up. Also the operator will be able to feel the indicator as being out of its normal resting position as it will not be flush with the top of the slide, thus warning the operator that the firearm is loaded.
Enhanced Trigger
Kahr’s new enhanced trigger will be featured on Kahr models with external safeties and loaded chamber indicators. The enhanced trigger has a shorter length of pull compared to the Kahr standard trigger. The new enhanced trigger has a 1/4” length of pull with an approximate 7.5 lb. trigger pull weight compared to a 3/8” length of pull for the standard trigger. The trigger pull weight for the enhanced trigger is the same as the standard trigger, approximately 7.5 lb. 
External Safety
This model has, in addition to the internal safety, an external safety that will prevent the firearm from firing when the safety is in the safe position. The product has an external lever with two settings. When the lever is pushed completely up and the red dot is fully visible, the firearm is in the armed position and ready to fire with the pull of the trigger. When the lever is pushed down, and the red dot is hidden the firearm is in the safe position and will not function with the pull of the trigger. The safety works in the following manner. When the lever is in the down (Safe) position the connecting cam on"

 I bought it new from Topgun Supply a few months ago to get my wife into shooting. She has probably fired 300-400 rounds through it and it functions perfectly on my G29 frame with Remington Golden Bullets. I have tried a few CCI mini mags and they work great too. It does not like Federal .22LR and the instructions even say to avoid other brands than the Golden Bullets. 
 Selling because she has moved on to shooting 9mm now and is not using this anymore. It worked great for getting her comfortable shooting and she now shoots as good as I do at close range. 
 $300 with the extra magazines and I'll include a box of 225 Golden Bullets so you can shoot it right away. I might also be interested in trades but I don't have anything in particular I am looking for so let me know what you have. Worst that can happen is I tell you I am not interested.
 I am up in Woodland, WA but can meet in Vancouver on Saturdays or Tuesdays.
 I will get some images posted of it later this evening."

This is your chance to get a heck of a deal on the ultimate sniper kit. I have done all the legwork for you to put together the best sniper kit out there. To start with you have a Savage model 10 FCP 308. This rifle has only had 60 rounds through it 50 for barrel break in and 10 to sight in scope. It is set in a McMillan A5 free floating stock with a Harris bi-pod , padded cheek rest and accu-trigger. To help you hit what your aiming at I have mounted a Zeiss Conquest 6.5x20x50 with the rapid Z 1000 reticle. If you are not familiar with this reticle it is a bullet drop type reticle that is graduated from 100 to 1000 yards in the scope, all you have to know is the distance to your object, hold it on the correct line in the scope and press the 2.5lb trigger . Which brings us to the Leopold RX 1000i laser range finder. All the fancy scope doesn't help you if you don't know the distance so I have this range finder that works out to 1000 yards for super fast yardage measurements. Next to keep all this amazing  equipment safe I have a Plano Michael Waddell Bone Collector edition gun guard case. But the goodies don't stop there, you need ammo and rite now its like winning the lottery to find what you need, well I have to go with the package 500 rounds of Hornady 168 grain A- Max Match grade ammo. I also have 200 rounds of Hornady 168 grain TAP fpd, so you have 700 rounds to get you started. And last but not least I have a brand new Black hawk shooting mat. This mat also doubles as a carry bag and a drag bag. Like I said I have done all the work to put this together, everything is brand new and ready to be put to use. I have invested over 4500 dollars in all of this top of the line equipment and now I am looking at a new project and need to free up some cash. I am a certified Glock, Smith and Wesson, 1911 and AR 15 armor and gunsmith for a living so you can be sure this was all put together correctly. If interested I am asking 3500 for whole setup or I am willing to trade for a new LWRCI R.E.R.P. If you have any questions or need any additional pics don't hesitate to text or call and I will get back with you A.S.A.P. Thanks!  Mike 765-730-zerro......three..five6"

Gold Dot bullets were designed to meet stringent law enforcement standards for dependability and performance. They features Uni-Cor technology which firmly bonds the core to the jacket and virtually eliminates bullet failures. The hollow point is created after the jacket is built.

First off, I do not want to sell this gun. I have only had it for about 6 months and love shooting it. But, I also really want a nice 1911 right now and could use some extra cash so here it is. Its a Rock River Arms LAR-15. It has the .223 Wylde chamber for .223 or 5.56mm, RRA aluminum free float tube, 24 inch heavy match stainless steel barrel, light varmint gas block with sight rail, and a 2 stage trigger. The scope is not for sale, unless you want to throw in an additional $450. With this set up I can stack bullets out to 500 yards, the gun itself is accurate much further than that.
 If you have any questions please don't hesitate to PM me or call REDACTED. Let me know what you have. Thanks! I also have 320+ rounds of 55grain bullets, 3 30 round mags, and 2 5 round mags I will throw in for an extra $110."

Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the U.S. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide, on the civilian market, and has been featured in films and TV shows. The SPAS 12 was designed to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by pressing a button under the foregrip and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards until it clicks into position. The SPAS-12 has a magazine cut-off feature, which prevents loading a new round from the internal magazine when the gun is cycled. This allows the operator to load a specialized round into the chamber without firing the entire magazine first. The barrel of the SPAS 12 was externally threaded to accept a variety of attachments, from chokes to gas-grenade launchers. The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""combat"" designation. Franchi renamed the model the Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun in 1990, after the importation ban of 1989 (when it was called the Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). This allowed continued sales to the U.S. as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, exports to the U.S. ceased."

Nosler Ballistic Tip Hunting bullets have been trusted by hunters for nearly 25 years. They are precision made and individually inspected for the utmost quality which translates to incredible accuracy with every shot. The heavy jacket base prevents bullet deformation during firing and holds together at extreme velocities as well as a polycarbonate tip that resists deformation in the magazine and initiates expansion upon impact. The bullet's mid-section keeps it together at any velocity until impact, and a uniform, pure lead core eliminates possible imbalance and erratic flight caused by air pockets. Great for thin-skinned game like deer, antelope and sheep. This is not loaded ammunition."

AccuBond represents the most advanced bonded core bullet technology to date. Through a proprietary bonding process that eliminates voids in the bullet core, AccuBond marries Nosler's traditional copper-alloy jacket with its special lead-alloy core. The result is a bullet that flies true, penetrates deep, won't cause extensive barrel fouling, and will retain 60-70% of its weight. The polymer tip helps protect against deformation while initiating expansion upon impact. This is not loaded ammunition."

The BVL280 provides an incredible 280 lumens of light in momentary or constant-on mode. Both models have a sophisticated electronic power management system that delivers maximum output for up to 2 hours, then backs down the output to give you up to 24 hours of usable light from one set of batteries. It even reduces the power if it senses the light is overheating - amazing!
Both lights come with three color filters (red, green, and blue) to make the BVL highly adaptable to different illuminating tasks, plus rubber rings that you can slide over the body to serve as finger stops when employing the popular “syringe” grip technique.

Hornady XTP bullets were designed for hunting, self-defense, and law enforcement. One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities. 

Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition."

This was one of the limited Talo Edition EXO Glocks with the Nickel Boron Coating, meaning it is self lubricating and cleaning is as simple as wiping it off with with a paper towel.  It also comes with Trijicon HD Night Sights and TWO 15rd Magazines.  I've put 400 flawless rounds through it and it eats anything, including steel cased ammo.  It has a little wear here and there from normal use at the range.

I also have lots of accessories for it, mags, holsters, TLR-1s, etc.

Trades I would be interested in would be S&W M&P's, especially a VTAC Edition, AK-74's, 5.45 Ammo, FN 5.7 Pistol, AR-15's, Semi Auto Shotguns, anything tactical, try me!
