I Knew the battle pack was Non-corrosive but didn't realize they are Berdan primed so I also have set of RCBS reloading dies. I broke the de-priming pin the first shell I put in and then realized my dumb mistake but ill pick up a pack before sale so you can reload any new brass you would like.

High Standard marked Citation II
Serial Number: C201238
Year of Manufacture: 1995-1996 (?)
Caliber: .22 Long Rifle
Action Type: Single Action Semi-Automatic with Detachable Magazine
Markings: The flats on both sides of the barrel are marked “.22 LONG RIFLE” and both sides of the slide are marked “Mitchell / HIGH STANDARD”. The left side of the frame is marked “MITCHELL ARMS / CITATION II”. The right side of the frame is has a logo that looks like a “P” with an “i” followed by “MADE IN U.S.A. / FORT WORTH, TEXAS / C201238”.
Barrel Length: 5 ½” Unfluted Bull Barrel
Sights / Optics: The front sight is Patridge style blade screwed onto the barrel. The rear sight is serrated flat rear face square notch Target style adjustable for windage and elevation. The rear sight is mounted on a bridge attached to the frame, through which the slide travels without disturbing the rear sight. A silver colored Tasco ProPoint PDP3 is installed with Weaver style rings to a scope rail mounted to the barrel. The glass is clear, but NO battery is installed or provided. (A red dot did appear when we temporarily installed a CR2032.) It comes with scope covers to protect the lenses.
Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are checkered walnut with a thumbrest on the left grip panel. The grips have possibly damaged diamonds scattered randomly throughout, or they may have been manufactured that way. The grips rate in about Fine overall condition.
Type of Finish: Matte Stainless
Finish Originality: All Original
Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is great. There is no erosion in the bore.

Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 98% of its metal finish. There are light handling marks and that’s about it. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. The front and rear straps of the grip frame are stippled. Overall, this handgun rates in about Excellent condition. The action functions correctly. There are both adjustable trigger over-travel and trigger-pull weight screws. There are three tapped and filled holes beneath the barrel for the attachment of barrel weights. There is a recessed muzzle crown. We did not fire this handgun.
The factory box with an end label describing this pistol is provided. The box is marked “MITCHELL ARMS HIGH STANDARD” and has a Santa Ana, CA address among other things. The box is lightly scuffed but is in about Fine condition with its light green egg crate foam inside. There is an Owner’s Manual that is a little age darkened and frayed at the cover’s edges, with the interior pages in better condition. The manual is certainly in at least Very Good condition. Also provided is a “Mitchell Arms” marked magazine with a red floorplate and green follower. The magazine is in about Excellent used condition.
According to S. P. Fjestad’s “Blue Book of Gun Values”: “Mitchell Arms manufactured High Standard marked pistols during 1993-1994. Due to litigation, the High Standard logo was dropped in 1994, and High Standard nomenclature was dropped in 1996. . . Mitchell parts are interchangeable with original High Standard pistols.” This pistol has the same grip frame angle as a 1911 and will feel comfortable and familiar to anyone acquainted one. This appears to be a little used .22 target pistol that has been well maintained and properly stored. It comes with excellent iron sights and if those have started to get fuzzy on you, it already has a red dot optic mounted on it!

If you have a WI permit I'll give you a discount!,"WI, Wisconsin, United States",$ 125,"Listed On: Thursday, April 18, 2013",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Minnesota course requirements exceed Wisconsin course requirements which is why your Wisconsin permit is not recognized in Minnesota, but I can help you change that. By taking my class, you will be eligible to apply for your Minnesota permit to carry as a NON Resident. The best part is you do not have to drive to Minnesota to take my class!! I will travel throughout Wisconsin as long as I have at least 15* guaranteed students. (Student minimum will depend on location and availability of shoot range.)

If you have property that we can LEGALLY shoot on in Wisconsin please call me to discuss how you can take my class for free!!

I'm an instructor from Minnesota which means you can apply for a Minnesota and Florida permit, which will give you the most states that recognize your permit. (The shooting portion of the class is required in order to obtain a Minnesota permit). I have a unique approach to the class in which I am confident you will not experience anywhere else. The course will give you the information you need to safely handle and carry a firearm as well as understand the legal responsibilities that come with it. Please visit my site for additional information. 


Important factors one should consider when shopping for a class/instructor:

- Low cost does not mean high quality training.

- Do not go with the shortest class for your patience and availability.

- Distance is a small factor when it comes to taking an educational course. 
(So thats why I am willing to travel just about anywhere in WI & MN to teach.) 

- Call the instructor of the class you are considering and ask questions regarding what he/she offers in order to determine whether they will provide the information and necessities you are looking for in the class.

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers"

I have the .308 and the .338 Laupa Mangum conversion kits.  This is advertised as the most modular sniper rifle in the world.  You can purchase many different caliber conversion kits from DTA.  DTA also offers a .338 or 30 caliber titanium suppressor built specifically for this rifle.  It is a very accurate long range set up.  All I can say is do some research.  It also has a Trijicon 5x20x50 tactical mil-dot scope.  I will remove the scope and sell the package for $5000.00   I paid $1179 plus tax for the scope.  I am asking $6000 for the package with the scope and hard case which is an excellent deal.  I have over $7500 in this setup.  The .338 LM has only been shot about 10 times and the .308 conversion about 50 times.  All manufacture break-in procedures were followed, plus the rifle was cleaned after every shot. Every Shot.  That is the old-school way to break in a rifle properly.  Don't know if it is true because I have never not followed that break-in procedure on a new rifle.  It is a lot of money but if you look at building a high end custom rifle or a couple custom rifles it is not cheap.  I am not interested in any trades.  I have to liquidate so I need cash only.  This comes with .308 barrel, bolt and 2 clips, .338 barrel, bolt and two clips.  DTA tool kit and sling.  Please ask if you see something in the pictures but I think I have covered everything.

589,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1481589,For Sale:  AMMO RECALL WINCHESTER M855 62 GRAIN 5.56,"Minnesota, Minnesota, United States",$ 10,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 24, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Amid a national ammo shortage this is probably the last thing you want to hear. Winchester has issued a recall for some of their 5.56mm centerfire rifle ammo Feb. 4.

The Winchester 5.56mm M855 62 Grain Pene ammunition has the symbol number “ZGQ3308″ and the lot number “WCC10M106-004″.

The company stated in the recall notice that after an extensive evaluation they found that a single lot of Winchester 5.56mm M855 62 Grain Pene (penetrator) ammunition may contain incorrect propellant, an issue that if used may cause damage to the firearm or render it inoperable, or may cause injury to the shooter or bystanders.

The 5.56mm M855 is an economical brand that features a steel core and a green penetrating tip. Online a box typically costs $10.

The company asks that you do not use the 5.56 ammo from boxes marked with the symbol number “ZGQ3308″ and the lot number “WCC10M106-004″. Both identifying numbers are stamped on the outside of the 900-round shipping container, and on the outside of the 30-round box.

Winchester asks that if you do have a box of defective ammo to immediately discontinue using it and contact the company to exchange it at no cost to the consumer. You can contact Winchester at REDACTED and they’ll arrange for free UPS pick-up. As soon as the company receives the package, a replacement box will be shipped out.

The company can also be reached via snail mail. If you have questions relating to this issue write to Winchester at 600 Powder Mill Road, East Alton, IL 62024 with “Attn: 5.56mm M855 Recall” at the top, or visit the company’s website at www.winchester.com.

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers"

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers"

679,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1481679,For Trade:  Lee pro 1000 press plus many extras brand new!,"Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, April 18, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Where to start..

I have a lee pro 1000 progressive reloading press.. I bought it last month with hopes of reloading 9mm.. It was out of stock every where but I happened to find one in stock for 45 long colt.. So I ordered it for 45LC.  I then went about ordering all of the parts to turn it into 9mm..  I had to buy:

9mm shell plate
Lee small primer attachment
Lee 9 mm dies( I have the 4 die set with factory crimp die.. As well as an extra powder through sizing die)
I also had to order small pistol case feed tube kit.
Also have the case collator 

I also ordered a .380 shell plate but could not find dies for it..
digital grain scale to double check your work.
bullet puller
case tumbler and a full box of media
hornady lock n load powder drop(haven't even taken out of the box..)
Several hundred 9mm and .380 once fired brass
1.5 pounds of bullseye powder..
Digital calipers to check length

I'm sure I'm missing stuff here..  It's all brand new.  I set up the press but have not used it.  I am uncertain if I actually want to reload or not.

This set is so complete, all you have to do is buy the dies to change it over.. I already ordered all the parts to let it take small and large cases and primers.

I spent hundreds of dollars and countless hours scouring the Internet to find these things in stock as they are sold out everywhere..  All you need to reload 9 mm is primers and bullets as I have powder too.  The same goes for 45 LC.

For those that don't know.. A progressive press like this does all the actions required to reload with one pull of the press..:it automatically feeds the cases into the machine; it deprimes, sizes it; then it reprimes, flares it to accept the bullet, measures and adds the powder; you place the bullet on the case and it seats the bullet, crimps it then ejects the completed round..  It does all of this with ONE pull of the handle.  I have read that after you get the hang of it it is common place to reload 250-300 bullets per hour.

I am interested in trading my entire set up.. Basically everything you need to start reloading minus primers and bullets.. For firearms.  I am most interested in assault style rifles such as sks's ak's ar15's..  I'm also interested in pistols..  Make me am offer.  Cash can be added or subtracted both ends to make it all work."

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers"

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers"

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers."

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers"

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers"
