High grade walnut stock, adjustable cheek and butt, recoiless system The operating principle of the Beretta UGB25 Xcel semiautomatic gun with break-open barrel is based on short recoil, which keeps the internal parts of the gun clean even after prolonged use. The short recoil (and low barrel axis position) almost completely compensates for muzzle jump during firing, with quicker and easier realignment of the barrel on the target for the next shot. The low barrel axis position transmits the recoil forces in line with the shooterâs shoulder, thus minimizing felt recoil. The ergonomically rounded back of the light alloy receiver fits smoothly into the stock, allowing quick and instinctive target acquisition. The polished sides contrast pleasingly with the other matte anti-glare surfaces. The streamlined receiver and the newly designed fore-end with its extended checkered configuration combine to give the UGB25 Xcel an extremely attractive look. The cartridge carrier receives the second cartridge on the right-hand side of the receiver, making it immediately ready for use. It is chambered automatically through the feeding port after the first round in the cartridge chamber has been fired"

He does not even have one. His ad was already flagged and taken down but he has re posted it. Also he is not in Lake County like his ad states. He lives in Tinley Park which is cook county. Not sure why hes telling people he is in Lake county, when I asked him why he is telling people he is in lake county when I KNOW FOR A FACT HE IS IN COOK COUNTY, his reply was ""I don't know I must have gotten confused"" really dude? you got confused for a 2nd time? you are that jacked in the head that you don't know what county you live in? you are that jacked in the head that you are trying to sell a firearm that you do NOT EVEN HAVE?? GET A LIFE BRO! dude is a flake!!!!! i almost think he is seriously kinda retarded or something, not joking either i think he does not have all his marbles or something, or just gets off at playing little kid games on the internet. I have exchanged emails with him in the past, and the dude does not seem right at all. But ya any way hes got a ad up trading a 1911 Colt Lightweight Commander MKIV Series 80. Maybe he does have one but when i told him i would do the trade he then told me he didn't have it and that it was ""long gone"" then he offered to trade me a stainless colt instead.... Not sure what this guys deal is. I blocked his email, he kept sending me retarded emails Not the first time he has acted weird with me either. ps he calls him self jimmytwotimes, fitting name for this ass hat"

I bought this rifle off another guy here on ARMSLIST, and put a couple hundred rounds through it, I just have 2 AR's in .223 as well and don't really need a bolt gun that I need to reload differently for. Gun shoots great, if I were to keep it I would re-barrel down to something with a 1:7 twist to stabilize the 80 A-max. I tried them and they didn't stabilize. Very Fun Range gun I just have enough .223 rifles already and don't need another reloading project.

I will ship to an FFL, but price needs to be worth it. Money Talks but I will entertain trades

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

accuracy in a pistol its size.

ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

ATPIAL (AN/PEQ-15)
Advanced Target Pointer/Illuminator Aiming Laser

The Advanced Target Pointer/ Illuminator/ Aiming Light (ATPIAL) is Insight Technologiesâ latest entry into the combat laser module arena. Designed and built as the next generation weapon-mountable IR laser/ illuminator, it is the battlefield replacement for the venerable AN/PEQ-2A which has faithfully served US Military Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies for years. One of the key improvements in the ATPIAL is the addition of a co-aligned visible laser diode which increases functionality, allowing for use without night vision devices. The visible laser is co-aligned with the IR laser pointer, meaning a zero with one, insures the same zero with the other. This is extremely advantageous because you can positively zero or check your zero during the day using a simple boresight technique. The ATPIALâs increased functionality comes at almost half the weight and size of its predecessor. Due to the successful fielding of this unit to the US Military and Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, Insight has recently made this unit available to state, municipal, and local law enforcement agencies.
We have been truly impressed with the ATPIAL, Insight hit a home-run with this unit. And, we are very excited to offer the ATPIAL to our Law Enforcement customers. The exceptional functionality of this unit gives you everything you could want in a single compact package. Its design seats the unit low on the rail, and wraps around the Picatinny rail for a snag-resistant, low profile. This is accomplished by utilizing a recessed rail-grabber mount. Half of the mount is molded into the housing, which is a tiny frustration since it precludes the swapping out of the mount for a throw-lever system. The recessed controls are located on top of the housing for easy access in the field with gloves. The body housing is constructed of a high-density/ impact polymer and feels extremely robust. The material takes a lot of weight out of the unit, which is appreciated during long deployments. The ATPIAL also features a rear-facing battery compartment which allows the user to remove the battery (we all know not to store our high-end NV and laser equipment with batteries installed, right?) without removing the unit. A molded-in lanyard loop rounds out the back. Windage and Elevation are adjusted with tiny screws on the top and sides of the unit. Each adjustment produces a positive click. Overall, this is one of our favorite new laser units.

Product Description

Some people like sights, some want optics, and some want a featherweight rifle-the DPMS Panther A3 Lite 16 provides a platform to have all three. All you need to do is add your own optics, back up sights, or carry handle and you'll be ready to go. Every A3 Lite 16 is built with a forged, A3-style flattop receiver that makes the perfect platform for anything you want to attach. This 6 pound rifle has a 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum alloy upper with a forged 7075T6 aircraft aluminum alloy receiver; both are hard-coat anodized per Mil Spec and Teflon coated black. The rifle's trigger guard, magazine release button, and delta ring are all made of aluminum to keep weight down. The 16"", button-rifled, 4140 chrome-moly steel, light contour barrel is precision accurate with 6 grooves and a 1 in 9"" twist. A Pardus carbine stock, GlacierGuards, and an A2 birdcage flash hider complete the package."

GunsAmerica Supports Interstate Tax Bill - 20 Points to Protect 2nd Amendment Freedom
Hold your rotten tomatoes for a minute ok. There are important reasons why we need to level the playing field when it comes to internet sales, and gun sales in particular. I will primarily address guns. But beware that this isn't a ""soundbyte"" explanation. Our attention spans have grown so thin that anything longer than a Facebook status tends to fall on deaf ears, and lazy readers. If you care about the future of 2nd Amendment freedom, you should support a nationwide internet sales tax. It will force merchants to do some work collecting taxes for states in which they do not reside, but remember, these are internet merchants who have very little if any other overhead. We have organized 20 points, but they are not to be taken individually. However you can jump to the end if you have to check your Facebook.(Click Here to Read More)

It has approximatley 2rds through it. As was told by previous owner. It looks very clean inside and out and it appears to have very few rounds down range. Beautiful condition, comes with extra factory brushing and takedown tools. Does not have the original box or owners manual. I have talked to Zac at LAR about this gun. It was a custom build produced in April, 1995. The Mark V was produced from 1993 to 1999 and is one of the only 50aes built on the 1911 platform. It is lighter than a desert eagle and is one bad a piece of American firepower. Most Mark V's come with a V at the start of the serial number this particular one starts with the customers initials. They don't have any info on the build specs. But he did say the person who had it built must have knew someone at LAR to get it. You will not find a more awesome 1911 than this beast.
I am looking to trade for something really cool like maybe a SCAR. I know somebody out there got a sweet deal on one. I will entertain other sweet trade offers but I'm looking at $2900 cash or trade value. Thanks guys.

I had  this apart cleaned, lubricated and replaced the recoil and action springs (because they were 65 years old, not because there were problems).  This came to me as part of a multiple gun trade.

I have not shot this, but there is nothing that makes me think it won't shoot reliably and well,  Bore is clean and bright.
