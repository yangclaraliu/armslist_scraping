Selling because I've decided to go with a Shield 9mm instead mostly for ergo reasons.

I have installed a set of rubberized Powder River Xtreme Grips on it (like Talon Grips) to cut down on the aggressiveness of the stock grip. Can be easily removed if desired.

I've also slightly modified the grip in that there was a very sharp protrusion under where my shooting hand thumb would rest that bothered me, so I carefully dremel'd it down to make it smooth. Worked great and no visible marking. Only did it to the one side so if you shoot left handed that one is like stock.

When I bought this I also bought a rail mount Lasermax Laser for it. I paid $120 for it but if you buy it with the gun I'll sell to you for $60 for a total of $660.

Beretta 17 + 1 Round 9MM Pistol w/Picatinny Rail & Matte Black Finish 

The Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semi-automatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Beretta designed innovative locked breech with rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. 

The Beretta Px4 Storm Pistol in F versions are equipped with an ambidextrous safety lever positioned on the slide that disconnects the linkage between the trigger and the sear, allowing to decock the hammer (if cocked or if positioned on the half-cock position) with maximum safety, thanks to the rotation of the rear part of the firing pin. The safety may be engaged also with the hammer decocked and with slide open.

This is a 9mm shield barrel that can be used as either a backup Shield 9 barrel or can be dropped in the 40 Shield for immediate conversion to a 9mm Shield. You do not need to buy 9mm magazines the 40 S&W Shield mags will feed the 9mm cartridges flawlessly. I have put less than 300 rounds down this barrel through my 40 Shield without one singe failure to feed or eject. Many people don't know that this is possible with the 40 Shield. The barrel dimensions are 99.9% identical the only difference is the bore. No gun smithing required for this conversion and you won't be able to get the 9mm barrel from anywhere else anytime soon. I had this back order from S&W for months. If anything it would give you the option to save money at the range, carry an extra round per mag if using 9mm or essentially give you two calibers in one gun.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

The boat has a livewell and a dry storage area, also has foot controlled Minnkota trolling motor, with fairly new deep cycle battery. It has running lights, and a bilge pump. Boat has no corrosion whatsoever and doesnt leak a drop. It has an aluminum false floor with floatation foam underneath the floor and sides of the boat. The boat used to have carpet in it, that I removed for easy cleanup. There was also once a console in the boat, as it has been reconfiguerd to make an open floor plan. There is jb weld covering some holes in the interior of the false bottom, along with black plastic caps where they injected the floatation foam at the factory. There are no holes in the actual hull, supposedly never been in salt water, even though it would make an awesome inlet boat.Boat has clear title, in my name, with 3 more years on the registration. Motor has clear title in my name as well. There is no title on trailer.

All trades will be at my discretion and I can add cash if needed. Mainly interested in rifles and revolvers, no shotguns, unless tactical or .410, no single shots. Will also consider decent AR's, .223 ammo, or gun safes. I think my price value is fair, so no crazy prices on your end. Will do partial trades as well.

At 300 meters, 300 BLK has 16.7% more energy than 7.62x39mm. Max effective range, using M4 military standards for hit probability, is 440 meters for a 9 inch barrel, and 460 meters for a 16 inch barrel. 300 BLK from a 9 inch barrel has the same energy at the muzzle as a 14.5 inch barrel M4, and about 5% more energy at 440 meters - even though the barrel is much shorter.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.

DPMS lower parts kit with ALG QMS trigger
Located in Beebe 
Lower parts kits with ALG QMS trigger groups $80 each $5 shipping. Located in Beebe.

Included in this kit are either the ALG QMS Trigger, along with a DPMS Lower Receiver Parts Kit. Everything needed to complete your AR15 lower receiver (less the stock) is included.

The ALG Combat Trigger (ACT) and Quality Mil-Spec Trigger (QMS) are designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulator concerns are of primary importance. The pull of both the triggers is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, but with the removal of the grittiness.  QMS do not have pull weights lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5 lbs.


    The QMS is smoother thanks to honing of the sear surfaces while not removing material below the stock surface finish
    Sear geometry has remained unchanged on both triggers, ensuring reliability
    Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy
    Disconnetor is 1070 High Carbon steel properly austempered into the spring range of hardness
    Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications
    A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all types of ammunition
    Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered
    Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the lower receiver

Realistically, I'm not going to be building 4 AR's any time soon so I'm selling off 3.

These are basic black phosphate coated, Mil-spec AR BCG, complete.  No fancy coatings, just the same thing that's been working in AR's for almost 50 years.

Depending on what you're looking for I may be able to help you out on other AR parts as well; I have complete lowers, stripped lowers, 80% lowers, lower parks kits, Daniel Defense rails, Magpul UBR stocks, Magpul gen 2 back up sights, Magpul Pmags, etc.  

I can accept CC payments for these and ship if you're out of state, or would simply prefer that.  I use Google Checkout for this option, so you will need to add 3.5% to cover the fee.  Otherwise, anything other than FTF would require a USPS money order or a bank-cleared personal check.

This is just about the best rifle you can get do legally in New York now. It comes with two stocks, and the original one doesn't have a pistol grip or telescoping butt stock, so it isn't facing a ban.

It has two 10-round mags and one 5-round mag. It comes with both the wood stock, and the ATI black stock. The ATI stock is made for the Mini 14 5.56, so I took a dremel and widened the magazine well to accommodate the Mini 30 mags. This part of the stock could use some sanding but it works just find.

It has a mounted Accu-Strut for increased accuracy. It also has a 4x scope. The detachable flash suppressor has been declared illegal, so that part is not for sale. I also have 60 rounds of Winchester 7.62 that I save for zeroing, and about 160 rounds of Golden Tiger, maybe more, for range shooting. This rifle has zero issues with steel cased Soviet ammo, and Soviet ammo is cheap and plentiful.

Now the same Benelli M4 used by the U.S. Marine Corps can be your home defense shotgun of choice. When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a shotgun, they bought the M4 — the 12-gauge shotgun that functions the first time, every time. Its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operated (A.R.G.O.) system developed by Benelli engineers has dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber that operate directly against the bolt assembly.The M4 Tactical comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a fully adjustable ghost-ring rear sight and fixed-blade front sight and a black synthetic pistol-grip style stock. An optional standard stock is offered. With features and reliability that do it for the U.S. military, the Benelli M4 is an excellent choice for your own home defense plan."

Now the same Benelli M4 used by the U.S. Marine Corps can be your home defense shotgun of choice. When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a shotgun, they bought the M4 — the 12-gauge shotgun that functions the first time, every time. Its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operated (A.R.G.O.) system developed by Benelli engineers has dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber that operate directly against the bolt assembly.The M4 Tactical comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a fully adjustable ghost-ring rear sight and fixed-blade front sight and a black synthetic pistol-grip style stock. An optional standard stock is offered. With features and reliability that do it for the U.S. military, the Benelli M4 is an excellent choice for your own home defense plan."
