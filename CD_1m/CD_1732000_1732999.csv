Taking up space in my safe, too big to carry and not big enough for HD. Got this in a trade, its in good condition given the age of it. Comes with two cobray mags, 2 barrel extensions, no box or papers. Internal parts seems to be in good shape. Just as any other mac clone.
I HAVE NOT SHOT IT YET!! So besides what i just described i cant say much else about it. This is my last attempt to move it. And given the price its pretty cheap compared to the other cobrays on here.

Buyer must have valid OK license and or CC license. I have both, will make bill of sale.

He is a small business owner running his shop out of a garage. If you want the big fancy gun shop go to Gander. If you want a deal on a firearm go to J&J Sports.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Trigger System™ 

The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator 

The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.



Grip Safety 

All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly 

The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.



Secure Grip Texture 

The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.



Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case 

To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

Picked this up several years ago and wanted to save it for matches, but the car needs tires as well as a couple other unexpected things that came up so I gotta cut some ammo loose!

This stuff is match quality, non-corrosive brass cased, Boxer primed and ultra consistent. The ammo is as good or better (IMHO) than US National Match stuff but with a lighter 146 grain match bullet. , and with that going for over a buck a round, I figure this won't last long.
The case has five battle packs (200 rounds each in ten boxes) and as I said, this is the good stuff! Your match rifles will love it and it shoots great in STG58's, M14's, AR10's etc.

This is NOT the steel clad Portugese, berdan primed surplus or old berdan primed German stuff, nor is it corrosive like the S & B surplus.....and those are going for 70-80 cents a round. Heck...even the commercial huntng ammo is going for around a buck a pop nowadays, and if you have looked, you KNOW what sellers are getting for MATCH ammo!!
if you are going to spend the money, might as well get the best you can get, right?

I haven't seen any of this for sale for several years so if you need some really REALLY good, accurate .308 with a lighter projectile, this is some of the best you can get.

Hey! If you can't afford or don't need the whole case, I WILL open it up and sell the individual battle packs (200 rounds each) for $200.00 cash.

$900 cash takes the 1000 round case OR $200 cash per battle pack.

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed.No Trade, The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles."

N.I.B. (Unfired/Old Stock). This weapon is pristine! You will not find a new SCAR 16S better than this. It has been stored in a gunsafe with a dehumidifier and is in perfect condition. It comes with a 30 round magazine, flip-up sights, box, manual, rails, etc (listed below). It also comes with an ATN MK350 Guardian Night Vision Scope (also new), a tactical extendable bipod, and 500 rounds of Remington Law Enforcement 62 grain ETSP. You will not be disappointed. It is milspec all the way around, and definitely the ultimate pig-hunter. This is the semi-automatic version of one of the newest rifles used by U.S. Special Operations personnel as well as numerous law enforcement agency tactical teams. The 16S has a huge advantage over the 17, due to the availability and cost of .223/5.56 NATO vs the significantly more expensive and allusive .308/7.62 NATO. The value of this weapon is far better than a Colt 6920. It is gas-piston operated - a pricy upgrade for a regular AR-15 style assault rifle. It has four quad rails for accessory mounting (at 12, 3, 6, and 9). Additionally it has ambidextrous safety and magazine releases, as well as the ability to mount the charging handle on either side.

I have a Rossi/Taurus Circuit Judge 45 colt/.410 for sale. Double Action.

Its black with wood stock, adjustable sights, its 5 rounds (I have everything it came with owners manual, chokes, the tools etc. It does not come with a key lock but it has a hammer lock. There is a small screw in the base of the hammer you turn and it locks the gun. Its also got a base mount for a scope.

I have only fired it 1 time and that's 10 rounds of 45 colt. Shot pretty good at 50 yards.

Gun itself is around a year old but its spent all its life but maybe 10 minutes in a safe. Kept it oiled. Just never really cared for it after I bought it.

I understand you can buy new ones for $550 or so But I am asking $500 or best offer. Trade towards other firearms? or let me know what you have. I really do not want to put cash on top of the gun. 

Picture upon request or until I get them uploaded which will prob be sometime this weekend.

Thanks Dustin"

The buyer of this pistol must furnish me with a copy of their Ohio driver's license.  If the buyer wishes, we can complete the transaction at an FFL dealer down the road from me.

I am considering selling factory new Jack Carbine. Will not be bummed if I don't though after all it is the ""Jack of all trades."" For those of you that don't know the jack carbine is an AR15 manufactered by Bravo Company Manufacturing which is one of the top AR manufacturers in the business. BCM puts it together but its quality parts were chosen by the Famous Travis Haley who is a well known former marine and now CEO of magpul and founder of Haley Strategic. Bottom line is this is an awesome package with a top of the line AR15. Comes with everything you see in the pictures. Everything is sealed in the bags and the rifle still has all factory oil on it. I put it back in the plastic bag it came in I only took it out for pics.

You can read a review of this model here: GunBlast.com Review

The DT Sport proved to be one hundred percent reliable, as expected. The carbine fed, fired, and ejected every cartridge perfectly. Accuracy was excellent, especially considering the mil-spec trigger. I do much better work with a match trigger, such as the Alexander or Timney, but this carbine is built for fighting, and the trigger is well-suited to that task. The AR-15 is a wonderful concept, and Del-Ton executes it very well. The Del-Ton rifles are built very well, and just because the DT Sport is one of the most affordable AR-15 carbines available, does not mean that it sacrifices on quality. The DT Sport has everything that you need, and nothing that you don’t. It performs as well as rifles costing three times the price, and buying a basic rifle such as this leaves a lot more cash to purchase a good optic, plenty of extra magazines, and ammunition. You can’t have too much ammunition. The stuff keeps well, needs no refrigeration, and several thousand rounds will fit neatly under your bed. Buy it while you still can.

Product Details:
Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

I bought this around 6months ago as part of a 'new direction' but its sat in its box unfired since i bought it. 

It is the 887 nitromag tactical, so is covered / treated with remmington's Armorlokt technology to prevent rust / damage. I searched and handled dozens of shotguns before settling on this one, its definitely different!

It comes brand new in box with all paperwork, door breach style choke / muzzle, 2 fiber optic inserts (red & green). In addition i added a 'stock end' elastic shell holder and bought an offset flashlight mount for the front rail attachment.

Comes with a box of Hornady Zombie 00 buckshot, Rifled slugs and a box of Rio Royal Buck 00 buck.

I love this gun in principle, but i just don't (hence it still being BNIB) get to use it.

If my P7 m13 trades I will be keeping this.  I would prefer to trade or part trade for a P210, but will listen to offers.  I would consider a multi gun trade, but don't offer Taurus or other garbage.  Maybe a newer Desert Eagle .44 that functions perfectly.  I have an Hk P7 PSP to partial trade for a Sig P210 legend.  A target model would be the top of the list.  I've owned the P7 for about 8 years, it's in great shape and never failed me in any way.  It is one of the finest combat handguns ever made with a superb single action trigger.  The magazine release is a heel release.  I actually prefer this for CCW since there is no concern of the mag release button being hit and releasing the mag.  Comes with 2 mags and custom leather holster.  The P7 is one of the fastest weapons to reload due to the fact that the grip safety also releases the slide and cocks the weapon making it ready to fire.  The fixed polygonal rifled barrel lends to it's accuracy.  Some say the most accurate 9mm made.  The gas system allows for less recoil as well as assisting with the ejecting of brass due to ports in the chamber area.  The gas system also retards recoil for a fraction of a second so that the movement of recoil does not start until after the round has left the barrel.  The weapon will eject brass even if the extractor is damaged.  The gas system also prevents limp wrist issues.  One of the finest weapons ever!  I will always keep one in the collection (also have a P7m13).  I will consider a decent cash offer but don't waste my time with lowball offers please.   These are currently going for $1,200-$1,500.  The weapons is in my name so the purchaser must be legal to own and willing to complete a transfer form.  $1,200 or best offer.  Thanks"
