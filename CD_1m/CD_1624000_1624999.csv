Runs great and a really fun car! Has Flow master exhaust super 44's, new single wire alternator, new rear drum piece kit, BBK stabilizer bar, Serpentine belt, headlight wiring kit, headlights and turn signal kit, Cd player with two amps hooked up in the back seat. Kill switch in engine compartment for power to the vehicle for not so good areas of theft!! 4"" Cowl pull off hood! I even have a stock hood matching color for it as well... The only thing wrong is a minor oil leak: looks like valve cover gasket which I have a new ""CORK"" gasket for it... Breaks need to be bleed and maybe a new master cylinder for brakes! Nothing huge a good deal!! Body looks clean just a few minor set backs and the part on the windshield wiper area needs a dent pulled out from old owner that didn't latch hood. So it popped up. Great car and it is my daily driver. I am even selling with it an M4 Carbine with case and extra magazines with accessories!! This deal is a must see and need them both gone TODAY.... Investing for the future of my children.

I have a Springfield XDM 3.8 45 ACP that I would like to sell. I will also include a combat cut horse hide crossbreed super tuck with it. Plus, an extra 9 round flush magazine. Also includes an outside the wast band Tagua leather holster.

Comes with all the original things that in came with in the case of course, mags, holster ect.

I am looking to get 675 for everything, will sell just the gun and and the three mags for 625. Gun has less then 200 rounds through it, (Bought it about 7 months ago) and the holster was hardly ever used. Just looking to fund something else.

FTF only, Bucks County preferred, but will drive for the right deal.

Only trades I am interested in is an SR 1911, or a high cap shotgun (Over 6 rounds) so if you happen to have one and want to trade, let me know. Obviously some cash may have to be added on your end for these.

Freedom Munitions ""Like-New"" manufacturing process provides like-new ammo performance.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS inspects all cartridge cases for defects. The Scharch Range Master machines are fully automated and cases are checked for any debris and pressure tested for any splits or cracks. Primers are removed, flash holes are cleared, and primer pockets are reamed to accept new primers.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS then washes cases in an acid wash specially designed to remove all remaining burnt powder from the flash hole and interior of the case which tumbling doesn't remove. Then cases are tumbled in a dryer for a factory look and finish.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS roll sizes all cases on our own designed machines to meet S.A.A.M.I.specification. This method is the industry standard for commercial sizing, insuring the case wall is sized down to the rim which insures new component performance.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS then loads these processed components on the same fiber optic-controlled Ammo Load machines as our premium new ammo. These are the same machines used by some of the largest manufacturers in the industry. These machines assure S.A.A.M.I. specifications for priming depth, pressure and overall cartridge length.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS ""Like-New"" manufacturing process with the new projectile, powder and primer assures factory ammo performance that discriminating shooters expect."

347,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1624347,For Sale/Trade:  FN Five-seveN 5.7x28 Pistol & PS90 Bullpup 1650 Rounds,"Northlake, Charlotte, North Carolina","$ 4,350","Listed On: Wednesday, May 15, 2013",Handguns,FN Herstal S.A.                                                                                ,5.7x28mm,no type,no type,"Photo album here: http://imgur.com/a/hteI6

I really love these guns, but I've been considering getting away from the 5.7 and consolidating all my firearms into the same caliber. I'm not sold on it yet, but I'd like to see what else is out there... and I could always use cash. 

The PS90 is the Gen3 trigger pack, tri-rail edition. I topped it off with an EOTech XPS holo sight and it has a side rail installed on the right side (can be mounted either side I think) with a sig laser on it. I have 5 50-round mags (3 are FN and 2 are AR57 I think). I have the original box and warranty card that has not been filled out or submitted yet... I am not sure about a manual. That might be something you have to download. The PS90 is in flawless, like new condition. I'm asking $1,500 for rifle and the 5 mags and side rail. If you want the EOTech it'll be $400 (it's brand new and has box/paperwork). Sig laser is $50.

The FN FiveseveN pistol comes with 3 20-magazines, original hardcase, manual, lock, cleaning kit... everything from the factory. As you can see from the picture, it's the two-tone FDE version. It has some slight wear on the tall front site post from a holster, but nothing major. Internals look brand new and shows no signs of wear and tear. I would like to get $1,400

As you probably know with the 5.7x28 rounds, finding them is the first problem and then finding them at a reasonable price is the second. I have 1,688 total. I'm trying to sell it as a package so I'll sell it for less than $0.60 per round. So the ammo comes out to $1,000.

If you want the whole package it totals to $4,350

I'm willing to trade for other stuff that I might be interested in but I'm interested in losing money... cash or guns must be fairly valued. I tried to do that with my stuff here... the market is crazy right now I know... but I'm indefinitely giving a break on the ammo. Feel free to make trade offers or I can let you know a rough list of stuff I want from the top of my head.

Keep in mind everything is in great shape and I rather like them both. I'm just considering keeping to the more ""standard"" calibers.

As a bonus, if you are into reloading, I have 5.7 LEE dyes and between 100 and 200 rounds of brass for the 5.7x28"

I don't want to deal with the whole HazMat thing.

I have 19 pounds of this smokeless powder available.
The powder has been weighed out into one-pound (net) plastic bottles.

$5 is the per-pound price. You may purchase any quantity from 1 to 19 pounds at this price. I will relist with the new lower quantity if the buyer does not take the whole lot.

It was taken from pulled-down 1944-vintage Turkish light ball 8x57mm military rifle ammunition. It is a square flake powder, and is in good condition- showing no evidence of decay.

From what I've read online, burning rate is similar to IMR 3031 powder. This is not a canister-grade powder, and no loading data is available! You should only consider working with unknown powder like this if you are a very experienced and cautious handloader, and are willing to keep your loads light.

You must be a USA resident, age 18 or older, and otherwise legally able to purchase this powder.

This is the shotgun that every Saiga 12 WANTS to be but cannot. Only 1000 have been shipped into the country as of yet--but being an AK at heart, most aftermarket accessories are still interchangeable.

With its AK heritage, you can rest assured that you can drag it through hell and back as a daily excursion and it will keep on tickin'--you cannot kill this weapon. The Vepr 12 was also designed with an auto gas regulator (unlike its little brother, the Saiga) meaning that you can reliably feed ANY 2 3/4 or 3 inch shells you can find without manual adjustment from birdshot to buckshot, low to high brass. Unlike the Saiga, the Vepr 12 was based on the RPK instead of the standard AK, which means that the receiver has a hinged dust cover, a thicker receiver, and a polymer rail on top. Also included in the design is an auto-bolt hold open and a magwell which allows for AR-15 style magazine changes instead of rock and lock.

Instead of explaining every new intricacy, watch this great video by the Military Arms Channel on youtube to get an idea of all of its features.
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMfzN5LZc3o

I have added a Magpul rail to the lower handguard, as well as a vertical foregrip. Additionally, I have replaced the standard wooden stock with a sturdy clubfoot. The Vepr would come with two 10 round SGM magazines and 1 original Russian 5 round.

I've sent roughly 150 shells down the tube and I am QUITE fond of my deadly new toy. Please dont hesitate to send any questions that you may have--im sure that I didnt answer every question you might have in this ad. Im a gun enthusiast though and I am constantly buying/selling/trading so show me what you have in trade. Thanks for looking!"

This firearm comes with 3 magazines (6 round magazines), each magazine has the extended floor, the pistol also comes with the Crimson Trace LG431 laser sight, and the firearm will also come with a soft-sided gun case. If a person is to meet the price, I may also have an extra holster or two, but those will not be promised. The firearm does come with pocket holster however. Price is cash, but will consider a trade for a .45 ACP pistol in 1911 style...
*NOTE* I will sell ONLY in compliance with Federal and State law. If a person were to pick up locally (as in an Ohio resident) I will require a legal, unexpired government issued identification, and a copy of same for recordkeeping. A reciept will be issued for local buyers and with distance purchases, I will make a reciept out with the buyer's payment standing in as signature of as-is condition with NO WARRANTIES on my part... If the firearm is to be sold out-of-state, or if an out of state buyer attempts to purchase from me here in Toledo, the person will be on their own to furnish an FFL dealer to ship the firearm to (I will calculate shipping to add to price), or one around here that will complete the 4473 at the buyer's expense."
