FNH USA                      FNS-40    

The FNS 40 is the result of years of research incorporating the most
precise engineering and product development to bring the most
highly-advanced striker-fired pistol to the American law enforcement and
personal defense market. The FN FNS is a true double-action pistol with a
pivoting hinged trigger featuring an exceptionally crisp break and a short
travel to reset. The matte black polymer frame comes with four
interchangeable backstraps to customize grip fit and is designed with a
low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced control. The
fully-ambidextrous controls are shaped for easy access without snagging on
holsters or clothing. The contoured frame-mounted manual safety is ideally
placed for positive operation by either thumb. The FNS-40 offers a
hammer-forged stainless steel barrel. The slide features front and rear
cocking serrations and is topped with three-dot fixed combat sights with a
Deep-V rear sight that allows for better visibility of the front sight for
faster sight picture and target acquisition. The FN FNS also is equipped
with steel frame rails that can be easily replaced.

While doing research on which AR to purchase I came upon a thread in forums.officer.com entitled ‘So you want to buy an AR-15, huh?’ and from which I learned a great deal about the AR-15 platform.  This thread is still active and the author (a police officer in Texas) chose the very rifle I have for sale as his choice to take into harm’s way.  His analysis of the features, specifications and reliability led him to choose CMMG over other brands because it was as reliable, priced better, and carried excellent product support.
In my experience this rifle has been perfect.  Whatever I have loaded it with, whether factory or handloads, has ALWAYS fed, fired, and ejected without any issues.  The 1:7 twist barrel will stabilize any weight bullet I choose, from the standard 55 grain commercial load up to 80 grain hunting bullets.  In fact, the bullet weight is only limited by overall length of the cartridges fitting in the magazine.
The scope is set in front of the rear sight on a ½” offset riser to provide optimum co-witness with the iron sights. Dial it back to 1x and it behaves like a red dot optic, zoom it up for longer shots. The reticle allows range estimation using the dots, which are 1 mil center to center.  The scope has QD rings.
This rifle will do all you want and more.  I am offering at $1800."

The battle-proven P226 pistol platform has proven itself to be an uncompromising, combat-ready pistol, clearly demonstrating that when it counts, SIG SAUER is there. And, for the first time, the United States Navy has granted SIG SAUER permission to sell the new contract pistol, designated the MK25, to the general public. The commercially available MK25 is identical to the firearm SIG SAUER delivers under contract to the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC). Built to the Navy’s demanding standards, the MK25 comes chambered in 9mm, with a phosphate finish applied to all internal components, providing corrosion resistance in even the harshest of saltwater environments. The engraved gold anchor on the pistol’s slide hints at its military origin, while the UID code on the right side serves as a genuine badge of authenticity. The true mil-spec 1913 rail is machined into the hardcoat anodized alloy frame, providing a solid mounting point for lights, lasers and accessories. A reliable double-action/single-action trigger and two-piece polymer grips are included in the NSWC-specification package. SIGLITE® night sights, three magazines, and a card certifying authenticity come standard in the case. The only other way to obtain an authentic MK25 pistol would require a Naval enlistment and training with elite forces.

I'm not sure what it's issue is, but at it's worst the rifle will pinch and bend every round at an angle before it can even load it into chamber. At it's best it will run 10, maybe 15 rounds before doing that. It doesn't seem to want to feed the round into the chamber properly, and will also fail to eject the spent casings every 10 rounds or so. Also occasional FTF's.

The rifle was cheap, so I'm not looking to spend hundreds of dollars to get it tuned up. My buddy wants to sell it to me for $100, so if the repair is going to be hundreds more, I'll just say no thanks and we'll melt the damn thing down in my forge and turn it into some tools. So, if you have a reasonable estimate... feel free to reply to the ad. Thanks."

You've been reading in the news, you know the assault weapons ban has already been introduced.  Better buy now, because if it goes into effect as written this version of the venerable SIG556 will no longer be available!

I have only fired around 100 rounds through this rifle since I bought it new. This rifle features a factory collapsible folding stock, a flip-up rear sight, and I have also installed the Sig Sauer Red-Dot sight, which co-witnesses perfectly with the fixed sights. I also installed a Grip-Pod fore-grip that converts to a bi-pod with the push of a button. 

Everything you see in the photos goes with the rifle, including the SIG hard case, lock, and owner’s manual.

You can’t find any SIG 556s on the shelves right now, and if the ban passes there may not be any more available. Get it while you still can!

This rifle was commissioned by a friend of mine who is terminally ill. He managed to shoot it once, but didn't even get a box of twenty through it. He now wants it sold to pay medical bills. He is asking just his bare cost on this, which today is remarkable. 

Your work has been done for you. Virtually none of the items on this rifle are available anymore. I am the Armalite certified armorer who did this build, so can vouch for the work. What we have here is a new The build consists of the following items, none of which are currently available. This was built as a competition bench gun and will drive nails at 600 yards if your that good.

It is a friend of the families and was to have sat in a case in a closet for 40 some years. I took it to a gunsmith and he believes it is an original that has been refinished and a modification.  Under the trigger guard they have replaced a wire with a spring, I am not too familiar with the gun workings but apparently that is a modification.  The pictures I have are not showing the detail I would like, but I will do my best to describe it.  Across the top of the barrel there is this inscription, ""Patented Sept. 14, 1858"", then below that, ""E. Remington and Sons, (something I cant read) then, New York U.S.A"", then below that, ""New Model"".  The ""New Model"" is very hard to see.  The serial number is 101718 and is on the underside of the barrel.  The inspector stamps are D, R and M on the left side and W's on the right.  The cylinder marks are R and D.  There is also the serial number 101718 under the walnut stock.  There is also a worn inscription on the left walnut stock that I cannot make out.  I also took this gun to a gunshop and they too believe it is authentic.  Mechanically, the gun is in superb condition. I am guessing someone put some time into restoring it around the mid 1900's.  Due to the serial number, I am guessing this gun was manufactured around 1870.  Please do your due diligence regarding this gun and its authenticity.  I am selling it for a family friend and am in no way an expert in guns.  The information I provided is what what was told to me.  I am sorry about the poor picture quality.  Asking $1,500

I recieved a call from the gunsmith and the inscription on the left walnut stock is ""OWA"".  This was OW Ainsworth who was the final inspector for the Calvary model back then.  The civilian models did not have this stamp on the stock."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

Hi Power. Take a true classic to the range.
When it was introduced early in the 20th century, the Browning Hi Power 9mm pistol was a revelation. It offered the perfect balance of handling, size and firepower, with an impressive 13-round magazine capacity. Over the years, the Hi Power has aged gracefully and continues to have a loyal following among those “in the know.” Whether you are a novice or a seasoned shooter, you will appreciate the fine craftsmanship and function of these classic pistols, the sure heft of the machined steel frame and slide, and their natural pointability. Even with the double-column magazine, the grip is narrow to neatly accommodate nearly every hand size, and the single-action trigger provides a smooth, consistent pull. As reliable, accurate and easy to shoot as ever. Sure, there are many, many  other full-size 9mm pistols on the market that are made to meet many different requirements. But in the end, every true firearm enthusiast should have a Hi Power in their collection. Having and shooting the best just means something."

The barrel has a few rounds through it but it was on a different upper. Everything else is brand new.  I sighted it in with one magazine to 27 yards, 300 yards and 600 yards.  Tight groups.  With exception to the barrel, the gun has new parts.  Most of it is matching from Doublestar.

Cash price is $1300. I Have a stockpile of magazines and .223 ammo to sell too.

No trades except for gold or silver, but i will buy your ar parts.  Gun is in Mebane.
