It has had 30-40 rounds through the receiver and it has a brand new never fired 21"" Remington riffled barrel with riffle sights installed.  Also installed is a brand new (and brand new to Nordic) Nordic MXT +4 (Modular Extension Tube) modular meaning that Nordic sells multiple tube lengths, caps, and clamps for it so it will fit on any shotgun in the Remington line (1100, 1187, Versamax, 870, etc.), and a Blackhawk! single point ambidextrous receiver sling mount, and a high visibility/high performance magazine follower.  The MXT brings shell capacity to 7+1.  And, the 1100 has three sling points (stock, receiver, and barrel clamp) for maximum versatility.  

I just bought and installed the barrel ($250), Nordic extension ($80 and it came with a new mag spring which is also installed), Blackhawk! sling point ($30), and High Performance Mag Follower ($15).  So, you get $375 worth of brand new parts and an excellent condition fully functioning Remington 1100 for $400.

Also, when I installed the extension, sling point, and barrel I stripped her down, inspected, installed a new O-ring, and deep cleaned.  Hasn't been fired since (about two weeks).  It's ready for action as is.  

I'm also including the original Remington Magazine cap parts, as well as, another brand new magazine extension (Carlson's Magazine Extension worth $50) just in case you want a little shorter extension.

It was built by CAI for Pacific Arms Corporation. The magwell is cut for inch mags and will take either inch or metric. The red dot co-witnesses in the lower one third with the dot right on top of the blade. Look above the rear sight and dot is usable by itself in the middle. So if dot dies just use irons through the dot.

It has the following with it: (Prices that it would cost to buy these beside each)

-(5) Inch 20 Round mags (loaded with 100 rounds total of 168 grain HPBT Match Bullets) = $35 each mag on Numrich (still available) + $50 for ammo = $225
-a Light Tactical Rail Scope mount (More info here www.falltr.com = $70
-Burris Speed Dot 135 = $200 (A great 3 MOA small dot, highly rated red dot)
-Extra Receiver Cover Plain Steel - $15
-Bolt Buffer - $5
-Extra Metric Gas Rod - $10
-Bipod  Barrel Clamp Style- $35
-TAPCO SAW style handgrip that I added epoxy to to keep the safety lever from rotating farther than the Semi position. - $20

Gun shoots great and I get around 2 MOA with the red dot at 100 yards. (No the FAL is not a 1 MOA gun and will not be, It IS a great battle rifle that is very easy to take down clean and is adjustable for different ammo with the gas system adjustment.)

So with the gun at about $900 (Lowest Gunbroker price for Imbel/Metric ones SOLD in last couple of months go look it up) and Extras Worth about 2/3 of what is listed .66 x $580 = $382 TOTAL Value = $1282.00 

So sale price is $1200 or trade(s) and cash

I travel the state for work (sales and service job) and can probably get to your location in just a week or two depending on my work schedule. I go to NOVA, Richmond and Norfolk area at least 1-2 times a month. I am located in Roanoke and will meet anyone in Roanoke, Lynchburg or New River Valley Area anytime. If I drive to you somewhere outside of the Roanoke/Lynchburg/New River Valley area I will add $50 on for the gas.

$550 - 1040 rounds ( .53 per round)

If you scrounge around local stores and buy it 2-5 boxes at a time, the cheapest you will find steel is $6.99 plus tax per box. (about .38 per round).  $6.99 will be available once or twice a month, and if you are lucky enough to be there the morning they have it in stock, you can get 2-5 boxes. I occasionally see it in stores for 8.99-11.99 per box (.48-.64 per round), but again you will only be able to buy 2-5 boxes.   If you want to drive around and spend the time/gas, that is your choice (i.e. dont send me any ridiculous offers).  My ammo is meant for someone who knows what their time is really worth and just wants to buy it in one transaction."

The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection."

I had  this apart cleaned, lubricated and replaced the recoil and action springs (because they were 65 years old, not because there were problems).  This came to me as part of a multiple gun trade.  I have since had back surgery and my doctors are discouraging me from shooting higher recoil guns.

DETAILS:
The UTS-15 tactical shotgun is a 12 ga. pump action shotgun with two 7-round alternately feeding or selectable magazine tubes, that measuring 28.3” in overall length with a 20,5” barrel chambers for 2 3/4” and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation (sights and choke tube pictured not included).

I'm interested in trading for a Glock 26. Generation doesn't matter but I do prefer gen 4 and round count isn't a deal breaker. I want a 26 because the shield is the only pistol I own that isn't a Glock and I would like the commonality.
