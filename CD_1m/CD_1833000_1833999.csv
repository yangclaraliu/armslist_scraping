Hornady produces most of the brass for Hornady Custom pistol ammo. All other brass is chosen to ensure it meets our unusually high standards for reliable feeding, corrosion resistance, proper hardness and the ability to withstand maximum chamber pressures.

Powder
Each cartridge is loaded to ensure optimal pressure, velocity and consistency from lot to lot.

Primers
Like the powder, each primer is carefully matched to individual loads, and specifically selected for their ability to quickly, completely, and reliably ignite the powder charge."

This Nagant is partially matching (bolt, receiver, buttplate), with only the bottom of the magazine well being the non-matching part. The bore is as if it was never fired. I personally have put maybe 50 rounds though it. 

The rifle comes as pictured below with permanent double ear notched bayonet, post war stock (blonde in color), integral cleaning rod, dog collar sling, 76 rounds of Albanian surplus ammo (bought 20rd paper packs not a spam can hence my low round count), as well as 20 rounds of Hornaday Match ammo. My main reasoning for selling this rifle is that I have not shot it in probably 4 or 5 years. It was my 2nd rifle purchase and I have been considering moving it for a few years now.

Please feel free to email me with any offers. NC transactions will take place at a FFL of our agreement. Buyer will be responsible for transfer fee. SC have it much easier and will take place at a location of our agreement. SC FTF transactions will be documented.

Although CIA AK's aren't my favorite this one has been incredibly reliable for me and has never had a FTF or FTE. It functions flawlessly. As for the finish: it has two complete coats of primer of durable outdoor metal finish onto a prepped surface, followed by two coats of durable outdoor gold finish. I have experience with Duracoat and I much prefer this in both texture and appearance. The barrel on this rifle is also ready to be tapped if you'd like to add a suppressor or muzzle brake.

Since its inception as the standard US military primary issue rifle ammunition, the 5.56×45mm NATO round has run up against firm opposition from those[who?] who argue that the 30 caliber round provides the minimum, if not ideal, performance necessary for the modern battlefield soldier. While 5.56mm NATO has enjoyed widespread acceptance in military circles, the fluid nature of the missions that some special operations groups encounter often demand a round that not only provides better performance[1] than that available in the high energy standard velocity rounds but also one that can offer subsonic performance greater than the current standard 9mm submachine guns now in use"

Icon ARC Seventh Seal set:
Icon sent a few ARC jackets over to the other side. Some came back with a story of impending apocalypse forever seared onto their flesh. Never before has this level of evil been sublimated into a motorcycle jacket. Give yourself over to the infinite abyss and ride like hell!

Icon Regulator Vest:
Icon has a unique vision to recognize holes in the market where a product should exist, but doesn't. Its part of the reason we are here. The Regulator™ Vest is one of those profound products that creates its own dimension. At first glance, its apparent that this is no mere Fat Brother Bobs Cruiser vest. The Regulator is made of premium 1.4mm leather. It houses the same Field Armor™ Stryker CE back protector as the Field Armor™ Vest. This back armor is removable; doing so reveals a large back panel- perfect access for attaching a club patch, or whatever you can think up. Also featured are two cross-draw pistol pockets up front. Now you can retrieve your smokes confidently, without resorting to the infamous chicken-wing arm technique. The Regulator Vest is sized to rock over your jacket, or just use the side fit adjustment straps to wear it alone."

Aimpoint Micro H-1 (2 MOA) Red Dot On Sale!!! Price everywhere online: $606.99. My price: $569.99 + tax.

The Aimpoint Micro H-1 (2 MOA) Red Dot Sight is an impressive addition to anyone’s arsenal; it is extremely light, yet still retains the durability and practicality of any sight bearing the Aimpoint brand. Weighing only 3.7 oz (and that with the mount included), the Aimpoint Micro H-1 is extremely handy for long hours of hunting and other operations. The weight added to your weapon is so negligible that you won’t feel any difference in performance and endurance when you’re out and about.

You don’t need to worry about saving battery and constantly switching off your sight. The Aimpoint Micro H-1 lasts for up to five years continuously working. This means it is always ready to use and doesn’t hassle the operator with switching it on and off. It uses 4 minutes of angle for increased accuracy. You can choose between 13 different settings from broad daylight to twilight low-light conditions, making it ideal for long hunting hours early in the morning up late in the evening.

It includes a 1X parallax free optic lens and the mount absorbs all the recoil of the weapon. It can be extremely easily attached to your typical Piccatiny rail. So, clip on your own little Aimpoint Micro H-1 and get out there!
Here a rundown of all the benefits an operator using Aimpoint Micro H-1 will enjoy:

Very light and small, weighing only 3.7 oz. Your weapon will stay as light as the manufacturer intended it to be, increasing your performance with better sight at no cost.
Increased flexibility, vision and performance.
Easily integrated onto any Piccatiny rail.
Has 13 different brightness setting covering your needs from dawn till dusk.
Comes in black color.
Absorbs recoil through its patent pending mount.
Has a mechanical switch increasing reliability and operating speed.
Better aim and confidence.
Operates continuously for five whole years without a change of battery thanks to superior ACET technology.
Submersible to up to 15 feet below water without damage to the sight.
Will withstand any weather condition, no matter how harsh.
No hazardous materials used.
Operates with a 2 minute of angle setting."

Travis Strahan began accurizing firearms for the United States Army in 1956. He is one of the finest armorers to have worked at the US Army AMU. Travis has provided competition pistols to champions Hershel Anderson, Bonnie Harmon, B.J. Hile, R. D. Whitacre, and M. D. Black. All of these shooters are distinguished champions and hold records still unbeaten today. Anyone having the privilege of owning and shooting one of Travis’s accurized firearms knows that they have experienced the best.

It comes with 3 LE hi cap mags with it. I also have 6 brand new, gen 4 hi caps mags that still have the stickers on them. There is a brand new G&G RH pancake holster and I will add 25 rounds of Winchester 155gr Silvertip JHP's. Now, it was a duty weapon and has a lot of slide wear plus it is stamped with the department on the slide, and they kept the box.  Cosmetically it isn't pristine, but it functions flawlessly.
I am firm on the price, not interested in trades at this time. If you just want the handgun and 3 mags I will sell it for 550.00. Thanks for looking."

Rifle wont last as these are back ordered for over a year. Fastest contact is text at REDACTED. Don't waste my time with low ball offers. Those that can't legally purchase need not contact. Valid Kansas CCH prefered, as I also hold one. Thank you

Flag |  Edit | Favorite I have a 1987 Porsche 944 in good condition. Engine has just been completely rebuilt has less then 600 miles on it. Brand new tires with less then 600 miles on them. Wheels have each been hand sanded painted (on both sides) and clear coated. Center Caps are all there and in great shape. Interior is in 8/10 shape. I have two brand new seat covers over the front seats. The rear seats are in great condition, no tears they are basically in brand new shape. Dash has a cover on it. Has a newer Alpine radio in it. New sway bar bushing were just put on. Will be putting new exhaust hangers when they get here just ordered them yesterday (I wont be installing Worths Exhaust in Huntsville will) Convertible top is in great shape. Passenger side window button needs to be replaced. Exhaust is in great shape. It is a NO RUST car! Emergency brake sensor I have replaced twice and the dang thing never stays fixed so I quit replacing it. Has nothing to do with the performance of the car just a light on the dash. Other then that nothing mechanical and is one heck of a driver. Im looking to sell or partial trades with cash. If its a fair enough trade the cash can be minimum but not looking to be robbed on it. Thanks for looking and send me an email I can send some pictures of it. Will be putting some new ones up this week.
