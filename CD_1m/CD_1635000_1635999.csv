The Rifle:

Both upper and lower receivers, barrel and bolt carrier group are all BCM.

The barrel is a 14.5"" hammer forged chrome lined barrel. The BCG (Bolt Carrier Group) is is a full-auto size bolt and is HPT (High Pressure Tested) and MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) tested.

It has a Spikes Tactical buffer and Tubbs Flat Spring to help with recoil. 

It has a Magpul MIAD grip and CTR Stock. Magpul XTM rail covers ride on a Midwest Industries Free Floated Continuous rail. The vertical fore grip is a TangoDown.

It also has a KNS Precision Anti-Rotation Pins installed on it to keep the hammer and trigger pins from vibrating and backing out on you.

Optics & Light:

The primary optics is a Aimpoint Patrol Rifle Optic (brand new, only 1 month old) Red Dot Sight. It has night vision mode and will run for 3 years straight off of one battery on setting 7. Battery life is amazing on this thing!

For backup sights, the front sight is a standard A2 sight post with a tritium night sight inserted. The rear sight is a flip-up Troy BattleSight with tritium inserts. Great for using at night without the red dot. With the red dot on, the front post glows green on lower 1/3rd of aimpoint sight.

The weaponlight is a PentagonLight Xenon light with pressure switch. This light was used in Iraq on the battlefield, so it has a few scratches, but also tons of history. I think the switch needs some wiring work done.

Accessories it comes with:

It comes with an OD Green Voodoo Tactical Range Bag that carries 2 rifles.

It comes with 18 magazines, 5 are factory BCM metal magazines with Magpul non-tilt followers, 13 magazines are Magpul PMAG's with 4 being OD Green (I thought I wanted to switch over to OD Green furniture, so I bought 4 in OD Green.) and 9 being black.

---------------

This gun is fully mil-spec and is a total bad ass. It has never had a failure to feed, eject or fire. I have put 300 rounds through it (10 magazines full) and it ran flawlessly."

TAVOR SAR Flattop 16.5"" Barrel FDE Finish

At the end of the 1982 Israel-Lebanon War arose an understanding that the modern battlefield had changed. One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close-quarters engagements – and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission. Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Able to accept standard AK-47 magazines;

NO Ohio Ordnance receivers.
No Tapco magazines.
No canting to sights or gas system.

Price can be negotiable but we all know that a decent AK can still be had for around $600 and a good one for $700.  I'm willing to pay more if you have several quality magazines, a sling, or other accessories that command a higher price, but let's be fair.  I won't pay $1,000 for an AK-47 just like I wouldn't expect you to pay $1400 for my AR-15 or $700 for my Glock.  If you have ammo, quality mags, a sling, rail, spare parts, etc. then of course I am willing to pay more; it just has to be justified; I'm on a budget (like everyone else these days).  I'd also be interested in any Golden Tiger ammo.

I purchased this pistol from my local gun shop in late 2011.   I had them professionally install a set of Heinie Slant Pro - Straight Eight Night Sights.    The Nickel Boron coating was done as part of an exclusive run of pistols done by Talo Distribution.  The coating was done by the good folks at Fail Zero, which are now working with WMD Guns.  This coating does not void the factory warranty as it was part of a distributor exclusive.

I put roughly 500 rounds of Dynamit Nobel 124 gr NATO spec 9mm through this pistol.  I have not modified or removed any of the internal parts, everything except the night sights are factory OEM parts.

I used this radio maybe once or twice then I was given a different radio, but it is still almost brand new. The only wear on the radio is a slight patch of gunk on the bottom where some mounting tape was located. Included in the deal is the radio, microphone, power cable with brand new fuse, double ended coax harness for dual antennas, dual antenna ""mirror mounts"", two 4' fiberglass whip antennas, radio mounting hardware still in bags, and manuals. Like I said, just about everything you need to outfit your rig. Anyone who goes off roading or 4-wheeling out where cell phone reception is limited knows the benefits of having a good CB to communicate with your buddies. This is a middle of the road set up that will serve you well for many years. If you have any questions about this particular radio, or the accessories please feel free to send me an email with questions."

The cool thing about it is someone put a sticker on it from 1955 Post Sugar Crisp cereal giveaway. For 2 box tops and .25c you could have your choice of team stickers. The sticker is made from cotton not paper and that's why it has lasted this long. The team is the 'Milwaukee Braves' and they were a team from 1953-1967 and the star of the team was Hank Aaron who started his career with them in 1954. The sticker promotion is thought to be the 1st ever team endorsement/cereal box offer ever. I challenge you to find 1 of these stickers for sale somewhere. They are very rare and the combination of the 2 items makes for a really cool conversation piece/ paper weight. It's a cross between World War 2 and Major League Baseball. The anti tank round is inert(not explosive) and is about 8"" tall and 3"" round and is commonly referred to as a '6 pounder'.

I shot approximately 30 rounds through it one time.  I cleaned it so it would not rust and it has been taking up space in the safe.  I have one unopened 440 round tin of rounds and approximately 400 or so rounds still in paper, just not in the second tin which was discarded.

The barrel has deep grooves and all parts match the import scrolled number.  The bluing is in great shape for a rifle manufactured in 1942.  The stock has a couple blemishes that can be seen in the pictures.  I do not have any extra items such as a sling or oil can, etc.

This is a fair price and not a rip off.  

I figure $100.00 for the rifle... good deal.
$100.00 for sealed box of 440 rounds.
$75.00 for almost full box of 400 or so rounds.

The partial ammo that was taken out of the second sealed can has been stored in a G.I. box as seen in picture.  The G.I. can is not part of the deal.  I will transfer the rounds to a card board box.

The only trade I would be interested in would be a nice rolling tool box.  

I will accept cash only in twenty, ten, five, or one dollar bills.  No big ones.  

A bill of sale will be required and I will need to see an Indiana i.d. AND an Indiana carry permit.  Sorry, no permit, no sale.  I no it is not required by law, but is what I require for a clean conscious.  

I will not not sell to a ""prohibited"" person.  This means I will not sell to a person who has been convicted of a felony, or domestic battery, or has a restraining order, drug abuser and/or on medicine for psychiatric purposes, illegal alien, etc.  

I am not really interested in traveling since fuel cost so much.  If you want to meet other than in Greenfield, it will cost 30 cents a mile not to exceed twenty miles from the Greenfield Walmart parking lot."

The metal is in great shape and is stamped with matching serial numbers. It is a wartime manufacture in 1943 at the arsenal in Izhevsk. Bolt is smooth and fires very accurately. I have taken very good care of this rifle. It has been my baby. Kept VERY clean. I will include 680rds of ammo with the sale of this rifle. Ammo is continuously sold out online. 240 rds are in the brown paper pouches of 20rds. The remaining 440 are still sealed in a spam can. Rifle can be seen on 18th May at the Springfield Gun Show. I will be walking around with it. I check my email daily. Contact me with any questions or requests to see it. Thanks for looking!

Not looking for top of the line, obviously.  Just want a working mans gun to shoot some trap.  I could possibly go a little higher if you want to barter a gun or ammo trade.  I have a couple of old colecter pieces (.22 revolvers) and a short pistol grip 12g. w/camo finish.
S&W model 1, 2nd issue.
H&R Victoer .22 short, D/S action pocket gun.
And I'll trade my ammo at normal store prices, not some a-hole trying to rip poeple off prices.  I'm all about the fair deal, you be too.

Local pick-up around Harrisburg PA, or I can ship it USPS for a few bucks and take Paypal (gift or +$1.50 to cover fees) to get them shipped to your door.

From Bravo Company Machining's Site: 

BCMGUNFIGHTER™ (VLTOR Patent Pending) Charging Handle and extended latches feature internal redesigns to direct the force off of the roll pin and into the body of the charging handle during support hand only manipulations. This new design has a built in backstop engineered into the extended latch and into the charging handle. As the latch is opened up, its’ travel is limited by these flat surface backstops. With this travel limiting feature, the stress is taken off the roll pin, and is now redirected into the entire body of the charging handle. 
The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle offers two significant advantages. 
1. Since the tiny roll pin is no longer the weak point - it is a much stronger system and tactical latch will stay intact even under repeated support side only manipulation. 
2. With the force kept inside the body of the handle, when the handle is pulled directly to the rear, it moves directly to the rear and does not angle off to the outboard side. A much smoother operation.

Will consider trades toward 20rd Mags.  Thanks!"

Like new dry storage box that can be used for ammo, guns, pistols, cameras, lens, or anything else that needs to be protected from shock and water! These are tough cases and mine still has the foam intact so you can customize it to specific items such as camera lens, etc... or leave the foam intact. See below for product details. These are for sale on the internet for $99.99 new not counting shipping. It is a great case and I don't have to sell. I just have four of them and only regularly use three. These are of the same if not better quality than Pelican boxes. I have two Pelican pistol cases and I like them both.

Starlight 7x14x14 Case is perfect for storage, shipping and protection tactical equipment.

 I recently bought a group of guns and trying to thin the herd some. Just looking to get back what I have in it. Asking $300.  The serial # has this gun being manufactured in 1964.  Gun has factory sights and has been tapped for a scope mount also.  

This gun has been used and shows it, but still a very solid gun.

I am pretty busy right now, so prefer not to travel very far to make a deal.

Thanks!"

Century is pleased to be the new importer for the Grand Power line of pistols! These awesome handguns are jam-packed with all the features you need and want in a modern handgun. Grand Power pistols are all made on 4140 steel reinforced polymer frames with a significant design emphasis on ergonomics and ease of function. Each pistol has an integral Picatinny rail in the frame and comes with four interchangeable backstraps, so it is like having a handgun that is custom made for you! Attention southpaws! Each pistol is fully ambidextrous, the slide lock, mag. release and safety are fully functional on both sides of the frame - right out of the box - no modifications required!

All of the barrels are high quality stainless steel and use a patented rotating lock, rather than tilting, during cycling for super smooth work at the range. The trigger has a very short reset, so accurate and fast follow-up shots are a breeze. The slide and the steel reinforcing in the frame is finished by nitrocarburizing. This creates a deep, matte non-reflective finish that is actually as hard as tool steel, for unsurpassed ruggedness.

Used by the Slovakia military, where there is no shortage of quality locally made sidearms from the former Czechoslovakia - Grand Power pistols were put through, and passed with flying colors, incredible torture tests that other internationally famous brands failed miserably. Such as 100,000 rounds without any changes in critical dimensions. 20,000 consecutive rounds without any feeding failures. And a silicone dust, wind chamber test (think desert sandstorm) that ground the competition to a halt - literally.

Attractive, tough, comfortable to use and light weight to carry, Grand Power makes a pistol that you will be proud to own for years to come. Whether it's the full size K100 Mk7, the compact P1 MK7, or the sub compact P11 MK7, Grand Power makes a pistol that's just right for you!

The P1 Mk7 is a shorter, compact version of the K100 using the same Mk7 frame and also made in the Slovak Republic by Grand Power. The P1 has a shorter slide and barrel making it the perfect choice for concealed carry. Like its full size brother, the P1 also comes with four easily interchangeable grip backstraps that ensure a comfortable ergonomic grip for almost any user!

Comes with two 16 rd. mags. and plastic case. Barrel: 3.66"", Overall: 7.38"", Weight: 1.71 lbs. Comes with a 1 year manufacturer's warranty! Condition: New.

902,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1635902,"For Sale/Trade:  Entire collection of target, game, and personal protection 12 gauge rounds","North lakeland, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, May 23, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale or trade:  I have 550 rounds of 12 gauge (300 rounds federal and 25 rounds winchester 8 shot, 100 rounds federal 7.5 shot, 110 rounds winchester PDX1 defender personal protection rounds, and 15 rounds winchester super x 00 buck) all of which are 2 3/4.  

the winchester pdx1 is an amazing self defense round designed for one thing: Making sure the target you shoot at ceases to move. The slug in this round, just like any other foster slug, will cause an amazing wound cavity and catastrophic damage through as many layers iof denim and bone as any person would ever posses; the buckshot following the slug not only ensures everything around the target area is also severely damaged, but it also offers better coverage just in case of inaccuracy or duress while aiming. This was one of the first rounds besides buckshot to disappear when the scare started, and for the most part is has been very hard to find.
___________________________________________________________________

  The birdshot offered is FEDERAL 8 shot, and besides being an outstanding field game and target load, it is arguably the BEST shell one would use to make wax slugs, which are some amazing, proven slugs for home defense, hunting , or just blowing things apart cheaply. at this rate, after buying the crayons to melt down, you can have some premium wax slugs for about 40 cents per round!

  The 7.5 shot is excellent for the same purpose but is also a much more effective round for clay shooting.
