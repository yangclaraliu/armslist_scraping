My truck just ate its CTM,so need to pay the repair bill, I will lower the price to 550.00 for this week only, otherwise its going on the online auction site.
Today I am listing for sale a brand new,never fired ,completly decked out Mossberg 715T (flat top with optics) 22 carbine for sale.
I bought this with the intension of having my daughter join me at the range ,she initially expressed some interest but seems to have lost it.
She liked my AR,and wanted something similar ,so I bought this and built it up to resemble mine.

What I have here-

Mossberg 715T flat top with 1X Barska optical........................................399.99
I took off the Barska and added the following-
JJAS ,  Trijicon Acog replica 4X illuminate scope. with Doctor optic,cover and quick mount.................................................................................................139.99
Rail mounted Vertical, Tacticle for=grip with integrated adjustable-
Bipod (built with sturdy aluminum adjustable legd,not cheap plastic legs,and 1"" tactical flashlight................................................................................................89.99
Rail mounted  adjustable red dot lazer site...............................................39.99
Brand new second  30 round magazine( 2 ) total......................................59.99
Brand new Camo Tactical camo soft guncase with mag pockets.................39.99
Everything was bought brand new  for this build.

The original barska optic is also included,new in the box.

Over 769.00 invested in this,I know its alot of money for a 22 but itwas fun and I know I went overboard.
If you want a badazz 22 black rifle for you or one of your kids,I am willing to let this go for 550.00

This is much cheaper to shoot than a 223 ,and much easier on the shoulder for those little ones wanting to shoot.

Just testing the waters out there,to see if anyone is interested in a built up  715T.
If not, Im ok with keeping it,it definetly is a very nice  rifle.
Interested, or Any questions, please do  feel free to Email or call me.

Much has been written about the benefits of PCCs [ pistol caliber carbines ]. Here is a quick summary of why the PCC excels for close contact fighting indoors, and why in my opinion, it's the best overall weapon for home defense:

    Muzzle blast - Whether you stick with the stock configuration of a
16 inch barrel, or shorten the barrel length after getting your SBR
approval (which you should do if your state allows that), the muzzle
blast from a PCC just doesn’t compare to a rifle/shotgun.  ""Tame"" is
an understatement.  I'll trade the devastation of a shotgun blast for
retaining my  night vision in the fight.

    Noise - It's inconvenient to lose your hearing during a fight.
Firing a rifle/shotgun indoors is something best avoided if you can
help it.  If your hearing isn't important, so be it...but the ability
for you and your family to hear and communicate over the roar of
shotgun fire might come in handy.  If you don't have the opportunity
to compare the sound of shotgun/rifle/PCC/pistols indoors, shoot them
side-by-side outdoors.  It's not at all the same but it will give you
some idea.  In class I've found that PCCs seem tame even next to
suppressed AKs.

    Ease of use - In my opinion, a PCC is easier to shoot than any
other platform, pistols included.  This is especially true for other
family members.  The Storm in particular is a very light weapon.  It's
handy and compact, soft shooting and very gentle to handle.  As much
as I appreciate the therapeutic properties of the rough edges of an
AK, not everyone in my family does.  Easier on the hands and body is a
shooting and fighting benefit for most people.  I would not hand my
mom a Remington 870 if I could help it.  But a Berretta Storm?  You
bet.  I'd give it to her, get a beer, and watch the fun.

    Recoil - Virtually non-existent when compared to shotguns and many
rifles.  Easier to get multiple rounds on target.  Low recoil also
helps with...

    Accuracy - The low recoil in conjunction with the additional
points of contact on the stock make the PCC a very accurate platform.
In terms of accuracy, anything you can do with a pistol, you can do
easier with a PCC.  The strength of the pistol is its small size and
concealability, which is not an issue with a bedside gun.  Accuracy
indoors is also easier than a rifle in my opinion, given the points
mentioned above.

    Fun - This is a serious consideration in my opinion.  Something
that's fun to shoot will get more training time, and more training
time equals more proficiency.  Maybe you prefer shooting a 12 gauge
870 to a PCC...but does your wife?  Your kids?"

Give your fine firearms the same protection while traveling that the military and professional photographers rely on to keep their valuable gear clean, dry and safe. Certified with NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), these cases meet the standards of both the United States and European military forces. To meet the necessary criteria, the cases are subjected to an extensive battery of standardized endurance and quality tests designed to simulate extreme situations. Pelican’s innovative open-cell core and solid-wall construction absorbs shock and bumps, so your guns and optics won’t. Each case has an Automatic Purge Valve with a GORE-TEX® membrane that releases air pressure but keeps moisture out. A waterproof neoprene O-ring seal and a tongue-and-groove fit keeps moisture from penetrating through the opening. Easy-open Double-Throw latches combine a C-clamp with a secondary action that works like a pry bar so they lock tight but release with just a light pull. Rifle cases are wheeled.

Top of the Line Weaver scope, great optics for long distances and original leather strap. The strap is still stiff and new. This gun was not mass produced like they are today.

Give your fine firearms the same protection while traveling that the military and professional photographers rely on to keep their valuable gear clean, dry and safe. Certified with NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), these cases meet the standards of both the United States and European military forces. To meet the necessary criteria, the cases are subjected to an extensive battery of standardized endurance and quality tests designed to simulate extreme situations. Pelican’s innovative open-cell core and solid-wall construction absorbs shock and bumps, so your guns and optics won’t. Each case has an Automatic Purge Valve with a GORE-TEX® membrane that releases air pressure but keeps moisture out. A waterproof neoprene O-ring seal and a tongue-and-groove fit keeps moisture from penetrating through the opening. Easy-open Double-Throw latches combine a C-clamp with a secondary action that works like a pry bar so they lock tight but release with just a light pull. Rifle cases are wheeled.

I have all the factory paperwork and box etc. It comes with 2 mags an it is chambered in 357 Sig. The gun is a very accurate and a joy to shoot. If it weren't for having to shift my hands forward to compensate for the grip I would NOT get rid of this gun. However, it is not smart on my part to hold onto it when it is not made for my hand. Bill of Sale will be completed and buyer must have a CCH or permit I can retain with the bill of sale. Thanks!

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

 - Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire
 - 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
 - Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
 - Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
 - Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
 - Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance
 - M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification
  - Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation

Colt's Law Enforcement Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. The handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection, while the muzzle compensator reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures. The upper has all of the standard features such as a forward assist, shell deflector and dust cover over the ejection port.

It is a phenomenal shooting rifle and has more options then you could imagine. Only 250 rounds down the pipe in this rifle. Included in the deal is all the furniture seen in the pics: Main optic (Sightmark 3x9x30) on riser, Sightmark red/green dot mounted on 45 degree cant, laser, single point sling plate with sling attached, fore-grip, bulldog soft case, and 1x 33 round Glock 9mm mag.

What sets this rifle apart (aside from being chambered in 9mm) is that the rifle is completely ambidextrous. Currently it is set up for a right handed shooter, but can be converted for a left handed shooter in a matter of minutes by flipping the BCG and changing the plate for the ejection port. Another amazing feature of this rifle is you can change out calibers fairly easy. JRC sells conversions for .40 and .45 that won't break the bank.

I bought everything in this deal brand new last Christmas as a gift for myself to hunt groundhogs with but just don't have the time to do so. I mounted the scope and did a 25 yd quick zero in my backyard with 9 shots when I got the scope mounted, then cleaned the rifle, put it in a gunsock, then into my climatically controlled safe where it has sat untouched until I took it out just now to take these pictures. This is a great shooting, great looking rig and it is ready to hunt as it comes;  you don't spend another dime to get started varmint hunting or plinking. I have the factory box and owner's manual for both the rifle and the scope. This rifle is absolutely flawless, the finish is a beautiful deep blue and the stock is made of a nice looking, solid American hardwood and not a cheapo hollow plastic stock with ugly molding seams. The Weave scope has brilliant optics as you would expect in a nice high powered Weaver scope and the controls are finger adjustable and are smooth and positive in operation. I will drive half way between me and the buyer for a FTF, cash and carry deal in a public place during daylight hours. I am not interested in trades or counter offers. Sale to lawful Maryland residents or active duty military stationed in Maryland. I will not ship this rifle out of state.

Self defense ammo is of the highest quality with a single purpose, and that is to stop an intruder with the first shot.  .38 special and 9mm together with .380, .32 ACP, etc. have had a reputation for needing more than one shot to stop someone intent on doing you harm.  It was for that reason that the various ammunition manufacturers created ammo that was intended to do what you wanted it to, i.e. stop an intruder with the first shot, assuming it was well placed.  

This isn't ammo to go plinking with unless you are rich.  Practice with the cheaper FMJ ammo and dry fire your gun, practicing your draw, aim, and fire techniques.  When you are done practicing, this is the ammo to leave in your home self defense gun or in your concealed or carry gun.  This is the ammo you will want when that important moment comes along when your life or someone else's life is in jeopardy and needs protecting.

Designed to be the ultimate lightweight solution for competitive, recreational or hunting purposes, the EVO Ultra Lite trims weight wherever possible while still maintaining excellent accuracy, long term durability and high performance. It does this by combining a melonite treated, 16"" ultra-light contour barrel with a 12"" extended Samson Evolution Modular Free Floating Handguard and a low profile piston gas block. The shooter's preferred sighting arrangement is easily accommodated by a continuous top picatinny rail interface that runs from the rear of the forged A3 flat-top upper receiver to the low profile gas block, while both recoil and muzzle climb are efficiently handled by an effective Adams Arms Competition Compensator. Additional features include a mid length gas system for a longer sight radius and smoother recoil impulse, complete bolt carrier group, charging handle assembly, one 4"" modular rail section and one QD sling swivel adapter.
