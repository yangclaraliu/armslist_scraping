Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

It does have the handling marks as expected from moving in bulk, but is a mint condition piece. There were no markings inside the receiver to signify that the action had even been worked before I got it. I have 850 rounds of 7.62x54R 148-grain steel core ammunition to go with it. It's been hard to find a lot of ammo around so this one comes with a pretty good supply. I have installed a stock sleeve to hold extra rounds, a 1"" rubber recoil pad (and boy it made a difference), and have purchased a scope mount that attaches to the rear sight but have not installed because it requires a long eye relief scope and mine was not that type. It comes with the bayonet, ammo pouches, oil can, and sling.

Asking $450. Yes the base Mosin rifles are not very expensive, but they also come packed in cosmoline and suck up hours of cleaning which is already done, and most are not in such great condition. The ammo is a bulk of the cost. Even though it was cheaper than a lot of other stuff, shipping prices are a killer. Serious inquiries only. Call or text 330-605-O238.

Additional Comments - This rifle is as nice as they come and I paid a premium to receive an unissued, unfired model in such excellent condition. Yes you can go find a base model for $120 - $170 plus tax depending on your area, BUT the condition they will be in is far less than what I am offering. There is also a value in having 869 rounds available with the firearm. Online prices are deceptive. You can see a really awesome price and make a judgement call on that alone, but consider that shipping ORM-D class material of this weight is expensive. It's very common for a $120 order to have an additional $100 in shipping. I am willing to make trades but be reasonable. Just because you can get a cosmoline covered beat up Mosin for cheap after driving 3 hours to get it does not mean I'm going to devalue my own mint condition weapon. I also have little interest separating the rifle and the ammo. What good would the ammo do me if I no longer have the rifle? I would possibly consider keeping the sealed can of 440 if you really want to deal and have a little less to work with though."

Lots of people have a lot to say about Taurus, but this little revolver has been a flawless companion to me for DECADES without a hiccup. Based on the S&W 36 and made in a factory built by S&W for the Brazilian military, I've found this 85 to be better built and better shooting than many Smith 36s from the same period. And though I've never had to use it, the lifetime warranty follows the gun. Then why sell it? I probably shouldn't. Truth be told, I just don't use it any more. When carrying concealed (where legal, of course) it's usually a 442, LCP, or PM9. The stainless is nice for damp or salty environments, but I don't find myself in them too often and alloys and polymer ""don't rust neither"". It's too nice a gun for the tackle box and it's taking up space in the safe. 
Comes with original wooden stocks and Hogues.

$375 

Now, don't write to tell me you can get a new one for that. That may be true, but I don't think they are built as well and they've got those damn locks. Look on GunBroker for the older ones (S&W style cylinder latch and without that new lettering) and see what they have sold for. I believe I'm asking a fair price.

FTF with FOID ONLY!!!! 
I scrupulously follow all laws governing the transfer of firearms. 
If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.

It will also shoot .45 Colt (a.k.a. Long Colt). It has a 6.5 inch barrel. This gun is in immaculate condition. Always kept clean and lubed. The factory ported barrel and the Raging Bull grips make this gun fun to shoot without too much felt recoil. This would be a great gun for a hunting sidearm or even your primary hunting firearm. Great shooter for hunting or just having some fun.

The gun comes with about 125 rounds of ammo (mixed .454 Casull and .45 Colt) plus some once fired brass, a briefcase-style locking case, holster, and original box and manual. That's at least $200 in ammo and accessories. 

I'm asking $850 for the whole package. I would also consider trading for the right gun. I'm looking for a S&W M&P 9c (compact) or a S&W M&P Shield (9mm) plus cash. I might consider other trades (I'm into S&W pistols and revolvers, lever action and semi-auto rifles, and AR-type guns) so feel free to shoot me an offer."

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. 

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, because people do not always follow through with purchases, and we can lose guaranteed sales if a firearm is not available because we’re holding it for someone.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. 

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M) series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface."

Description
The AN/PVS-7B is a single-tube night vision goggle, Generation III image intensifier which uses prisms and lenses to provide the user with simulated binocular vision. The Marine Corps is acquiring the AN/PVS-7B, a model which incorporates a high light level protection circuit in a passive, self-contained image intensifier device which amplifies existing ambient light to provide the operator a means of conducting night operations. A shipping case, soft carrying case, eyepiece and objective lens cap, and filter are ancillary items. A demist shield is also provided to prevent fogging of eyepiece. 

The AN/PVS-7B represents the current state of the art in night vision goggles. Initially, it will augment the AN/PVS-5 NVG, and over time, it will replace the AN/PVS-5. The Marine Corps is interested in procuring a clip-on Night Vision Magnification Device (NVMD) to satisfy the need to see targets at the maximum effective range of its weapons.

RCBS Press
RCBS Chargemaster Digital with Scale
Power Case Trimmer
All extras
Dies and other stuff.

Basically, I am 100% complete for the calibers listed above. I own a bunch of .308 rifles, and really like tinkering with the cartridge and running at 110% to see what I can get out of it.

Anyway, I have become very proficient at reloading, seeing as how I am now unemployed due to the current economy, layoffs, etc. Thanks Obama, with honorable mention to Cuomo.

I find myself doing a ton of reloading in between my online job searching. To be honest, lookiing for work in this economy is more aggravation than it is worth, so I have been reloading more. I put a lot of time into reloading, and you might be impresssed to see the results below. I weighed the completed rounds on the scale, and ALL of them weighed to within .2 grains or LESS. I would say 98% of them were IDENTICAL from case to case.

1. 168 grn Barnes TTSX BTHP, using GMM Brass and IMR Powder
2. 168 Nosler's with GMM brass and IMR Powder
3. 168 Sierra's GMM with GMM brass and IMR Powder
4. 175 Sierra's with GMM brass and IMR Powder
5. 168 Hornady TAP's with GMM brass and IMR Powder
6. 168 Ballistic Silvertip's with GMM brass and IMR Powder.

I am not selling any of this ammo. I have put far too much time into case trimming, inspection, weighing, supplies, etc. 

I am posting this to see if anyone who has any of the calibers listed in my heading has reloading supplies or access to them, but doesn't have the equipment.  

If you provide the required supplies for the calibers listed above I will supply the time, equipment, and expertise required to perform the reloading.

RATES:
You provide powder, primers, bullets, and cases: .50 cents per round
I provide powder and primers: 75 cents per round
(I cannot provide brass at this time, I am almost out myself)

All equipment is new, calibrated, and functioning 100%.
I am open to rate negotiating depending on quantity desired. I am open to trade equity as well. Ammo for service, guns for service, (legally), etc.

What you will get for the .50 or .75 cents:

1. ALL cases will be polished to a mirror finish. I clean them so well, some of my GMM brass actually turned to a nickel like finish on the Hornady .308's.
2. IMR4895 or IMR8208 XBR powder for rifles. We will discuss the load %'s based on load data provided. I will not overload them. Don't ask.
3. I have every powder for a pistol you can imagine.
4. Cases trimmed, deburred, cleaned, and checked.

I don't produce junk. Everything will shoot better than anything you can buy. 

If you are interested, call or text me at REDACTED. I would prefer local/cash, but if this really takes off I could ship back and forth."

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

 Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

 Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

No. It just makes it lighter, yes some forum commandos will say different, but these same people said glocks were piece of shit plastic toys that will break after hard use...and i do believe they have been proved pretty wrong. Anyway, ive done some work to this rifle, it comes with BLACKHAWK quad rail, pistol grip, foward grip, and buttstock. Also have UTG 1x4 CQB scope which has really surprised me and is a good scope espically for the money, also have UTG iron sights, and Bushnell trophy reddot. Also comes with 8 gi mags, 260 steel core rounds and 142 pmc xtac rounds. Awesome rifle and a good setup.

The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

The 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. This rifle comes with your choice of one 10 or 20 round magazine. Additional mags are available for purchase separately.

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

It is fully automatic with pushbutton 4x4. It's top speed is about 60mph and it has enough torque to pull a house down. It is perfect for hunting. It is in great shape mechanically but has some cracks in the plastics and is scratched up from trail ridding. The wench on the front is bound up funny and needs fixed. The light switch is missing so the lights are always on. I will post pictures of the plastics. The rear brakes will need changed soon. I was going to change them myself but Summit Racing sent me the wrong type of pads so screw it. It just got an oil change and a radiator flush. The speedometer was broke but now has a new cable and works fine. It has Titan tires on it and the front tires are in great shape and the rear tires are 70%. 

No title.
 I would like $3000 cash but I am willing to take a honda xr 100 or a yammaha ttr 125 or similar size dirtbike as a partial trade. 
If interested please email me and I will get back to you or text/call 330-439-two58two.

I am selling my Ruger LC9 with original box and everything that came with it. An extra magazine and finger extensions for both magazines are included. I have shot the gun twice and put exactly 200 rounds through it with no problems. I'm asking what I paid for the package about a year ago (gun, transfer fee, extra mag, floorplates). The Ruger LC9 and the magazines are still in very high demand. Very popular 9mm pistol and a great conceal gun! I dont need a copy of your license or CPL. I just want to see id and cpl for a second to make sure I'm not selling a gun to someone that shouldnt own a gun. 

I'll take cash or trade. I'm looking for a Gen 4 Glock 21, XDM, 4"" 357, or S&W 15-22. I have cash to add depending on the trade. Thanks!"
