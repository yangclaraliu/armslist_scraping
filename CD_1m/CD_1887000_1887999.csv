I also have an Eotech 3x magnifier. For the optic and magnifier I'm asking $850. For just the optic, $500


Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.


Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space 
Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours
The XPS2 is not Night Vision compatible, for Night Vision compatibility see the XPS3 sights."

NOTE - ONLY SOME OF THE OFFENSES LISTED ABOVE HAVE A THREE-YEAR LIMITATION. OTHER OFFENSES, SUCH AS FELONIES AND MISDEMEANOR CRIMES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, DO NOT HAVE A TIME LIMIT. IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR CRIME OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, YOU ARE INELIGIBLE FOR A CCDW LICENSE AND ARE PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING A FIREARM UNDER FEDERAL LAW, NO MATTER HOW LONG AGO YOU WERE CONVICTED.

Felony Convictions

If you have been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, i.e., a felony, you are not only ineligible to possess a CCDW license; federal law prohibits you from possessing a firearm. Individuals subject to this disability should immediately lawfully dispose of their firearms and ammunition. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recommends that individuals who have been convicted of a felony surrender their firearms and ammunition to a third party, such as their attorney, local police agency, or a federal firearms dealer. The continued possession of firearms or ammunition by persons under this disability is a violation of federal law and may subject the possessor to criminal penalties as well as seizure and forfeiture of the firearms and ammunition.

Diversion

Those on pretrial diversion for disqualifying offenses are not eligible for a CCDW license.

Misdemeanor Crimes of Domestic Violence (MCDV)

It is illegal under federal law for any person convicted of a ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence"" to ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms or ammunition (18 U.S.C. 922). A ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence"" is defined in 18 U.S.C. 921(33) as an offense that:

1. Is a misdemeanor under federal or state law; and

2. Has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.

The following misdemeanors under Kentucky law are deemed to be possible misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence. If you have been convicted of any of the following offenses, your application must be reviewed to determine whether your offense involved domestic violence:

• KRS 508.030 Assault in the fourth degree (note that this is a three year state disqualifier even if domestic violence was not involved).
• KRS 508.040 Assault under Extreme Emotional Disturbance
• KRS 508.120 Criminal Abuse in the third degree
• KRS 509.030 Unlawful Imprisonment in the second degree
• KRS 510.120 Sexual Abuse in second degree
•  KRS 510.130 Sexual Abuse in third degree
• KRS 510.140 Sexual Misconduct
• KRS 525.060 Disorderly Conduct
• KRS 525.070 Harassment

Note that there is no three-year limitation as with state disqualifiers. If you have been convicted of any of the above offenses, a domestic violence determination must be made regardless of how long ago you were convicted. A domestic violence determination must also be made if you were convicted of similar misdemeanors in federal court or another state or territory. You are not disqualified, even if domestic violence was involved, if your conviction was expunged, set aside or pardoned. If your conviction is determined to be a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, you are not only ineligible to possess a CCDW license; federal law prohibits you from possessing a firearm. Individuals subject to this disability should immediately lawfully dispose of their firearms and ammunition. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recommends that individuals who have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence surrender their firearms and ammunition to a third party, such as their attorney, local police agency, or a federal firearms dealer. The continued possession of firearms or ammunition by persons under this disability is a violation of federal law and may subject the possessor to criminal penalties as well as seizure and forfeiture of the firearms and ammunition."

About PTR:
The original PTR rifle was first conceived in 2002, when a predecessor company purchased tooling and designs for the HK line of roller-lock weapons from Fabrica Militar of Portugal.
Initially, small quantities HK-91 “clone” rifles were produced, mostly from surplus parts acquired around the world. From 2002-2006, the reputation of the PTR-91 rifle grew considerably along with the market for it.
PTR was organized in 2006 to meet that demand. Over the next few years, the company consistently grew its capabilities. Expanding beyond the original 91 “clone”, PTR began to introduce many other models and variants to suit different shooting applications. Today the company is known affectionately as just “PTR”, due to the fact that the product offerings have expanded well beyond the original PTR-91 rifle.
In 2011 PTR stands light-years away from its humble beginnings. The company was re-organized in 2010 with new management, new capital, new focus, and higher expectations.
Today, PTR is a full-fledged 21st century firearms manufactur- ing firm, capable of much more than just “clone” rifles. Rather than just assembly personnel and work-benches in the early years, PTR now employs gunsmiths, engineers, toolmakers, and machinists who work with state of the art technology to bring our customers a truly modern firearm. PTR is also no longer dependent on foreign surplus markets – it has the capability to produce every part for PTR rifles right here in the United States.
The company has also drastically improved its resources in customer service and support. PTR today produces fine quality firearms in multiple calibers for a variety of applications across the shooting disciplines.
The new PTR is committed to providing top-quality firearms to the most discerning shooters be they military, law-enforcement, or civilian. Along with this commitment comes the obligation to stand by every part and firearm that leaves the factory, and provide the customer an excellent experience long after his purchase comes out of the box.

From PTR Industries:
The G.I. comes with a parkerized only finish, there is no powder coat. It comes with original HK OD green furniture and an HK navy style polymer pistol grip (we use this grip on all PTR's). The barrel has 11 flutes and is a 16"" HK type profile match grade barrel from Green Mountain Barrels, finished off with an HK style flash hider (we use this flash hider on all PTR's). It is chambered for .308 Winchester, 7.62 NATO and 7.62x51 will work as well (same as all of our PTR-91's). The rifle is 40.5"" long, weighs roughly 9.5 lbs and comes with a 20 rd. magazine. This rifle was produced to be as close to an original HK91 as possible in look, fit and accuracy.

So here's the story. I purchased a 3rd Gen Glock 17 over a year ago, but had an issue with the ejector. Glock sent me this new one as a replacement (also a Gen 3) and it's got less than 500 rounds through it. I can confirm there are ZERO ejection issues with this gun, and it is cosmetically perfect. No BTF concerns like some other Glock owners are worrying about. I'm only selling it because I lost 45lbs and am just too skinny to conceal this, so I'm moving to something smaller.

The gun comes with custom grip tape (can be removed easily) and Trijicon Night Sights, plus two 17rd magazines, speed loader and the black clamshell it shipped in. 

I will ask for a copy of your ID and a signature on something that states the date, purchase price and serial. This is just for my records and protection, not for the gov't."

Finding Kimbers in 38 Super is very difficult, this is the only one I have ever seen in ANY gun store I've ever been to, and I am a huge Kimber fanatic and shooter. Only selling to help fund a move, really hate to see it go. If you know anything about 38 Supers the bullet diameter is the same weight as a 9mm, but the cases are longer for more powder and higher velocities. A standard 38 Super outperforms a 9mm +P+ and most fire around 1250fps out of this gun. A very flat shooting round out to 50m and even able to hit targets at 100m. I have 4 Kimbers and this one is by and far the most accurate! They are all accurate, but this one shoots point of aim to impact every single time. Sights are excellent, trigger is amazing, recoil is little, and a very comfortable gun. 4"" Bushingless barrel is the heart and soul of this gun. Less than 600 rounds through the barrel Kimber recommends an 800 round break in period, so it isn't even broken in yet. I paid $1167 initially (before taxes, receipt in photo) $100 for action/internals ground and smoothed out by competent gunsmith, $40 for Kimber Wooden Tactical full length to magwell grips, and $100 more for the Kimber SS Mag Well replacing the cheap stock mainspring housing. Comes with hard case, 1 mag full of 124gr+P HP Doubletap defensive ammo (more mags and ammo available for extra), all original paperwork, your choice of black rubber grips, full length wooden Kimber grips, also have a Wilson bulletproof SS extended slide stop that I will throw in for an extra $25($50 part). So total with tax around $1400 in it I'm asking for $850 Extra mags, ammo, truIvory grips, and .22LR conversion available for extra.

The LG-453 Laserguard® is Crimson Trace’s first Springfield green laser sight and is designed to fit seamlessly on the trigger guard of Springfield Armory’s popular line of XD and XD(M) pistols with Full-Size frames.  The LG-453 takes the excellent low-light sighting capabilities of red laser sights to a new level.  The human eye processes the color green more than any other color and Crimson Trace offers the brightest green laser available, making the LG-453 a versatile laser sighting system for all lighting conditions.

Providing over two hours of run time on a single (1) CR2 battery, such incredible battery life has never been offered by the green laser market.  Additionally, the LG-453 Laserguard platform is the most lightweight and compact green laser sight available for Springfield XD and XD(M) pistols.  The Laserguard is quickly and easily user-installed in minutes without gunsmithing.

In addition to the powerful green laser, great battery life, and compact design, the LG-453 offers windage and elevation adjustments (with provided wrenches), and a Master On/Off switch, allowing the user to completely power down the unit.

As with all Crimson Trace Laserguard models, the LG-453 features Crimson Trace’s patented Instinctive Activation™.  Instinctive Activation allows the operator to activate the laser by simply holding the firearm with a normal shooting grip.  No other brand can claim that.  No one else builds them close.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.

Product Description The Model 4043 is a reliable, high-quality, third generation Smith & Wesson semi-auto. The 4046's stainless steel frame is durable and weather-resistant. The double-action-only trigger has a smooth pull and the double-stack magazine design gives you plenty of ammo capacity. The 4046 is known to be accurate and smooth-cycling. The trigger pull and the gun itself are relatively heavy, making it a good choice for experienced shooters who like to have some heft behind their shots. This pistol features a 3-white-dot sight, synthetic grips, and an 11-round magazine. Its grips, its metal, and its bore are all in good condition."

3.8"" match-grade barrel
Rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite finish
Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System
The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case.

This gun is in great condition and shoots incredibly with only about 400 rounds put through it, and comes with an extra magazine (that makes 3 total mags) and a great trigger. It will also include a bonus Pearce Grip Extension for the short mag so your pinky will fit."

Smith & Wesson offers the lightest, slimmest and most compact semiautomatic in the M&P family – the Shield™. Less than 1"" thick, 6"" overall length and weighing just 19 oz., the Shield is perfect for concealed carry or a law-enforcement backup gun. Striker fired with a low bore axis and an 18° grip angle, the Shield delivers a natural sight picture and points instinctively. The consistent trigger pull and short trigger reset enhance accuracy and make for fast follow-up shots. Unlike some compact semiautomatics, the Shield is outfitted with a thumb safety for added peace of mind. Maintenance is easy with the patented M&P No Tool Takedown System. A steel recoil-spring rod adds durability and the captured spring speeds the takedown and cleaning process. The Shield comes with two magazines, a seven-round version that fits flush with the base of the grip and an eight-round version with an extended finger rest."

(SHILEN - SELECT MATCH GRADE)
These stainless steel masterpieces of machining and hand lapping are intended for the competition shooter-- or even the hunter-- who wants the ultimate in accuracy and quality. These are our highest grade barrel and, of course, the most costly. What makes them so good that benchrest shooters, such as Tony Boyer, crave them? Consider this: To meet Select Match Grade criteria, the groove diameter must air gauge within .0003"" of our standard diameter. Moreover, the uniformity of the bore cannot vary more than .0001"" for the entire length of the barrel. These barrels are also completely stress relieved, and the bore is polished to a gleaming surface finish by our most experienced lappers.

Brand new - less than 500 documented Break-In round shot through Barrel.
Barrel mates to 700 Remington platform.
Break-in and cleaning procedures meticulously followed as per manufactures’ instructions.

Almost no slide wear that I can see and if there is, it is very minimal. I have 3 15 round magazines, test fire casings and original hard shell case as well as a simple Fobus OWB holster. I also had a 3.5 trigger connector put in and have the original packaging as well as the factory connector. I made the decision to get rid of this because the amazing humidity in Indiana makes CC for this a little difficult since, well it's hot outside. Looking for a trade preferably, but I will settle on 500 if you want to buy. Make an offer. I can text pics upon request. Email is not my prefered method of contact since I don't regularly check my email, but my phone updates my inbox about every half hour or so. Text/call at seven six five 409 one 0 five 3.

Double/Single action semiautomatic pistol with polymer. In addition to the well-known handling advantages of the TANFOGLIO products, the FORCE model has a reduced weight and it is the ideal handgun for concealed carry and the right choise for Security and Law Enforcement forces. It has a “cocked and locked” safety mounted on the frame (F version) and a reversible magazine catch. The R version has an ambidextrous firing pin safety mounted on the slide that works as a hammer decocker; both versions have an automatic firing pin safety. The R version is particularly used by Security and Law Enforcements forces.
