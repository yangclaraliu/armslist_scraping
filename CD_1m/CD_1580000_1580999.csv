AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The horn plays perfectly. This is an intermediate level trombone, essentially identical to the TB200B that they are currently selling. The slide has a ding in the bottom, but it does not affect play. All the external brass shows some age, but most of it should polish out. The slide, trigger and all the tuning slides work perfectly.

Terry McClure Story
After a very vigorous life plowing whole fields with his grandpa’s tractor by the age of 8, playing football in high school and following his heart into his lifelong career in law enforcement, in January 2012 Terry began experiencing difficulty with mobility such as stumbling and falling and also being unable to lift and hold onto things. These symptoms slowly progressed to a very pronounced weakness in his arms to the point that he couldn’t lift his keys to unlock a lock or even lift a cup for a drink. A series of events and doctors’ visits finally led to the Kansas University Medical Center on January 24, 2013 and the diagnosis of ALS. 
Terry was told to immediately quit his job as head of the Cowley County Jail in Winfield, Kansas, abruptly ending his career in law enforcement. This has also altered Terry’s ability to participate in activities supporting his love of firearms which includes over 20 years teaching classes in firearm safety and how to shoot plus spending countless hours over the years encouraging people to further their marksmanship skills. 
Terry and Becca have been married nearly 8 years and have made a very loving family with Becca’s 3 kids, Damyan (18, U.S. Navy), Brenna (15) and Aley (13). Through being foster parents they met and, on July 3, 2012, adopted 4 wonderful kids from the same family: Dylan (7), Chloe (6), Lola (4) and Max (2). Wow! Six kids at home and now Terry will never work again! 
Terry has dedicated his life to helping others and is a friend of mine and many others. Its time we give back to him and hey..you may just win something for your kindness."

This particular issue is a 9/11 Special.Also, any comic book fanatic would know how awesome it would be to have a comic signed by Stan Lee (creator of Marvel). Stan Lee is getting up there in age so the value of his signature alone is rising. It is sealed in a glass casing.

I am the second owner. I actually just bought this at Soundwave in Summerville during Free Comic Book Day (5-4-2013) at their auction. I still have the receipt. The reason why I am selling it is because I recently got engaged and need the money to help save up for a wedding and rent for an apartment. I am asking $175 because that is how much I paid for it at the auction. I recently looked on eBay and saw a recent listing of the same comic signed by Stan Lee sell for $230ish. I would also consider trading for firearms.

If you are interested, feel free to email me or call/text me at 843-452-4571.

***YOU CAN BUY THEM INSTORE***

so I had a new customer come in with a finish problem, He desperately needed some stainless aircraft display pins blued because it was keeping an airplane grounded. Well as soon as I finished them and found out that I am now their hero for getting them out of a pinch. We got to talking and I find out that his company builds parts for a bunch of gun manufacturers. They also build a few thousand parts for the military every month, He invited me to visit his shop and so today I toured his company and he shows off the newest design in billet lowers.

The finished lowers are as you can see are machined out of a solid billet. You will not get one with machine marks, they will be blasted smooth with walnut shells and then anodized black, the lettering will be color filled. Unfortunately when we were there they did not have a finished example to show me.

I took some pictures of it and asked him about availability to the civilian market.
I was informed that they would build some for me but will be built per order because it takes machine time away from government contracts due to differences in serial numbers. 
I decided that I wanted these lowers so I put in my purchase order for 100 of these billet lowers today (minimum order) and those of you who want one can buy one through this Group buy for $245 out our door. (If I have to ship it to yourFFL it will cost you actual shipping plus whatever you’re local FFL wants for transfer) I can deliver to an OKC FFL but not deliver to individuals other than in my store. Once they are delivered there will be no discount they will be built and sold out of my store.

Orders will have to be paid for in advance because I don’t want to shell out $24K out of my own pocket when I go pick them up. All money will be held until the billets are picked up so if the buy does not happen then you will get a full refund but I have yet to have a group buy go south.
Add your name and number wanted to the list and send me your check or money order (no creditcards please due to service charges)

The P30 was made from 1990 - 1994 by Grendel Inc. of Rockledge, Florida. They eventually faded away (largely due to the first assault weapon ban), but were later reborn as Kel Tec. The P30 is the father of Kel Tec's popular and hard to find PMR 30 which is also a full size 30 shot semi-auto pistol in .22 Mag caliber. The two pistols operate in a similar fashion and I have read that a PMR 30 magazine can be modified to work in the P30 although I have not tried this.

This P30 is in like new condition and has only had 60 rounds fired through it since it was purchased new in the 90's. It comes in it's original plastic case with the original factory operating manual, and one 30 shot magazine. It would be difficult to find a better one.

It is 2 year old, and I have only put about 100-200 rounds through it, and cleaned it after every range trip. This is basically a Beretta, but instead of it being made in Italy, it is made in Turkey so the gun is overall is a little less expensive. This gun is great for lefties, too, due to ambidextrous thumb safety. Great for home defense or just 'plinking'. New these are around $400 or $450 + tax.
This comes with the firearm, a hard case, the manual, and 4 - 15 round magazines (originally came with only 2). For the right price I will also add 100 rounds of 9mm (VERY hard to find right now.) [please note: not looking to sell the ammo/mags separately as of yet, don't bother to ask]

In the interest of full disclosure: This gun does occasionally jam (stovepipe)[for those that don't know what that means, this is a malfunction where sometimes after the gun fires, instead of properly ejecting the SPENT cartridge, the spent (now empty) cartridge gets trapped when the slide is coming forward, thus jamming the gun]. I have done research and found other users who have experienced this same type of jam repeatedly, and the solving of this problem seems to be 'breaking the gun in' meaning firing a couple of hundred rounds through it to loosen up the recoil spring enough to prevent it snapping back too quickly and catching the spent shell. Another thing other users have reportedly done is used +P rounds to loosen it up. As there is a shortage of 9mm lately I haven't tried this. But someone else should be able to use this as a 'project gun' and get it working fine, everything else is great besides this issue. I haven't tried replacing the recoil spring either.

 The Ruger® SR-22® rifle is an autoloading rimfire rifle that combines the legendary reliability of the Ruger® 10/22® with the ergonomics and configurability of the Ruger® SR-556.® The SR-22 Rifle places a standard 10/22 action inside a top-quality, American-Made, all-aluminum chassis that is custom manufactured to Ruger specs by Nordic Components, Inc.™ 

 The final product is an affordable, feature-loaded rifle that faithfully replicates the AR-platform dimensions between the sighting plane, buttstock height, and grip. Although it looks really cool out of the box, there is an extensive array of accessories available allowing a custom configuration, limited only by the shooter's preferences.

 Ruger 10/22 Takedown
 Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) is proud to introduce the Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™. Readily separated into two subassemblies, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger® 10/22®. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America's favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

 The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

 The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves which hold the subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

 The 4.67-pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37"" long when assembled; each subassembly is less than 20 1/4"" long when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action and ten round rotary magazine (one magazine is provided), the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a compact and portable package.

I was told it was customized/tuned by the Colt Custom Shop however have no records of that.  I received it with custom target grips and what appears to be a ""magna port"" style port.
Feels and fires excellent.  I'm not an appraiser but don't see any sign of wear; just handling marks on the top of the pistol.  I don't think it's ever been holstered.  It is still new enough that the cylinder doesn't freely spin so I don't think it is broken in yet.  I showed it to 2 Colt dealers and they compared the action to other Pythons and said it was certainly a Custom Shop Python.  Again, it is obviously customized, but I'm not skilled to make comment on who did the work. I'm no longer waiting on Colt to respond to help me verify the history.  They sent me a price list and I'll have to pay more than I'm willing to pay to prove it is a Colt Custom Shop Python.  Reducing price. Serial number is 13975 E.  There are two marks under the serial number that appear to be a 00, but can't be certain.  I would rather trade for guns or guns + cash since I have two Pythons.  No box or papers.

If you want open sights but also want the option of mounting an optic of some kind, why buy a generic rifle then have a drawer of extra parts left over when you finally get what you want. I ca build a Name Brand rifle to your specs for not a lot more than you would spend on a base rifle. We can install custom triggers, sights, hand guards, stocks, barrels (different lengths, stainless steel, M4 configuration, bull barrels, etc) basically what you want the first time. I have built hundreds of AR-15's to satisfy your every need and/or preference. We can ship to your FFL dealer nationwide in the lower 48 states.

Leupold Mark 6 1-6x20mm Rifle Scope is a small, nimble, and powerful rifle scope that meets the needs of law enforcement, tactical, and sport shooters.image With an objective lens that's no wider than 20mm and a light weight of just over a pound, these small Leupold riflescopes won't hinder your weapon with a bulky profile or heavy load. The versatile 1x to 6x magnification range of these rifle scopes is ideal for close-range operations, with a wide field of view, fast target acquisition, and pinpoint precision at longer ranges. The professional-grade lenses of the Leupold Mark VI 1-6x20 34mm Tube Riflescope use the Xtended Twilight Lens System for edge-to-edge clarity, and their DiamondCoat2 lens coating excels at light transmission and scratch resistance. Fine-tune your measurements with the low profile Zerolock locking windage and elevation turrets, complete with tactile and audible 2/10th mil per click movement. Leupold has equipped the Mark 6 rifle scope with an illuminated reticle on the front focal plane, visible under any lighting settings with the right position on the 7-setting brightness adjustment. Smaller, lighter, and faster than most rifle scopes, the Leupold Mk 6 1-6x Xtended Twilight Scope is a versatile tool for any job. Specifications:

Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sight Matte 7.5 MOA:
The Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sight Matte 7.5 MOA Dot ushers in the next generation of illuminated reflex sights with progressive technology that speeds target acquisition and keeps shooters of all skill levels focused andimage right on the mark. The DeltaPoint Reflex Sight by Leupold can be used with nearly any firearm, from handguns to shotguns to AR-style rifles. The Reflex Sight 's applications range from plinking to hunting to competitive shooting, as well as home defense, law enforcement and military. The Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sight 's compact size allows mounting of the sight in conjunction with a primary riflescope for use when adjusting fire from distant to short-range targets, or dealing with changing environments in a single tactical encounter.

Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sights Matte 7.5MOA come in a kit which includes numerous mounting options, saving the additional expense of purchasing separate mounts that may cost hundreds of dollars more. A special plate system aligns the mount with the gun, ensuring a good fit. Each kit has plates for 10 of the most popular handgun applications, with compatibility for up to 40 different handgun models. There is also a cross-slot mount for easy coupling with Picatinny Weaver-style rails and bases.

Key features that make Leupold Delta Point Reflex Sight a truly unique high-performance shooting optic include an innovative aspheric lens, motion activation, auto-brightness sensor, locking elevation and windage adjustment system, and an ultralight rugged magnesium housing. Exclusive to this Leupold Reflex Sight are two screws that lock in windage and elevation adjustments, preventing the reticle from wandering under heavy recoil or extended shooting periods. A generous 120-MOA of adjustment range for both windage and elevation makes zero easy to change and maintain, allowing the shooter to dial in the target with precise accuracy. Adjustment markings are ¼-inch MOA with an adjustment tool included with the sight.

With these features of the Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sight Matte 7.5 MOA Dot, Leupold has launched a next-generation optic that is extremely versatile, intuitive and rugged, while providing the ease and precise accuracy of a red dot sight."

Own the LWRC….the FINEST piston AR on the market!!! This is NOT an NFA weapon! Pinned flash hider results in the overall barrel length reaching the BATFE required 16” minimum. 

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories. 

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters."
