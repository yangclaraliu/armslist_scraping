One thing I've noticed about this rifle, every once in a while when you cycle the action as the bolt closes it drops the hammer as well.  Obviously this can cause a slamfire.  I shot it once and put one magazine through without any slamfires and then I cycled one more magazine by hand and got one slamfire.  My thinking is that someone messed with the trigger group.  It might need a new sear or disconnector or something.  I'm not a gunsmith so I don't want to mess with it, but I believe all the parts for the trigger group are relatively inexpensive and available."

This scope has a side focus so it is much easier to use when shooting, as well as a 30mm tube so rings are pretty easy to find. I have a set of Burris rings I can throw in for about 60 bucks.

The reticle is a Medium Plex, so it has a fine crosshair in the middle and larger sections on the end. It's great if you are doing some hunting or varminting.

Gas operated, Egyptian built on Swedish machinery with Sweish steel. These are based on Ljungman Swedish rifles that Egypt had converted to a larger size to accept the 8mm ammo they had tons of in the 1950s. It has 10 round mags but lots of 25 and 30 rounders are out there. Spare parts are available as well. A truly unique design that cocks FORWARD. It will be the center of attention at the range. Has the recoil of an AK or less due to its size and weight and especially the muzzle brake designed into it. The blast moves the partitions at the indoor range outward every shot. 8mm ammo is still around for under 40 cents a round. In better shape than many and there are only a few thousand around. Metal surfaces are 85% plus and the wood, while dinged up. is better than most as the storage from the 1960s wasnt kind to the wood and I dont know how they trained, but they beat on the stocks. Keep in mind that I am using terms as compared to regular firearms and not military ones which dont come with deep bluing and smooth finishes to start, so this is nice like a nice Mauser. Pictures are good and I can send closeups but it looks better in person as the flash reflects weird on the metal surface. Bore has very good rifling though lost the shine from decades of corrosive ammo BUT the gas system and adjustable valve is pristine. I took it apart totally and cleaned every crevice. The adjustable gas system allows use of HOT Turkish ammo, or 8mm from different continents and decades that are very different. Short of a BAR in 30-06 or Dragunov 7.62x54, 8mm is the only other full size caliber and the only other 8mm semis are very expensive, as in double or triple the price.

It can either be a straight up trade, or a firearm plus cash, etc. I am open to offers, as I am not currently looking for anything specific. So if this interests you, please just contact me and let me know what you'd like to trade/offer, and we can go from there. For purposes of the trade, I would consider the value I am looking for from the two rings to be around $950, but I may be somewhat flexible depending in the firearm. All the info on the rings is below. Thanks!


Information on rings:
Current Retail at Kay Jewelers is $899 Each = $1798 + Tax, Warranty, Etc.. These two rings are both brand new and the most they have been handled (or out of the boxes for that matter) is for the photos took for this listing. I have taken high quality photos so you can see that they are in perfect, brand new condition, like the day they were purchased.

There are 9 diamonds on each 14k white gold ring. I have all the original paperwork and purchased the extended service plan for these. If you have any questions at all or have a request for additional photos etc, please just let me know. Original boxes, paperwork etc. included.

*The three stone Engagement Ring in the pictures is NOT included*

Kay Jewelers allows the original purchase price to be used towards a future purchase, so I am not looking to take extremely low offers as I am already asking nearly the value/price of one ring, for both of the rings. If I am unable to sell/trade them I will just keep them so that I can retain the full purchase price in the future. Thanks.

I have added some textured pads to the sides of the grip for my personal preference, a beavertail grip, peirce grip extentions on both mags, end plate on the slide, grip plug and recoil buffer. I have the uncle mikes holster that goes with it and a laser that mounts under the slide. I have never carried this gun cause i did not want to damage it, ive have babied it. The only drawback i have with it is the mags are the ten rounders not the 15s. I am looking to trade it for high end stuff in 9mm but will listen to others. I really want a berreta m9 or a sig 9mm not the p250. The only way ill sell it is if i can get enough to go buy an m9 or sig.

I was tired of prepping all my military and standard rounds and then have to use a hand case trimmer tool to trim. This adapter screws into any of the power prepping stations and takes just seconds to install. This allows you to do all of you prep in one station. Just use your Lee tools or a socket style shell holder adapter on a screwdriver to add another step to your station. I'm a reloader and I love this adapter and figured any true reloader with a power station would as well. These are hand made from my lathe and may have some machining marks on them, but they work great! Made of high strength grade aluminum. Available in two sizes. The small size will work for cases up to 45 caliber and the large will do 45 caliber and above. When ordering please specify in your comments which size you would like to order so I can make sure you get the right one. I will include a 14 day satisfaction guarantee, just pay return postage.

This firearm has come a long way from the ""sporting"" version that they come as when they are imported into America. The Saiga 12 is constructed entirely of steel and is an incredibly robust, reliable and powerful machine. Chambered for 3"" shells, it is capable of firing the hottest 3"" shells or low-brass 2 3/4"" with just a turn of the gas tube valve. Barrel is fully chrome-lined, which not only significantly increases barrel life but requires less maintenance than a barrel of plain steel construction. List of modifications and aftermarket parts equipped are as follows.

Tapco USA Made T6 Telescopic stock with recoil pad, single-point, two-point sling mounts and a pistol grip storage compartment.

Tapco USA Made forearm with 3 removable picatinny rails mountable on the left, right & bottom of the forearm.

Carolina Shooters Supply USA Made gas tube shroud

Correctly polished action for increased reliability which also provides significantly smoother functioning and feeding of the weapon.


Original stock, forearm and factory Izhmash matching serial number 5 round magazine are also included with this package.

Weapon has cycled hundreds of rounds flawlessly from cheap Federal Multi-Purpose 8 shot to 3"" 1.25 ounce foster slugs. I have cleaned every inch of the internals of this firearm after each time it was fired, action was also kept properly lubricated at all times. I am extremely familiar with this firearm's design so feel free to contact me with any questions you may have regarding anything about them.

My intention is to trade this for an AK-74, a Izhmash manufactured Saiga like the SGL31-61 or SGL31-62 but I will consider others. Cash difference will be needed or given depending on what you have to offer. If I had to sell it outright price is $1250. Please contact me if you have any interest, offers or questions.

A re-designed bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine allows increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the PMAG 30 M3 will not over-insert on compatible weapons, including the AR15/M16, HK 416, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN SCAR MK 16/16S, and others. In addition to the expanded feature set and compatibility, the PMAG 30 M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes that have been engineered to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. By improving strength and durability in critical areas, the PMAG 30 M3 increases overall reliability and lifespan, while decreasing total lifecycle cost."

This firearm has come a long way from the ""sporting"" version that they come as when they are imported into America. The Saiga 12 is constructed entirely of steel and is an incredibly robust, reliable and powerful machine. Chambered for 3"" shells, it is capable of firing the hottest 3"" shells or low-brass 2 3/4"" with just a turn of the gas tube valve. Barrel is fully chrome-lined, which not only significantly increases barrel life but requires less maintenance than a barrel of plain steel construction. List of modifications and aftermarket parts equipped are as follows.

Tapco USA Made T6 Telescopic stock with recoil pad, single-point, two-point sling mounts and a pistol grip storage compartment.

Tapco USA Made forearm with 3 removable picatinny rails mountable on the left, right & bottom of the forearm.

DPH Arms USA Made door breaching thread-on muzzle brake

SGM Tactical (Surefire Gun Magazines) USA Made 10 round magazine

BreakO USA Made mercury recoil reduction system (installed in Tapco stock), recoil is easily half of any standard pump shotgun.

Carolina Shooters Supply USA Made gas tube shroud

Correctly polished action for increased reliability which also provides significantly smoother functioning and feeding of the weapon.


Original stock, forearm and factory Izhmash matching serial number 5 round magazine are also included with this package.

Weapon has cycled hundreds of rounds flawlessly from cheap Federal Multi-Purpose 8 shot to 3"" 1.25 ounce foster slugs. I have cleaned every inch of the internals of this firearm after each time it was fired, action was also kept properly lubricated at all times. I am extremely familiar with this firearm's design so feel free to contact me with any questions you may have regarding anything about them.

My intention is to trade this for an AK-74, a Izhmash manufactured Saiga like the SGL31 but I will consider others. Cash difference will be needed or given depending on what you have to offer. If I had to sell it outright price is $1250. Please contact me if you have any interest, offers or questions. Thanks for looking!"

These holes were welded closed at some point during this rifle's life when it went through an arsenal refinish.  You will also see a striked out serial number on the left side of the receiver.

This is a new custom Palmetto build AR15 chambered in 5.56 Nato with bullet button installed and one ten round magazine by C products!

If you're looking for an AR15, this is an awesome choice for your first black rifle.  Most AR15s that have 16in barrels run a carbine length gas system with a semi-auto bolt carrier group.  The mid length gas system actually runs smoother than the carbine, producing less recoil.  This allows you to stay on target better than your friend with a carbine AR15.  On top of that, you'll have the full auto bolt carrier group which will allow your rifle to cycle more smoothly because it's a little heavier than the semi-auto.  

Palmetto makes great rifles!  The chrome lined 1-7 twist barrel is made by FN manufacturing, a well known producer of excellent barrels.  The bolt carrier group is the Palmetto M-16 MPI, pretty much as good as it gets, built to last.  The 6-position buttstock is made by Blackhawk and I threw a Magpul MOE grip on there.  The lower parts are from Palmetto as well.  Fortunately, this one came with a pretty good trigger.  Sometimes you get lucky!

Benelli's SuperNova Tactical embodies a modular design concept in a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. At the heart of this pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the SuperNova Tactical super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. The top of the SuperNova's receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics. This shotgun features a pistol grip and open rifle sights.

This handgun features a grip safety similar to the 1911, and is known for being a very safe as well as practical firearm. Instead of having the grip safety at the palm of your hands it is at your finger tips which in my opinion is an awesome feature.

This rifle has been meticulously maintained, and has only had up to 70 rounds fired through it. It comes with the pictured bipod and sling, and the Burris scope.

I will also include 60 rounds of ammunition and some cleaning equipment. Would be a great first gun with all this gear, and the .270 is such a great all round gun - good for roos, pigs, etc. I am VERY sad to see it go, and sort of hope it doesn't sell, but finances are tough in our house at the moment.
