The best offer on the AK-47 SAR-1 so far is $1,200. Thanks for the offers and responses guys ******


* By the way, don't confuse this gun (the SAR-1) with the WASR 10/63 model because they are not really made the same guality. The SAR-1 is worth more and collectable. Not too many SAR-1s imported compared to the regular WASR 10 or 10/63 guns *"

Piston driven!! Much more reliable... less heat production than gas driven bushmaster!

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® employs a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.
The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

Along with the FN-style stock and receiver outline, the MK22 has many of the same features as the rifle that inspired it. The receiver is an all-metal construction, with a Picatinny-style rail system on all receiver surfaces. This includes a barrel placement for attaching FN sights. The mussle of the precision match, 16-inch barrel is cut with a 1:28 thread to accept various muzzle breaks and flash hiders.
 The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. 
Comes with 22-round magazine. The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. 
The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the gun. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage. Tan finish.

This car is BEAST. Runs amazing with a fresh big block 454 tied to what is believed to be 400 auto tranny with a fuel cell in the trunk, headers & new dual exhaust. It has a few little issues like a 54 yr old car will...but it's a blast to drive. It's missing one small piece of trim on the passenger front fender. Other than that it has all chrome and trim in great shape (try looking up the value of the trim & bumpers). All windows, doors, trunk, & hood close properly & solidly. All lines are straight and true. It runs, turns and stops just fine althought the brakes need adjustment bc it pulls to left when theyre applied. Interior upholstry & headliner look great. Dash could use a little love but very presentable. It has some rust issues underneath that I discovered when I got the car but that didnt bother me. Paint is an amatuer ""10 footer"" with great flake. I was going to wet sand & polish it bc its flat now. It looks great like it is though (many of my hotrod buddies think I should leave it flat & weathered...makes it look cooler & more authentic)
 The bottom line is that this will be a GREAT car to drive around and burn through tires. It fires up EVERY time with no problem and will light up the tires without even trying. I love it and I'm sure someone else out there will too.
I'd be interested in a trade for a cache of QUALITY guns & ammo.  Don't expect to get hysteria values for each weapon but current climate will be taken into consideration.  Quality assault style rifles, shotguns and some good pistols would be the best mix but all rifles is fine."

The Bushmaster Carbon 15 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AR-15's or for veteran gun owners. This line of rifles is among the first to come stock with polymer receiver, making it 40% lighter and more shock resistant than a standard aluminum receiver. The slim pencil style barrel, low profile gas block, and CAR-15 style stock only enhance what is already one of the lightest and most maneuverable AR's on the market. The included red dot scope is light, simple and reliable while the sight allows the user to quickly aim the weapon in any situation.

This is a .43 SPANISH (11.15X58MMR) caliber. ANTIQUE – NO FFL TRANSFER REQUIRED. 

Probably over one million Remington Number 1 size rolling block rifles were made between 1867 and 1888. They were purchased in large quantities and in many different calibers and configurations by many countries including Argentina, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Turkey, Egypt and Mexico. Barrel lengths and other specifications differed from country to country. They were hard used for long periods of time and fought in many different wars. It was used by either the Spanish or Argentine military. The barrel and receiver both have a few areas of pitting in the metal. The barrel is 35 inches long and has an excellent bore with great rifling and no pitting. There are the usual slight dings and dents but no heavy gouging. The gun has it's cleaning rod. The rifle still functions perfectly. The multi line Remington roll stamp of name and patent dates is on the top tang and is still readable. Not the prettiest rifle I’ve ever sold, but it’s got tons of character and is a great example of 19th Century military history. Antique – No FFL or C&R required – can be shipped right to your door. Like I said before this is not a wall hanger. It has a bright and shiny bore with pronounced rifling. I am including a box of 20 rounds of Ammo, also. Yes Buffalo arms black powder 370 grn, ammo. Perfect for those montana buffalo poaching trips on Ted's private prarie, lol. Keep your brass and you can be reloading with a $50.00 set of dies. Much funner than percussion, lol.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters."

Because I only have 1 clip for it and it doesn't come with the original box, I am pricing it to sell.  I know the later generations are going for a lot more, but I am trying to price this one fairly.  This one has the NPV Austrian proof mark with the eagle and the shield which means it was actually assembled and tested in Austria in the late 80's to early 90's.  Some people think this makes it even more collectible.

It shoots great and is in good condition, but the slide is not as glossy and fresh looking as a newer pistol.  I tried to take some photos in good lighting to show a good representation.  I took it to the range last weekend and ran about 25 rounds through it and it functioned perfectly.

Hello, I have a Brand New Ruger 10/22 Semi-Automatic Rifle for sale. This rifle was only taken out of it's box for pictures. These rifles are hard to find and will be illegal to sell in New York after April 15, 2013 because of the 10 round detachable magazine. Private sales after March 15 will have to produce a N.I.C.S background check before the sale. They are 'OUT OF STOCK' in all the stores. Gander Mountain said they are not even on back order, they are nonexistent. Dicks will not even sell them. If you meet in Geneseo, NY or Dansville, NY and have cash I will sell the rifle for $375.00. If I meet you in the Rochester area, Batavia, Perry, Bath, or Canadaigua the cash price is $395.00. That's my lowest price.

Surely I am not being like those out that are asking 3000 to 2700 for them! The Ammo comes with it Sir and as per the Ammo it is the 1080 count tin and is opened but never shot any of it as our local range does not allow FMJ! Then I have 9 boxes of the Wolf WOA Polyformance Ammo 5.45x39 55 grain HP left ,and 30 to a box so that is 370 of those. I only used to of those boxes so 60 rounds instead of 40, Sorry about that statement but thought there were 20 to the box but slightly more, So the rifle has been shot 60 times now and sighted well at 50 and 75 yards so far. I have the bullet Trunion guide so you can use the standard AJ 74 mags in it and not JUST the Arsenal/Saiga ones. I have 6 Tapco 30 round Mags and then 4 factory 10 round Mags that come with it. So it will not shoot ALL forms of AK 74 mags! 

I am only charging you for the amount I paid for ALL Ammo and not what these guys are now! I do not do that gouging crap! The ONLY thing I paid a Super amount of money for Tapco 30 rnd mags and asking for that money back in the price and I bought those when this Gun Ban talk came up so I would have more and enough. I bought this rifle approx 6 months ago now. I have added this all up and I expect about a 15% loss of my original price everything I have invested so that is how I based it all! I itemized it all then took that much off. 

Bought Rifle, Scope ,Scope bracket,All Ammo,Trunion Bullet Guide Kit,Muzzle Break,Lifetime Nylon Sling,Higher quality Sling Brackets,Harris Elevational/Tiltable Bi Pod,6-Tapco 30 rnd Mags, 2 10rnd Tapco Mags and of course it came with one factory 10 rounder,and the extended mag release button! So with all that said I am willing to Nego.for it as I itemized it for myself. I could sell the ammo for more and make 300 more but not like that. 

I hope that gives you the general idea of what all I put into this rifle and ammo. Please feel free to call me at anytime! I am always up late!

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.

Sporter version. Non thumbhole stock and does not accept ak mags. Is 100% matching, original and real. Have green sling, cleaning kit that fits in stock, screwdriver type bayonet. Comes with a 30 rnd deatatcheable polymer Tapco mag and 860 rounds of various factory ammo (norinco steel core, Winchester, brown bear, golden bear, silver bear, Tula and wolf). I have owned for over 22 years. Less than 500 rounds shot thru it. Well taken care of and pristine condition. Again all numbers match. Is stamped Tucson AZ. Is also a legit DB stamp.  Here's the history:

In 1989 sks were stamped sporter or sks-m to be allowed for import after a 1989 ban. These rifles were fitted with Monte Carlo or thumbhole stocks. Also made and adapted to accept ak mags. Also had the bayo lug removed. The rifle I have has had none of the cosmetic changes yet is stamped sporter. Plus it has the DB stamp. That means deport Bangladesh. Some Chinese made sks were stamped this or DP(Pakistan) or DK(Kampuchea). DP typically adds 10% value. DK about 15-20%. And the most rare DB adding up to 50% based on condition. Many DP have been forged to appear DB. They are easy to tell due to the mis proportion of the humps of the B. so the sporter mis-stamp, DB stamp and #'s matching drives it to a collectors rifle. 
And when I mention the 1989 ban I don't mean the 1994 awb. The 1989 ban also ban import of norinco ammo which some is included with the rifle. A 20 rnd box of norinco was fetching 35-40 bucks before the paranoia after conn.
Also another change was the bolt carrier was changed on sporters with no slots for striped clips since they used ak removable mags and no stripper clip was needed. 
Most sporters had barrels shortened too.

If you're looking for a gun that nobody else at the range is going to have then this is it. The RTF2 has a finer, rougher texture than the Gen 4 model giving it much better grip in any wet condition. The RTF2 was made for police officers that were having trouble keeping a grip on the Gen 3 model with wet or bloody hands. It may be a rougher texture than the Gen 4 but its not at all uncomfortable in the hand or when carrying, I have another one that I carry iwb every single day and I refuse to carry anything else. The RTF2 also features very unique ""scalloped"" slide serrations that you arent going to find on any other Glock model.
