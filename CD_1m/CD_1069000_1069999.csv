Basically 2 guns in 1, but I now have 4 other Winchester 12/1300's doing each job seperately that's how much I like the Winchester pump over the Mossberg or Remington.

Tapco's Detailed Product Information:

""The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we've redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn't just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower. 

We've kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market.""

This is a NIB Windham Weaponry AR-15 SRC model: R16M4FTT. It comes with the factory hard case, one 30rd factory mag, sling, owner's manual, and 2013 catalog. I just received this yesterday and paid the current market price for one of these fine guns, so I'm not ""gouging"" any more than I have been gouged. If you don't know Windham, do some research. They are one of the best AR type rifles you can buy. Certainly much better than DPMS, Del-Ton, Spikes, and Bushmaster. They have a lifetime factory warranty that goes with the rifle, not the owner. In other words you could be the 10th owner and you still have a lifetime warranty from Windham, same as if you bought it new. This one is the flat top optics ready model with no front sight post to get in the way of your optics. After watching his majesty, lord-god Obama's speech the other night, I'm now really worried. Add to that the crap going on in our own State of Colorado and I'm pretty well convinced that you will not be able to buy an AR for much longer.

 The price is $1,550 firm. Which is about what it cost me after all shipping, credit card, and FFL fees. A limited number of extra mags are available: Windham factory mags or P-mags for $45 each. I will also sell some ammo with it, if needed. The good stuff, not that Russian steel case crap. Don't shoot that filthy ammo in an AR. It's ok to use in AKs though."

Gibbs Springfield 1903A4 Sniper rifle and 100 30.06 rounds,"Annandale, Northern Virginia, Virginia","$ 1,000","Listed On: Thursday, March 14, 2013",Rifles,Springfield                                                                                ,30-06 Springfield                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Gibbs Springfield 1903A4 Sniper Rifle. This rifle is SUPER clean with only 15-20 rounds through it. Shoots strait and kicks hard. I also have 100 rounds of 30.06 specifically made for this rifle and or a M-1 Garand. This rifle has zero blemishes and is in prestine condition. 
The Gibbs M1903A4 is built using original Remington-made World War II M1903A3 actions and turned-down bolts, which Gibbs obtained large quantities of when it purchase the rifle division of Parker-Hale in the 1990's. Gibbs then utilizes new-made 4-groove barrels made identical to the originals. Each receiver is carefully drilled and tapped using replicas of the original ""Redfield"" rings and mounts and an exact copy of the M73B1 scope, used on the 1st model M1903A4's. Each barreled action has the original military parkerized finish with polished blue stock furniture, again, identical to the originals.

The stocks are new-made ""C"" configuration with a linseed oil finish and have replica cartouches similar to the originals.

Each gun comes with a replica of the M1907 U.S. issued leather sling and OD Green canvas carrying case. The result is a firearm that comes out of the box in brand-new condition, ready for shooting, display, reenacting and field use. Not just exceptional in looks and finish, each gun is made to hold to the accuracy standards of the U.S. Government during World War II. ""We want our customers to know that they can achieve the same accuracy as World War II snipers with these guns"" stated Val Forgett, President of Forgett Militaria, LLC.

Like all replicas and historic remakes, the Gibbs M1903A4 has a number of features that intentionally distinguish it from originals, even by the casual observer. For instance, the barrels are marked with the modern dates of manufacture, unlike original barrels that would have had 1940's manufacturing dates.

A great compact pistol for collecting and/or service.

Grendel was a hot manufacturer of mostly high capacity weapons in the early 90's. 
When the first assault weapon ban came, Grendel silently faded away. They were resurrected 4-5 years later as KelTec, same owner, at same Florida location. Today, KelTec is the third largest manufacturer of handguns in the USA. If this Grendel resembles a KelTec you've seen that is why. The slide, frame and firing mechanisms are made of high strength steel, with high-impact strength polymer material for the grip, mag well, trigger, trigger guard and magazines. 

This is a lot of firepower in a very small package. The .380 cartridge is no slouch and many feel that it's about top of the line for a truly concealable pistol. This P12 is much smaller and lighter than compact high capacity 9mm's and .40's handguns. Gun comes all original; in the factory plastic case, manual, parts list and 2 magazines. Manual is 14 pages, very thorough on; features, operation, disassembly, parts and cleaning. 

Magazines holds 11 rounds, with one in the chamber (P12 = 11+1). 
Design of this pistol allows it to be carried safely with a chambered round. Fire mechanism is double-action with a low inertia safety hammer system for safe carry, thus not requiring an external safety.

636,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1069636,For Sale:  Vector Arms Underfolder AK47,"SW, by the new WalMart, Jacksonville, North Carolina","$ 2,000","Listed On: Thursday, February 28, 2013",Rifles,Saiga                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is one of the better AK builds you can buy, short of a Custom Job by Krebs.  This is a Vector Arms model AUSA underfoler.  It's an Armory USA receiver put together with a matching numbers Bulgarian parts kit, the exact same build that Krebs Custom uses for their underfolders.  This isn't some pieced together crap build, AUSA receivers are 1.5 mil steel, whereas the standard AK runs a 1.0 mil receiver.   As a point of comparison, the RPK Medium Machine Gun uses a 1.6 mil receiver for rigidity.  The Bulgarian parts kits used by Vector are mint, all numbers matching.  I've fired about 400rds through this gun.  I do have the cleaning rod for it, and though it's not in the pic, it will be included.  Sights are great, shoots well with no malfunctions, and the stock is pretty tight for an underfolder.  It has paracord along the left side of the folding stock, to make it a bit more comfortable while firing.  I've shot some folders that attacked you like a rabid pitbull when firing, but this is not one of them!

I've been watching piece of crap frankengun AKs and Romanian WASR 10s imported by  Century Arms go for 1000-1200 on this website, and on others.  This blows my mind since in early December you could find them for $450 in shops, and order them for less than $400 online. Unlike the vast majority of the AKs on the market right now, this is a quality rifle, which retailed for over twice what a CAI frankengun went for before the frenzy. 

I'll sell this gun with two magazines, and all wood furniture. The Ultimak Rail, as shown in the picture, will not be sold with the gun.  I will put the stock wood back on, and it matches the wood that you see in the pics.  I will also include 100 rounds of 7.62x39 Ulyanovsk FMJ with this rifle.

I'm not desperate to sell this AK, as it's the best AK I've seen/shot/handled in a very long time.  I'll take $2000 for it.  If you're an AK fan, and you appreciate quality, then you'll know the difference between a Vector and a CAI pot luck gun.   Please don't shoot me lowball offers, if you want a cheap AK, go buy one of those frankenguns. I'm open to reasonable offers though.  If you want a quality rifle, one of the best AKs you can get your hands on, shoot me a message.

Face to face only, must show DL and sign a bill of sale, per NC General Statute.

Please no offers for car stereos, tattoo work, etc.  I might knock off some cash on a partial trade transaction for guns and gun related items.  I am particularly interested in ruger LCPs, glock 19s, and mossberg 930 shotguns.  If you have a 930 JM Pro signature series I'll knock $1000 off the price."

TECHNICAL DETAILS ON THIS BOLT-ACTION:
1992 to 2006 Winchester Model 70
Starting in 1992, Winchester re-introduced many features of the pre-'64 rifles. The Post-'92 Model 70 is an extensive rifle line that boasts nearly all of the features of the original line, but with some updated equipment, such as the Controlled Round action and synthetic stocks. Popular variants feature black resin stocks, which hold up better than wood stocks over time. 

BALLISTICS DATA:
Many ballistics scholars consider the 7mm Rem-Mag ""the Most Ballistically Efficient Round"" available under .338 Lapua.
This rifle will send a 150-grain Federal Hi-Shok out the barrel at 3,110 feet/per-second with a muzzle energy of 3,220 foot-pounds.

On February 19 and 22, the Illinois House Judiciary Committee will hold hearings to discuss comprehensive gun control legislation.  We urge all Illinois residents to attend these hearings and urge legislators to oppose anti-gun legislation that does nothing more than penalize law-abiding gun owners by restricting the right to self-defense.  It is important that you plan to testify at these hearings and stand up for the Second Amendment in Illinois.  You can sign a witness slip to testify for either hearing date here.  The House Judiciary Committee may be limiting the amount of testimony they will hear, so it is important that you register your opinions with the online witness slip as soon as possible.

Dates, times and locations for both House Judiciary Committee hearings are listed below:

Tuesday, February 19th at 12:00 NOON

Room 114 Capitol Building in Springfield

My friends, there is hope. Law enforcement officers at the local level are making their stand and they want you to be a part of that. While I’ve written on various sheriffs that have made their own stance to protect their citizens from anyone attempting to confiscate guns, I recently ran across Police Chief Mark Kessler of the Gilberton Borough Police Department in Pennsylvania. He wants citizens to join with his police department in building a “reserve force” that will aid his police force should the need arise to resist Federal authorities when it comes to the Second Amendment."

the bore is nice and shiny and it is in a camo pattern that i cant identify but it lookd like the old army woodland pattern kind of. (i think its ugly but beauty is in the eye of the beer holder, lol). it can chamber the 3 1/2"" 12 Gauge magnum loads for turkey and waterfoul hunting. I have not shot it yet, so i cant tell you how it shoots, but it has good reviews. the saftey is mounted on the top of the grip so it is a good gun for lefties (I am one) and the slide lock lever is by the back of the trigger guard so it is fast into action. it has a 24"" barrel and bead sights. it is drilled and tapped to mount a scope. i believe it has a turkey choke but am unsure. you probably know more about it than i do.

NOTE: this shotgun is USED not new. it is also apparently an older model of the 835 with an un ported barrel. it has some very light scratching on the stock that you have to look hard to see and the slide rails show a little wear. i have pictures of all the wear areas except the scratches on the stock because they will not show on the pictures.

I am pretty open to trades, tell me what you've got worst i can say is no. I am in the market for a shotgun so first pick goes to them, failing that old S&W revolvers, small CCW pistols, or any good rifle, especially a lefty rifle.
