Are you a custom revolver guy? I've got an Old Model 357 Ruger revolver with the original lockwork that was converted to 44 special by Cosby Custom Gunsmithing.  That would be neat enough, but he also welded up and recontoured the topstrap like a SAA.  He case-colored the frame and hammer, shortened the barrel and ejector rod, swapped in a steel gripframe that he round-butted, and made the custom grips.  The owner's name is engraved on the backstrap.  A lot of work.  I figured I would be buried with it, but if you trade me a Baer for it, you can be buried with it."

As far as the modifications go, I've done the standard stuff you'll see with other Saiga's. UTG quad-rails, a Phoenix technologies recoil reduction stock with pistol grip conversion (NOTE: this is only a bolt on pistol grip, so the actual gun it self was not touched with a dremel tool to move the trigger like some modders do), a blackhawk 3-point sling with a rail-mount sling point from blackhawk as well, and a TruGlo red/green dot sight (simple sight with 5 brightness settings). Comes with the 5 round box mag that came with the gun as well as the original stock if you'd like that too. 

NOTE: the foregrip pictured has been sold.

This saiga is virtually new and unspoiled and is selling for less than any other saiga I've seen on here. If you're thinking about buying one, this is the deal you've been waiting for. I'm negotiable on the price as this is something that needs to be sold."

This is nothing less than an AK47 actual receiver with a removed bolt and de-milled charging handle. This function of the charging handle is real working, and the barrel has replaced with a .177 cal BB gun barrel. This version is the only one I have ever seen like this in this configuration. All the pictures online I have seen have the standard AK47 style wood for-grip. This version has a removable all aluminum picatanny rail housing around the barrel. The Canadians officials stated they could be converted to an actual AK47 by replacing the charging handle with bolt, barrel and gas tube. All true. This version also has a true Ak47 metal magazine not the plastic one (My Ak mag. fits it perfectly unlike the ones on the Youtube videos reviews I have seen check it out. I am looking for a 12 gage shot gun pump or semiautomatic. Even trade only. This BB rifle placed on the (Airgun Ads) could bring as much as $500 to $800.

This is a brand new Heritage Rough Rider RR22MB6 Single Action 22LR / 22 Mag Combination Revolver, Blue Finish, With Zombie Green Wood Grips. 

BRAND: Heritage Arms

Model: RR22MB6 

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

This stuff is very hard to come by! Secondary market prices are crazy. I am looking to get some silver, therefore I'm offering a trade. Looking for two Silver Dollars per brick (Eagles preferred). I have both hollow points and solid noise ammo. Remington, Federal, Winchester and some CCI. I understand this offer is not for everyone, but if you have some Silver and need some 22, we can make a deal. 
**** Local coin shop **** is advertising their buying price for your silver. 
They are paying $24.31 for Eagles and $18.05 for Morgans and Peace dollars. Do the math.
My trade value is one of the cheapest advertised prices for 22. May consider other, rounds, bullion and pre-65 silver coins, but a adjustment maybe necessary for condition and silver content. Thanks for reading, if any interest, reply to this post."

Factory New

Heritage Rough Rider 22 Combo Single Action Revolver Yellow Camo Grips.


Model RR22B4



Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state- of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

Insider trading is the trading of a public company's stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access to non-public information about the company. In most countries, trading by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, and large shareholders may be legal, if this trading is done in a way that does not take advantage of non-public information.

Now, are you claiming that those enterprising individuals who spend their own time and money to wait hours for Sportmans to open aren't entitled to the fruits of their labor? That they were doing so based on inside information? Yep, just another Occupy Momma's Basement wee-todd.

This is a crap-load of stuff for this package, I think it would make someone happy. Havent had any time to shoot lately so figured I'd go ahead and move it to get the gun I'd like to have rather than shoot it and end up liking it too much to part with it haha! 

If you'd like this gun you must be 21 and have a valid DL from MN and a PTP or PTC. 

I placed a call to kel-tec today and will be receiving an extractor, extractor spring, and screw in the mail this week, it was the only part there wasnt an ""extra"" for so figured i'd get one for someone to have. Kel-tec's warranty is awesome. You just tell them what you need and they send it free of charge to you. I will gladly mail it to you when it comes should you pick up the gun prior.

Hard Use Umbrella Corp Receiver. It's how we designate a receiver that might not be the prettiest thing to look at, but it gets the job done like a pro. You don't take these home to momma, you spend a few bucks and use them like the HUUCRs that they are. As Umbrella blems, they may very well look better than other manufacturers' standard parts, but even so these uppers may have some dents, dings, and anodizing issues. All of our standard upper receiver specs apply including M4 feedramps, no ""T"" markings, our deep laser engraved logo on top of the rail, along with a new surface mark to designate these as HUUCR uppers. Even though our standard uppers come fully assembled, it didn't seem right to offer these any way other than fully stripped.... Barrel assembly should be performed by a qualified Armorer: Mil-Spec AeroShell 33MS barrel nut grease is included.
