Best of all, the gun proved to be utterly reliable and accurate with all of the ammunition tested.

Price for the ammo is $50, and I am not interested in trades at this time. I will not ship ammo, will only drive in the springfield/nixa/ozark area, will not separate the ammo, and most importantly do not waste my time, as I do not want to waste yours. This is a hell of a deal btw, as each box retails at around 35 bucks apiece right now at walmart and is almost impossible to find. Best way to reach me is to email or text at 417-413-8five0seven, as I may not be able to answer your phone calls at all times. Thank you"

Rifle includes BCM upper with Stainless Steel 410 Barrel and Midwest Industries 9"" rail. Contact me if you would like more pictures as I can only list 3.  Extra information is below.  Please contact me with any questions you have.  Thanks.

BCM SS410™ Barrels
This BCM stripped barrel is machined from a 410 stainless steel. It features hand lapped button rifling with a 1/8 twist rate and M4 feedramps. As with all BCM barrels it is proofed (HPT) and magnetic particle inspected (MPI). To give the shooter the best balance of weight and accuracy this BCM barrel has a mid weight profile and a mid length gas system.
(410 stainless is a harder and more corrosion resistant than the conventional 416 stainless found in most barrels.)
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.


Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

I saw a DPMS lower stripped at a local shop today for 150, so your lower must cost less than that. I don't plan on reselling it to make quick cash like other people on here. Send me offers. New or used, as long as it is still in good shape. Cosmetics don't bother me. 

I am ONLY interested in either Aluminum MIL-SPEC lowers, or the ""new"" magnesium lowers. No plastic lowers, no exceptions. I have a permit, and legal to own a gun.

Again, I am not desperate to pay high prices for a lower, I am looking for a normal priced lower. If I change my mind and I do sell it, it will be for the same price. Gun owners should be helping each other out, not taking advantage of each other."

This scope kit is specifically designed to fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

Leave the power set on 2x or 3x in the field and you’re ready for close-in, fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For long shots at smaller targets, turn the power ring up to the full 6X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is a great combination of a lightweight mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.

Get to Walmart before 0700 and wait to see what they had in, get to Bass Pro or Cabela's right before they open to get your ammo as well.  It has worked for me and I have paid retail prices and not the shitty prices people post shit for on here.   Currently I have seen the following:

But those barrels were best suited only for light bullets, 55 grain. This new barrel has a 1 in 9"" twist that will stabilize heavier bullets, at least up to 69 grain. Bigger bullet = bigger knock-down on a tough enemy. Chambered for 5.56 NATO, so it is safe to shoot with 5.56 or civilian .223.

FLASH SUPPRESSOR: Current style A2 birdcage with no slots on the bottom. 

LOWER RECEIVER: Current style. The captive take-down pins are a minor improvement, but the biggie is the raised ""fence"" to guard the mag release. An accidental mag drop during a firefight is never cool. The current lowers are also reinforced in areas that sometimes broke on the early ones. This lower receiver is from JD Machine, San Diego CA.

UPPER RECEIVER: This Bushmaster A1 style upper receiver has the original style A1 sight, which in my opinion is more rugged than the later A2 sight. Also, this upper has the brass deflector which considerably improves the path of ejected cartridges away from your face. Especially vital for lefty shooters. Original finish. Good match to the lower.

OTHER FEATURES: Current tapered h/g slip ring; current round forward assist; front sight is old style round pin (new), not later square pin. Ejection port door is later style, used, with some finish wear. Butt-stock is the early 70's Type E, with storage compartment and a trap-door on butt-plate; room for a 4 piece cleaning rod and brushes (NOS set included). A1 hand-guards, pistol grip, and stock were refinished when I got them. I wiped over them with lacquer thinner on a rag and the paint did not come off, so we know at least it is not junk dollar store rattle-can stuff. Still, I would recommend against getting any super-potent solvent on the furniture, like acetone, carb cleaner, bore blaster, etc. Bolt carrier is a new semi-auto type, gas key screws correctly staked; bolt is used mil-surp with a new extractor, spring, and gas rings. Standard current manufacture internal parts including semi-auto fire control parts. New buffer and spring. New charging handle."

This .308 riffle has a M700 Stainless Steel barreled action with a 24 inch R5 Mil-Spec barrel and 11.25 inch twist rate with five lands and grooves and eleven degree target crown, This is the same type rifling used in the M-24 sniper rifles.  Has a black synthetic stock with aluminum bedding.  Remington makes a limited quantity of these riffles every year so they are hard to find."
