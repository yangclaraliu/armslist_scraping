Hello,
   Thank you for looking. I have one of the last NY legal High Powered Semi-Automatic Rifles Available. This is the Industry Standard for a High Quality, Reliable and Versatile Rifle. The stock, magazine and accessories are endless. This rifle shoots the .223 Rem and or the 5.56 NATO rounds. This is Brand New never fired or even loaded and comes with the Weaver Mounting Bar for that type of Scope, Ruger Scope Rings, allen wrenches and a Ruger Safety Lock. This is the Ruger Mini-14 Ranch Rifle that comes with a legal 5 round magazine. Promag makes a high quality steel 10 round magazine that is also NY legal. I will meet you in Dansville or Geneseo for deliver and you must have a valid NICS background check certificate. I will also sell the rifle in Pennsylvania across the border and No NICS Background Check is needed, but you must add $30 to the price for travel. I will not sell the rifle if you have been convicted of any felonies. Please email me with your phone number if you are interested.
                                                                     Thank you very much, Kirk"

Taurus M85 Ultra Light 38 Special +P Revolver Stainless Steel, 5 Shot



Ultra-fast. Ultra-reliable. Ultra-lightweight. It's no wonder the 85s are our most popular family. We pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special +P ammo making them powerful, easy to carry and lightning-quick to use. To many of our friends in Law Enforcement, these are must-have revolvers.

Plus P
Plus P rated for duty use. This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

 In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

 The ultra-compact 94 and 941 give you your choice of either .22 LR with a nine-round cylinder or the .22 Magnum with an eight round cylinder. We'll repeat that, 8 or 9 shots. This impressive innovation has become a favorite of shooters, writers and editors everywhere, as both the 94 and 941 feature single/double action triggers, adjustable sights and an extended ejector rod for faster reloading. Consider one for your nightstand, tackle box, or for endless plinking in the summer.


Transfer Bar The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

 Before the ridiculous gun law goes into effect July 1st, I am wanting to trade one or both (or more) of these diamonds for guns. The first diamond is a white diamond that weighs over .65 ct. It is a very old mine cut diamond that has been certified and appraised at $2250. I am looking to trade it for either a Kimber or Colt .45. I figure this should be about double the value of either handgun.
 Second, I have a certified black diamond that weighs over 9.5 cts. Try finding anything like this in any other jewelry store anywhere. This black diamond appraised at $3350. For this I would like to trade for either an AR-10 (.308) or some combination of Colt or Kimber .45. I would also be interested in a Colt python or anaconda as well!
 For the right trade, either one of these diamonds could be put in a custom setting.  We have a lot more stones and custom jewelry in stock that we don't put on our website if you are interested in anything else, please let us know.

I have put a hundred-fifty rounds through it (I suggest you use a rubber stock cushion as your body won't like this treatment much) and it shoots nice 3 MOA groups through tired old eyes. Bore is close to being mirror-bright but does show a little frost near the chamber.

This rifle functions perfectly. The extractor is so strong it will pitch a spent case 20 feet! Feed and cutoff are perfect, all the finish is strongly phosphated green save a black bolt, and the rebuild was done in 1944 at the Ogden arsenal.

It's an amazing piece that you would be proud to add to your collection. Offered for $550, cash only, no trades.

Rifle  was torn down and cleaned and made 922r compliant. A new trigger job was done smoothing the action and heat cured with Militec-1 molecular bonded dry lubricant for a nice finish. All told I dropped another 525.00 on a rifle I paid 800.00 for. There is still an issue with the rifle. The bolt closure & lockup will not close fully when loaded, but will cycle fine empty ?? According to the gunsmith, this is because of the weak closure spring. He field tested the rifle and had no issues according to Him so this is My problem to solve. I have the 922r compliance sheet and the build sheets from the gunsmith too if You want to know what was done. So this rifle is a roll of the dice. Spend 50.00 dollars on some wood furniture and iron out the problem and  You get a good entry level rifle to play with for decent price."

It is a K98k, dou marked, a Russian capture gun. I had it re-stocked with a military profile walnut stock, and a Leupold scope mount tapped into the top of the chamber. The entire rifle was configured with new parts from Numerich, it was bead-blasted and blued (the finish is unique and beautiful), and I had the rifle chambered in 6 mm Remington, because I wanted a fast, flat-shooting cartridge. It's had an action block installed in the magazine to prevent the short-action cartridges from moving forward under recoil, and the action has been slicked up to function with the new caliber as well. It's got a Timmney trigger and Bueller-style safety which clears the scope bell nicely - speaking of that, I've mounted a nice Nikon Monarch 3-12x40 scope with a side parallax adjustment as a telescopic sight.

With my handloads the rifle shoots moderately well, (1.5 MOA) but it's no mega-tack driver (although with the right reloader behind the press, it could show it's true capabilities). If you're buying it for that purpose, you can get a rifle these days for $400 that will bench under a minute. This rifle oozes CHARACTER, and attracts huge attention on the line during a competition shoot.

Offered for $800 with dies, brass for about 100 rounds,, some loads ready to shoot, and nearly 800 Hornady 105-grain bullets. 

For background check, kindly arrange for a place for us to meet (your favorite FFL) - you will be responsible for paying this fee."

Had it checked out by a gunsmith and the following observations were made. This appears to be a new barrel due to the fact there is full rifling at the muzzle. When testing with a commercial grade ""no-go"" gauge, it will not close. That's a good thing in case you are not familiar with them. The stock does have some obvious wear marks, but overall is a very nice gun. The rifle comes in a CMP hard case with the Certificate of Authenticity, and original CMP instruction manual. Rifle is shipped within two days of the payment clearing. Fixed shipping applies to lower USA only, Alaska or Hawaii will need to pay actual shipping. Payment with a USPS money order for faster shipment or a bank money order that will need to clear prior to shipment. Credit cards accepted for additional 3% charge. So that there are no issues, I will ship to an FFL, or C&R holder only. Please email me with any questions.

Dual-tone, has magazine disconnect but is prior to the key lock.  VG condition.  Frame has some discoloration that has always been there.  If you've never fired a Bersa you will be amazed at the smoothness of the trigger.  Both DA and SA the trigger pull has virtually no creep, is consistently smooth throughout the travel.  The ""safety"" functions as a decocker.  Read the article about the Bersa Thunder (very similar to the Firestorm...they share some parts) in gunblast.com.  This firearm is an outstanding value in today's market."

It is a modified New Model type with a seven and a half inch barrel. It is well used but never mistreated, with some small nicks and bare spots toward the muzzle, a narrow band of tiny pitting spots in a line on one small section of the cylinder, and some carry wear and finish loss on the handle backstrap. Where the blue remains, however, it remains quite deep and can be quite striking in the right light.

This weapon has been lightly--and, if need be, reversibly--customized, with a Power Custom hammer that both tightened and slicked up the action considerably and also added an extra notch so that, like the ""old model"" Blackhawks, it can be set to half-cock. This allows the the chambers to index neatly with the loading gate when reloading. Current owners of unmodified New Model Blackhawks will understand the difference, and the awkwardness of having to hold the cylinder just so rather than it simply clicking into the right spot. It also adds a delightful extra ""click"" to the cocking action. Essentially you get all the advantages of both the old and new model Ruger actions: the hammer bar safety allowing it to be safely carried with all six chambers loaded, and the extra cocking notch for proper indexing and that classic ""feel.""

A well used gun, but a very fun one to shoot with an action that feels better and tighter than a factory new one. I've upgraded to a Freedom Arms model for my big-bore single-action needs and don't really need this Ruger anymore, but I don't particularly need to get rid of it either.  The listed price is how much money I have in the gun plus the custom parts, but I'm well aware that the nature of custom guns is you can't reasonably expect to get back the same amount back out. Make whatever offer you would consider fair, and I will consider it.

Also note that it comes with all of the original parts, which can be easily reinstalled without alteration, as well as a number of extras. Several Wolff mainsprings of varying weights. A Power Custom alternative pawl that would allow the cylinder to spin in both directions when the gun is NOT set to half-cock, but was never installed as it requires minor gunsmithing to fit that I never got around to. The gun is pictured wearing Hogue Micarta grips (I find the extra thickness to take the sharpness out of the recoil), but it will also come with its well worn walnut originals. I'll even throw in its old leather Western style holster, which is nothing special but quite functional."

Any Benelli with the extended magazine, which doesn't have enough additional US made parts is a felony to own. This weapon is 100% LEGAL! Included in the sale are all receipts proving US origin of parts, the original magazine tube, follower, and hammer, the original box, a Cabela's soft case, and all manufacturer's documentation.

It's had approximately 100 rounds fired through it. I am selling it as I'm soon moving to a state with less accepting gun laws. My loss is your gain!
