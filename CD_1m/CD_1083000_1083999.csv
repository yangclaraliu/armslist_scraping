Although the ammo is available, these rifles are not. Very hard to find a complete S&W. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. Please just compare apples to apples. Complete M&P15R to complete M&P15R, that is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of their rare discontinued status these will continue to climb in value even after the market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson is pleased to announce the M&P15R Rifle (along with the new Upper Receiver Assembly). This new rifle is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifles come with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

Although the ammo is available, these rifles are not. Very hard to find a complete S&W. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. Please just compare apples to apples. Complete M&P15R to complete M&P15R, that is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of their rare discontinued status these will continue to climb in value even after the market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson is pleased to announce the M&P15R Rifle (along with the new Upper Receiver Assembly). This new rifle is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifles come with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

I do have quite a few and basing my price less than the going rate on Gunbroker.com. I want $150.00/brick which is 500 rounds in each brick or 10 boxes of 50 in nice hard plastic containers. Prices on Gunbroker are running $160.00/500 and the shipping runs another $25.00, so my price is $35.00 less per 500. All transactions are to be done face to face and you must be 18 years of age. If you only want a box of 50 and I have to break up a brick ach box will cost $20.00. Boxes of 50 are selling for $35.00 on Gunbroker + $7.00 S&H which is $42.00/box so I am $22.00 les per 50 round box in comparison. Ammo is just going to continue to rise so get them while you can and while it's still available."

Although the ammo is available, these rifles are not. Very hard to find a complete S&W. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. Please just compare apples to apples. Complete M&P15R to complete M&P15R, that is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of their rare discontinued status these will continue to climb in value even after the market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson is pleased to announce the M&P15R Rifle (along with the new Upper Receiver Assembly). This new rifle is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifles come with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

Bolt Carrier Group: Nickel-boron coated M16 Full-auto bolt carrier group, MP and HP tested
Lower: Complete New Frontier Armory LW-15 Lower

These rifles also come with a rear sight, charging handle, 2-point padded sling, and a 30 round PMAG.

These rifles are 100% ready to go, just add ammo. They have been laser bore sighted and test fired for functionality. The barrels are extremely nice and made by FN USA, the chrome lining will keep the barrel in top shape longer than you can afford to shoot it. The upper is built completely to mil-spec and features M4 feed ramps for more reliable feeding. And the bolt carrier groups are of the M16 variety, the gun is only semi-automatic but the bolts are built to be used in automatic weapons and will hold up much better than most which are only built to meet the .223 ar-15 semi-auto specs, they are also coated in nickel boron which reduces friction, requires less lubrication, lasts longer, and is incredibly easier to clean. These are not home brewn parts guns, they are barreled upper assemblies that have been factory assembled and headspaced, with a bolt carrier group installed, and pinned to a complete factory built lower, buy with confidence.

I have about $400 I can spend and well, looking to get the most out of it like anyone else. 

Mossberg/Maverick 20 gauge  in the $175 range
Mossberg/Maverick 12 gauge  in the $175 range
38 or 380 revolver ( entry level lower end but not old junk) in the $175 range
sks (not perfect maybe needing some work) in the $300 range
Mosin sporter or any mosin really in the $120 range
older HiPoint carbine in the $200 range
Hipoint pistol in the $150 range
.22 lr semi auto pistol, I have had some target time with a few different semi's but never owned one so I am open to just about anything really in my budget, just wanting something cheaper to shoot then 9mm and .40 cal and something besides the s/a's I currently own.

I am legal, able and currently own firearms, Have valid ID and 10 + year Ohio Resident.

I know the market is weird but what I like to shoot and own is not really in higher demand (besides maybe the sks, I am just hoping for that non#'s matching diamond in the rough).    

Mosin wise, I am not really a purist so the sporter has been and always will be fine with me. All I ask in regards to the Mosin is the bolt not be sticky.  

Hipoint wise, I am cheap, they are cheap, I own two and would not mind owning another in a different caliber. I think it would be fun to own one in each.   

Revolver wise, I prefer a lower end edc piece in .38 .380 but am open to others.

Like I mentioned above, I don't have much to spend so if I can come out with two items I want then I am pretty happy. I am a great guy to deal with, have meet a few people from here over the last few years, normally @ Bass Pro or Dicks in Colerain (either preferred) and always had a great experience.

Yes , you get the warranty from the manufacturer beginning  from first day of purchase  so hurry up and get your brand new rifle  Now. - Totally unfired, unhanded, and fresh from the factory.

Why settle for a rifle that is advertised as  ""a few rounds fired through it for testing and zeroing of scope etc...""   which is a sneaky way of saying ""USED Rifle that doesn't work for sale""  !!  

Ask about the warranty on any of those rifles my guess is NO WARRANTY IS IN EFFECT ! So why pay the price of a new rifle when it's not new ? Some of them are actually 15 YEARS OLD !!!! 

This brand new rifle comes complete with all factory components , accessories, and packaging none of which have been tampered with in any way .

And NO I will NOT include a cheap red dot scope as an enticement for you - if you want such a piece of junk I'll give you the $30 to get one but I'll have nothing to do with cheap Optics. Sorry but junk is junk DON'T BUY IT because it 'adds value"" or ""I'll sell it later for money to buy a good one""  NO YOU WON'T NO ONE WANTS THAT JUNK. I see such optics on almost every ad, don't waste you rmoney IT WILL NOT HOLD ZERO AND YOU WILL WASTE MORE $1 ammo trying to keep it ""dialed in"" than a new good quality scope will cost."

This one shows some holster wear that would be consistent with a gun of this vintage, but overall, is in good condition. Though the MK III series Colts weren't known for a particular graceful DA pull (like the Python was), I can honestly say that the single action trigger on this gun is one of the finest I have come across. In SA, it feels like a match grade trigger. I'm looking to get $500. Might be willing to trade for a nice S&W 4"" .357 revolver. Face to face, GWL and DL required."

If you are in the market for a 44 Magnum, you can't do wrong with the Smith & Wesson 629. 
This revolver is in very good shape. The lock up is rock solid. This was my woods carry gun, so there are holster rub marks and small scratches. 
Here is how it breaks down: 
•Stainless Steel
•6.5” Barrel
•Hogue Rubber Grips and Wood Grips (small chip)
•Orange Hi Viz Front Sight Blade and four additional Sight Blades
•Original blue plastic box (matching serial number)
•Factory Manual, Warranty Card and Target, dated 12/22/98
•2 Speed Loaders (HKS)
•Camo Nylon Holster (Uncle Mikes)
•Leather Holster (DeSantis)
•Custom, one-of-a-kind Bladetech Kydex/nylon drop-leg “concealment” rig
•50 rounds of PMC Bronz 180 gr JHP
•25 High Quality hunting rounds 
•21 FMJ rounds


The drop leg is something to behold! Bladetech made the holster and provided the drop-leg platform. SKT Industries made the concealment pouch. (I probably have $600 in ths rig!) I designed it several years ago when bowhunters were required to carry concealed if they were carrying a sidearm. It can come apart and be used as a regular owb Kydex holster, or on the drop-leg, or with the concealment shroud over it. I was going to put a red cross patch on it but never got around to it.
