Description of Kit:
M962 KIT01
This kit contains everything needed to equip a Picatinny-railed long gun with a close- to medium- range incandescent white light illumination tool. Included filters allow you to convert white light output to infrared, red, or blue light. Included diffuser provides an evenly distributed flood beam for close range or interior applications. Included opaque cover protects against impact, dust, and mud, and prevents light escaping during stealth approach or operations. Flip-up feature on filters/diffuser/cover permits instantly reverting to white light output. Nylon fabric carrying case keeps it all with room for additional batteries or lamps.

One M962XM07 Millennium® Universal WeaponLight

(This is not an Original, but a High Quality Copy).  It is in Very Good condition; with about 200 miles on it.  

There are some minor paint chips, and light riding wear, but I do have touch up paint for it.  This has been totally hand crafted in metal, including the frame and gas tank.

These types of motorbikes are impossible to find.  It is stored heated indoors.  This is perfect show piece for any collector, business, or man cave, or ready to ride once the weather warms up.  It is is perfect running condition...

This was obtained from a private collector on a trade, who only had it for show.  This is 100% street legal to ride on WI streets AS A BICYCLE, USING THE BICYCLE LAWS, if you want to ride it in the warmer weather.  This Retro Motorbike can never be made into any Larger Engine, or Registered as a Motorcycle because of all the State and Federal DOT Safety Requirements (aka headlights, mirrors, directional's, brakes, frame, engine size, fuel tank, etc...).  No MC License, registration, insurance, needed to ride, because you follow WI bicycle laws.  Moped, scooters, and MC need all that, but since this has pedals to start and stop, so it is not considered a MC, but a bicycle....

The only time you ever see these are in museums, and never offered.  I rode this last year and I got all the looks and attention whenever I bring it out to the public...  I rode this down to the museum several times, and whenever I stop somewhere and park it next to all the big bikes, everyone comes over and checks it out.  More attention then custom MC's because you never see these on the road...

The ones paying these outrageous prices are the ones causing this frenzy. Sellers try to sweeten the deal by saying they will give you 1 P-Mag or 100 rounds of ammo... Sit back, stay calm and things will begin replenishing. I purchased (2) 100 round value packs of .223 at Wal-Mart this morning for $39 a pop. They also had (1) Sig Enhanced AR for $900.

It has a 16.1” chrome lined barrel with a 1 in 7” twist. 

The barrel has a removable/replaceable standard A2 Bird Cage flash hider. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories.

I can +/- cash depending on the offer.

 Currently in service with several branches of the U.S. military and overseas, the Leupold Mark 4 Tactical spotting scope is ideally suited for use as part of a shooting team. The success of every mission relies on a perfectly executed shot derived from exacting observation and range estimation. The LEUPOLD Mark-4 12-40x60 Tactical Spotting Scope, Duplex Mil-Dot Reticle (67180) utilizes a front focal Duplex Mil-Dot Reticle so the spotter and sniper can estimate range at any power setting. Powerful, with bright, clear optics, it's also supremely rugged and waterproof. It's for all these reasons that the Mark 4 spotting scope is highly prized by hunters and shooters everywhere, as well.

The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

This gun also includes a 33 round Glock OEM magazine as well as the magazine it came with. This gun is NEW in box!!!  Would consider partial trade for 7.62 x 39 ammo and payment. 
The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. 

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation."

No other semi-automatic rifle has captured the imagination of the shooting public like the SG 556 series rifle. For years this legendary Swiss made rifle has been restricted to law enforcement and military sales where it has continuously built on its reputation for outstanding performance, accuracy and durability. SIG SAUER offers the U.S. produced version as the SIG556, which is available to the general consumer and law enforcement markets. The SIG556 features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by SIG's sister company Swiss Arms and marries it to a trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle's weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines."

This shoots the 7.62x39 round that still is sometime found at wall mart for 25c per round and online if you act quick for under 30c per round.
I got this as a ""project"" some kid ""bubba'd"" up, added all these weird bells and whistles an AK shouldnt have. I found some wood, re finished it with a oil absed finish like romaninan guns are actually finished it, used Iodine to darken up the wood after i sanded it really nice (still romanian wood tho...) I added a USA PG so that it is very 922r complians ( 3 trigger pieces, piston, PG and 3 mag pieces) making it have 8 compliant parts when it only needs 6...
I polished all the internals and painted it with a bake on paint job, got the missing pieces like cleaning rod under the barrel, the real ""slant"" muzzle brake.
It has some issues, it has some FTE meaning sometimes the rounds dont get out of the gun fast enough, I think it either needs a recoil buffer (5$) or new springs for the extractor (5$) or the recoil spring (8$ and if you got this spring might not need the buffer)
Also the guy drilled 4 random holes in it, 2 are tiny, 2 are about 1/8""
WHY? I dont know, I dint see those ones til I bought it.
It is sound though, but the AK is too rough for my liking, I guess next to my AR or my Arsenal AK it seems to be not getting the attention it deserves. I refuse to get into this damn Panic selling prices, so I am priceing this at 50$ above what they cost pre panic.
500$ that was for the paint job, the extra parts WASR are always missing etc.
What you need is to have a Oregon DL and better yet a CHL, I want to see it and know you are legal to own this. I dont want to see your address etc, just your face on a current OR ID/DL/CHL one of them.
I want you to come to me, Ill meet somewhere near by.
Lastly I wont take under 500$ for it, this is the best deal you'll get these days, look on here people get ones in same +/- condion wanting 1100, 1300, 1500$
what dicks!
Come and get it
Comes with everything picture, 1 tapco like new mag, gun and the attached cleaning rod.
Has ALL MATCHING #s from what I see not that that matters much but it does make it a little cooler as most come in with 2-3 serial numbers.
pictures attached of the stupid bubba holes that dont effect anything. Even if some one were to buy a barreled parts kit it would cost them 450 if you could find it! and this bore looks great, but then again AKS can take 50,000 rounds easy under full auto fire in sand boxes, and semi auto civilan versions 100k plus rounds no problem!

I am selling the gun because I have grown tired of it and would like to make room in my safe for future guns. I do not shoot it nearly enough to justify keeping it around. It needs a good new home with someone who will shoot it more than I do. I have about 500 rounds through it with 0 malfunctions, it was unfired before I owned it. This puppy eats everything you feed it and is not too shabby in the accuracy department (2-5 inch groups typically at 100 yards, and I am by no means the best shooter).
