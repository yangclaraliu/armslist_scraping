The NHM-91 went for 900-1200 before the shootings, and the VZ-52s are not cz-52 surplus.  I could write paragraphs about why this is one of the best aks ever made...one thing the Chinese did right is their gun clones...excessively overbuilt which leads to a long service life. Comparing it to wasrs ...let's just say this. First hand military accounts of wartime use  shows the MILITARY GRADE Romanian aks weren't even liked....much better constructed than the civilian wasrs that aren't even designed to take high cap mags....not trying to offend anyone...I'm just annoyed when people don't take the time to research a gun before they buy it and expect my gun to be worth the same as a gun half the quality.

Stainless. 223. Shot very little maybe 100 rds.  I am aware that most people think of Mini 14's as a 800 gun... as do I, but even without the current gun ban talk Ruger is now charging almost a grand MSRP bare gun, check their website. I am pricing this gun as to what it would take to replace in normal times. With that said, i don't believe i could replace this gun for what i am asking if i wanted to. And this is one of the top guns on the ban list! Unlike AR's with 50 companies making them, the mini 14 is only made by Ruger and will hold value better even if ban does not happen. All extras are included in price. As  stated below best offer gets it, and i am open to trades, i will give you fair value for yours.

Comes with six quality mags.: 3-30rds, 2- 20 round and original 10 round flush mag.

I have had a stainless tactical flash suppressor/ front sight added by a gun smith. (Cost was around $130)

Attached is a stock photo of the 870 Express 7 shot so you know what I'm talking about.

Might be interested in a standard (short tube, wood, etc) 870 if it has an 18-20 inch barrel. Not interested in a standard 28"" barreled gun. The cost of making it what I want would be prohibitive with new 18-20"" barrels running $140 plus.

Willing to pay a reasonable price depending on model and condition. For a price check I saw a standard Remington 870 Express 7 shot (in stock) for $425 brand new so don't bother telling me you have a used one for $550.
Basically if you want MSRP plus for a used gun (like a car a gun is used the minute it leaves the shop the first time) save us both time and don't contact me. I am a guy who likes to save a few bucks by getting a used gun with a couple scratches, not a desperate felon.

The only accessory I might be interested in purchasing as part of the deal is a quality (surefire/ streamlight/ insight)for end light. The light/ forend would have to be a pretty decent deal for me to be interested.

Can pay cash or trade for guns/ gun related items. Would like to meet in the greater Sierra Vista area (Benson, Herford, Palaminas, etc)but for the right deal might go to Tuscon.

Let me know what you have and how much you want for it. Thanks for your time."

I bought this gun to restore and use just for fun, but I have quite a few projects going so trying to sell it as is.

The gun could use a good cleaning but as is cycles great. I figure I would throw it up here and see if I can sell it, if i cant get a decent buck for it i might just finish the restore and then try and sell it.

It has Magpul adjustable 6 position sliding stock, pistol grip, trigger guard, sling mount, and hand guard all in OD Green.  There is a 20 round Pmag and a single point tactical sling in the same OD green to match the furniture.  Also has Magpul rails, a vertical grip, NcStar rear adjustable peep sight, new front sight (with a crosshair built into the winged sight) with bayonet lug and front sling, muzzle brake, UTG red/green dot sight with quick-release riser mount and flip-up covers, UTG flashlight with pressure switch that mounts on the side rail.  The pressure switch for the light needs to be remounted on the vertical grip (there's a little bit of damage/residue from where the glue had pulled off from the previous owner).  

I'm also including 2 brand new 30 round Gen2 Magpul Pmags in the plastic, the factory hard case and, since it's impossible to find ammo these days, 100 rounds of PMC Bronze .223 ammunition in the box (not pictured) to get you started.

This is a lightly used gun.  It shows some sign of wear but is in great shape with no abuse.  A few marks on the rear sling post, the aforementioned residue from the pressure switch mounting, etc.  It works great in the daylight or at night, however, and is very accurate as well as lighter than your standard AR, even with all the extras attached.

I'm hoping to get cash for this to pay some unexpected bills, so I'm not really looking for trades at this time.  However, if you have a gun you need/want to get rid of and are willing to add cash to it I may consider a trade.  Lowballers will be ignored.  I'm willing to drive a little ways to meet if you're coming from a long distance away.  Prefer face to face meeting with cash only, although I am willing to ship to your FFL dealer at your cost.  Wisconsin ID required, and CCW preferred so I know you have a clear background.  If you have any questions (other than ""do you still have this?"") please feel free to contact me."

My name is Mickey and I've been a tattoo artist for about 9 years now. I worked in a well known and rather busy shop for just over 6 of those years. I've had my work published in magazines and books, I have won several awards for my work, but most importantly I take great pride in the work I do!!!

After finding the industry is full of less than savory characters, who for whatever reason have the idea tattoo artists are gods when in all reality we draw pictures for a living, how is that worthy of treating people like crap...so I left to start my own shop with a partner......unfortunately that didn't go according to plan so I once again packed my equipment and left. 
So now I just focus all of my attention on my very well established clientele from home, or I travel to them. 

Anything from black and grey, full color, traditional, new school, realistic, lettering, you name it and I can do it! Everything I do is 100% custom drawn by me so your guaranteed to never see the same piece ANYWHERE, although I can recreate any image I'm given.

I have the blood borne pathogens courses under the belt, red cross certified, and use all sterile tools. I have my own sterilizer which is regularly tested to insure it's doing it's job.
For whatever reason if the tattoo ever needs a touch up, it's guaranteed for life! Anything less that guaranteed for life is a slackers excuse in my opinion.

I charge roughly $100/hr depending on travel time and all that. I also highly respect the people that serve our country, without them who knows where we'd be, so 10% discount to those who have served, past or present.

If you're interested in getting some new work, or even some work that needs fixing, let me know. Open to trade for firearms and other firearm related items, make an offer and I'm sure we can work something out.


Thanks for looking.
Email is best at first as there is quite a few people who would call at odd hours when I posted the first time."

The Huldra 5.56 Carbine TU-C Upper (Tactical Upper – Carbine) 16"" is a M4 profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms Piston technology and a tactical extended free floating forearm. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating quad rail was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 10” rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you more rail space for whatever your tactical needs may be. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler and longer than any other AR upper you own. This model is only available online and is not sold in stores."

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM™) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups, charging handles or handguards.

As a note:  BCM™ barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly.  Prior to shipping, all BCM™ upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy.  As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.

Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH™ series of barrels are made right here in the USA!  (Just like all the BCM products.)

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

The 92FS, Beretta's premier full metal gun, most resembles the military M9 9mm pistol. Accurate out of the box, this workhorse features an open slide design that virtually eliminates jamming, a safety system that combines de-cocking with a slide-mounted positive thumb safety, and a combat muzzle crown. Beretta's proprietary black, non-glare Bruniton finish gives your 92FS a wear-resistant coating, which means it will stand up to any special duty. The Inox model features a stainless steel slide and barrel designed for corrosion resistance.

I always looked at it like this, if you're wanting a top of the line AR. Then, why use cheap ammo, tear up your high dollar firearms, & defeat the concept of it's purpose for accuracy? A accurate rifle is an interesting rifle. This M4 is very accurate, a tac driver (grouped in the same holes), & loved Hornady custom ammo. No two rifle's rifling is ever the same. Some more accurate than others, & when you have an accurate rifle like this stacking holes in my opinion is rare.

*****Hurry, cause from most of the offerings others are presenting out there are not as sweet like this package!
