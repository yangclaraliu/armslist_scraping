Critical DUTY® handgun ammunition is built to meet the needs and requirements of LAW ENFORCEMENT and TACTICAL PROFESSIONALS, as well as those law abiding citizens who prefer a full-size handgun for their personal protection and demand superior barrier penetration and subsequent terminal performance.*

FlexLock CutawayThe FlexLock® bullets loaded in all Critical DUTY® offerings are rugged, heavy jacketed bullets that deliver virtually “barrier blind” performance (i.e. total penetration, weight retention and expansion are practically the same) when shot through common urban barriers* (bare gelatin, auto glass, sheet metal, plywood, drywall, heavy clothing*). In addition, Critical DUTY® loads are “full power loads” designed to function full-size handgun slides. Although designed to work flawlessly in ALL handguns, these loads are NOT optimized for short barreled, concealed carry style handguns; they will deliver standard recoil during firing.

I have put sling swivels on this as well so I could put a bi-pod and sling on it (sling and bi-pod not included).

The factory iron sights shoot about an inch high and to the left at 25 yds, I never adjusted them just threw a scope on it. I should have the factory box for the scope and the rifle if the buyer wants it.

Here's a nice old Ithaca Model 37 in 12 gauge. It has a 30"" full choke barrel and the desirable corn-cob forend. The wood is in good condition with normal wear, and a mark on the right side of the butt stock. It has not been sanded or refinished. It has the original Ithaca butt plate and it a nice, honest, old Ithaca.

The bottom-eject on these Ithacas make them appealing to both right- and left-handed shooters. These also make great home defense guns because they are so easy to operate, and the safety is right by the trigger finger instead of on top of the tang like most modern guns. These older Ithacas are really nice all-around shotguns, great for hunting, or shorten the barrel for a home defense gun. They just don't make them like this anymore.

This will ship from a private individual via FedEx for $30 to any of the 48 states. Hawaii and Alaska will cost more. Make sure your dealer will accept shipment from an individual. If your dealer requires that this be shipped from a dealer, shipping will be an additional $20 for my dealer's fee. However, my dealer cannot ship to California.

A very nice gun and is fun to shoot. I have tried to provide photos of about every possible angle. The is a mark on the top of the barrel and I have tried to show this in the photo.

This Savage has the tactical stock, which is really nice, and a threaded barrel so it's ready for a suppressor. It also comes with the factor-supplied scope rail and factory magazine.

This will ship from a private individual via FedEx for $30 to any of the 48 states. Hawaii and Alaska will cost more. Make sure your dealer will accept shipment from an individual. If your dealer requires that this be shipped from a dealer, shipping will be an additional $20 for my dealer's fee. However, my dealer cannot ship to California.

More photos available, just ask."

I have original box and a iphone4 dock included with this, besides a new iphone cover which I never put on it.  unit also has screen protector currently installed and there has been one since day 1, so screen is SUPERB.  
Battery holds charge just fine.  old microSIM is slotted and included, in case you want to cut out your Tmobile SIM down to use this without a contract, this way you have a template :).  No cords (except the audio cord pictured) are  included - wife and kids immediately took these away from me the moment I got my new i5.  What I will include for you - is a new audio cable - used one at work to listen to pandora, however found a sealed extra one - has USB for charging, 30pin connector and a female 1/8 audio jack = so I had it charging via USB from my laptop and a desktop speakers connected to the audio female jack (thus apple plug has audio out via a plug vs. using iphone native headphone jack).
Reason it looks new (despite being used by me) is because it was always cased when carried (with a screen protector) and the only time it came out of the case is when it was plugged into my vehicles's THB bury cradle...

Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Stainless is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today. 

P232 stainless with SIGLITE® Night Sights comes with Hogue finger groove rubber grips. The stainless model with contrast sights come with polymer factory grips."

I had a friend of mine, who's an antique gun collector, look at it and give me some information. It's from Suhl, Germany made in the mid 1800's. The inscription between the barrels says FR. JUNG u. SOHNE in Suhl. Inside the break it also says RIEDER, and has a number of markings. This gun is very ornate, with a lot of decorative engravings (too many to picture), including two doe, a buck, mule deer, bore, fox, and a hound. Because of the animals, we are guessing it was made for someone in the US. It also has a horn grip, carved cheek-pad, engraved side plates and hammers, a spring-door compartment in the stock with engraved door/cover, and the barrels have a design on them (fading near the end). This gun is absolutely beautiful, and in great condition for it's age. There are two things I noticed that need mentioning...first, near the end of the forearm, both sides have broken pieces (the tip of the forearm is fine), and one of the decorative screws is missing from the stock-compartment door that holds a piece of leather to keep the shells from making noise inside the stock (see pictures). My friend told me these screws were commonly used in many guns of that era, so would probably be very easy to find and replace. These are 16 Gauge Side by Side Damascus Barrels, the lenght is about 30.5"", and the overall weight is about 5.5 lbs. I have taken a number of pictures to show condition and markings, and can email more if you are SERIOUSLY interested. If you have any questions I will do my best to answer. This gun does not requre an FFL so I can ship it directly to you.

Manufacturer info: 

MUR at a glance: 

Construction 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved; heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. Compatibility Fits all AR-type lower receivers made to Milspec standards. Will fit all select-fire AR-15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. Will fit most of the semi-auto AR-type lower receivers (currently available). Weight MUR-1A (with assist) weighs less than 10 oz. The MUR-1S (shell deflector only) weighs less than 8 oz. Dimensions Height of rail (from the centerline of the bore): 1.215”. Color/Finish Black matte (anti-reflection/glare) Hard coat anodized (Type-III, Class 2). Bore’s surface in coated with dry film lube, over the anodized surface. Special Features Improved strength over conventional forged “flat-top” upper receivers. Stronger than any “billet” upper receiver with similar material and dimensional characteristics. Tighter manufacturing tolerances, when compared to the competition. The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly. MUR-1A (with bolt assist) showing the right side. Mounted to the MUR-1A is a CASV-S rail/handguard system. The MUR comes in two models: one with Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector (part# MUR-1A) and the second with Shell Deflector only (part# MUR-1S). Vltor offers the selection at the time of purchase, but does not offer a service to exchange the Bolt Assist or Shell Deflector. The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available. The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

everything is negotiable, cash or trade? just call me up talk or ask questions whatever.
but like i said 60$  OBO would take home it all.


got a romanian wood ak stock with some engraveing on the side. 15$

2 messed up modifyed saiga parts one is a cutdown butstock to pistol grip type deal. other is a handguard that could be salvaged possibly. someone modifyed it and did a horrible job. i think it could be salvaged with bondo or some type of filler. 10$ for both

then theres a perfect original saiga rifle or shotgun stock has izmash symbol in white tape on the side. was going to put it on the other side paint it and peel the tape off to effectivly have the saiga symbol perm on the original stock....but decided against it. given how hard it was to put it on there that perfect i just left it on there. can peel right off though! 10$

then theres a romanian or maybe a yugo type lower handguard....idk? it worked on a converted saiga with handguard retaining bracket though. has small hole in it, 10$ 

then theres a East german upper handguard ak part made from brown plastic 5$ 

heres the nicest thing for sale its a Saiga rifle OR shotgun NO CONVERSION NEEDED tapco T-6 six position stock and ADD A PISTOL GRIP NO CONVERSION TO SAIGA RIFLE/SHOTGUN NEEDED!
( heres the deal on those parts though, that t-6 telescoping stock CAN be used on a plane jay akm ak47 Whatever! so if you have a wasr 10, that stock will work! however i am not sure if the SAW style pistol grip will work for any ak i think it is really just ment to work when that tapco stock is attached to a unconverted saiga and used in the fashion of adding a pistol grip without converting a saiga. 

easy best way to make a saiga more tactical... orrrr

i planned on modifying it for use with any ak and makeing a slide fire stock out of it and saveing a few hundred doallers as i have seen it done and is effectively the very same thing.   i am asking 40$ for this tapco saiga or ak stock and the any  saiga pistol grip that comes with it.
i know i may seem firm on 40$ but....
everything is negotiable?
cash or trade? we can work something out.
random junk part stuff.

tapco ak muzzle break - 10$ never used 14x1lh 

trigger i made from a saiga trigger probley could use some work
throw in the hammer and joint thing, springs and pins ect 10$

then theres all the mosin junk and the buttplate someone painted red. mostly mosin nagant tools ect...5$ that pretty much covers everything in the second photo.


id sell all of this junk for 60$ if someone wants to cough up that much cash i mean look at the photos  and how much everything is already reasonably priced, you know its worth it to just buy it all man,

i also got some 7.62x39 ammo 20 round tula box for 10$ a piece.

Nothing was stolen--it was pawned legitimately and then sold legitimately, but I would like to buy it legitimately back as I'm trying to recover it for the family. If the current owner happens to see this, please know that I'd be willing to pay well over whatever it cost from the pawn shop.

Local pick-up is much preferred.

If your are daring and want it shipped to you, USPS Flat Rate Box is $18.95. I will cover the whole box with heavy duty packing tape and do the best I can - but historically the corners of these boxes like to break. If the post office cracks the box in transit and you loose half your bullets I will not be held responsible. The Post Office is rough with their package handling - it cannot be helped.

If you are less daring I can put it in a heavy duty container container and ship it UPS but it will be very costly. You are in the neighborhood of at least 50 dollars.

The gun is in excellent condition. The box is in very nice condition. The date of manufacture is 1966.

There is a story behind this gun. I bought this gun from a lady in Montana who told me that it belonged to her uncle. Her uncle was a bank manager and he bought the gun new and kept it in the drawer of his desk, loaded. When he retired, he took the gun out and shot the six rounds that were in it, cleaned it, and put it away. The box contains five empty casings, along with the original tools that came with the gun. The only mark on the gun is on one sport on the cylinder where it seems that it might have come from being in a wood desk drawer and is shown in the third photo.

Now, the serial number on the box is S 271180. The serial number on the gun is S 275277. The numbers are very close. I have no reason to believe the lady would lie about the gun so my guess would be that when the gun was purchased it was put into the wrong box. In any case, the gun is in excellent condition, and the box and contents are very nice.

More photos available, just ask.

Shipping is $35 for priority mail from my dealer but he cannot ship to California.

Read the reviews. Ask the black rifle experts, look at what the professionals are using, it is LMT rifles. This is the BMW of AR 15s. A rare find indeed. There is over a TWO year wait for one of their complete rifles if you can get on the list. There are cars and then there are precision driving machines. There are guns and then there are precision shooting instruments. Impossible to find because owners do not let these go.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $3-$5 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 19 boxes left (380 rounds total).  Price is $16/box FIRM. 15 boxes are the tan box shown in the first 2 pics, 4 boxes are the red box shown in the last pic. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush. Price is pretty reasonable considering others are asking $1/round + for similar ammo.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 6 box minimum on orders I have to ship.

I can be reached through the Armslist messaging system, @ REDACTED, or @ REDACTED (please leave a message if I'm unable to answer). No texts please if you can help it, too difficult to try and conduct business via text, so email or phone call if possible."

This rifle started as a L1A1 Sporter, ""Thumbhole stock"" Century built rifle.   It has since been reconfigured to remove the Thumbhole stock.

(it requires 6 US parts, since it does not have a muzzle device.
