The leather wears in very comfortably and the support is very nice. I never wore this one I have only test fitted the gun to make sure it fit. It secures very positively at first and loosens up over time but don't worry, I take mine running with the dog and it has never budged. Highly recommended. They adjust to sit as low as you want and as high as you want. Great holsters. I paid about $90 plus shipping for it but I'll ship it to you for $70 or you can come pick it up for $60.
 It may fit a PPQ as the leather backing can stretch a little.

Introduction:

In the last few decades, the Asian-Pacific community has witnessed a dramatic increase in exposure to the activities of transnational organized crime groups, terrorists and lawless extremists. These groups exploit whatever tools available in order to gather information, analyze vulnerabilities, plan and execute inhumane and terrorist acts which target and disrupt the lives of law abiding citizens and communities throughout the region. With the spread of technology, it has become easier for these criminals and terrorists to identify, purchase, and use low-cost, high-tech equipment to violate your personal rights and destroy your way of life. In this emerging environment, having top tier equipment and the will to fight alone are no longer enough.

I bought it back at the beginning of the scare but sold the gun it was installed in, and so am selling the kit seperately.  The kit works GREAT and is quite easy to install assuming you have basic AR skills.  This is the carbine length kit and will only work with carbine length gas systems.  It includes everything found in the original kit, except that it has a couple of additional pins that I requested from Osprey when I bought it in case one were to get lost.

Here is a link to the kit with description: http://www.midwayusa.com/product/915714/osprey-defense-ops-416-gas-piston-retrofit-conversion-kit-ar-15-standard-barrel-diameter-carbine-length 

I also have the Carbine length Midwest 2 Piece Free Float Quad-Rail that was designed to work with this system.  It is also very easy to install, though you do have to remove the delta pack from your AR (the standard barrel nut remains), but you have to take off the spring, c-clip, and delta ring.  You can either remove the barrel with a barrel wrench to do it, or just cut the ring off with a dremel if you don't want to break the gun down.  The rail is rock-solid.  It is a very nice piece.  It does have a couple of small scratches on it, but nothing major.  It just got bumped around in the safe.

Item 4A (305gr. Hard Cast gas Checked LFN) is designed for super deep penetration on large game. The big flat nose keeps the bullet penetrating straight and thus deep. You can expect a good three + feet of penetration in normal flesh and bone. The flat nose also does considerably more damage than a round nosed type of bullet as the flat nose cuts and smashes it way through living matter, while round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through matter, doing much less damage along the bullet’s path and achieving more shallow penetration due to getting sideways while “slipping and sliding” through matter.

Item 4A is recommended for all STEEL revolvers and rifles on today’s market. It is not suitable for scandium or aluminum alloy revolvers."

Just purchased this month at local dealer, and I have receipts to prove. Still in new condition. Save by buying a new firearm without background check fee's, sales tax, and new firearm price. This firearm is the same length and height of the popular Kel Tec PF9, but holds 10+1 rounds instead of the 7+1 that the only very slightly smaller PF9 holds. The P11 also is able to use Smith&Wesson 15 round magazines (unlike the PF9).

No problems with the firearm, but I just have my sights on another firearm. Face to face cash only transaction please. More pictures coming soon.

KEL-TEC CNC INDUSTRIES 

The Kel-Tec P-11 is one of the smallest and lightest 9mm made. Thanks to it's locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially suited for plain clothes police officers or as a secondary weapon for military personnel. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment. Equally advanced quality control equipment and test procedures ensure a firearm with uncompromising quality in materials and workmanship.

Just purchased this month at local dealer, and I have receipts to prove. Still in new condition. Save by buying a new firearm without background check fee's, sales tax, and new firearm price. This firearm is the same length and height of the popular Kel Tec PF9, but holds 10+1 rounds instead of the 7+1 that the only very slightly smaller PF9 holds. The P11 also is able to use Smith&Wesson 15 round magazines (unlike the PF9).

No problems with the firearm, but I just have my sights on another firearm. Face to face cash only transaction please. More pictures coming soon.

Like I said I am primarily interested in trades but if you are only looking to buy outright the price is $575 with a bill of sale.

These guns are hard to find for a reason. IMO this is far superior to a shield, G26, or XDS. It has the best features of all of them in an extraordinarily concealable size."

This stock has been carved with a deer scene, oak leaves, and acorns, and then checkered. It seems it developed a crack behind the receiver safety, so to stop it from cracking any more, it was pinned, fiber glassed, and then Accura-glass bedded all under the crack and the crack was also filled. Very nicely and professionally done, I don't think the crack will go further. = See Pictures = As you can see the inside workings of this gun look like it hasn't been shot much, and the bore is sharp and shiny. The bluing on the outside is fine for the age of the gun. The rifle has had a scope on it the past, you can tell where the mounts were. The rifle is mechanically sound and cycles great. The forearm has also been glass bedded, and there is no extra hole, as you unscrew the sling stud to remove it. There is a buffalo horn plug thats been added where the butt stock sling stud is. The buyer pays a fixed shipping charge of $35. Of course I can only ship to a FFL address, and the buyer will send me proof of the FFL by email or slow mail with the check. I only accept money orders, or cashiers checks. A USPS money order is preferred and assures no wait time for the check to clear, before the gun is shipped. I also reserve the right to increase the shipping if you want it shipped with a hard case or the shipping and insurance runs any higher. But that will all be taken care of before shipment, through communication. I have more pictures at better quality upon request and your email. Call REDACTED"

I have for sale 2 new/never used stainless steel parkerizing tanks with lids and ½” drain valves. I bought these thinking I was going to learn how to parkerize guns but never got around to it so these have just been sitting collecting dust. Also included with this is 1 gallon of Zinc Phosphate Parkerizing Solution and 1 gallon of Post Treatment Solution, both new and unopened. Each gallon of chemical is concentrated and gets mixed with 4 gallons of water for 5 total gallons of each, which is the capacity of each tank. 

I paid right around $450 shipped to the door for the pair of tanks/lids plus around $125 shipped to the door for the chemicals. I have around $575 wrapped up in this but I will sell everything as a set for $350 cash or $400 trade value. Located in Dublin and you must be willing to meet in the Dublin area for the sale. 

Here is the description of the tanks from the manufacturer:

6""x6""x40"", pure 304 Stainless Steel. Tank, cover, and Stainless Steel ball valve are included. 

We are proud to offer the very best Parkerizing Tanks in the industry. They are cut and formed out of pure 304 stainless steel. Handles are formed right into the ends. All edges of these tanks are hemmed, so there are no exposed sharp edges. Feel free to handle these tank with your bare hands! 

The tanks are TIG welded using supreme skill and elaborate tooling. The outside of the welds are treated and polished to reveal the beauty of the stainless steel and show the excellence of the weld. We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied."

The Benelli Cordoba is a lightning-fast 20-gauge shotgun especially built for hunting. Inspired by the high volume of dove shooting found around Cordoba, Argentina, the designers of Benelli shotguns engineered this one with all the advanced features of a serious sporting clays model. Incorporated into the Cordoba is the 10-mm tapered sporting rib favored by competition shooters and porting to keep barrel climb to a minimum. The 28"" barrel has a bead rear sight and fiber optic front sight fitted.

The ComforTech stock cushions the blow when ammo isn’t measured in boxes, but by cases in an afternoon. The ComforTech system also helps reduce barrel climb and puts the shooter back on target 69% faster, so that the Cordoba just may be the fastest field gun ever built. A Crio barrel and extended Crio choke tubes put more pellets on target. And the whole package is finished in matte black GripTight coating, so a reflected flash won’t give you away.

This shotgun ships in a fitted hard case. Please note that the original box is not included but all other standard included parts and accessories are.

• Does your horse have trouble keeping weight on?
• Do you want to add more healthy calories to his diet?
• Do you want to help your horse build lean muscle?
•	Do you want to draw the deer to your feeder and deer stand?
•	Do you want to see huge racks on your bucks?

If you answered ""YES"" to any of these questions, a rice bran supplement may be just what you need...it can provide all these benefits and more.

Rice bran (RB) can be a great addition to many horses, all livestock and wildlife’s diets.  But what is it?  When the rice seed is harvested, there are three stages.  The first stage takes off the hull to make brown rice.  Then the second stage removes the brown layer to make white rice. It is this brown layer that is the bran.

The high fat content makes it an ideal choice to feed to performance horses, broodmares and weanlings, older horses, all livestock and wildlife that need additional calories in their diet to maintain performance or increase body weight.  Weighing in at almost 20% oil, RB has a very high fat content.

RB weighs in at approximately 1200 calories per pound, making it a very effective weight building feed.  It is not as high in calories as oil (4000 calories/pound) because oil is 100% fat while RB contains other things such as fiber, some starch, calcium, phosphorous and protein.
Benefits of feeding

Not only is RB a highly palatable fat source, it also has a few other benefits: It contains gamma oryzanol.  Gamma oryzanol is thought to help muscle repair and rebuilding.  Many horse owners have reported increased lean muscle mass in horses that are on RB.  Rice bran is a rich natural source of vitamin E and gamma-oryzanol, which have been extensively studied and reported to possess important health-promoting properties.  Deer hunters have reported bigger body mass and racks.

It has a significant amount of fiber in addition to the fat.  The fiber in the RB makes it less likely to cause digestive upset than other calorie sources that contain large amounts of starch.  Studies have shown feeding rice bran greatly reduces colic, stomach ulcers and other digestive problems associated with grains.  Due to its mixed composition, RB is an ideal fat source for many horses, livestock and wildlife.

Our rice bran pellets have been analyzed by a certified lab for its nutritional value. 

Dr. David Freeman, Animal Nutritionist, Oklahoma State University says this about our rice bran:  “Shows to be a very sound feed, protein similar to corn, fat higher than oats or corn, calcium higher than phosphorus.  All suggest a very adequate feed for most broodmares, weanlings, performance and older horses or any livestock and wildlife.”"
