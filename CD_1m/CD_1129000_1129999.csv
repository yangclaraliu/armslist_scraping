It's a 580-series, stainless, Choate folding stock. The original owner installed the Barska illuminated reticle scope on it and for some reason removed the factory front sight. I took the carbine to a gunsmith, had the barrel shortened to 16 1/2"" and installed a Choate combination front sight / flashhider. I just think a weapon with no front sight is a bad plan - but the bonus is it looks like it was made this way. Also has some nice stainless sling swivels.

I've run a few hundred rounds through it and it ate everything and was as accurate as Mini-14's can be.

It comes with the 20 round ProMag, which I have tested; no FTF's or any issues at all.  

Nice compact, reliable, scoped. Great bugout gun.
Price as is, $875.00 cash or gold and silver. Not really interested in trades but it can't hurt to ask.

I have several Like New stainless 30-rd and 20-rd Precision Magazines that I will offer to the buyer at $40.00 each. These are not Pmag, or ProMag, or USA Mag; they are in fact Precision Mags, made in the 1980's. These are generally considered to be on par with Ruger and usually the only aftermarket magazine make to have the reputation as being reliable.  If you know anything about Ruger Mini-14's you know what I am talking about.

***************
Send me an email if you'd like for me to let you know before the next 223 ammo offer is posted. 

Offer is one box of 100 rounds of Federal's 55gr FMJ. NIB, New USA factory manufacture. 
**Three** boxes available -- 300 rounds total.  Buy one, two, or all three. 
$60 per box / 60¢ per round average cost.
Reloadable BRASS case. Copper FMJ-- NOT bi-metal steel FMJ grinding down your barrel.
It is better that my good neighbors have this ammo than it sitting in my basement. 
No sense paying $1 per round at other online sources either. 
Appleton Fleet Farm has 223 soft point available for $1 per round, so use that as a local price point for regularly available cash and carry ammo. (Yes, soft point is better for social work, but 223 FMJ scooting out at over 3000 fps isn't ticklish either.) 
Federal's product number is Model No.: BP223BL
TERMS: Appleton meetup, face to face @ Walmart or other parking lot; cash in hand.

Here's a link to a general description at WalMart. (Use the product link to find if your local WalMart has it in stock---it goes quickly, but WalMart will 'hold' it for you if you ask nicely and can come pick it up within a couple of hours.)

Magpul's Description:
The MagPul 20LR PMag is constructed from advanced polymers with superior impact resistance and light weight. This 20-Round magazine is designed to replace the standard SR25/ M110 pattern magazines. The 20LR is less than half the weight of a standard steel mag and has a true 20-round capacity. The body is designed with a constant-curve inside dimension and a self-lubricating follower for reliable feeding. The textured magazine body and flared floorplate improve handling over standard magazines. The snap-on impact cover protects the feed lips from impacts and debris while in storage. The impact cover also allows loaded magazines to be stored long-term (over 1 year) without compromising the integrity of the feed lips. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using the impact cover or simple punch for cleaning and maintenance. 

Technical Information:
•	20-Round Capacity

•	Anti-Tilt Follower and Stainless Steel Spring
•	Will accept rounds with a maximum overall length of 2.820""

About EXO Technology
EXO Technology is a patented, nickel-boron coating from UCT Coatings, Inc. EXO Technology provides a hard, durable surface (40% harder than Chrome) and permanent lubricity to metal substrates, allowing firearms to operate without oil or grease. EXO coated components last longer, clean up easier, and require minimal maintenance, while increasing reliability in harsh environments (sand/dust, hot/cold, suppressed fire, frangible ammunition)."

I'm looking to see if I can get a used GLOCK 23 .40 for around 400. Friend of mine got one used a while back for $399 at buckeye Outdoors but I don't live close to that store. Let me know if you've seen any deals at other gun stores b/c some of the prices on the website are a bit high and Vance's is sold out. I'm also interested in Springfield XD .40's. Thanks

Union Army soldiers relied on many different types of sidearms for short
range and close quarters combat. The revolver was unique in that it had the
ability to fire several rounds per minute before having to reload.
Revolvers were typically issued to officers and mounted soldiers, however
some were purchased privately or found on the battlefield by infantrymen.
istinguished by its octagon barrel and lever style loader, the 1851 helped
to begin both the expansion of the West and the Civil War. The 1851 Navy is
commonly considered to be one of gunfighter  Wild Bill  Hickok s favorite
handguns. The British government licensed the manufacturing rights and
produced what is commonly known as the London Model.
his model features a 7.5 octagonal Old Silver barrel, Old Silver frame,
nickel guard, and walnut grip. It is available in .44 caliber, weighs 2.75
lbs., and is 13"" in length.

Stock would need to be pinned and muzzle brake installed to keep it into NY. Will cost you about $100 including brake...I brought it into NY before it was illegal to do so, but shoot at PA ranges, so never modified it and leave it in my buddies safe on border, so, It is legal to modify and keep in NY as I purchased it while living in this state. My neighbor is a trooper and agreed with me as long as it gets modified....I have a fixed stock, but it is black. See below.

I also have (2) 30 round P-mags that are not pre-ban. $50 each (Not for NY residents)

It has very little wear on the barrel and after I bought it I had a 3.5 trigger connector installed by a Glock Armorer. This gun shoots super sweet and has much less muzzle flip than a regular 23 due to the factory compensated barrel system. I also own a Gen 4 Glock 19 and the felt recoil is about the same. This gun is super accurate and headshots on paper silhouette targets are no problem from 40 ft. or so and the follow up shots come quicker due to the compensated barrel. You seldom ever see one of these for sale anywhere since they are fairly rare and cost quite a bit more originally than the standard 23's. The only reason I am even considering the sale of this 23C is because .40 caliber S&W ammo is noticeably higher than 9mm ammo. It does come with 3 Factory Glock 13 round magazines and a Factory Glock case with a new Factory Glock lock still in the plastic bag. I'll also throw in a Hoppes bore snake. I would be interested in trading this gun for a Glock 34 preferably a Gen 4 or a Gen 4 17 or one of the compensated variations of any of those or possibly another Gen 4 19. I might also be interested in other high end 9mm models by different brands. I've got my eye on a FN FNS 9 at a local gun store so I am looking for a nice 9mm. Something like that or possibly a stainless Inox Beretta 92 FS or a nice Sig Sauer model.

This gun is in new condition and only had 50 rounds go through it and has been a safe queen in the original box since.

They no longer make this line anymore and it is rare to see these come up for sale.

It comes with one 10rnd mag. 

If you’re not familiar with the Mini Cougars they can be converted to a full sized duty gun just with the addition of a full size mag and grip extension. Beretta still sells the mag extensions to do this. It’s nice to have the option for a full sized pistol and a compact with just the change of a magazine.

I’m only going through an FFL and the buyer pays the transfer. So those that have a CCW, good, I but I don't have a FFL transfer book, so we still are going through a FFL. If someone wants it shipped, it is my FFL to your FFL. Shipped buyers pay with money order.

Firm on the price.

First come first serve. If you're out of town I'll take a nonrefundable PayPal deposit of $100 +3% until I get your money order for the full amount. I sorry, i'm not doing this sale pending stuff anymore only for the buyer to back out.
