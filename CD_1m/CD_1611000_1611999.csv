rifling and a twist rate of 1:7”. The SIG551-A1 measures 36.1” but can fold to 26”, 
making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special 
Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 5.56 x 45mm NATO, the SIG551-A1 sets a new standard for dependable operation and function.

This brass is 100% WCC made from once fired 5.56. It has a stronger primer pocket compared to the other brass I run and I seem to get more reloadings from it comparatively. Primer pockets are swagged, not reemed, just enough that the primers go in while still giving it a snug fit for long life. I trim the brass to 1.355 which is closer to the lower tolerance so your brass should last longer between trimmings. The way these are trimmed some might have a slight burr on the inside of the case. These can be removed with a deburring chamfer or running them through a resizing die. I dont think it necessarily needs removed and I dont when I reload them. Shipping is not included but flat rate is pretty reasonable. I take PayPal (gift or +3.5%) or postal mo. PayPal however will get you the fastest shipping. This is made to order so shipping will not be immediate. I might have more at a later date. No trades at this time, email me if you want a smaller lot but that rates are higher"

I have sub-caliber devices from Kennesaw Cannon Co. in .410/.45 long (long colt) and .22 (any .22 except WMR).  The gun also comes with an adapter to fire 12 gauge marine flares which are much cheaper and easier to find than the 26.5 mm ones.  You can order some very impressive looking 26.5 mm flares from a few places, I just haven't ever gotten around to it.  This would be a great Boating emergency item.  I think the .45 colt would handle an angry gator at emergency range....I hope so, at least.  It would certainly be enough for any pirates, stowaways, or mutineers.

You can still find .410 for cheap just about anywhere that sells ammo (Academy has lots of it), .45 colt is pretty easy to find online (about $20 for a box of 50).  For the .22, I can throw in a box of 40 American Eagle .22lr hollow point or a box of 325 Federal Automatch or both for the right trade.

I already own a Shield 9mm, so I dont need this one, its just been sitting in the box since I picked it up about three weeks ago.

This is probably the best Shield to pick up because 40S&W ammo is pretty easy to come across, so you can actually get out and enjoy this weapon, unlike the 9mm version.

No price gouging here, I am just asking what I paid for it ($449 + tax) plus just a few bucks for my time and gas to get it.

Includes the 2 magazines (1 extended, 1 short), box, and paperwork.

No trades please, price is firm, cash only, buyer must pick up locally, PTP/PTC required, and be willing to sign a bill of sale.

Please email with any questions, but if your looking at this ad, my guess is you already know what you want."

The price is lower than most AR's on ARMSLIST because I believe buying and selling among gun owners should be fair-market value.  Dishonorable vendors have been buying ammunition and AR's at fair-market prices and then 'scalping' the items to profit from the current panic-buying craze.  Only when ammunition and rifle sellers begin to sell for reasonable prices will this craziness begin to stop."

The gun (I believe) is an 1893 Mannlicher Stock 7mm Spanish Mauser used in the Spanish civil war (between 1936 and 1939).  I'm not sure how my father came by it, but the gun was his pride and joy.  It occupied a very prominent place on our living room wall in Los Angeles before I inherited it upon his death.  

Over the past nine years, I have exhausted nearly every avenue (including repeating law enforcement inquiries) seeking to find my family's treasured heirloom.  Of course, I am willing to pay your asking price (within reason; I live on a fixed pension as a result of being a service-connected disabled veteran) in return for the gun.

This is a desperate plea.  I have no idea where or what else to do in locating this prized family possession.

MANUFACTURER: COLT

MODEL: LE6940

CALIBER: 5.56

Description: A factory new in box Colt LE6940 rifle. 

""Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength. Specifications: Action: Semi-Automatic Caliber: 223 Remington/5.56 NATO Bbl Length: 16.1"" Capacity: 30+1 Trigger: Direct Safety: Lever OAL: 35.25"" Weight: 6.6 lbs Stock: 4-Position Collapsible Finish: Black""

The Model 597 is easily the most technologically advanced autoloading rimfire rifle on the market today. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-grade steel guide rails for silky-smooth functioning, fast feeding reliability, and perfect bolt alignment on lock-up for excellent out-of-the-box accuracy.

To assure reliable, long-life accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597 all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for a smooth, dependable operation and ultra-crisp trigger pull (that stays that way). Completing the breakthrough design is an innovative last-shot bolt “hold open” feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack detachable 10-round box magazine.

The Model 597 OD Green Synthetic Scope Combo has a 20"" carbon-steel barrel furnished clean with no sights set in a rugged olive drab green synthetic stock with a beaver tail fore-end. The matching alloy receiver is grooved for standard rimfire mounts and drilled and tapped for the Model 597 Weaver-style one-piece base. A 3-9x32mm scope with rings is included."

The small, pocket-sized Vz.50 was developed during late 1940s for police use and it was chambered for the marginally powerful 7.65x17 Browning ammunition. Apparently influenced by the Walther PP in design, the Vz.50 had several differences in safety and disassembly. In the early 1970s the basic design went through minor face-lift, and the “new” design received the designation of Vz.70. Many Vz.50 pistols were refurbished to Vz.70 standard, with different finish, grip panels and a slightly different safety lever. New Vz.70 pistols were also manufactured between 1970 and 1983. After the replacement in service of the older Vz.50 and Vz.70 by more modern 9mm Vz.82 pistol, most were sold as surplus, as Cz-50 and Cz-70, respectively.

The Vz.50 (commercially sold as Cz-50) is a compact pistol of all-steel construction, firing the relatively weak 7.65mm ammunition. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed. Magazines are single stack. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. Vz.70 (Cz-70) pistols are similar, with minor differences in the finish, shape of the safety lever and grips. Manual safety is a lever at left side of the frame, behind the trigger guard. To set on safe: pull the lever down; if the hammer was cocked, it will be automatically brought down to rest. To disengage safety: push the lever up; a red dot will appear on the frame.

How to field-strip (disassemble) Cz-50 and Cz-70 pistol: 1) remove the magazine by pressing the magazine release button; 2) check that the chamber is empty; 3) push the disassembly button, located at the right side of the frame, above the front of the trigger-guard; 4) while holding the disassembly button, retract the slide all the way back, raise the rear part of the slide off the rails, then slowly release it forward and off the barrel; 5) remove the return spring from the barrel

The Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility, and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. Utilizing the proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"", and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments. The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech system which reduces recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less on average; that's more than a pound less! The ComforTech system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest-shooting, most reliable shotgun ever."

I'm trying to sell my S&W M&P .40. The pistol has performed amazingly, but I decided I'd like to get a Beretta 92FS. I'm asking $700 OBO for the pistol with its original case, five (5) 15-round S&W magazines, and a box of .40 ammo. There have been no issues with jamming, misfires, or other mechanical problems. Cosmetically, it is in great shape and has been cleaned and oiled meticulously after shooting. 

The only reason that I wish to sell it is that I'm very partial toward the Beretta 92FS. When I purchased the M&P, I actually wanted to buy the Beretta (I'm military), but was unable to find it anywhere in town. After getting back into shooting, I decided that I wanted to try and trade them out.

This holster uses belt loops at the front and rear to pull your handgun tight against your body for better concealment. The angle this holster positions your handgun allows faster drawing with full combat grip, more comfortable wearing, and much safer use.
A regular Small of the Back (SOB) holster places your gun over the base of the spine. A fall or hard blow with your gun in that position could cause serious spinal cord injury. This holster is engineered for kidney carry to avoid that danger.
Made of waterproof foam for a comfortable carry and to protect gun from moisture. Lined on both sides with rugged Cordura® nylon for durability and a smooth, fast draw. Webbing inside the holster protects your gun’s sights and keeps holster partially open for easier re-holstering. Great for use while driving. Comes with an adjustable thumb break to keep gun secure. Fits belts up to 1½” wide. Made in the USA."

Ruger’s newest addition, the SR45 pistol is perfectly sized to be comfortable and controllable with slim, ergonomic grips and narrow slide. A short reach from the backstrap to the trigger creates a comfort level that will challenge any standard-sized, striker-fired pistol available today. It’s structurally rigid, recoil-reducing, glass-filled nylon frame and stainless steel slide combine to create low-maintenance, rugged and reliable handgun. A unique reversible backstrap (flat or arched) allows shooters to quickly customize the size and feel of the grip, without the use of separate inserts or special tools. High-visibility 3-dot night sight system features a raked-forward front sight for easy removal from the holster. Rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable. Integral Picatinny rail for mounting lights, lasers and other tactical accessories. The SR45 is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator. This is a great home defense or concealed carry gun and it is California approved.

807,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1611807,For Sale:  Swarovski EL Swarovision 10x42,"Parker, Denver, Colorado","$ 2,499","Listed On: Tuesday, June 25, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The EL binoculars combine maximum functionality, innovation and design.
The unique wrap-around grip enables comfortable operation even with one hand. Low weight and excellent balance make light work of
long observation periods. The sophisticated top-class optical system delivers high-contrast, lifelike image quality.

In the EL series, Swarovski Optik uses high-quality technologies such as the SWAROBRIGHT coating for maximum color fidelity across the whole light spectrum or the SWAROTOP and SWARODUR coatings for bright, high-contrast images.

The non-stick effect of the SWAROCLEAN coating on the outer surface of the lens makes cleaning objective and eyepiece lenses considerably easier, above all when removing dried-on mineral residues (e.g. water marks due to condensation), insect repellents and tree resin.  The lenses require less intensive cleaning which significantly increases the longevity of optical products.

SWAROVISION – OPTICAL QUALITY REDEFINED
The revolutionary SWAROVISION TECHNOLOGY from SWAROVSKI OPTIK enables an image quality in the new EL 42 previously unequalled in binoculars. The combination of field flattener lenses and HD optic ensures impressive image resolution over the entire field of view.
Thus providing outstanding contrast even when observing at dusk. Eyeglass-wearers also benefit from the full wide-angle field of view due to the large eye relief distance.

FIELD FLATTENER LENSES – CONTRAST RIGHT UP TO THE IMAGE EDGE
The image focus of the new EL 42 has never before been achieved in any binoculars. The field flattener lenses used produce a virtually flat image. As a result, even the finest structures and smallest details are reproduced with razor-sharp clarity right up to the image edge.
For the first time ever, the observer obtains a perfect image with no annoying distortions. The outstanding image quality over the entire
field of view means less refocusing and allows you to identify every detail at lightning speed. The observer’s peripheral vision will be able to see small movements and identify colors and patterns at the edges of the image with greater ease.

HIGH-DEFINITION – FOR MAXIMUM CONTRAST
The fluoride-containing HD lenses minimize color-fringing (chromatic aberration) for contrast-rich images with razor-sharp outlines.
As a result, significant improvements in resolution and contrast are achieved by comparison with conventional grades of glass.
Experience completely new insights into nature’s world of shapes and colors.

GREATER EYE RELIEF – 100% FIELD OF VIEW FOR EYEGLASS-WEARERS
The new EL 42 stands out by comparison with other binoculars due to a larger eye relief of the exit pupil. This enables even eyeglasswearers to survey the entire wide-angle field of view and enjoy the new EL’s unique edge sharpness. The removable twist-in eyecups are individually adjustable in three stages. In addition to the maximum position (completely twisted out) and the setting for eyeglass-wearers (completely twisted in), the eyecups also have a snap-in intermediate stage.

OPTIMIZED COATING – FOR MAXIMUM COLOUR FIDELITY
The enhanced coatings of the lenses and prisms (SWARODUR, SWAROTOP, SWAROBRIGHT) in the new EL guarantee absolutely lifelike color reproduction and outstanding image brightness for spectacular observation experiences even at dusk.
The SWAROCLEAN coating on the outer surface of the lens ensures a non-stick effect with obvious cleaning advantage in the case of dirt such as water marks, insect repellents and tree resin.

Arsenal, Inc. is the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collector firearm. Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled and Forged Receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank rather than from bar stock like most other manufacturers. Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel, and eliminates internal voids and cooling deformations with the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each receiver requires 5.5+ hours of milling, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a product of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

I also have probably 5 of these nasty rounds I got out of curiosity. Plastic slugs with a metal band. The slug on impact is said to shatter, breaking the metal ring into dozens of pieces to travel throughout the targets body. Pretty gross, but I thought it'd be something interesting to get.

Kinda Hate to let it go, and I don't necessarily have to, so any low ball offers will be ignored.
I know, I need to get some pics put up, so I will work on that tonight, however like I said it really is in like new condition, safe queen,  just don't have box 
I am asking $800.00 for the gun, and have been told by some Winchester collectors that  I should be asking at least a $1000.00 but it is just one that I don't use (too pretty)
I really prefer cash, and may consider reasonable offers or interesting trades

Awesome condition 1966 Ruger .44 Magnum carbine. Comes with a full box of hollow point ammo. 

Check out the pictures to see what amazing condition this is in. Serial number starts with 110,xxx so according to Ruger records, it was made in 1966. There is no warning label on this gun. It is a metal and wood gun - no plastic parts, a truly awesome example of American gun manufacturing. Stock is a very nice dark walnut. This is one of the rarer monte carlo or ""finger grove"" stocks. It has the Ruger logo on the bottom of the knob and sling attachments. Already has weaver rail scope mounts on it so a scope can be attached and the original sights can also be used. Made from 1961-1985 there were two runs of these rifles the first from 1961-1974 and the second from 75-85. This is a fine example of the first run where a tube magazine was used rather than a detachable mag. 

I'm going to try to give a better description as I can only load three pictures. If I had to guess I would say that this rifle was never used to hunt. The sort of wear it has is consistent with someone taking it out to the range once or twice a year for 47 years. It has the sorts of marks that are almost impossible to avoid as you put a gun into and take a gun out of a safe, case, rack, etc. The sort of nicks that happen when you lay it down on a wooden shooting bench, etc. The rifling is awesome and the metal parts all show almost no use. 

Overall I'd put this gun at 90%+. I'd say its between ""VERY GOOD"" and ""Excellent"" on the NRA grading scale. This rifle has a few nicks and light scratches that you'd expect from a gun that is 47 years old. The finish is very good, if it looks like there is veneer missing its just the picture. There is about a 1/4 inch chip in the very bottom of the butt stock where the gun meets the butt plate. It is so insignificant that I didn't even notice it until I was inspecting it closer for an interested party. It will only be seen if the gun is literally laying on its top (bottom exposed up). Otherwise just extremely minor surface scratches and nicks. The bluing is excellent everywhere with no noticeable scratches or dings.  

If you have any questions please ask. I will answer as quick as possible. 

**Please know your state laws before asking me to buy it. 

Payment: I accept visa, mastercard, discover, Paypal, cash, and money orders. ALL CREDIT CARD AND PAYPAL PAYMENTS WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL 3%. I only accept cash in person otherwise Paypal is preferred for all out of area sales.
