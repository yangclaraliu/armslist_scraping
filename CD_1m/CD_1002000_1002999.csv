I do not want a Ranch Rifle or a .223 Mini 14. I live in Washington DC, so if you feel more comfortable, you can ship to my FFL instead of handing the rifle to me on the spot, but I still need to see it in person unless you're a reputable dealer that can prove your identity.

Flash suppressors, collapsible stocks, thumbhole stocks, pistol grips, and high capacity mags are illegal in this communist city, so I would ask all owners of 5854's to remove the flash suppressors. You could simply keep your pistol grips, flash suppressors, and mags if the mags hold more than ten rounds.

I'm also in the market for a decently priced M1A or M1 Garand. Same communist laws apply, no folding stocks (which excludes the paratrooper M1) and no pistol grips or flash suppressors.

I can't spend too much on this seeing as the DC police only licensed one single FFL for the entire city to prevent people from buying guns, and since he has a monopoly he can charge $125 for a transfer fee. So I really can't pay more than $900 for this right now. I've got a PS3 and a desktop PC with two computer monitors though, as well as a Google Nexus, in case that helps."

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap-around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to bump fire, the SSAR-15's radical design enables the shooter to fire an AR-15 as quickly as desired without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike traditional bump firing, the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly hold their firearm and maintain complete control at all times. In addition, as a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round, the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm’s muzzle upward in an unsafe direction.

In principal the SSAR-15 functions similar to the Gatlin system.  When operating a Gatlin system; the shooter operates a crank in a circular motion to activate the firing mechanism.  Every 1/5 rotation of the crank will discharge a round. The shooter will then continue forward another 1/5 of a rotation to fire the next round, and so on. With the SSAR-15 the shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward to discharge a round.  To discharge the next round the operator must again move the upper assembly forward.  As with the Gatlin system, an AR-15  equipped with the SSAR-15 will never fire automatically.

> Compatible with Mil-Spec and Commercial Buffer Tubes

DISINTEGRATOR®
No one equips you for perfect practice like Remington, which is why we’re the top choice for government agencies everywhere – in the field and on the range. Disintegrator lead free frangible ammunition is a technological breakthrough in bullet construction that offers totally lead free, no-ricochet performance, with point of impact and felt recoil equivalent to standard lead core pistol ammunition. In accuracy performance, it is as good or better than the best duty ammo. Disintegrator frangible bullets feature a high strength compaction formed core, completely sealed in a jacket of electroplated copper. The metal powder core construction creates a bullet that easily withstands the forces and pressures of firing, while providing instant and complete frangibility against hard surfaces. The copper plating on Disintegrator bullets provide a smooth ductile jacket that enhances feed and function in all autoloading pistols, minimizes bore fouling, and virtually eliminates barrel erosion. Only 0.005” thick, it is enough for rifling engraving, but too thin to ricochet. Disintegrator bullets are made of compressed metal particles shaped into standard profile 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP specifications. Disintegrator core is completely protected with hard copper plate. Manufacturing process produces highly concentric core for excellent accuracy."

Narrative: The CTT-Solutions pistol program of instruction is designed to give shooter specific answers based on operational experience of multiple vetted military/ LE sources, testing and historical data. All techniques taught are highly efficient and effective in the use of a pistol for combative engagements as opposed to sport shooting. The course requires the extensive use of steel targetry to accomplish rapid gains in skills with instant feedback as well as approximately 1000 rounds of ammunition per officer. The high round count and the use of steel give the shooter time and apparatus to refine his/her shooting technique based on the principles taught.

Hello, Alias Training would like to announce a new set of clear and concise ammo policies that are in place until the current ammo situation corrects itself. Both Larry Vickers and Kyle Defoor have released their own statements and this one will mirror theirs exactly. It is intended to merely explain a few points a little farther and speak for Alias as a group. 

- A new minimum of 400 rounds has been set for all Alias Training & Security Services associated 2-day classes. This is to be considered an absolute minimum. If this is all the ammo you can find or afford you will be good to go. All efforts will be made to minimalize the effects of shooting fewer rounds in the class. Honestly the class will be the same, you will just have the option of self-regulating your rounds fired per drill. Example; if the drill calls for four rounds, firing two will be OK. This is completely student self-regulating. Please be careful so you don?t over shoot one drill and miss out on another. 

- *Very Important* If you have the standard ammo supply available this policy will not affect you at all. You will just be shooting the class normally. The instructors wanted me to be very clear on this. 

- We have not had any restrictions on remanufactured ammo for years but to reiterate it is completely fine in our classes. 

- .22 weapons are completely fine. Same with .22 conversion kits.

- We are working with several manufacturers & suppliers to ensure ammo availability for our classes. Some instructors have or are working on their own deals. Other suppliers are going to be helping Alias as a whole. If you cannot find ammo for a class contact Paul at Alias Training (REDACTED) and I will point you in the right direction. 

I would like to thank the world-class instructors associated with Alias Training & Security Services for looking out for our customers during this situation. 

If anyone has any questions or concerns please feel free contact me anytime day or night.

Thank you,

Paul Hotaling"

Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and muzzle threaded ½ -28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion when the barrel heats up, and hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life.

The price is $475 cash, and I am not interested in trades at this time. If you are interested, email me, if not, please move on and don't tell me that I am charging too much. It is a matter of supply and demand. I have one that I am willing to part with, and there are many people who want these, and the supply has run out for now, possibly for a very long time. If someone is willing to pay what I am asking, then I am not asking too much. If they are not, then I guess I will still have a lower.

Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 2 boxes available (100 rounds total). Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush. 

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly.

883,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1002883,For Sale:  SWR Spectre II,"South, Louisville, Kentucky",$ 395,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 5, 2013",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"With its construction of ultra high performance and tough Stainless Steel, the Spectre II allows weapon fire to go virtually unnoticed. It is not only super tough, but also one of the quietest 22 suppressor known to man. With the Spectre II, users will also enjoy its multi-caliber versatility.
The Spectre II has a unique CTA baffle design for easy disassembly and is user serviceable, which is very important for any .22 lr silencer. Because the .22 lr round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue .22 silencers must be able to be disassembled for cleaning and regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22 lr silencers on the market. The Spectre II has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily."

Looking to pay no more than $15 or $20 per box of 50 depending on manufacturer. I know its harder to come by at the moment but its a shame people are price gouging way too much and it isn't helping this ""shortage"" at all and is actually a big part of it.. so If asking a lot and or way to much for what you have don't even bother to respond with your capitalism. I'd rather get it once or twice a week or so in boxes of 50 or 100 for way cheaper than anything I've seen online recently. Just thought I would see if I could find bulk to be a little easier and faster because I can't get out early everyday because of work and when I do get a chance to go early I can usually only get so much at the few places I know to go. Looking preferably for new in the box FMJ rounds for target practice do not want hollow points I have enough.

I'm a custom knifemaker local to the area who specializes in tactical folders and fixed blades. 

The majority of my work is tactical folders in the framelock or linerlock design. I also make fixed blades and various other small knives and tools. 

I'm interested in trading my work for guns or gun related items - gear, ammo, guns of all kinds and any working condition. 

All of my work is made per order and I rarely have something available for immediate sell or trade. The benefit of this for you is you basically get to choose whatever knife you want as far as handle materials and finishes. I only use high quality materials and blade steels, typically cpm154 stainless or 1095 carbon steel for blades and titanium and g10 for handle materials.
I do all work in house from cutting out the material, heat treating the blades, and grinding the blades. The only thing I don't make are the screws that hold the knife together. 

I can typically have a piece done for you within a week's time. 

If your interested, shoot me an email and I will direct you to my website as well as several online retailers who sell my work. 

I'm particularly interested in finding a Marlin 336 in 30-30 right now, but as said, I'm open to all offers. Handguns of all sizes/calibers, rifles, gear, and ammo
I shoot a lot of .22lr and 9mm. 

Thanks for viewing my thread!

Feel free to let me know what your trade value is on your item(s) and I'm sure I can create something of equal value. My folding knives typically start around the 400.00 range and 
fixed blades start in the area of 250.00"
