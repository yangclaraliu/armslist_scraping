The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced (SSA-E) Trigger is a finely-tuned semi-automatic-only version of our full-auto, two stage combat trigger presently used in the U.S. Special Operations Community. Built on the chassis of the Geissele SSA, the SSA-E provides enhanced trigger control and weapon accuracy while maintaining the robustness and reliability of our combat-proven two-stage trigger. The SSA-E’s reduced 1st and 2nd stage pull weights result in a trigger with a smooth, light 1st stage take-up and a crisp, candy cane-like 2nd stage break. The SSA-E is ideal for use in precision Squad Designated Marksman type rifles where weapon accuracy and reliability are critical and a non-adjustable drop in trigger is desired."

FROM VIKING TACTICS SITE BELOW:
Unlike any sight on the market, the Revolutionary design of the Viking Sight will enhance your ability to close with and destroy the threat, day or night. The Viking Sight from Viking Tactics, Inc. features a tapered front sight that will draw you immediately to the correct aiming point. This sight is not only tapered for speed, but to help with accuracy at distance when needed. The tapered sight leads to an indestructible fiber optic that will help to drive your focus where it is needed. These sights are extremely fast. The rear sight notch has also been cut lower than normal to not only enhance speed, but to allow the shooter to see the tritium vials that have been inserted below the fiber optic. The Viking Sight will allow you to have the fine aiming point that you want and need, coupled with fiber optic to help draw your attention. If the sun goes down you are now able to use the tritium that is slightly below the fiber optic.
Tapered Front Sight; Serrated Front and Rear Sights; Fiber Optic Speed Sight; Tritium Night Sights."

This is a complete BCM upper, straight from BCM's factory, no mods. Upper is brand new and has never been mated to a lower. Not looking to part out - selling as complete upper.

Shipping is $30 to nearby states where this upper (and its features - threaded barrel, flash hider, bayonet lug) is legal. Might be a couple of bucks more to ship farther west. Payment options for shipping: DISCREET Paypal (no mention of anything gun related), either marked using 'Gift' option or tack on 3% to cover paypal's fee, or USPS money order.

For those not familiar with the different barrel profiles, the lightweight barrel reduces a bit of muzzle-end weight (where you want to reduce weight - i.e., the part of the rifle farthest from your body) relative to the government profile barrel. From the chamber to the FSB, the barrel is identical to the government profile barrel. All the weight savings is at the muzzle end.

The streaks and unevenness you see is just the preservative oil that is slathered on at the factory.

 Includes swag - hat, posters, DVD's, stickers, lube."

decrease the felt recoil when firing the weapon. The polymer frame that is

     The only ding with this rifle is one of the trigger guard ""ears"" is broken, but i did JB weld it back on there so it is on there and in no way affects the rifle, just not pretty, but you cant see it because the Stark grip i have on there covers it up nicely (see pictures). So with over 350 dollars worth of accessories and 450 rounds of ammo,that is hard to find right now and super expensive, i find this to be a great deal.  I will also include an extra Magpul MOE grip and all the original parts that came with the rifle. might be wiling to work on the price so if your interested shoot me an offer, and if you need any more pics or info just let me know. please contact mike @ REDACTED  YOU WILL NEED VALID NEW MEXICO ID AND LEGALLY ABLE TO OWN A FIREARM.

Romanian PSL 54 C converted stock and gas tube to SVD.

Stock is made of Natural Walnut and Stained with Minwax Natural. Also coated in a polyurethane semigloss finish. Its beautiful. Looks just like a Dragunov. 

Stock has seen some use but functionally works and looks great.

Fires Reliably and accurately for a PSL. I have a Tapco G2 trigger installed giving it a light, and very crsip break when you shoot. 

Stock increases the length of pull for us Americans thank god. Actually their stock is shorter because of the gear they wear so they dont need it. But for casual shooting you need a longer length of pull.

The rifle comes with 6 10 round Magazines, The LPS 4x6 Scope w/ the modern rubber eye piece (much better) 

 If you want this transfered to you.......not so hot on that.  You would have to send a money order and put trust in to me which you dont know at all and that would be awkward for both of us.  Preferably Local then I can meet with the person im selling to

Also have 1600-1800 rounds for it still in sealed cases.  That can go with it too.

If you get it with all the ammo Ill give you a Mosin Nagant too.

Information about my Thompson 1927A5 pistol:
Purchased: New in 1995
Manufacturer: Auto Ordnance Corporation West Hurley, N.Y. U.S.A.
Model: 1927 A5 
Condition: Pistol is in the good condition, walnut grips are in excellent condition
with two very minor scuff marks on bottom sides near set screws.
Barrel, bore clean & shiny, minor exterior small marks on pistol. 
The rifling is crisp and clean, very little to no wear on the inside of the receiver.
There are scratches inside and around feed ramp, wear marks
on drum guide rails from drum usage, also brass marks on feed ramp. 
Low serial number  No. 3xxx P

Comes with:
2 -20 rd magazines
7-30 rd  magazines
1- 50 rd drum
1-100 rd drum
""3rd Hand"" Tool for each drum
Original manual, 2 drum loading instructions sheets
Additional Thompson Submachine Guns reference book,
Thompson brochure & various magazine articles of the
Auto Ordnance Thompson ""Tommy Gun""
Thompson patch
no original box

Magazines & Drums Information:
2 - 20 rd magazines (1 mag marked:Auto Ordnance Corp, the other, no markings)

1 - 50 rd drum (drum marked: Auto Ordnance Corp. Type "" L"" Thompson)
1 - 100 rd drum (drum marked: Auto Ordnance Corp. Type "" C "" Thompson)

Magazines/Drum Notes: The 30 rd magazines have all been altered by filing the 
catch hole slightly higher for magazine catch lever. These magazines we're
function tested, all good except one magazine that did not function properly.
With magazines properly locked in, functioned well without any
problems with an occasion jam, ammo related?...etc...etc
The 50 rd drum also functioned properly, the 100 rd drum was a bit more finicky
to use (very heavy for a pistol without a stock) the few times it was used, I had issues
with the correct amount of ""WIND TO 15 CLICKS"", it would run like a sewing machine
for the first 75 rds plus, again with an occasion jam, ammo related?

This weapon is designed to be usable at all ranges of combat, against all infantry targets.
To be most successful when using this weapon, you must follow these simple tips:

-For fighting targets at long ranges, it is recommended that you raise your velocity to
200 or higher. 250 velocity is the maximum velocity you would want to use, as any higher
will have very unreliable collision registry.

-For fast moving/jumping targets use Stages 3-4 with an active lead. The higher stages
offer more spread, and put very high amounts of ammunition downrange instantly.

-For slow moving/stationary targets use Stages 1-2. These stages offer a minor spread
and will allow you to conserve your ammunition.

-For fighting in extreme lag, use the CTRL Stage. This stage disables all 4 rezzer scripts
and cuts the weapon's lag down to very low levels."

I only have one set left to sell and one is not for sale (my personal use), this carrier is a black condor compact plate carrier adjustable M to XL with Military mil-spec armor plates rated for .30cal armor piercing.

MOLLE webbing on the front and back of the vest for attaching pistol mag. pouches or rifle mag. pouches.
I worn one under my hoodie jack, it is completely concealable, but when I attached AK 47 - AR 15 mag. pouches to the carrier it was no longer concealable. These plates are curved Mil-a-46100 10in x 12in steel 1/4"" thick hi-impact brand.
I had ar500 plates but these are better in my opinion.
I shot at one of my old ar500 NIJ level-3 plates and a mil-spec side panel sample I got online, I used my .308 rifle and shot 8 times each plate from 45 feet. Totally different stuff. ar500 flattened and dimpled up penetrated 2 places but the mil-spec plate kept its curve and did not dimple as much also zero penetration. This set is normally $350.

Gun has the following:

Wilson beaver-tail, Novak/Trijicon night sights, after-market ambi safety, trigger job (done by a smith) has crip pull/break (and a insanely nice reset travel, clicks at 1-2mm travel), after-market 2 piece mag release (the fat stud can be removed, which leaves a regular button),  after-market main spring housing (metal), threw some Springfield wood grips on to keep my after market grips. 

Comes with 2 Wilson Combat magazines, Bladetech IWB kydex holster, and box of Federal Hydrashoks.

Got this in trade from a family member, decided to go another route. Seems to like oil and 7rnd mags; kinda finicky to me, but I'm use to shooting Glocks, Sigs, and HKs. DOL transfer form will be filled out.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.


A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

From HK:
A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. 

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures."

The serial number is 80xx with the condition of barrel as excellent, overall about 70% blue remaining on slide and frame and grips as near perfect. This is John Browning's first successful patented semi-auto pistol and led to the popular 1911 Colt model. The action and workings of this gun are excellent but being over 100 years old one would expect some bluing loss and some corrosion in spots, there is that here with this gun. The faded or worn areas have turned brownish and a few of the screws and pins show use. Still a very nice addition to a collection"

The leather belt loop is in very good condition and is not ripped or torn. There are two documents that go with this. Both documents list the P 38 by serial number.
