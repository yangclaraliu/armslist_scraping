1,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1006001,For Sale/Trade:  Mateba Autorevolver,"North, Columbus, GA, Georgia","$ 3,500","Listed On: Tuesday, February 5, 2013",Handguns,no type,357 Magnum                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"Mateba Sportiva Grifone autorevolver 8 Inch barrel. Excellent condition, beautiful bluing and grips. 

The Mateba Model 6 uses the recoil from firing to rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer, unlike conventional revolvers, which depend on the user physically pulling the trigger and/or cocking the hammer to actuate the weapon's mechanism of operation.
The Mateba Autorevolver's barrel alignment is different from most other revolvers. The barrel is aligned with the bottom of the cylinder instead of the top. This lowers the bore axis (line of the barrel) which directs the recoil in line with the shooter's hand thereby reducing the twisting motion or muzzle flip of normal revolvers. The gun's entire upper assembly (barrel, cylinder and frame) are mounted on rails on the lower frame, which houses the trigger, hammer, and grip, and recoils 1/2 of an inch, or 12.7mm, on firing. The rearward motion of the upper assembly cocks the hammer, and the cylinder is rotated on the forward stroke.

•ALL BALLISTIC (Stand Alone) PLATE ARMOR INCLUDED!!!

FRONT&REAR PLATES:
Level III Titanium/Steel plates, 8""X10"" big enough to cover vital organs not too heavy to weigh you down, only 3.8lbs each, 5.5mm thick, date manufactured: Feb 2012 by International Armor. The plates are built to withstand close-range, multiple hits from 7.62mm X 51 mm (.308 caliber) FMJ and AK-47/Kalashnikov 7.62 X 39 mm (FMJ). Smaller calibers are obviously easily defeated.
•BOTH SIDE PLATES:
Level III AR500 Body Armor 6"" x 6"" Side (Pair), Painted Military OD Green to prevent rust/corrosion & protect the plates from wear while inside the carrier! 
AR500 tests each batch of AR500 armor to assure its effectiveness and quality. As you can see from the photo, the plate was tested against 5.56 62gr JHP @ 20yrds, 5.56 Steel-core ""Penetrator"" rounds @ 20yrds, .308 @ 40yrds and 12ga 1.25oz slug @ 15yrds. These plates are multi-hit capable of stopping Multiple hits (unlike military ceramic plates which are brittle and only stop one shot before needing replaced...as you can see from the test plate these are far more durable. They are cut on a CNC Plasma Water Table to keep the plate cool during cutting. As you can see from the test plate, it has been hit with a 5.56 round right at the very bottom edge of the plate, confirming that the strength of the plate's edge has not been compromised. 

DON'T WAIT TILL OBAMA BANDS THEM; GET THEM NOW WHILE STILL AT GOOD PRICES!

*If you're not familiar with International Armor or AR500's body armor get online and look at their gear. These plates are thin and light weight, and unless you know about body armor you may not be impressed when you see them unless you know what you're looking at. If you want heavy, bulky ceramic plates (like guys wear on TV/video games) that will only stop one round before breaking these are not for you. The main plates are thin enough (while still offering the highest level of protection) to be transferred into a low profile plate-carrier to be worn under a suit-jacket for VIP protection details.*

Just wait and get a firearm you can really enjoy, don't spend $2000 on a $500 gun.  

For M4/ AR types, if it does not cut it on the M4 Chart don't even bother, these are true specs that make a difference with a investment such as this.  Don't get mad at me, these are facts!
*M4 Chart-google docs, and updated on forums- chart not updated via Rob S anymore

And if it is an AK, read the forums, the lower end AK's are just lower end, you might get lucky, again you might just get a expensive aggravation.  Remember many of these AK's are kits/ parts put together in the US- too many variations.

 BLACK/OPAQUE (Non-Translucent) Product Information: The Lancer Systems L5AWM Magazine is a polymer and steel hybrid that combines the best features of each material. The one-piece steel feed lip unit is permanently fixed to the polymer body. The steel is hardened so the dimensions will not change in long term storage or rough use. The PTFE coating ensures the steel will not rust. The polymer body is designed with an internal dimension that is a constant curve, combined with a no-tilt follower for maximum reliability in feeding 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition. The exterior texture of the polymer body is aggressive for improved grip when changing magazines. The steel feed lip assembly and the polymer body are corrosion and chemical resistant. The Floor plate slides off similar to a USGI magazine for cleaning and maintenance.

The baofeng uv-5ra (newest model) is a Chinese made ham radio that does what the heavy hitting jap radios do, but for the price of your average Walmart junk walkie talkie. 

 I'm new to ham (studying for license, which isn't hard) but I can confirm these are amazing, way better than a cb also. I heard people from Beaverton (I am in Portland) also people from Hawaii, Cali, Georgia, and somewhere else I forget, camping a frequency as if it was a chat room just talking which I tumbled upon using the scanner button right out of the box.

For $44-$50 bucks having that type of power? Incredible. Just be aware, arms list is full of people trying to make a dishonest buck right now.. Ignorance is no excuse when you find yourself ripped off bad, do your homework.

If your into that electro magnetic pulse stuff, look into faraday cages, can make them yourself, or just buy some lead, and bury the radio. If anything happens you will have god like powers (communication haha)

But really.. Can't go wrong with these radios, and from what I've heard listening ( not keying in) is that the people n the waves want more good folks out there talking.

For under a hundred bucks you could buy Gordon wests audiobook course training you for the test to take get your license.

A baofeng dual band radio.

Extra rechargeable lithium battery packs for the radio

And pay for the test itself.

I know this isn't exactly what armslist was designed for ( they really need to add a forum) but I am sick of seeing people raise prices for personal gain so I felt the need to rant a little at least rant on the dude selling something for twice as more as it is brand new and n stock."

The laser sight is slightly used, but in excellent condition: it was mounted in a Glock 17 for about 2 years, but only had about 100 rounds fired with it in.)
This sight is completely internal, and replaces the Glock guide rod, so you can keep your existing lights, grips, holster, etc.
Included is everything in the picture: the laser sight guide rod, the slide lock and spring, installation tool, original box, manual, and warranty card. Price is $240, cash and exact change only, and no bills larger than $20, please. If interested, please call 323-1580 here in Albuquerque. Thanks.

Manufacturer Description and Information:

Extremely rugged. LaserMax internal guide rods for GLOCK meet or exceed both Mil-Spec and Homeland Security durability test standards (drop tests, blowing sand, temperature and humidity extremes, salt water fog, deep water immersion, 20,000+ rounds live fire).

Installation takes minutes. If you can field-strip your gun, you can install your LaserMax sight—No gunsmithing required. 

Hi-Vis Pulsating Beam. Pulsating gives effortless awareness of muzzle direction, transcends language barriers. Can be used outdoors from dusk till dawn, or indoors round-the-clock. IR versions optimized for NVG characteristics.

Alignment. The Internal Guide Rod lasers come permanently aligned from the factory* for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. There is no need to re-zero after changing batteries.

Accuracy. As close to the bore of the GLOCK as possible, positioning allows for the closest and most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Especially useful for moving targets.

Turn it on! Ambidextrous switch in custom take-down lever closely resembles the factory GLOCK take-down lever. Deliberate on/off activation—highly desirable in a tactical or personal defense situation!

Battery Model: LMS-3x393 (readily available silver oxide batteries commonly used in watches)

Accuracy (20 Yards): ±2"" POA

Laser Operating Temperature: 15°-120° F

Wavelength: 635nm (red-orange)

Made by Lewis Machine and Tool (LMT). These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups come in the PreBan (No Ban) configuration only, including bayonet lug, threaded barrel and A2 flash hider. These uppers are assembled, headspaced, and test fired.    These do not include bolt carrier groups. These do not include charging handles.      

Please Note: 
LMT's branded product line was developed primarily for the US Government / Professional Market. The civilian market is a secondary benefactor to this program. As such the QC standards and priorities (and features) are very different than that of a commercial market AR15 manufacturer. To the very overwhelming majority of shooters, this is a huge plus in the LMT column. It makes their product and extremely attractive option for a civilian shooter looking for a higher standard of product.


With the primary focus being a quality standard for GI sales, there are some noteworthy differences in the product as you receive it. Specific to the LMT Upper Groups, they ALL come extensively test fired from the factory. As such, every single real LMT Upper Group on the market will have significant brass, significant carbon, and handling marks on the group.   Regarding the utility of the Upper Group (everything LMT builds is focused on utility); this is a very very good thing.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents.

Taurus 1145039P Model 145 MillPro 45 ACP 3.25"" 10+1 Poly Grip

Constructed with a hammer forged slide and an injection molded polymer
frame, Taurus' Millennium Pro PT145 is a pocket size, extremely lightweight
double action only autoloader in .45 ACP that weighs a mere 22.6 ounces. It
joins Taurus' family of ultra compact personal defense Millennium
autoloaders. The Model PT145 features a 10 round magazine capacity for 10+1
firepower, but the most central feature of the gun is its rugged recoil
operated action instead of the simple blowback mechanisms found on many
other pocket size pistols.

Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life. This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine. The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face. The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance. The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle."
