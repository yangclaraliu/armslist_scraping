Yes this is a used welder and shows it, but anybody that knows welders knows that Miller is one of the top name brands in welding. Due to the retail cost I am asking 1,000 cash or trade for a few guns or one really nice one if the value is there. There is a brand new spool on it and is ready to go. You supply your own tank and regulator. Only reason for sale is I simply do not have a garage or workplace to use it in and requires a 220 plug. I have neither hence the sale. I am not really looking for anything in particular really items I dont own that I would like to own are as followed. Smith and Wesson 357 black and stainless or blued with brown grips, ruger 357, anything glock 9mm or 40 cal any generation, anything .243,308, 7mm-08,17hmr, nice ar15.... If the value doesnt meet or exceed the value of the welder I expect you to make up the difference in cash please be willing to do so before you waste my time emailing me with a gun thats worth 200.00 and expect a straight trade, that will just waste both our times. Looking forward to a cash sale but am always open to trades so send me a picture and a brief description of what you have to offer. Thank you very much."

For Sale/Trade is a, Like New, Lee Pro 1000 Progressive Press Kit 380 ACP.  Have only used it to load 10 rounds and it works great.  Don’t need it anymore due to I have sold all of my .380s.

The Lee Pro 1000 Progressive Press is a great press for beginning reloaders or seasoned veterans.  Just add a bullet and load a cartridge with each pull of the lever - all other operations are automatic.  For added safety, primers and powder are fed only if a case is present.  For fine adjustments or for experimenting, an alternate loading sequence allows for loading only one case at a time.  Makes learning easy for the first time user.  Easily changed over to other calibers.  Numerous upgrades available for this kit to increase productivity

The gun has around 650-700 rounds through it, I usually buy 100-150 per range trip. It has been thoroughly cleaned after each use. 
I will include the three spare magazines I bought for it for the price of 425 or I will sell it with the original mag for 350. I bought the magazines for 44 apiece less than a month ago. Also while I have all of the original paperwork the stock plastic clamshell fell apart quite quickly. I will include with it the $50  G.P.S. range bag I currently have it in. It has two padded pockets that can hold much larger handguns than this Witness, a pocket that can hold 6 magazines, and a pocket opposite that is designed to hold an entire cleaning kit with a small bolt tray and pockets for shooting glasses and ear protection. You can contact me by text at 620-three one four- 9627 or by email. Thanks for looking."

If you’re looking for a light little pocket rocket that won’t break the bank and the 9mm cartridge works for you, the CM9 will suit you just fine. The dot and post sights are great for quick target acquisition, it has crisp slide serrations, and it isn’t so small that my groupings were wild (and I am far from a pro shooter). But the long trigger, snappy muzzle flip, lone magazine in the box, plastic grip, and the over-aggressive checkering leave something to be desired. Call me superficial, but I still don’t dig how this pistol bears more than a passing resemblance to my dorm room refrigerator."

 This is an for a 36 caliber Standard Navy model Allen and Wheelock revolver. It has a 8” octagonal barrel with dovetailed German silver front sight with 6-shotunfluted cylinder with the hammer mounted to right side of frame. The serial number is 139 which can be seen all matching on the cylinder face, inside of the grips and on the underside of the trigger guard. According to Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms only approximately 750 were manufactured by Allen and Wheelock in the 1858-1861 period. The front half of trigger guard serves as the Rammer lever and is retained by a spring loaded catch at back of trigger guard. This example has 2 piece walnut grips which have retained most of its original varnish but does show moderate to heavy wear on edges as seen in the photos. The bluing on the barrel is fully intact but has lightened with scattered very light speckling. The fine barrel marking are complete and unworn. The Cylinder retains about 75% of the stag & dog hunting scene. The mechanics are fully function and crisp. The bore shines bright with strong rifling. The cost of shipping and insurance is $68 mostly due to the cost of insurance. This is an antique so no specific federal licenses are required for transfer.

The class lasts about 7 hours total, includes a written and range test, basic handgun safety, handgun cleaning, handgun knowledge, handgun marksmanship, and qualifies you to apply for a CCDW license in KY. Students should bring a modern functioning handgun with 50 rounds of factory new ammunition and appropriate cleaning supplies for the firearm. Don’t have a handgun, ammo, or supplies? No worries! Get in touch with me and we can work out the details. There is also a $60 fee divided between the state and local police that is normally paid 2-3 weeks after the completion of the course. A criminal background check will be done by the Kentucky State Police after the completion of the course. Due to high volume, it is currently taking up to 5 months after the class for the actual license to be issued by the Kentucky State Police. Feel free to contact me, and thanks for your consideration!

Only picture I had, sorry.

Just like it says.  5+1 capacity. Pistol grip and foregrip. Older model so it has a little wear but is still in good shape. Not stainless but polished. Nice gun. As you can see in the picture, I have two of the same model so I don't need it, I would rather have cash. All proceeds go towards tattoo work. Check Cabelas if you want to know what a Mossberg goes for new. A plain jane Persuader model (same but with only one pistol grip) is $439. No barter please. Unless it's an assault rifle. Prefer text or call and leave voicemail and I will call back.

This would make a great project gun, I just don't have the time to do the work. The wood on this one is in great shape but the finish is very worn, there is some pitting on the barrel and the bluing is very worn. But this is a very old rifle (made between '46-'48, if my research is correct) and has seen it's fair share of use.

These haven't been made in a while and are very collectible.

Cosmetically it is good on the right side and very good on the left side (mostly holster and handling wear).

The action is perfect and it shoots like a dream. The bore is like a mirror (this was carried but hardly shot IMO). The decocker/safety functions flawlessly. This is 100% ready to go.

It comes with the original 8-round magazine. These magazines sell on Gunbroker for $100 by themselves. I have a couple more mags available for the right trade.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

We carry CHAMPION and SUPERIOR brand safes. They are sister companies owned by Ray Crosby. (www.championsafes.com and www.superiorgunsafes.com) I could carry a bunch of other brands, and have been approached by some other companies, but I choose Champion and Superior because of their quality, customer service, U.S.A. manufacturing and warranty. I wouldn't sell you a brand that I don't have faith in or wouldn't own myself. (I own a Superior.)
I also keep my prices very fair. I don't run a lot of sale price specials. You won't have to wonder if you could have saved a few dollars by waiting for a big sale. The prices are already low. I'm not trying to retire after one big sale- I just want to sell a lot of safes! When you buy a safe from me and then, because you were happy, tell your friend and he buys a safe, you've stumbled onto my business model.
PARKER'S SAFES AND VAULTS carries around 30 gun safes in sizes from 17 cubic feet up to 75 cubic feet and WE DELIVER, INSTALL AND SERVICE! That means we'll bring the safe to you, put it where you want it, get it level, bolt it down,(if you want), explain how to operate and maintain your new safe and lock, explain the warranty paperwork AND help you if you have an issue in the future. (I've only seen 2 problems in 4 years and they were both minor).

If you'd like to see and talk about some quality safes in person, give me a call and arrange a visit. If you just have some questions about safes, call, email or text me.

 The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members
 The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

Has a vintage scope attached and is very accurate out to 100 yards. Bluing is in great condition for its age with no rust or pitting and bore is also real nice as evidenced by it’s accuracy. Only real detractions is a small chip on the toe of the butt plate and a tight crack on the top of the stock near the receiver. Both items can be seen in the pictures. I’ve been using this one for my back up rifle for deer hunting in heavier brush. But recently got a .32 Winchester handed down to me and will be using that one and can’t afford to keep guns I don’t use.(at least that’s what my wife says) Price is firm.
