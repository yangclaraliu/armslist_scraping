GLOCK has become one of the most popular firearms used by law enforcement over the last few decades because they are some of the most reliable weapons on the planet. 

The Gen 4 has a Multiple Backstrap System that allows you to add a backstrap to the rear of the grip so youcan get a custom sized grip that fits your hand perfectly. The backstraps come in to sizes, M=2mm and L=4mm, as well as two styles, standard and beaver tail (the beaver tail incorporates a flair that protects your thumb from the slide as it travels back during cycling). Also on the Gen 4 is a new grip surface known as Rough Textured Frame which helps you hold on tighter when your hands may be sweaty.

The CompM4 sight features an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring, and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of weapon systems. Can run continuously on a AA for 8 years. 

Designed for 3rd generation night vision technology
The CompM4 sight can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility.
The performance of CompM4 sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology.

The clearest, brightest image possible
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).

Ready for use around the clock
With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 sight is ready for round the clock use.

Unique features of the CompM4
High battery compartment

Unique features of the CompM4 and CompM4s
Compatible with every generation of NVD
ACET technology allows up to 80,000 hours (over 8 years) of daytime operation on one AA battery
Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery
7 NVD settings and 9 daylight settings
QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation and lower the risk of snagging on other gear
Mount base is keyed into to the body of the sight to absorb recoil
Mount base screws directly into the sight – no separate sight ring required.
500,000 hours of use on NVD setting
2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement
Matches perfectly with Aimpoint® 3XMag

I've shot maybe 10 slugs thru it & it is dead on accurate with them, the rest of the shooting I did with it was skeet shooting. Shoots perfect & extremely smooth. Scope comes off with two screws for shooting skeet or fowl, put it back on & it returns to zero perfectly, very solid setup.

Gun is in next to new condition. Holds 11 rounds of .357 ammo in magazine tube and shoots .38 Special too. Mechanically excellent with a close to unused mirror-clean bore. Other features: blued receiver with 20 inch octagon barrel, crescent shape steel butt plate, top tang safety, spent cartridges angle up and outward towards the side. My gun was made in New Haven, Connecticut in 2004. Rare Gun: Winchester made only about 1,025 of my Model 94’s Trails End specific version from 2004-2006 the only time they were manufactured. Winchester closed down USA manufacturing operations in 2006 and now outsources their lever actions to be made in Asia.

It's a ex police gun so there is some holster wear and dead night sights. Gun shoots fantastic it's just as accurate as my Sr1911. I am only selling because I am funding a Glock 30 purchase. Glock comes with 1 10 round magazine. I'd prefer to sell to a mass resident only so I can keep this Glock in the state for other mass residents to enjoy having a high cap 45. I am looking for 650 as it is a fair price for a mass compliant Glock 21 they are rare in mass. Anyone who knows glocks knows that holster wear does not effect how they shoot in any manner. When I bought this one I had a choice of 7 other ones which some had almost no holster wear and bright night sites. I picked this one up because the mechanics were better than the other ones. I know my glocks as this is my 4th lol. My names Rob thanks for your time.

This pistol was a very limited edition from TALO in late 2010 through early 2011. The run was never completed and only a few of these pistols were made. This one has factory Metrolight night sights and a Glock grip plug installed. I had the Glock Armorer install a 3.5 lb trigger kit including the connector and all 3 springs over the weekend. Its actually a little less then 3lbs I think. I have a couple of other Glocks done exactly the same way and this one has the lightest trigger. The factory trigger parts are included. This gun also includes 2 hi-cap mags, the box and all factory accessories. 

These EXO Glocks are extremely hard to find especially brand new. The chance of you walking into a gun dealer and them having one are almost impossible. The last few Glock EXO's that sold on Gunbroker went for around $700. And that's without the extras that are on this one. Im asking $775 or best offer. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or offers. Im not interested in any trades at this time and low ballers can go on to the next listing. Thanks for looking & GOD Bless."

Nothing fancy, just stuff I bought a couple boxes of every payday after the last time the clowns in DC caused ammo prices to go thru the roof. 

I'd be fine to just keep it on hand, but I got laid off the end of last month. My laptop decided to do a crash and burn a week ago, and this morning my wife tells me our refrigerator died... so you know where this is going LOL

I agree it's completely nuts what's happened with ammo prices and don't doubt stuff will be around 6 months from now - although higher than it was before. But in the meantime, if you need range ammo and are willing to pay a premium so you don't have to drive 100 miles to find it in stock somewhere, wave some cash in my face and we can both help each other out.

9mm /  40 S&W - $30/60 for 50/100 rounds
45 ACP - $40/80 for 50/100
22LR - $8 box of 50 or $35/50 for brick of 333/550

Brands are Winchester / Blazer Brass / Federal / S&B / Remington probably a few others I can't remember - basically what I'd buy off the shelf at Walmart or Cabela's. Let me know if there's something specific you're looking for, the pics below are just some of what I've got. I also have some JHP defense ammo in all calibers I'd consider selling if you want it bad enough to persuade me. 

While I'm doing this to get the cash, I'd be open to trade, although swapping for another gun probably defeats the purpose. But if you have silver coins or your ex-wedding ring, whatever - toss me an offer, worst I can do is say 'no'. But please don't waste your time and mine telling me I'm an evil price gouger because I won't sell for what you bought ammo for 6 months ago. If you want to camp out at Walmart at 4 am for two hours to get ammo at their retail, go for it. If your time is worth $20, make an offer and we'll both go away happy. 

Cheers!

Forgot to mention when I first put this up: as my brother-in-law the cop reminds me, it's a given I need to see a photo ID showing you're 21 since this is handgun ammo. Thanks!"

I hate to do this, but I have a tax bill that has to be paid.

This is my all time favorite handgun. The entire Sig Sauer line is great, with the bulletproof construction of the P229 the one that works the best for me. The first time I held a SAS version, I was hooked. It is my favorite pistol, only better. The egdes have been smoothed out, it has nightsights, a short reset trigger, it is a P229 9mm, it is just about the perfect do-all handgun. A little heavy, but compact enough for carry, works great for the nightstand, or the range, or just about anywhere. This is my fourth P229, but my first SAS.
