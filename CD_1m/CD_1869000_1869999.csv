The 3032 Tomcat offers all the features of the 21 Bobcat. Both pistols have a snag-proof design that permits quick presentation to the target, a slide blade front sight for fast target acquisition, and a smooth, crisp trigger pull in double/single action.

QUALITY POCKET PISTOLS. 
The same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality control that make the 92FS, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity, safety and practical use are their best qualities. 
PRACTICAL AND SIMPLE.
The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas. 

 	1) Barrel. Forged out of special high-strength steel; precisely rifled for accuracy. The Inox  models feature stainless steel barrels.
2) Slide. Machined out of high-strength carbon steel and specially heat treated.
3) Sights. Notched rear sight and blade front sight for fast target acquisition.
4) Frame-mounted. Manual, conveniently thumb operated.
5) Contoured Tang. Top of the grip area is precisely curved and relieved to snugly accommodate the shooter’s hand, thus protecting the thumb web from being pinched by the slide and increasing the pistol control upon firing.
6) Frame. Made of a special alloy, noticeably stronger, lighter and more corrosion resistant than stainless steel. In all other models the frame is made of special aluminum alloy forgings and anodized black or gray.
7) Tip-up Barrel Latch.
8) Trigger Pull. Smooth, crisp pull in double/single action. 
9) Snag Proof Design. Smooth contours permit quick, smooth draw.
3032 TOMCAT. EXCELLENT POWER VS WEIGHT.
Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy. Available in the Tritium version featuring the tritium luminous front sight in some countries. 

3032 TOMCAT INOX.
This new model has a stainless steel slide and barrel. The alloy frame is gray anodized to match the color and finish of the stainless components. The trigger, hammer, safety, magazine and other parts are blued. All other features are the same as the Tomcat."

This rifle was originally chambered in .30-06, but was re-barreled in 2002 to .308 Winchester after a well intentioned but errant friend left it in a closet for a year in False Pass, Alaska after using it on a caribou hunt and not cleaning it afterwards.  The original barrel developed some pitting, and although it still shot well, it just bugged the hell out of me.  The new barrel was purchased from Midwest Gun Works, and was installed, headspaced, and test fired by Andy Hawk Gunsmithing in Anchorage Alaska.  Check him out-he builds custom take-down lever guns and does first rate smith work.  Anyway, this particular rifle has a DNZ low mount holding a Leupold 2x-7x scope, three magazines (clips) and it shoots really well!  This is no safe queen-it has been afield and the stock and metal tell the tale, but it is not trashed either-it is still a beautiful rifle and a great shooter.  Make me a decent offer.  I will post pics soon-the rifle is at a local gun store in the back room right now being eye-balled by the store owner-if he ever makes up his mind.  In the meantime...."

It is not difficult to find holsters that fit the 6906. The 6906 is renowned for absolute reliability. It has a completely stainless slide and the frame is composed of an alloy to reduce weight. This thing has never caused me a minute of problems, in fact it is my nightstand gun/go-to gun for concealed carry (or it was until I made a recent purchase). Now, I would like to trade it for a larger caliber revolver in either single/double action or a 1911 like a Rock Island Armory (or sell outright for $600). Mine comes with the blue S&W plastic box, a set of Hogue rubberized wraparound finger groove grips (with the original grips), one factory 12 round stainless steel magazine with pinky extension, and three extended factory stainless magazines with extender spacers. Just the extended mags themselves sell for $80-100 each when you can find them. No nightsights."

469,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1869469,"For Sale:  DPMS Panther LR-308 16"" 7.62x51 Heavy Barrel w/ gas block and tube","Grey Forest, San Antonio, Texas",$ 250,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 17, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Lightly used take-off barrel from a DPMS Panther LR-308. It is a 16"" barrel with 1-10 twist. The muzzle is threaded 5/8""-24, and there is light damage on the threads, though the damage does not effect their use. The barrel uses a carbine-length gas system, and is 0.750"" under the gas block. I will include the original low-profile gas block and carbine-length gas tube with the sale.

The weapon that included this barrel was sold to me as ""unfired"", though clearly, it had been fired – perhaps just a proof round from the factory? I personally fired 200-300 rounds through it, including a proper break-in procedure with frequent cleaning. The barrel is in excellent functional condition, only lightly broken-in at this point. Aside from the damage mentioned above, there are light marks from disassembly, none of which would be visible on an assembled weapon.

I can't find anyone offering them who has one to sell. DPMS lists them new for $299, and says they'll have them in 8-12 months! Since it's used, I'll offer this one for $250. I prefer a local, face-to-face deal for cash, but I'm willing to ship at my cost if you're willing to pay up front.

If you're not willing to pay the $250, I also now have this listed on Gunbroker, so it'll sell this week one way or the other. Bid now if you want it!

Oracle is an excellent entry-level upper assembly that incorporates the versatility of the A3 Flat-Top configuration in selecting a preferred sighting arrangement with a solid, fully functional foundation of quality components. It is the perfect way to get into the larger, more powerful LR-308 platform, and is an ideal candidate for future user customization.
The Oracle features a 16"" Heavy Contour Barrel with a versatile 1:10 rifling twist rate capable of stabilizing a wide selection of different bullet weights. It utilizes a flattop upper receiver with forward assist, ejection port door and integral shell deflector. The upper comes equipped with heat resistant polymer handguards, single rail gas block, charging handle, complete bolt & carrier assembly, and an A2 birdcage flash hider. Aluminum parts are hard coat anodized to mil-spec, steel parts are manganese phosphate treated (parkerized) matte black.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

Product Details:
Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

The SCAR® is the semi-auto only version of the newest service rifle of U.S. special operators. Light, fast-handling and quick shooting, the SCAR® 16S is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO (223 Rem.) and features a free-floating, cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel with chrome-lined bore. Fully-ambidextrous operating controls on both models instantly adapt to any shooter and any shooting position. The receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail and three accessory rails enable the mounting of scopes or electronic sights, plus tactical lights and lasers. The telescoping, side-folding polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length-of-pull, availible in matte black.

THE NEW PARADIGM IN ASSAULT RIFLES
Emerging from the U.S. Military’s SCAR® program, the MK 16 and MK 17 weapon systems use a common multi-caliber architecture that is highly modular and instantly adaptable to virtually any mission requirements, and is further enhanced by the MK 13 grenade launcher. Built with an eye toward the economic realities and small logistic footprint requirements of today’s highly mobile military, every component of the SCAR® Family is readily adaptable to future upgrades and enhanced ammunition designs. Overall life cycle costs are reduced and nearly all standard maintenance can be easily accomplished at the operator or unit armorer level. The SCAR® is serving on the front lines with America’s warfighters in the defense of freedom.

***I have a complete commercial grade Oxy-Acetylene Torch setup with everything needed to go to work or just have around the house for projects- top of the line made by ºVICTOR and its 100% complete with the safest and most high quality, strongest components made. Cut, Weld, Fabricate or whatever you want. I PAID $2000 FOR IT BUT SOLD BUSINESS AND NO LONGER NEED I BUT I KNOW SOMEONE DOES- WILL CUT UP AN ENTIRE CAR IN MINUTES- PERFECT FOR PEOPLE SCRAPPING CARS AND METAL OR ANYONE NEEDING TO CUT, WELD, HEAT, Etc. Sell or Trade for fair price. 
***Dayton Heavy Duty 1000 pound electronic chain hoist, lightweight and easily portable but very strong, will lift/lower a range of 10 feet, very handy around the garage, shop, business, warehouse,  plugs into common household 110V power outlet or extension cord for even greater versatility than most and all you do is stand back and press up/down on the remote. Works like new, bearely used- great for pulling engines and mechanic work or lifting heavy equipment parts, etc. I use it to lift the lawnmower up to remove the blades, sharpen them, and put them back, and do maintenance on it and stuff like that and it hasnt ever been used much but should be since its such a handy piece of equipment to have around. I paid $1000 for it a couple years ago but it needs to go somewhere where it will be used. Sell or Trade for fair price. 
****I have lots of nice name brand power tools, both electric and cordless: Craftsman Pro Series HD ROUTER New in Hard Case , DeWalt HEAVY DUTY SAWZALL, DeWalt Drywall Pro Electric Screw Gun with depth settings, etc., 1/2"" Drive Electric Impact Wrench thats very strong, 18V Cordless Drill, etc.

Plus with this deal you get the heads, new plugs, gaskets, and the valvetrain is already good to go and handled a trick flow hydraulic roller camshaft perfectly and will handle common aftermarket high performance cams from Ford Racing, Comp Cams, Trick Flow, etc. The stock GT40P head springs are very weak and wont even hold up to a .444/.444 lift stock 5.0 H.O. Camshaft so if you buy a set you have to budget in $200-$300 for a spring upgrade kit and if you dont have a spring compressor, valve spring height checker, and the know how to take everything apart and put it back together and install the valves with springs at proper height and shim them if needed(doing this 16 times takes a while and machine shops have pretty expensive labor rates, plus they need to be magnafluxed for cracks invisible to the naked eye and vatted/cleaned) plus re-seat all 16 valves by lapping them and hope  all 16 valve guides and valve seats are in good shape and dont need to be replaced or the bill goes up, and that is after you pay $300 for the heads so the budget heads are not such a great deal anymore when you spend $600 buying them and having springs installed plus another $125-$150 for gaskets and plugs, etc  I have everything you need including the rocker arms and pushrods, bolts, etc. (they are not special-you just use the stock stuff from your engine that you used with your stock heads when you inatall these. HOWEVER, THIS IS A GOOD DEAL FOR SOMEONE SINCE EVERYTHING IS UPGRADED AND IN PERFECT WORKING ORDER WITH NO ISSUES WHATSOEVER AND ALL OF THE MONEY GETTING THE HEADS IN THE CONDITION THEY NEED TO BE IN HAS ALREADY BEEN SPENT PLUS YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SPEND ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY.  YOU JUST BUY THESE HEADS AND GO HOME AND INSTALL THEM WHICH IS VERY EASY SINCE THERE IS NO ADJUSTING VALVES OR ANYTHING-JUST INSTALL GASKETS, PARTS, TORQUE DOWN THE BOLTS AND GO-IM INCLUDING NEW High Performance Spark Plugs still in the box and all FEL PRO GASKETS NEEDED TO INSTALL EVERYTHING LISTED ON A FUEL INJECTED OR CARBURETED 5.0, 289, 302, 351 with a

Love this rifle, it's not a safe queen so there's a few nicks here and there but it shoots nice tight groups with 55gr rounds. I have right around 250 rounds thru it as I've only owned it since January and ammo has just been too damned expensive. I will include a 20 round and two 30 round sets of magazine parts that you can pin, block, weld or whatever into 15 round mags to conform to Colorados new mag law. Prefer local but will ship thru a local FFL, all fees in that case will apply but I'll make sure to use to most reasonably priced FFL I can find.
Also interested in a trade for an old GS850 or other late 70s early 80s bike that would make a good bobber. Thanks for looking

6""x 6"" and 6"" x 8"" Curved Side Plates $55 each

Free Shipping, When you buy two or more plates, any size!



Best price, best quality and fastest shipping!

We only offer one version of our plates (the best configuration you can get!) Curved and a maximum Line-X buildup (over 1/4"" thick on strike face)

We do not recommend bare steel or a minimum anti-spall buildup for armor. If hit, you and others may suffer injury from projectile fragmentation and spall.

At our price, quality and speed of fulfillment it pays to have the best!

Features:



High Quality Steel and Coating, Made in the USA

Sprayed with an anti-spalling protective coating to help mitigate spalling, fragmentation and impact force.



Strike face has over 1/4"" of anti-spall coating for maximum fragmentation containment



Plate edges are smooth and free from burrs or sharp edges



All plates are formed (curved) for a comfortable fit, a must for prone position!



Waterproof, durable, reliable, chemical and wear resistant, no special storage or handling requirements



Can take several hits without anti-spall coating delaminating



No shelf life, lasts a lifetime



Thin profile just over 1/2"" thick with coating, thinner than ceramic



Inexpensive, a fraction of the cost of ceramic



Will fit most standard 10” x 12” plate carriers



We do not guarantee our armor will contain 100% of the fragmentation & spall but through our testing we found it will give you significantly better odds of protection than using bare steel or a light coat of anti-spall coatings
