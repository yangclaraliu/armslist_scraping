 GoFoods is your solution when disaster strikes.
 Delicious, easy to make, affordable food that will be just as delicious 25 years later.
 Yes, GoFoods products can last a very long time. It is also GMO free, preservative free, all natural, no msg, no trans fat, no hydrogenated oil, no soy and more. They are very serious about what goes into their foods. That's why I support and personally consume these products on a daily basis (I'll tell you more about that later).

 A supply of food is definitely a worthwhile investment in such a shaky economy, especially when you have children or elderly living with you. 

 I have to add my personal testimonial because I started as a customer sampling the products. I started by getting a sample pack shipped to me, and I received it quite promptly. It had 3 individually packaged meals, a CD, a brochure and was all packaged in a neat box. The 3 dishes included were a cheesy rice, potato soup, and tortilla soup. I kept the 1st one simple which was the cheesy rice, but I added 2 chicken breast (grilled and cubed) and a sweet red pepper (cubed and grilled with the chicken) and nothing more. No salt, pepper or any other seasonings. I threw that in and OMG me and my spouse loved it. Second was the Potato soup and I only added bacon and once again HOLY MOLY it was delicious! Third and last was the tortilla soup. I decided to add absolutely nothing and as well it was delicious to the last drop. Every sip was gone. From there I was sold!

 This food is a million times better the any military style MRE as far as taste, quantity, quality, lack of GMO's etc, and much more. 

 This food can also be used as a substitute to your usual shopping. It can be delivered to your door, is as easy as boiling water, and is CHEAP!

 Preparedness begins with food. Eat well with GoFoods.

 Also great for hunting, camping, traveling, everyday use as a quick fix or side. The wife would appreciate it and it tastes just as good as out of the garden. The ultimate in storable food, a great gift for any prepper.

 Also offering other products for preparedness such as the Berkey Water Filter.

508,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1779508,"For Sale:  FIREClean! Advanced Gun Oil, Excellent Cleaner, lubricant, conditioner","Franklin, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 15,"Listed On: Sunday, July 14, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"To Purchase, Visit Us online at : https://leipersforkfirearms.com 

FIREClean was founded in early 2012 by two longtime shooting enthusiasts.  Having tired of conventional gun oils that quickly evaporated in hard use, they sought to develop something better.  Why is FIREClean growing so quickly?

FIREClean Advanced Gun Oil:
- melts carbon fouling....but doesn't harm metal, polymer, or night sights
- conditions metal to resist carbon fouling, with no heating required
- lubricates to incredibly high temperatures and isn't ""flung off"" into your eye protection.  Shooters with tightly  fitted 1911 pistols report 3,000 rounds between cleanings.  
- non-toxic, non-flammable, and odorless
- ultra high efficiency; very little oil is required to get the job done
- formulated to prevent gumming
- used and recommended by some of the top shooting instructors in the industry, with a growing portfolio of alliances in firearms manufacturing
- approved and recommended by the National Tactical Officers Association



FIREClean is a revolutionary way to keep your gun running cleaner, longer, and smoother.  This 4-oz bottle can clean, lubricate, and condition 30,000 rounds ($20,000 worth) of 5.56 ammunition!!! Whether you're firing a musket, revolver, or belt-fed crew-served weapon, FIREClean will enhance your firearms' reliability, and greatly reduce cleaning time and effort.  

Conditions metal to prevent buildup of carbon and other fouling
Most fouling simply wipes off(TM)
Cleans deeply and safely into gun metals
Reduces friction with persistent and remarkable lubricity
Dramatically reduces cleaning time and effort
Enhances reliability and decreases parts breakage
Odorless and non-toxic
Used as the cleaner and lubricant in the Luckygunner/Vuurwapenblog 40,000 round test
NEARLY 50% OF TOP 3-GUN SHOOTERS USE FIRECLEAN TO EASE CLEANING AND ENHANCE RELIABILITY

""When it comes to lubrication, I have used every name brand product that there is to use on the market to lube up my weapons. I recently changed to a new non-petroleum based product called FIREClean. I had never really bought into the hype about one lube is better than the next until I tried FIREClean"" - Jason Falla, former Australian SAS, Director of Training - Redback One

Used and recommended by John S. Farnam, defense-training.com

""Performance in a bottle."" - ""Super"" Dave Harrington, Combat Speed LLC, tactical trainer

""Phenomenal product.....cleans and melts carbon""  - MSG (Ret) Paul Howe, Combat Shooting & Tactics, tactical trainer and author

I have been using FIREClean on my reapplication of lubricant lately and it has been performing as advertised.  I specifically like it on concealment of duty type arms where you don’t want excess lubricant dripping off the gun.  It actually conditions the metal…..it is very much worth a look.”– Mike Pannone, CTT Solutions, tactical trainer and author

""I have used FIREClean during practice for several month now. But I really put it through the paces during the Ohio State Championships and the Camp Perry Pistol National Matches. This amazing oil is the best lubrication that I have ever used. No more constant or excessive lubrication drills to ensure that your precision weapon performs flawlessly or hard to remove carbon during clean-up. From this point on my Rifles, Shotguns, and Precision Pistols with receive nothing else but FIRECLEAN. Thanks Guys for the discovery and hardwork."" - William Bethards, Top Shot Season 4, Cabot Arms Shooting Team

""FIREClean is a $200 action job in a bottle"" - Aaron R., competitive shooter and former Navy SEAL

""I am a range master at a major skeet shooting range. Part of my job is maintaining and cleaning our 50 rental Beretta 391 semi auto shotguns each week. During our busy season these guns get pretty crusty between cleanings. I am always looking for a better and faster way of cleaning these shotguns.   Now that I have started using FIREClean my gun cleaning time has been cut in half. The stuff works great! I apply a small amount on the dirty parts and then wipe them clean. Burnt on carbon and grease do not stand a chance against FIREClean. Your product is also a wonderful lubricant as it cleans and lubricates at the same time. Thanks for making my job easier"" - Bernie F., Phoenix, AZ


Rental ranges and professional shooters report a serious reduction in cleaning time and effort.  Parts that used to be cleaned with brake cleaner, wire wheels and dental picks can now be wiped off with QTips and paper towels.  

While FIREClean was originally developed for suppressed, short-barreled AR-15s (unquestionably one of the world's most unforgiving lubrication environments), it also works incredibly well on revolvers, 22LR semi autos, muzzle loaders, bolt action rifles, 1911s, and even .50 caliber belt fed machine guns.  For this reason some of the world's top competitive shooters and specially selected SWAT elements are using FIREClean to keep their guns running cleaner and longer."

I’ve seen pictures of torture tests that blade men have put the BK2 through and it is incredible how well the knife holds up. On Amazon, the BK2 has 603 consumer comments. The BK2 consumer rating is 4.5 stars out of a possible 5.0 on Amazon.

-22inch barrel
-41.5 inches in OAL
weight- 6 3/4lbs. 
I can check the trigger pull for you but I believe it is about 4lbs.
I have maintained it regularly and, tested it once every 5 months using snap caps. There is no rust or pitting on any metal on this rifle, the bore is in my opinion 8.5/10. The stock was custom fitted by a gunsmith for my fathers length of pull, the recoil pad is a Pachmayr, I need to check to see what model it is. I cannot fit all the photos here so please email me and I can provide more photos. I will include a bottle of Birchwood Casey walnut stain if you want to refinish the stock.
I am putting a trade value of $320 on the rifle and the below listed accessories.
*The sling is not included but I am including a Winchester soft case a milsurp ACU M4/M16 mag bandoleer which can hold 120 rounds of 30-30, and a thru-bolt gun lock

I am including the following ammo (all in photo)
-100rnds of Federal ammo 150gr (loose ammo, not in boxes)
-100rnds of Winchester 170gr
-100rnds of reloads by Nutmeg Sporting Cartridge. Made right here in CT. all are 150gr
-40rnds of Winchester 150gr. 
The cost of the ammo alone at what I paid would run you over $280. I am putting a cash/trade value of $220 (aprox $12.94 a box) on the ammo. *The ammo boxes still have the prices on them so you can check and see what a deal you are getting from me.  

Trade value of everything = $540. I would prefer to trade for a rifle with atleast 100rnds of ammo with it. Trade only, will not sell at this time. Please email or call REDACTED. I'm Dave. Willing to drive as far as Avon or Harwinton.

Considered the most durable and reliable back up iron sights on the market and been used by the US military for years. They are in excellent working condition. Nothing wrong with them I just would like to buy the same iron sights but with the Noveske Marked symbol on them since I have them on an all out Noveske AR15. Not a lot a ways to find these sights cheaper than $200...so this is a rare opportunity if you have been wanting these iron sights. These are the HK style front sight as you see from the picture. I did round off the sharp edges on the left side of the front sight because it would dig into my palm because I had it positioned behind the forward grip of my hand. Does not affect function of the sight at all actually made it better in my opinion. These are authentic sights purchased directly thru Troy Industries. If you want me to ship the cost is on you.

This is the model with the angle-cut receiver and integrated sights. The barrel is 16 1/2"" and threaded. I've removed the thread protector and installed a birdcage flash suppressor. This has created a small gouge on the bottom of the barrel from removing the welded pin, but I refinished the area and now it isn't very noticeable. The wood is pristine with no scratches, same as the finish. The previous owner stated he never fired it, but upon disassembly I did find some carbon on the piston face. Even so, it was maybe test fired at most judging from the small amount of carbon found. I myself have not fired it. Comes with 4 magazines (5, 10, and two 20 rounders), owners manual, and cleaning rod. Ammo not included.
