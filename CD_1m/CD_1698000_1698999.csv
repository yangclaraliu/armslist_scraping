Based on the .22 Hornet cartridge case, the .17 Hornet propels the 20 grain V-MAX bullet to a scorching 3,650 fps. Fueled with the Superformance propellant, the .17 Hornet Superformance Varmint cartridges are economically priced, and deliver the trajectory of a traditional 55 grain .223 load, with the recoil of a .22 WMR. I work for Outdoors Unlimited in Norfolk, Nebraska. The rifle pictured is not necessarily the one you will receive. The gun will be shipped from our store to your FFL for a cost of $30.00 including ground shipping and insurance. The gun is 41.75 inches long, weighs 6.9 pounds.

I love the revolver but its not practical for the hog hunting we do. The package comes with the Raging bull, a set of lee reloading dies, a box of winchester factory ammo, 2 holsters, a box of brass, a scope mount and an ammo box. The brass i got from someone, most is new. he primed a few but i never loaded them so i do not know what primers are in the brass. the brass is from starline so it is small rifle primers. Magnum primers need to be used with all casull brass. the leather holster comes with the cartridge belt and then i also have a Bianchi holster for it. the scope mount is a weigand combat scope mount that is matched stainlss like the revolver with a set of weaver grand slam 1"" medium scope rings.. in total i have 100 pieces of brass. You have everything needed to get out and hunt hogs with this and everything to get started reloading for the casull. 



Im mainly looking to trade for lever action rifles or single action pistols. I might take an AR-15. you can send offers, worst i can say is no. For lever actions i really want a 45 colt or 30-30 or both.

I have too many guns already, so I am wondering if I can do do some type of cash + trade for what you have.  For the trade I have a Savage Axis .308 never fired with factory scope on it.  As well I have a Remington 7400 .308 with scope that is in really great condition and comes with the regular magazine and a new 10 round magazine I just purchased.  The Axis new goes for about $325 without tax and I just paid $545 for the 7400 and the 10 round magazine.  In addition, I can trade in 9mm, .308, or 223 ammo if that helps in a trade too.  Please let me know if you are interested as I would like to get this sooner than later to start practicing with it for the season next fall.

I have a CCP and would present ID to you to make this transaction valid.  Hope to hear from you soon!"

This is a fake listing and when you contact the seller they ask for you to send payment to a M. Gilliam in Murrells Inlet. Or they will ask you to send it to a person and address in Georgia and/or Jacksonville, FL. The person in SC that received the check is honest and found himself in the middle of a scam using his name and a fake email address. 
Photos of the fake gun for sale are attached. 
What to do: contact your loca FBI and AFT office to make them aware if you have been scammed. This is a federal felony once it crosses state lines and is wire fraud. 

If you are making a purchase from any website, always do it through a registered FFL dealer and gun store. Send payment to the dealer and they will forward the weapon after receiving it. If it is a scam, then you will get your money back because no weapon will have been dropped off. Always get an address and phone number from the seller and the FFL dealer and verify they are correct and contact the FFL license holder of that gun store.

Be smart out there and do things the right way and these scammers will not be able to feed off the innocent."

From Alvarez:

If you've always lusted after the lush, rich tonal textures that only rosewood can produce, but thought you couldn't afford it, the AD70 from Alvarez will change your mind! At the heart of the Alvarez AD70's amazing tone is its hand-sanded scalloped bracing, which allows the top to resonate more freely without compromising strength & stability.

Alvarez's rosewood bi-level bridge puts more down-pressure on the bone saddle, creating a more efficient energy transfer from the strings to the top, giving you more volume than you ever thought possible from a guitar in this price range. And with its hand-selected rosewood back & sides, you get all that big, warm bottom-end rosewood is known for at a groundbreaking price.

Alvarez also refined their neck profile, with a thinner, faster neck that plays easier, yet still feels solid in your hands. The Alvarez AD70 is a tone machine that's just waiting to take your playing to the next level."

When you have a life-long passion for precision, nothing says you've arrived like a five-shot group you can cover with a dime, and very few rifles on earth can elevate you to this stage in life as quickly as our Model 40-X™ series. Built on our world-famous Model 40-X action, the very same action that's dominated benchrest competitions since its creation in 1962, these rifles are handcrafted in the Remington Custom Shop to deliver the pinnacle of shot-to-shot consistency. The blueprinted action is impeccably squared to the barrel, and the barreled action is then hand-fitted and epoxy-bedded into the stock, creating a solid, exacting piece of machinery best compared to surgical equipment. An external adjustment on the 40-X trigger gives you a 1 1/2- to 3 1/2-lb. range, with a special 2-oz. trigger available as an option for select models. The stainless steel barrels are button rifled and hand lapped, then finished with a concave crown. 

Layaway available.  $40 shipping to lower 48, additional to AK and HI.  If sold in SC, we have to charge 6% sales tax.  If you pay with credit card, we charge an additional 3%.

SIX ROUNDS. THREE CALIBERS. 159 YEARS OF PROTECTION.

Introducing the S&W GOVERNOR.
 New. Versatile. Lightweight. The Smith & Wesson Governor revolver puts six rounds of customizable response under your control. Load with .410 2 1/2"" shotshells, .45 ACP or .45 Colt - alone or in combination - and hit your target in every situation. Plus, it's from the leading expert in revolver manufacturing over the past 159 years. Now that's confidence.

From the Smith & Wesson Press Room

Smith & Wesson Corp., the legendary 159-year old company in the global business of safety, security, protection and sport, announced yesterday the introduction of the Governor - a new firearm engineered as the ultimate self-defense package.

January 19, 2011 SPRINGFIELD, Mass.

Offering multiple caliber capabilities along with a lightweight scandium alloy frame, the Governor carries forward Smith & Wesson's rich history of revolver manufacturing and dedication to the personal protection market. 

Named the Governor for its authoritative appearance and specialized features, this new revolver provides discerning consumers with an essential tool for self-defense needs. At the core of this revolver is Smith & Wesson's patented heat-treated scandium frame for superior strength and reduced weight. Capable of chambering a mixture of .45 Colt, .45 ACP and .410 gauge 2 ½-inch shotshells, the Governor is suited for both close and distant encounters, allowing users to customize the load to their preference. The shooter's choice of ammunition is housed in the revolver's six-shot stainless PVD-coated cylinder, which adds an extra level of protection to this already rugged platform. On top of the revolvers compact 2 ¾-inch barrel, Smith & Wesson has added a dovetailed Tritium front night sight for enhanced accuracy in low-light conditions, while the Governors fixed rear sight is aptly suited for this self-defense handgun.

The Governor measures 8 ½ inches in overall length along with a width of 1 ¾ inches. Carry ability of this revolver has been further enhanced with the Governor's unloaded weight of 29.6 ounces and standard matte black finish designed to reduce unwanted glare while adding an all-business like demeanor to this self-defense handgun. On the lower portion of the frame, the revolver will be packaged with either shock absorbing synthetic grips or with factory-installed laser grips from Crimson Trace. Accurate, rugged and reliable, the Governor is further enhanced by Smith & Wesson's renowned smooth double-action and crisp single-action trigger pull. The new revolver will also come standard with 2-round and 6-round moon clips.

""For 159 years, Smith & Wesson has been at the forefront of revolver manufacturing with its advanced techniques and ground-breaking designs"", said James Debney, President of the Firearms Division for Smith & Wesson. With the advent of the new Governor, this pioneering mindset continues as does our unyielding commitment to produce and bring to market self-defense orientated products that match the needs of consumers. Along with our broad range of personal protection firearms, the new Governor will take a leadership role that will give consumers a distinct advantage when defending themselves against unwanted dangers."""

Additional Description: With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

This is a Standard model rifle that was assembled in 2002 according to SA records.

It has a H&R 22"" chrome lined barrel, which according to the stamping was produced in June of 1962. The bore and chamber are pristine, and it's rated for fully automatic fire (it was made for an M14). It has a synthetic stock that has a couple minor chips, but it's virtually impossible to find the milsurp stocks without blemishes. It will come with (4) steel 10 round magazines, (3) steel 20 round magazines, and (1) Thermold 20 round magazine. Also included is the SA 3rd gen scope mount, SA 6x ranging scope, and the M2 bipod. For additional cash I can throw in 250 or so rounds of mixed .308 ammunition. This is a sweet shooting rifle, and I'm hesitant to part with it so the price or trade has to be right, but I am willing to negotiate a bit.
