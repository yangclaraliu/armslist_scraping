RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation.  The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle."

The bore is clean and bright, the rifling looks great in the barrel.
It has all the original parts including the Weaver C4 .22 tip off Scope made in the USA that was sold with the rifle. Tube feed type magazine holds 15+1 rounds of 22LR and even more if you like 22 shorts. I did re-blue the rifle and refinish the stock., a very small amount of surface rust is still on the scope as I did not re-blue the scope.
According to the Remington web site the rifle was made in Feb 1957. Buy it for $210.00 cash if you buy it at full price I will toss in a box of CCI Stingers and a box of Federal HV match 22lr ammo 100 rounds total or make a REASONABLE offer. I might consider a trade also.

Being as this is my only 40 cal @ the moment if I trade outside this caliber I would add roughly 300rds of Winchester ball and roughly 200 rounds of Self Defense ammunition. The ONLY way I would add this ammunition to a trade is if you plan on bringing ammo to the table as well. If you do not have ammo and we're trading outside the caliber of 40 I'd like to keep my ammo. **It will only be used as trade value if you offer something totally bad ass.**

The Marlin Model 70P, also known as the Marlin Papoose, is a .22 Long Rifle semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Marlin Firearms. The rifle is notable for its portability; it is less than 21 inches (530 mm) in length when disassembled and weighs 3.25 pounds. Disassembly requires loosening a barrel retention nut by hand or with a supplied tool. It is designed as a hiker and camper utility rifle, and appeals to the same market as the AR-7. The Model 70P is based on the earlier Marlin Model 70 (currently listed as Model 795) that has a fixed barrel and conventional stock. Its semi-automatic action originated with the Marlin Model 60. The Marlin Model 70PSS variant has a synthetic stock and stainless steel barrel.

The rifle has an open rear sight and ramp front sight with high visibility orange post surrounded by a cutaway hood. The receiver has an integral .22 tip-off scope mounting rail. Swivel studs for a carrying strap are embedded in the synthetic stock. Included Marlin accessories are a 7 round metal magazine, a tool for adjusting the barrel nut, and a padded nylon carrying case designed to float in water. Optional accessories from Marlin include 7 and 10 round metal magazines 10/22

Constructed with a hammer forged slide and an injection molded polymer

double action only autoloader in .45 ACP that weighs a mere 22.6 ounces. It
joins Taurus' family of ultra compact personal defense Millennium
autoloaders. The Model PT145 features a 10 round magazine capacity for 10+1
firepower, but the most central feature of the gun is its rugged recoil
operated action instead of the simple blowback mechanisms found on many
other pocket size pistols.

What I know that is wrong is the cylinder arm doesn't line up properly meaning it could cause bullet shear. One of the hand grips is chipped and one screw on the right side is also chipped. All the moving parts on the gun function though and the barrel is in great shape. The metal is a bit tarnished from age. But it would be a great restoration project.

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

Info from HK 

HK now offers the long awaited civilian variant of the popular HK416 upper. This MR556, match grade upper receiver assembly comes complete and ready to pin onto any standard AR-15 (M4/M16 type) lower receiver. The short stroke gas piston design ensures cooler, cleaner operation of this upper for reliability and less time scrubbing residue out of the receiver after extended shooting sessions. The flat-top upper receiver and free floating quad rail upper allow plenty of room for mounting sighting devices and any other accessories the operator chooses. Upper receiver assembly also ships with a carbine length buffer spring and heavy, tungsten filled buffer.

This is the civilian version of the HK416, the weapon of choice of US Special Forces. And these are hard to find.

Alloy frame, with stainless cylinder and barrel
The upper part of the frame, as the photos show, shield the hammer; but still exposes its cleat-serrated hammer spur enough to produce a cocking motion for precise single action firing. The lightweight stainless variant of the Airweight Bodyguard, the 638, was introduced as a limited run in 1989, then added as a regular part of the Smith & Wesson line in 1996, when Smith & Wesson beefed up the J-frame sufficiently for it to handle High Performance +P ammunition. This third, current variant of the 638 has a .312 MIM Metal-injected-Molded .312 smooth combat trigger and MIM flat-faced hammer with floating firing pin. All S&W Revolvers have an internal transfer bar safety that prevents accidental firing if a loaded weapon is dropped, and in 2002, the 638-3 entered the market with Smith & Wesson's patented internal lock. Barrel length is 1 7/8 inches, and this 5 shot pocket revolver only weighs 14 5/8 ounces empty."

Springfield Armory Competition 40 S&W 5.25"" 16+1 Syn Grip Blk/DT Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. 

Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used."
