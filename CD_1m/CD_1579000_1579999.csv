This gun has not been shot and is in perfect condition. You can send me pics or texts to BrandonREDACTED or email me."

These will work fine for any large case cartridge that use small pistol primers as long as you don't load to max powder factor. I actually think they work better for 45acp than regular small primers  and Winchester only makes mag primers.

If there is no interested I will order the parts and do the work and offer it again for a little more. $1800 obo as is call REDACTED or email for more info or to come see it.

Whether you choose an FMJ bullet for its deep, bone-shattering penetration or its ability to protect the integrity of the pelt, you’ll find the perfect Full Metal Jacket in our traditional line.

Secant Ogive Design

Pioneered by Hornady for use in hunting bullets, this technology broke new ground in ballistic engineering and is now used in bullets for everything from match to varmint shooting.

The secant ogive is a geometrically developed design that creates the most ballistically efficient profile, yet retains the optimum bearing surface. The combination of the slender point and increased bearing surface results in lower drag, increased stability, flatter trajectories and amazing accuracy."

OVERVIEW:
Maybe you flinched? Or the animal turned at the last split-second? Either way, our Model 7600™ centerfire rifle will get you back on target – instantly. Because not only are they built to deliver legendary Remington® first-shot accuracy, they’re also designed for ultra-fast follow-up shots – without ever having to unshoulder your rifle.

Our ever-popular Model 7600 is one of the most proven deerslayers in the woods. It has a 22"" barrel, a four-round magazine and is available in wood and durable synthetic models. All of our centerfire pumps feature quick-release magazines and Remington’s rotary bolt lock-up design for exceptional strength, safety and reliability.

You can't find a big-game rifle with a better combination of practical shooting features: twin action bars provide slick, smooth operation for rapid repeat shots; a quick-release, drop-out four-round magazine that loads and unloads instantly; and a free-floated barrel that matches the accuracy of the best bolt guns.

An ideal cross-over rifle for pump-gun wingshooters. A Monte Carlo walnut stock with a satin finish is standard. An optional high-gloss finished stock available in 270 Win. and 30-06 calibers.

We've taken the world's most popular pump-action deer gun and given it the extra toughness and weather resistance of a fiberglass-reinforced synthetic stock and fore-end.

Metal work and stock have a black matte non-reflective finish, and the butt stock is furnished with a black rubber recoil pad. Like its walnut-stocked brother, the 7600™ Synthetic has twin action bars for smooth cycling; a quick-release, drop-out four-round magazine; and a free-floated barrel that matches the accuracy of the best bolt guns.

KEY FEATURES:

Robust slide-action design allows for fast follow-up shots in the harshest conditions.
Action, slide release and safety based on the design of the Model 870™, America's most popular pump shotgun, for instantaneous end user familiarity.
Weight distribution and slim line design result in shotgun like balance and pointability.

I have no interest in buying from FFL dealers, I appreciate them all, but there is no point in leaving a trail of bread crumbs to my home so when a 'real' AWB eventually succeeds, Dianne Feinstein can come knocking on my door looking for my AR-15s.  I am only buying from other gun enthusiasts like myself, face to face, or shipped to me from within the state of NC, as is perfectly legal.  If you want a bill of sale, that is fine with me, draw one up, email it to me, I'll sign it and send it to you with my payment, but that is all you are getting unless you are local, then you can see my retired military I.D. too, but that is it, no driver's license, no state I.D., that is it.  If there is anything about my WTB ad that bothers you, do not contact me, or go ahead and flag the ad, that is how this site is set up to work.  If you think I'm asking someone to do something illegal, call the ATF (a department of Homeland Security), that is how our country works.  Don't get all butt hurt when they ignore you though, because like I said, I'm not asking anyone to do anything illegal, not even close to it.  That being said, I look forward to purchasing a few lower receivers, so let me know what you have.  I am a straight shooter, no bull, and expect to be treated the same.  Your idea of quality and mine probably differ, so just let me know what you have and the price you are asking, (ignore the price I have posted, I had to put something).  I'm building these for fun, so if you are looking to make your car, house, or rent payment with the profit you think you can make off of your lower receiver, don't bother contacting me.  A high price for a high quality lower is one thing, but otherwise, no, I don't think so, I don't care what the current political climate is.  I prefer stripped new lowers, but used in like new condition would work, even if they are already completed, that just means I'll have more time to build an upper.  Keep in mind, if it is already built, I have no idea what parts you have in it, or how much it has been fired, if used, so don't expect me to be wild about it.  When contacting me, send (good) pictures of what you are offering me, it'll make things go smoother.  Do not ask me what I will give you for it, I'm not bidding on an auction, I'm buying, so name your price and then we'll talk.  I will only pay by USPS money order through the mail, or cash in person.  Again, those are the ONLY forms of payment I use, not gold, not silver, not trading my stuff for your stuff, I like my stuff and I'm keeping it.  If any of my terms are unacceptable to you, again, do not contact me, I'm not interested in playing games with anyone.  Thank you.  (Told you I was a straight shooter)"

I also ran some steel cased and had a few ftf (the bolt wouldn't cycle back far enough on a few rds).

Instead of looking through a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) as with traditional rangefinders, where the LCD film reduces image quality by stripping out light and reducing the resolution, the OLED display is reflected into the light path of the RX optical system leaving a crystal clear image. When in early morning or late evening low-light conditions, the 3x greater light transmission over competitive LCD rangefinders will give you that extra advantage.

1- sig p250 2 sum chambered in .40 cal. One full size one, one sub compact body with one interchangeable firing assembly. Theses guns can be chambered in .357, .45, .40 and .9mm by purchasing an exchange kit online. Very nice set of guns. I purchased new for $815 and they have under 100 rounds through them.

2- autauga mkii .32 acp. Beautiful little in fired only 3 times. Very hard to come by, only 3200 ever made, and none for sale on armslist nationwide. Would make an excellent concealed carry for your daughter, girlfriend or wife, or a great backup piece for anyone. I paid $435 for this one and I have the original box and paperwork as well.

3- 22lr starter revolver. Shoots good, fires blank 22 rounds like they use at the start of a horse race. Makes a great learner gun to teach you kid how to shoot without anyone getting hurt. I paid $75, and ammo is available online for next to nothing for these guns.

4- Jennings 22lr. Decent shooting little pistol, cheap but fun to shoot. Not in pristine condition but doesn't look bad. Shoots great. I paid $175 for that one several years back

I have plenty of ammo available for several of them at extra cost or will throw ammo in on a good trade."

Very rare hard to find fair to good condition (1941) RUSSIAN SVT-40 RIFLE - powerful 7.62x54r caliber semi-automatic rifle. 10 round aftermarket detachable magazine. The Samozaryadnaya Vintovka Tokareva (SVT-40) was designed by Soviet Arms Designer Fedor Tokarev. It was manufactured between 1941 and 1945. The SVT-40 is an improved and simplified rifle design over the SVT-38. During WWII SVT-40 rifles were highly prized captures by both German and Finnish troops. Many pictures in books of German troops on the eastern front carrying the SVT-40. The biggest issue with the SVT 40 is the ejection of the spent casing due to improper gas cartridge adjustment and improper powder loads. DO NOT use any loads over 150 grain as this will destroy the gas chamber. Overall condition is rated as fair to good for an old surplus military rifle that will never be imported again into the USA. 10rd magazine is an aftermarket, so not all original, all other numbers match THAT I CAN TELL. Wood stock has 3 to 4 cracks/splits at rear top of receiver and another at bottom of mag well but could be fixed by somebody that knows what they are doing or you could buy a newer style stock. Gun has some surface rust spots. I would grade gun and bore as fair to good condition with dark bore. Still has blueing on many metal parts and when item was on consignment, gunsmith graded it higher but I do not want to deal with perfectionist (its a used surplus military gun from WW2). Additional pictures could be emailed to serious buyers only !! Great for shooting , collecting or the one that got away! Serious Inquiries Only Please!!! These will never be imported again so no B.S., I will just keep placing back into the safe where the value is only going up still. If buying local in SC state, I will need a copy of your Valid South Carolina issued state photo I.D. and bill of sale signed with disclaimer as proof of sale for my records.

Sealed Case of YUGO 7.62x39 M67 Brass cased ammo (1260 rounds) 7.62x39 Yugoslavian Military M67 7.62x39 124gr. FMJ This ammo was manufactured by Prvi Partizan for a Yugoslavian military arsenal. For AK-47, SKS, VZ58, and other AK type rifles. This ammo has a 124gr. NON-MAGNETIC FMJ bullet. That means a magnet will not stick to the bullet, so this ammo should be safe to shoot at any gun range. It is also brass cased, berdan primed and mildly corrosive. This is excellent military grade 7.62x39 ammo, and some say the best ever produced, and brass cased so it is easy on your chamber, bolt face and extractor.

Manufactured by Prvi Partizan, this is some of the finest, most accurate, 7.62X39 ammo ever produced, berdan primed, 124gr. lead core non metalic bullet. Comes packaged 15 rounds per box (84 boxes total)with 1260 rounds in a zinc lined hermetically sealed wooded crate.
