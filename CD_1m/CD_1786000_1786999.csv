Please note these are not standard 243 Winchester these are shorter bottle necked version.
The .243 Win excels with a wide variety of powders, and excellent factory-loaded hunting ammunition is available. Off-the-shelf .243 rifles from Howa, Remington, Savage, and Tikka perform admirably with little or no modification. The ""improved"" version of the cartridge, the .243 Ackley, can do everything its parent can do, with more velocity, and greater brass stability thanks to its 40° shoulder. Among the Ackley variants, the .243 AI is rightly one of the most popular. It is easy to fire-form, and commercial dies are readily available. Barrel life is the downside of both the .243 AI and standard .243. These chamberings pump a lot of powder through a small bore. The result, typically, is rather short barrel life, sometimes less than 1500 rounds. A few folks have been experimenting with the use of very slow, cooler-burning powders. There is some evidence that the use of super-slow powders, combined with modified cleaning regimens, can result in significantly enhanced barrel life. These are loaded and ready to shoot factory Winchester loads. Midway sell 200 empty brass to reloaders for over $500. I will gladly ship FedEx ground if buyer pays shipping."

MAG Tactical Systems has released their new GEN 4 Ultralight Lower Receiver for the AR-15 which is 35% lighter than your standard AR-15 lower but is still an all metal design.  That’s including the integrated winter trigger guard too.  Just to clarify, this is not a Plastic, Polymer or Carbon Fiber lower but a special Aluminum Alloy lower receiver. 

MAG Tactical Systems owns the patent on the coating process for this material which gives it the excellent corrosion characteristics.

What makes the MAG Tactical Systems GEN 4 Receiver different?

The GEN 4 receiver has the integrated trigger guard that will be able to be used with cold weather gear.

The GEN 4 receiver has reinforced trigger & hammer axle pin placement points.

The GEN 4 front pivot pins are reinforced to eliminate any fracturing during torque when receiver is in the break down position.

Ive got a Safariland Zero G Concealable body armor vest that is rated for level II protection (will stop almost all handgun calibers except .44 mag or similar). The neat thing about this vest is that you can wear it under regular clothes and it does not protrude like lesser quality body armors or the heavier Level III and up armor. This is the same vest that is issued to LE everywhere for patrol use. The armor was manufactured in mid 07', but this vest has been sealed in the wrapper, stored in a dry closet, and was NEVER used so it is like new and has had zero deterioration from use or exposure to sunlight. These vests retail for $600 new, and im asking $200 for the vest. The size of the vest is regular which is a chest size 40. This is perfect for LE, security, or citizens who feel the need for better protection from carjackers or gangsta wannabes as what we have seen going on for a while now in the springfield area, more so recently.  You can contact me via email or call/text at 417-413-85zero7. Thanks and hope to hear from you soon!!

P.S. I provided you a link as to see how effective level II body armor is, rest assured if you get shot with a raven .25 or  hi point 9 millameata you are going to go home without a bleeder lol.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Might trade for full size frame handgun, 9mm only. Must be good quality.
Specifications:
The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.
The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.
Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

 I am specifically looking for a 4"" Model 64 Smith & Wesson HEAVY BARREL or a 4"" Model 67. It must be PRE-LOCK and in perfect timing, but otherwise unmolested. I might consider a 4"" Model 10 Heavy Barrel or 4"" Model 15 if cash is added on your end. My revolver has had literally $500+ in custom work done to it. I am not asking to recoup that obviously, but I want a clean revolver in trade. It is going to be the starting platform for a new IDPA revolver. I don't care about boxes, or paperwork, or any of that stuff, or what some ethereal ""collector"" value there might be. Thanks in advance!

 I am NOT interested in ANY other trades or cash offers unless it is a ridiculous offer. Trade to be made in the east valley, we both bring AZDL and/or CCW.

The pistol grip makes even 00 Buck or Slug loads controllable. The adjustable sights are great for slugs, you can put three rounds into a 3"" circle at 25 yards.

With a chrome lined bolt and bore it is in excellent shape mechanically , has some scratches on it but has been maintained in extremely good working order, reliable, will always be there for you.

Slide Fire Solutions' provide individuals the ability to fire their AR-15 at an incredible rate.  

New  $359.00 + $18.00 for sling adapter

“Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.”

Included is a Spade sling plate. Many aftermarket single point sling adaptors do not have dimensions compatible with the SSAR-15, the SPADE sling attachment is designed specifically for use with the Slide Fire Stock.

The scope is a Burris Fullfield. Good glass! 

This is an awesome combination. While the stock is synthetic, it is heaver than others in say a Remington or Weatherby rifle. I own both and would say the rifle feels a bit heavier which you would want when firing a flat shooting magnum round like the .300 WSM.

Slide Fire Solutions' provide individuals the ability to fire their AR-15 at an incredible rate.

New  $359.00 + $18.00 for sling adapter

“Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.”

Included is a Spade sling plate. Many aftermarket single point sling adaptors do not have dimensions compatible with the SSAR-15, the SPADE sling attachment is designed specifically for use with the Slide Fire Stock."

From The Manufacturer: X-15 The most compact and versatile 50 round magazine ever produced for the AR-15 in 5.56x45/.223 and 300 AAC Blackout full length. Built entirely of 6061 billet aluminum, there are zero plastic parts. The fully enclosed magazine will operate in the most demanding of operations. The compact design is based on our proven coil magazine technology, which allows side by side staging of ammo in a single stack. The streamlined design allows for no separation of ammunition during function and prevents malfunction. Based on our patent pending design that allows for unlimited spring loads for high rate of fire weapons, it will easily operate up to 1100 rounds per minute. The profile is shorter than a standard 30 round magazine and 4-5 inches shorter than a surefire quad stack magazine. User friendly ergonomics and the ability to use your sling makes this the choice magazine for 3 gun competitors. Coated in Cerakote for friction reduction and proven reliability without using lubrication, and given a liftime warranty. Manufactured in the USA, fit’s most M16/AR-15 rifles, Bushmaster ACR, SCAR 16 and Stanang Rifles with improved M4 feed ramps. THIS IS A BLACK X-15. Brand new in the original box.

[b]Sacramento Area[/b]

Hi there I decided to clean out a few of my "" safe queens"" to make room for some new stuff so my lovely little Star is going to go. 
This is the Star Firestar Plus with the alloy frame containing a double-column, 13-shot capacity.  Hammer fired single action compact 9mm reminiscent of a much smaller 1911.The finish is Starvel and has a 3.5 inch barrel.

Comes with 4 mags, one 10 rounder in Nickel finish and three 10+  MecGar mags. The MecGar's are virtually new. 
I bought it several years ago thinking it would be my backup CCW gun but never saw much use and never did carry it. For it's size a very accurate gun. 

I put about 200 rounds through it and the guy before me said his Dad never shot it much so it hasn’t seem much use and you can tell by how tight she still feels.

If your not familiar with these great little European firearms here is a website all about the company and the models of Stars.
[url]http://www.star-firearms.com/firearms/guns/firestar/[/url]

[b]Asking $400 or best offer.[/b] 

Also comes with original box and manual. I'll even toss in a lock so you don't have to pick one up at the gun store. 

[b]Not going to ship will do PPT only in Sacramento or nearby.[/b]

If you would like to shoot it first I can meet you at the ""Gun Range"" in North Highlands and you can try it out and we can do the PPT there."

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the
refinement today s shooters demand. The Sig Sauer 1911 proves that close
tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an
off-the-shelf pistol. Sig Saer has introduced clean, distinct lines that
American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull,
classic ergonomics,and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical
Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral
accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

For those who are unfamiliar with the Yugo AK's, they have a 1.5mm thick receiver and a heavy barrel for sustained fire as well as a reinforced area on the receiver like an RPK. This was for grenades. Its still has the grenade sight above the gas tube which, when flipped up, also cuts off the gas system for maximum energy thrust (grenades were kinda heavy). Anyways, she fires true and accurately. Completely reliable with whatever you feed her. Bolt, bolt carrier, and piston are all polished stainless and the action feels buttery smooth. 

I'm looking to trade for another Ak which I can mount a sight to. Preferably a side mount, NOT a handguard/dust cover mount. I never trust those area's to hold a good zero. ALSO, I would prefer a fixed stock or triangle folder as underfolders arent so comfy with scopes.  I may consider an AK74 as well. 

Comes with two 30rnd mags if trading for an ak74. Otherwise, you keep your mags and I'll do the same. (For AK74's I also have a green can with 400rnds of 7.62x39 steel cased, and a ton of brass cased Federal ammo if you also have 5.45x39)"

This is brand new and unused. This is the 13"" model that is tinted blue. It's a subtle blue that isn't screaming blue at you. The last picture shows one of the short picitinny rail sections on the forward end of the rail. The rail sections are black and you can see the subtle contrast to the blue tinted rail.



Manufacture's Description


The Geissele Super Modular Rail MK1 (SMR) was developed as a side project to a rail R&D project Geissele was working on for one of our larger customers. The SMR MK1 does a good job in meeting the ten design specifications for a good weapon rail, as outlined below.

1. ERGONOMIC
Instead of four sharp and jagged M1913 rails spaced at 90 degree intervals, the MK1 only has a M1913 rail at the 12 o’clock position while at 9, 3 and 6 o’clock is a rounded mounting surface for accessory rails. The rounded mounting surfaces feel good to the hand and provides for a comfortable grip.

2. SET-UP IS MODULAR AND FLEXIBLE
Accessory rails in the standard M1913 (Picatinny) configuration are provided with each SMR MK1 so accessories can be mounted where the shooter desires. Two short and one long accessory rail are provided with each SMR kit. There is also a QD mount at the receiver end that accepts an industry standard QD swivel. An accessory 45 deg QD mount can be purchased so a sling can be secured at an upper 45 deg position if so desired.

3. FREE FLOATING
The weapon barrel is completely free floating when an SMR is mounted. No force is put into the barrel from slings or bipods that could effect point of aim.

4. STRONG
The SMR MK1 is machined from a semi-billet extrusion made from aircraft grade aluminum. A semi billet extrusion is designed with extensive machining stock for 3D features that are machined directly into the rail so that the rail is one integral piece.

5. RIGID
Current infantry doctrine makes extensive use of accessories that require attachment to a weapon rail. Flashlights, visible and infrared lasers, night vision and thermal sights all require a rigid weapon rail so that zero is not changed when a bipod or sling is used to support the weapon from the rail. The SMR MK1 is a rigid interface for weapon accessories due to its precisely machined proprietary barrel nut and secure rail interface and clamping arrangement.

6. LIGHTWEIGHT
Use of aircraft grade aluminum and high strength steels in the SMR MK1 give the entire assembly a good strength and performance to weight ratio. Balance is as important as weight and the center of gravity of the rail is biased toward the receiver for good weapon handling characteristics.

7. ACCESSORY RAILS EASY TO INSTALL
Accessory rails are fastened directly to steel inserts that are imbedded into the rail aluminum. It takes literally seconds to install or remove an accessory rail without standing on your head to deal with non-captured plate nuts.

8. ACCESSORY RAILS ARE STRONG
The SMR MK1 accessory rails have machined in shear lugs that are a close fit into the cooling slots that are machined into the rail. Any force imparted into the accessory rail is transferred directly into the rail thereby bypassing mounting screws. This means that the mounting screws only need to hold the accessory rail on and not resist side loads that can make the screws loosen over time.

9. RAIL ASSEMBLY IS EASY TO INSTALL
Each SMR MK1 comes with a precisely machined, 2-1/4” long alloy steel barrel nut and a combination wrench that will remove the stock barrel nut and install the Geissele nut. The Geissele barrel nut needs no indexing to the gas tube so installation is a snap with just a torque value used for tightening. The rail is then slid onto the barrel nut and the precise barrel nut to rail fit precisely aligns the rail to the barrel. After indexing to the receiver rail two mounting bolts are tightened and the rail is secure.

10. RAIL IS EASY TO REMOVE
Just by loosening two screws and one of the indexing screws the Geissele SMR can be slid off the barrel nut for cleaning or gas system maintenance. Even a different rail with a different accessory
configuration can be mounted. As quick as it is removed the SMR MK1 can be re-installed with the precise barrel nut to rail fit maintaining sight and accessory zero."

I HAVE A FEW LEFT!!

The Magpul PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN SCAR MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.
