THIS IS NOT JUST ANY AR UPPER!!! All DLP uppers are machined from solid 7075-T6 Aluminum Billet. We have designed a much more solid and rigid AR Upper. We have created a larger ejection port and a more robust M16 bolt carrier group. This AR upper is on STEROIDS!!

The AR15 Side Charge upper will be the most durable, rigid, functional, and accurate you can own without modification. The DLP side charge Ambidextrous uppers can be used by left & right handed shooters. If you want a left handed upper only, just unscrew the left charging handle or the right handle for right handed shooters, or leave them both on to transition from left to right. The Aluminum charging handle is reciprocating allowing for both: charging of weapon and forward assist. The DLP upper is designed to hold much tighter tolerances for match shooting making this upper the most durable and accurate upper on the market."

By John

Superb accuracy in my CZ 75B, under 2"" at 25 yards from a rest, equaling the Hornady HAP and XTP. Best 115 FMJ I've ever tested.

By Emil
from Elizabethtown, KY
Excellent bullet. Better accuracy and reliability than Winchester's flat base 115 grain bullet. I have several 9mm pistols ranging from WW1 P-08 to a SIG P228. The Luger is, by far, the fussiest about ammunition. Despite seemingly identical nose profiles, the hollow base version of this bullet feeds and functions flawlessly, the flat base does not. In my case, if it works in the P-08, it will work in every other 9mm I own.

By Edwin
from Mantua, OH
I found the hollow base bullets to be more accurate then the flat base, at about 20 yards or so. The bullets themselves seemed to be more consistent (in shape and weight) but that may have just been a single batch problem.

By John
from Mount Vernon, IA
I bought these because I wanted a less expensive round for practice and plinking. I had been using Hornady 115 FMJ's and I was expecting these to be of lower quality. I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how well made these are and how accurate and consistent they shoot. I weighed about a dozen of these bullets from the 500 that I bought and all were within 0.2 grains. The heaviest was 115.9 gr, the lightest was 115.7 gr. That consistency also showed through to the chronograph were the first 10 rounds I tried were all within 30fps. The total variation I got after 50 rounds through the chronograph was 32fps with a standard deviation of only 7fps! This is the most consistent round I have ever loaded for 9mm. I will use these for competition as well as plinking, they are great bullets at a good price.

By Devin
from Vancouver, WA
A+ plinking bullets. These bullets are what you will find in WWB. Without buying from Wal-Mart! Excellent bullets used by many Americans. Cheap and good quality. The price of plated lead bullets, but real FMJ. The only minor Bit is that they have a hollow base and let lead in to the air. Load it with clean burning powder and lead safe primers and you won't regret it.

Luminox' self-powered illumination (LLT) allows one to view time at-a-glance, no matter what the light level, even in complete darkness -- up to 25 years of complete darkness, in fact. Being able to read time effortlessly under any and all circumstances fills a need for various military and law enforcement groups, which is why the U.S. Navy SEAL Procurement officers came to us asking us to create dive watches for them for night missions. It is also why U.S. Air Force pilots flying the F-117 Nighthawkâ¢ Stealth Jets approached us. These are only two of many groups of ""heroes"" that truly understand and appreciate the inherent benefit of wearing a Luminox timepiece. As for the rest of the population: When was the last time you had to fumble for a light switch or a button on your watch in the dead of night? Wear a Luminox for a week and you won't want to miss it."

I have ran a total of 10-15 rounds though it.  Reason I am selling is because I just recently came across an awesome deal on a Shadow Ops Weaponry .308 lower so I am going to build that and turn it into my new long range rifle.....looking for trades on AR10 components if you have any.  

This rifle has a Mueller 8-32x44 scope, front 6-9 Harris bi-pods and a custom FDE paint job.

The scope is awesome.  I can see bullet placement out to 100-125 yds no problem, this scope is one the best you can get for the price.  It competes with $700+ optics all day.  The rifle is a sub-MOA for sure and will come zeroed @ 100yds which was what the 15 rounds were used for. 

The rifle comes with the factory 4 round rotary clip, a total length of 42.5"", a 22"" barrel with a 1:10 twist, and weight only $6.25lbs.  This rifle will be a legend just like the ruger 10/22, just give it time being that it is so new.  I have even spoke to a few MFGs at gun shows who are currently in the R&D stages of designing a new tactical stocks with better integrated check rests.

Before you tell me you can go buy it brand new or even cheaper at DSarms just know I have been on DSarms wait list since January this year.  I bought a completed upper.  So yes not having to wait 7 months will cost you, thats the way the world works.  

Everything has seen 50rds max.  Reason I am selling is because I am looking to convert over to a 14.5"" barrel and shooting for maximum weight loss....I will have to weight to find a 14.5"" barrel by giving up my current setup. 

So I am open to trades if you have a 14.5""barrel

This is how it looks on my current setup in the photo

$400 for everything

Also here is some information for people thinking this storm is going to blow over.  Obama is attacking the 2nd Amendment economically.  In the US there are a few huge ammo manufactures and through out the past these manufactures have had contracts with the DoD and federal govt.  The contracts were for all the spent brass casing, so they could reload them and sell them for cheap back to the public.  What we were use too.  Now Obama is destroying all spent brass and selling it to china or other countries.  No longer do our American based companies have access to all the brass they originally sold to the Govt.  Prices are going to go through the roof, shelves are going to remain empty, companies are being forced to lay off workers.  

This is a full on attack on the 2nd amendment and Obama is going to do it economically.  You think it is just some political blow back, but it is much more than that, that crook will stop at nothing.  Dont believe me?  That's fine but do you own research.  The DHS and DoD have bought bought close to 1 billion rounds, with contracts still to come.  They have all the ammo and now the current admin is going to crumble access for civilians to acquire ammo.  Mark my words folks, this is real and happening.   

Gun MFGs will close down because they wont be able to afford staying open.  No one will be shooting if ammo is to expensive or impossible to find, gun sales will come to a crawl, current gun business will go out of business and thats that.  Disarming a population is always first order throughout history, that is fact.  This way they dont even need legislation.  This is criminal.  Good luck to you and god bless."

It's in good shape with a low round count at 300 rounds. It comes with night sights, an extended barrel, a Leather oem Beretta holster, and a total of 4 oem magazines, 3-17 rounders and 1-20 rounder. The 20 rounder and one of the 17 rounders were never used, never loaded, never fired. Just taken out of packaging.  Besides that I have all the equipment that comes with the gun new. back straps, gun lock, and box. 

I'm willing to sell the just the gun if that is all someone would be interested in. The extended barrel has exactly 50 rounds through it. To me that's barely a test drive for these beretta chrome lined barrels. This gun was never carried and the holster was never used. I mainly kept it by my bedside because it proved to me to be reliable with the recommended 300 rounds to break in. 

For just the gun with the Night Sights, I'm pretty firm on $480.

I just want to do a little itemizing for those with there offers.

That's $423.00 In accessories. Not counting shipping and installation of the sights. 
if you've ever wanted a px4 with all it has to offer besides a lazer light, witch I have but Im keeping because this package would be way to expensive with it, then this will most likely be the cheapest you will find it. Make an offer but be realistic. $550, $570, $590, will not buy everything. I see the gun itself selling for that in gun shops. You can call or text your offer to  REDACTED.

WIN A 1953.9 TYPE 53 CARBINE and BRING YOUR PERSONAL RIFLE & OUT SHOOT EVERYONE ELSE FOR 50% OF THE ENTRY FEE!

Details of both are below:

SHOOT #3
Saturday July 6th join us for the 3rd Linn Creek Military Surplus Shoot Off. Starts at 12 noon sharp!

You will have a chance to win a first year 1953.9 (Made September of 1953) Type 53 Mosin Nagant Carbine (7.62x54r) donated by Anna W the winner of out first 2 events. No worries folks, she's removed herself from this shoot off 'so everyone else has a chance'...lol.

The shoot off general rules/info:

EAR PROTECTION IS MANDATORY! NO EXCEPTIONS!

The cost is $20 for each ticket entry or 3 for $50. Enter as many times as you like or can afford...lol. You may pay cash at the time of the shoot off or pre-pay via Pay Pal. Email me through this site with your desired number of entries and I will invoice you through pay pal. Credit cards accepted. If you pre-pay, please print off your payment page/receipt and bring it with you to the shoot. This is what will get your tickets in hand.

""What do we shoot for the event?"" 
Everyone shoots the same rifle.... The prize you are trying to win. In this case an 1953.9 Mosin Nagant carbine. 

""How does it work?""

It's very simple. after everyone has paid & gotten their tickets, shooting order will be a random draw.

You shoot 5 rounds at 50 yards, open sights with ammo that I provide. Military surplus ammo straight from the spam can. In this case 188 gr Bulgarian surplus ammo.

No practice shots with the prize rifle. You go in cold just like everyone else. 

You can sit at the bench (no shooting rests, props or whatever, just the sling & your arms), sitting, prone or open hand as you so choose. This is an informal shoot, so please, no hardcore rule umpires, we want to keep it casual & easy going. In event of a tie there will be a 1 shot 'shoot off'. In the event of any disagreements/disputes, my judgement is final. 

We will spot and show you where your rounds are landing. 

Best points score takes the rifle home. It's that simple. Shoot 5 rounds, get the high score & take the rifle home with you. 

Obviously, you must be present to win. 
*******************************************************************
***************BRING YOUR OWN RIFLE & SHOOT TO WIN**************
*******************************************************************

It's pretty simple. 

$5 gets you in. Bring 5 rounds of your own ammo, shoot it out of your gun at 200 yards. High score wins.

Any caliber rifle, scoped or not at your preference. At the bench, off hand, sitting or prone. Your choice, no rests or bi pods. 

As reported to me by a few friends that are attending, there are .22's, .243, 30/30 and POSSIBLY a .50 Cal Barrett being entered...lol. (IDK if blowing up the target will win, but it'll sure be fun to watch...lol.)

Do you have a nail driver? Bring it, show off your chops & take a few bucks home along with the bragging rights!

Highest score with 5 rounds will win you 1/2 (50%) of the entry fees to the 'bring your own' shoot. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feel free to bring a few weapons/accessories to trade and or show off. After the shoot off it will be open range time for anyone wanting to shoot. There is a 300 yd range, pistol and shotgun pits as well. 

The range is in Linn Creek on A Rd. Located between Camdenton and Osage Beach. After you are on A rd. you will travel about 4 1/2 miles to Garrison. It will be a right turn, the only way you can go. Follow the gravel rd to the bottom of the hill & just across the low water bridge you will see Centerpoint gun club on the right. That is where we will be meeting for the shoot.

The winner from our first and 2nd shoot Anna. (a delightful 20 yr old young lady) out shot 9 and 15 guys respectively & took home a very nice 1943 Mosin Nagant with all matching numbers and accessories from the first and a sweet 1956 Type 53 in an ATI stock the second time around.

This is a primitive site. You will need to bring lawn chairs/something to sit on. Water isn't a bad idea. I'll have some there for everyone, but extra never hurts. A canopy/umbrella if you want shade. I'll have an awning & an umbrella, but we can always use more. 

This is a family event & is a LOT of fun with like minded folk. Come on down, meet new friends and enjoy a beautiful summer day in the Ozarks. 

PS: there is a creek near by (100yds or less) if you want to really cool off."

WIN A 1953.9 TYPE 53 CARBINE and BRING YOUR PERSONAL RIFLE & OUT SHOOT EVERYONE ELSE FOR 50% OF THE ENTRY FEE!

Details of both are below:

SHOOT #3
Saturday July 6th join us for the 3rd Linn Creek Military Surplus Shoot Off. Starts at 12 noon sharp!

You will have a chance to win a first year 1953.9 (Made September of 1953) Type 53 Mosin Nagant Carbine (7.62x54r) donated by Anna W the winner of out first 2 events. No worries folks, she's removed herself from this shoot off 'so everyone else has a chance'...lol.

The shoot off general rules/info:

EAR PROTECTION IS MANDATORY! NO EXCEPTIONS!

The cost is $20 for each ticket entry or 3 for $50. Enter as many times as you like or can afford...lol. You may pay cash at the time of the shoot off or pre-pay via Pay Pal. Email me through this site with your desired number of entries and I will invoice you through pay pal. Credit cards accepted. If you pre-pay, please print off your payment page/receipt and bring it with you to the shoot. This is what will get your tickets in hand.

""What do we shoot for the event?"" 
Everyone shoots the same rifle.... The prize you are trying to win. In this case an 1953.9 Mosin Nagant carbine. 

""How does it work?""

It's very simple. after everyone has paid & gotten their tickets, shooting order will be a random draw.

You shoot 5 rounds at 50 yards, open sights with ammo that I provide. Military surplus ammo straight from the spam can. In this case 188 gr Bulgarian surplus ammo.

No practice shots with the prize rifle. You go in cold just like everyone else. 

You can sit at the bench (no shooting rests, props or whatever, just the sling & your arms), sitting, prone or open hand as you so choose. This is an informal shoot, so please, no hardcore rule umpires, we want to keep it casual & easy going. In event of a tie there will be a 1 shot 'shoot off'. In the event of any disagreements/disputes, my judgement is final. 

We will spot and show you where your rounds are landing. 

Best points score takes the rifle home. It's that simple. Shoot 5 rounds, get the high score & take the rifle home with you. 

Obviously, you must be present to win. 
*******************************************************************
***************BRING YOUR OWN RIFLE & SHOOT TO WIN**************
*******************************************************************

It's pretty simple. 

$5 gets you in. Bring 5 rounds of your own ammo, shoot it out of your gun at 200 yards. High score wins.

Any caliber rifle, scoped or not at your preference. At the bench, off hand, sitting or prone. Your choice, no rests or bi pods. 

As reported to me by a few friends that are attending, there are .22's, .243, 30/30 and POSSIBLY a .50 Cal Barrett being entered...lol. (IDK if blowing up the target will win, but it'll sure be fun to watch...lol.)

Do you have a nail driver? Bring it, show off your chops & take a few bucks home along with the bragging rights!

Highest score with 5 rounds will win you 1/2 (50%) of the entry fees to the 'bring your own' shoot. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feel free to bring a few weapons/accessories to trade and or show off. After the shoot off it will be open range time for anyone wanting to shoot. There is a 300 yd range, pistol and shotgun pits as well. 

The range is in Linn Creek on A Rd. Located between Camdenton and Osage Beach. After you are on A rd. you will travel about 4 1/2 miles to Garrison. It will be a right turn, the only way you can go. Follow the gravel rd to the bottom of the hill & just across the low water bridge you will see Centerpoint gun club on the right. That is where we will be meeting for the shoot.

This is a very nice unfired .308/7.62 Nato AR-10 style rifle meant to replace the Remington M24 sniper rifle. The sniper choice of summited rifles Was the Remington XM110 because of it's reliability. The Knights rifle was a bit more accurate but reliability issued ensued because of such tight tolerances. In the end they selected the Knights Armament rifle. This is not only a collector piece but a shooter as well and it will only go up in value as the years go by. Truly an investment. Mounted on this rifle is a Leupold Military Mark 4 34mm tube 6.5-20x50 in Mark 8 34mm mount. This is what was used in the trials and is an awesome sniper rifle and optic setup.

NEW DYNAMIC PISTOL DIES
Dillon's New Dynamic Pistol dies allow you to easily clean the seating and crimp dies, and even change the bullet seating stem from round nose to semi-wad cutter in seconds - all without removing the die body from your reloading press. 

Sizing/Depriming Die 
Our sizing/depriming dies feature a unique ""floating decap assembly"" with a snap spring that throws the spent primer off the pin and eliminates the problem of primer ""draw back"" that often occurs when decapping military brass. The primary feature of Dillon's size die design the long, tapered carbide ring with a radiused opening remains unchanged. 
That radiused opening, and its importance to progressive reloading, is one of the reasons why our seat and crimp dies are better. We found a way of manufacturing these dies that have enabled us to make the lead-in radius even bigger! The bigger radius makes progressive loading even smoother .

Bullet Seating Die 
Our new quick-disassembly seat die allows the user to disassemble and clean the seat die without losing adjustment. In this manner, bullet lube and shavings can be quickly removed from the die, thereby guaranteeing a constant seating depth. We've incorporated a ""flip-flop"" seating stem and a clip that enables you to remove the die insert and change the seating stem from round nose to semi-wadcutter without unscrewing a seating stem out of the die body. We've always included both types of seating stems, but the new double-ended design makes it a simple matter to remove a pin, reverse the seating stem, make any minor seating depth adjustments that may be necessary and go on loading in a fraction of the time it used to take. 

Crimp Die 
We've made it easy for you to remove the die insert for cleaning without having to change the critical crimp adjustment. Once your crimp die is set for the proper amount of crimp, you'll never have to change it. This is especially good news for all of you who load lead bullets! Before, you had to unscrew the die from the toolhead and disassemble the die in order to remove any bullet lube or lead residue. Then, you had to start from square one to re-adjust the crimp. Those days are over. All you have to do now is pop a clip and the die insert drops into your hand for cleaning."

Can buy with cash today.

Folks, I've talked to two attorneys that specialize in firearms laws and they tell me that after July 1 any high capacity mag cannot be transferred to anybody, anywhere, any way - if you live in Colorado.  That means that (at least for now) if you own a FNH 5.7 Pistol on July 1 it's yours for life unless you sell it through an FFL without any mags.  That's going to be a tough sale and very limited number of buyers.  I know it's frustrating.  The same laws concern me as a potential buyer.  The guns are not cheap.  Ammo is hard to find.  Nothing about this makes it logical to buy one.  But I might.

If you own a Factory New FNH 5.7 Pistol and would rather have some cash, email me a picture and your offer.  I'm not interested in paying more than $1000.  I know that months ago they were selling for a lot more - but not now.  And it's probably going to get worse.  

Please don't email me with your frustration.  I understand.  This is a ""nice to have"" for me and I thought someone out there might rather have a little cash than a gun that they can't sell in a few days.  

God Bless and Be Safe."

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nanoâs extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nanoâs magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nanoâs sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
