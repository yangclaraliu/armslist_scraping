A very elegant pistol, legendary Walther quality, plenty of firepower and under an inch thick. Compared to normal double stack or even sub-compact pistols, this thing conceals like no other. When it's inside the waistband you could forget that you even have it on you.

This listing includes over $350 in extras (4 extra mags = $200+, 3 holsters = $150+)

This is for a Walther PPS with many extras. From the factory, this pistol comes with two magazines, I'm throwing in four (4) extras for a total of six (6) mags. Two 8 rounders, three 7 rounders, one 6 rounder (flush). I personally like and typically carried with the 7 round magazine. The 8 rounders and 6 rounder have each been loaded maybe once at the range. Note that these magazines are hard to find and when you can find them in stock they are usually over $50. So that is $200 in those extra 4 magazines.

I am the original owner of this PPS and have owned it for about 3 years. It has been one of my primary pistols for CCW, but I only have about 400 - 500 rounds through it. It eats all of the ammo I've thrown at it, from 115 grain range ammo to 147 grain Federal HST, and I've never had a failure of any sort, even in the break in period - a super reliable, accurate, low recoil little shooter.

I'm also including three (3) holsters. They are all IWB holsters and custom formed to this gun - a leather, combo leather/kydex, and a kydex holster with (removable) mag holster attached. The cost of these three holsters was about $165 total.

Comes with the pistol, 6 mags, 3 holsters, original Walther PPS case, and manual.

Compare to Springfield XDs, Smith & Wesson M&P Shield, Kahr PM9 or other super slim single stack pistols.

Must be CO resident and legally able to purchase and own a pistol in the state of Colorado. Must show ID (CCW preferred) and willing to sign a bill of sale."

The second rifle I am looking to trade or sell is a Marlin Model 60 with a Tasco scope. The connected tubular magazine can hold 14 rounds of .22lr.  With the speed loader you can reload another 14 rounds in 10 seconds. The speed loader has 8 sections each holding 14 rounds plus the original 15 (14+1) the gun holds would give you 127 rounds of plinking without making your fingers sore reloading an external magazine.
This gun is in great shape.  The wood is in magnificent condition.

The frame and slide are forged steel, and are parkerized. The 3"" bull barrel is fully supported and ramped, and is also parkerized. Parkerizing gives the pistol a finish that's much tougher than anodizing.
The reddish-brown hardwood grips are stamped ""U.S."", and contrast attractively with the black parkerized pistol. 
The sights on the pistol are original G.I. style, with a low profile notched rear sight and low rounded front sight blade.
The grip safety is flat, just like the old G.I. 1911's, as is the trigger. Trigger pull on the Micro Compact G.I. is five to six pounds, which is a good pull weight for a carry pistol.
The Micro Compact G.I. 1911 is a pistol with a lot of character, and one that can fit in the palm of your hand. It comes with a lifetime warranty that's good even if you're not the original purchaser.

Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220® Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights."

I would consider a trade for a Taurus Judge or S&W Governor (anything in .45/.410)

Feel free to contact me with any questions and please include your contact info if interested.

396,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1746396,For Sale:  Custom/aftermarket JRC (Just Right Carbine) .45 ACP,"Akron, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 900,"Listed On: Friday, June 28, 2013",Rifles,American Tactical Imports                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Just Right Carbine .45 ACP.  If you go to youtube and find the extremely thorough review of the JRC rifle by a Mr. Jared Price this rifle comes from the factory with quite a few engineering oversights.  I have done all the modifications that Mr. price recommends for this weapon except for adding a long sear and a full length bolt guide rail which were out of my abilities and capabilities at this time.  All gun smithing modifications were precision machined by hand on a bench top lathe and mill. 

Custom Mods:

Getting rid of the screws that JRC uses/used to attach the lower receiver to the upper receiver and replacing them with precision machined extended take down pins, springs, detents - the whole 9 yards.  Just this mod makes tear down for cleaning and maintenance 10X easier and more user friendly than the stock set up.  This modification required machining of the lower pistol grip, exposing the raw aluminum.  Nobody would want to buy a gun with exposed areas of aluminum so I chemically stripped the very cheap/poor factory black anodizing off of the lower pistol grip, lower mag well, upper receiver, buffer tube,  and free float quad rail hand guard (I did all the parts to maintain uniformity) and had them all professionally re-surfaced with type 3 hard coat anodize, leaving these aluminum parts with an incredibly hard, essentially scratch proof protective surface with a dark graphite grey matte finish.  From the pics you can see the finished product looks awesome, with the tan butt stock, grey body, and black accessories.  

3/32 removed from the cartridge ejection pin for increased live round ejection clearance in the event if a misfire, which stock from the factory this weapon tends to do because of its short firing pin.  The weapon can now cycle live ammo as it should with no problems.  

Speaking of short firing pin, I turned a brand new adjustable length firing pin out of heat treated steel on my lathe.  It is currently set to 3/16"" longer-than-stock.  Longer firing pin allows for consistent full primer strikes during rapid fire or any firing rate for that matter.  From the factory this thing had a problem with rapid fire misfires because of light primer strikes/no primer strikes due to a short firing pin, which in turn caused the weapon to need to eject live rounds which before the mods was a problem due to the already mentioned issue with the cartridge ejection pin.  I also bought a factory replacement firing pin from directly from JRC which will obviously be include with the gun.

I drilled and tapped the buffer tube and buffer tube adapter for 1/4-20 socket cap set screws (seen in one of the pictures).  This solved one of the biggest hassles with the gun, which was dis-assembly for cleaning and maintenance.  This setup allows for quick and easy removal/re-securing of the buffer tube which is required whenever you want to remove the bolt.  This setup means that a spanner wrench is no longer mandatory to screw/unscrew the factory castle nut that originally secured the buffer tube to the upper.  All you need now is a small 1/8 hex wrench to work the set screw and the castle nut can simply be hand tightened.  The hex wrench fits easily in the butt stock storage compartment so that it is with you whenever you need it.

With the addition of the pins mod and buffer tube set screw mod this weapon can be taken down in less than twenty seconds, which is exponentially faster and simpler than the way you had to tear down the stock weapon.

I know all this stuff will pry scare people off but: One, I want potential buyers to know exactly what they are getting.  I'm not trying to scam anybody, because the salesman/store I bought this thing from failed to mention any of the very obvious flaws with the stock gun.  Granted I pry should have done some research but, I mean come on.  Two, I've got this gun rockin' and rollin' now.  It looks sweet, and it fires phenomenally.  Weapon is quite accurate, at least for me, but that is a subjective statement, as it really depends on the shooter.  It has extremely, EXTREMELY low recoil (a baby could shoot it).  Three, even though the factory design and engineering were suspect with regards to a few features, the materials this weapon is made of are top notch.  Anything having to do with the bolt is a very hard/tough steel alloy of some sort...I found that out the hard way when trying to machine the firing pin.    Excellent factory barrel.  The factory machining is exquisite and the factory finish is flawless.  I could not duplicate it with my home machines, but I feel my machining is very good and blends nicely with the factory finish.

Weapon has had maybe 500 rounds through it.  Bought it for home defense hastily the day after I though I heard someone/thing in the house (turned out to be my imagination) and after I did post purchase research I realized I had my work cut out for me.  It went from being a weapon for defense/protection to a project gun almost over night.  All the mods took about 3 months to complete, they weren't turned out in a rush over night.  
Unfortunately for me I bought this thing on a whim with no regard for the horrible timing it was for me to buy a weapon as I am moving to a small apartment in Florida later this summer to attend medical school...so in about a month I see it collecting dust up in the closet somewhere.  Also throughout the build I became more interested in the machining than in the gun.   I want it to go to a good home and for somebody to benefit from my hasty purchase.  New in box with minimal to no accessories this weapon is sold for roughly $700-$800.  Take advantage of this package.   Have many more pics, just ask.  Price is negotiable (its more of a starting point).  Questions please email Matt at - REDACTED, or call or text Matt at three three zero-7 0 1-six six 9 2.  I will also split shipping."

I am looking to sell my SA Custom Carry 1911.  This is not your typical production Springfield.  This pistol was built by their custom shop, widely considered one of the top shops in the industry.  Top of the line parts are used and the pistol is hand fit.  This pistol is built very well and is very accurate.  There is some finish wear in areas to be expected, the muzzle, ejection port, magwell.  Overall it is in very good shape in my opinion.  The only issue is the front sight has come loose, but still functions fine.  May need to be re-pinned, or simply replaced.   Here are some key features of the pistol:
-Ed Brown grip safety
-Ed Brown thumb safety
-S&A magwell
-25-30 lpi front strap checkering (can't tell)
-Nowlin barrel

I do not have a case or paperwork for the pistol, but it does come with one mag. I am asking $1,600, and would prefer face to face at a dealer. Please let me know if you have any questions

New Gun Laws Took Effect July 1! 
Here's what I've learned that the news is not disclosing---

State law limits the amount the FFL Dealer can charge for Background Checks to only $10. It's basically a tax; the store must turn it over to the State.
The store must retain records for 20 years
The store must inspect the weapon; deeming it safe to operate.

I believe Corral Pawn on Main St. in Trinidad is doing the BGCs. Also, I was told Artic Gun, on 6th St, in Pueblo is doing them. Or, paid in full first, I will agree to ship UPS OVER-NITE to your FFL Dealer for Transfer; at your expense.

Please: No Trades ""Except!""---
I may consider trades for gold/silver bullion (no collectibles please)
1 oz Eagles or Maples are preferred.

This is the hard to find Hi-Capacity Bersa 380. Its basic design is that of a Walther PPK, a proven German pistol with strikingly handsome looks. Going beyond the PPK, It features an amazing 15+1 capacity, Satin Nickel Finish,a factory Hogue-like rubber grip instead of the plastic ones on most 7-shot Pistols. It has twice the capacity of most 380's which solves the problem of insuficient capacity, multiple bad guys, etc, or being forced to pack an extra magazine with you."

Patriot Training and Consulting, LLC, provides its clients with much more than just the minimum requirements of concealed carry certification training. We do not waste time teaching subject matter you already know, and we do not accept just anyone willing to pay the fee on the firing line either.

If someone accused us of placing high standards on our clients, we would have to enter a plea of guilt. We require every student to pass a handgun safety and proficiency test before the class starts to ensure the safety of all of our clients.

Because all of our Concealed Carry-Handgun (CCH) instructors are Marine Veterans who possess Criminal Justice expertise, we know first-hand how best to prepare you for two of the worst fights you could be in; a gun fight in the private sector, and the legal fight that will surely follow.

Though we teach the state mandated materials, we spend the majority of time teaching and explaining what you must know about North Carolina concealed carry and use of force law. If what you are looking for is both a challenge of your handgun skills and an educational course that will teach you much more than the N.C. CCH curriculum requires, this is your course.

PLEASE NOTE: It is our opinion that a concealed carry handgun course is NOT the place/time to become proficient with handguns. Anyone seeking to obtain their CCH Permit should already be proficient with handguns. For those who would benefit, we also offer NRA Pistol Courses. If you attend one of our NRA Pistol Courses first, we will discount your tuition fee for the CCH Course.

Providing simplicity of operation and tremendous illuminating power in a small package, it uses a high-efficiency LED—virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break—to generate a brilliant, penetrating, perfectly pre-focused 320-lumen beam. The G2X is activated by our classic tactical tailcap switch—press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on. The tough Nitrolon® polymer body is smoothly sculpted for a comfortable, secure grip and resists scratches, abrasion, and corrosion. A polycarbonate micro-textured reflector delivers a comparatively wider beam with generous peripheral light. We also make an aerospace aluminum-body version of this light, the 6PX Tactical, and a dual-output version with a two-stage click-type tailcap switch, the G2X Pro.

I purchased it toward the end of the imported availability to shoot from my project Romak 3, as several sources were quoting groups approaching MOA with this round. I ended up selling the rifle and have nothing in this caliber, so I am selling what has become a rare round, with little in circulation and never available as a full case. With the Russian 7.62 caliber being an actual .311 bullet and not .308, and the lack of availability of .311 match bullets, this is one of your best option for getting match grade ammunition. I can meet locally at the Sportsman's Center for the exchange or will ship through the local UPS Brown store however you wish, at your expense. The total package weight for the single can is 57 lbs.

Berreta Info: 

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

Other PX4 Accessories 3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. 

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

I want an American-made .22 LR bolt-action rifle in decent used condition.  I want the kind with a detachable magazine (""clip."")  I don't want the kind with the ""pain in the butt"" tube magazine.  If the rifle also handles .22 Long and .22 Short, so much the better.  Old is fine, as long as the bore is clean (not pitted) and the bluing and stock don't look like they were sitting in an outhouse for 50 years.  Brands like Marlin, Savage, Stevens, Sears, etc.  No Chinese or Italian brands, please."
