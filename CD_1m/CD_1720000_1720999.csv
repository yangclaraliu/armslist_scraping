I am in need of some quick cash however, I do not plan on giving this away. The ammo is going for over 50 cents per round on gunbroker.com and, the pistol is worth $250. The 3 spare mags (total of 4) (hard to find) are worth $100. Plus im throwing in a .30 cal ammo can to store the ammo. So much ammo the pistol will not fit. There is 650-750 rounds of ammo on stripper clips. You are free to count it first. This package is worth around $650. I will take a reasonable offer. If no reasonable offer is received tonight, I am going to sell to gun store tomorrow after-noon. For all you little 9mm, .45, or .40 cal fan boys.... The 7.62x25 round is one of the hottest pistol rounds ever made. Will cut threw bullet proof vest. Has the most penetration of any automatic pistol round I know of.

The PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs."

I bought this gun new about a year ago but need money for school now. I LOVE this gun. If you have ever shot an H&K, you know they are worth the money. It is extremely accurate and comfortable to shoot. I changed the base plates of the magazines so it's perfect as a conceal and carry gun. I have never had this gun malfunction. The recoil on this gun is amazing. It snaps back right on target. You won't believe how fast you can shoot this gun and still hit bulls-eyes. Super accurate. This is the standard issue pistol for U.S. Border Patrol and various paramilitary organizations around the world.

See a review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGQWRZ-s5pY

If you shoot with friends, you will be the envy of everyone in the group with this gun. One of the 13-round magazines is labeled ""Restricted law enforcement/government use only,"" but it's perfectly legal to own if you can legally own a gun.

Reduced to $800 for complete set. You won't regret buying this gun.

I bought this gun new about a year ago but need money for school now. I LOVE this gun. If you have ever shot an H&K, you know they are worth the money. It is extremely accurate and comfortable to shoot. I changed the base plates of the magazines so it's perfect as a conceal and carry gun. I have never had this gun malfunction. The recoil on this gun is amazing. It snaps back right on target. You won't believe how fast you can shoot this gun and still hit bulls-eyes. Super accurate. This is the standard issue pistol for U.S. Border Patrol and various paramilitary organizations around the world.

See a review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGQWRZ-s5pY

If you shoot with friends, you will be the envy of everyone in the group with this gun. One of the 13-round magazines is labeled ""Restricted law enforcement/government use only,"" but it's perfectly legal to own if you can legally own a gun.

Reduced to $900 for complete set. You won't regret buying this gun.

1 is phosphate coated / the other is hard chrome. dont have pictures as of now but text me and i will be more than happy to send you photo of them. 

they are both semi-auto ar-15 BCG's, in perfectly good working order...the phosphate has had about 300 rounds through it flawlessly...the chrome bcg has had about 60 rounds through it...flawlessly, of course. 

neither BCG has any markings on them anywhere from what I can tell, however due to some of my research, it looks as if the chrome bcg is LMT by the extractor o-ring around the spring that seemed very unique among the BCG's that Ive seen. 

phosphate BCG i do believe is a Rock River Arms

The SIG Pro is a short recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol. It uses a traditional Browning cam-operated locking system. The barrel locks into the slide via enlarged ejection port. Polymer frame, with detachable grip panels. Grip panels can be easily replaced and are available in several different sizes and shapes. The overall design is slightly different from earlier SIG-Sauer pistols such as P220 or P226, as there is no separate disassembly lever on the frame and the slide stop lever looks quite different. The standard SIG Pro does not have a manual safety but it does incorporate a decocking lever (lowers the hammer without striking the firing pin), trigger-bar disconnect (disconnects the trigger when the slide is out of battery), automatic firing pin lock (does not free the firing pin until the trigger is depressed) and a hammer safety intercept notch (prevents the hammer from striking the rear of the firing pin until the trigger is depressed)."
