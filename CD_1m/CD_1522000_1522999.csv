Used by law enforcement and military teams. Less than 100 rounds through this shotgun. It will shoot 2 3/4 or 3"" shells. Like new condition and comes in original box with manuals and other Benelli swag. Additional M3 Information The Benelli M3 is an updated version of the Benelli M1 shotgun. M3 uses sameinertia recoil semi-automatic system as earlier Benelli M1,but with addition of the another Benelli patented feature, which allows to the shooter to lock the semi-automatic action and switch to the manually operated pump-action mode and back in the matter of seconds. The action type switch is located at the forward end of the forearm, and is formed as an annular knurledring. Rotation of this ring either engages the action rods of the pump system and locks the semi-automatic recoil system, or disengages the action bars, locks the forearm and allows the inertia recoil system to operate the action automatically. This greatly improves the versatility of the shotgun, allowing itto fire low-powered ammunition (mostly of special purpose, such as less-lethal rubber or tear-gas projectiles) in the manually operated pump action mode, and to fire full power combat loads with slugs or buckshot in rapid semi-automatic mode."

For sale is a Saiga chambered in 7.62x39, made by Izhmash in Mother Russia, and converted with a proper pistol grip and includes the correct number of US-made parts for compliance with 922r and to allow the use of foreign standard capacity 30-round magazines.

If you're looking for an AK, don't get a crappy WASR or equivalent for the same price. Look into some other variants in this price range and you might find thin US-made non mil-spec barrels estimated to have a lifespan of only 10k rounds before degradation. Looks like the other option is to spring 1200+ for a more expensive rifle such as an Arsenal, Krebs, RifleDynamics, etc..

I will sell to Wisconsin residents only, for cash, face-to-face. I would be willing to drive maybe an hour or two. If you're in the Eau Claire area, I typically go to the range once or twice a week and would be willing to bring it along some time if you wanted to stop out and take a look at it.

I'll include a standard capacity 30-round mil-spec magazine with it. All rounds fired through it have been non-corrosive Wolf, Golden Tiger, brown/silver bear. I haven't fired this rifle in some time because I did a full conversion on a 5.45x39 and that has became my lead-slinger of choice.

The Saiga includes:
- Tapco SAW pistol grip, G2 trigger, Galil handgaurd
- Mojo Microclick peep sight
- Dinzag Arms bolt-on handguard retainer
- DPH Arms clip-on flash hider (this was temporary, I had planned on threading the barrel but never got around to it)
- Romanian wire-folding stock (these went for $75 to $100 when I bought it, if I remember correctly. If you plan on replacing the stock you could probably sell this for a good price nowadays.)

Thanks for looking."

Sako Black Bear .308 Winchester The Sako 85 Black Bear is a purpose built weapon for bear and wild boar hunters. This model features an adjustable single stage trigger, adjustable shallow “V” Express style rear sight with white bead front sight for fast target acquisition and a barrel band for front swivel. The patented Total Control Magazine Latch (TCL) prevents accidental release of the stainless steel magazine under the heaviest recoil or harshest hunting conditions. If desired the magazine may be top-loaded without being removed from the rifle. The forged one piece bolt with three locking lugs offers fast, smooth cycling with controlled round feed and mechanical case ejection.

The first was the 1st Model Russian (the original order design), and the Russian Ordnance Inspector mandated a number of improvements to the design, resulting in the 2nd Model Russian, with a final revision to the Russian design being known as the 3rd Model Russian. Smith & Wesson nearly went bankrupt as a result of their Russian Contract production, as the Imperial government assigned a number of engineers and gunsmiths to reverse-engineer the Smith & Wesson design, and then began to produce copies of the revolver—both in their own arsenal at Tula and by contracting other manufacturers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to manufacture copies of the revolver …...PLEASE check your state and local gun laws on purchasing this item BEFORE BIDDING.

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, folding front and rear sights for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, folding front and rear sights for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, folding front and rear sights for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.
