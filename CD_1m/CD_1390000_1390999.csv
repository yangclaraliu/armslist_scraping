""More cowbell?"" Yep, we got one. The cowbell is new, as are the new high-hat cymbals (at right). Some of the cymbals have had a real workout, but there are 4 more not in the picture that have cracks. Often used drums are sold without any cymbals, because they are so expensive, but this set has them in spades.

The front of the bass drum is decorated with wild stickers, and the drum comes pre-stuffed with a pillow (something most drummers wind up doing eventually). I also have included a drummer's throne, fitted with a bicycle seat (it's basic, and needs a little tweaking).
Also included is a set of drum sticks designed for quiet playing on one end and loud playing on the other.

The drums are red, made by Starion. The cymbals are Sabian and Zildjian brand.

All trades will be considered. Gun and ammo trade are welcome.

Seriously, if you want to buy .22LR and are willing to pay higher than normal prices for it, I will certainly sell you some.

My original posting expressed my belief that there is really no pressing need for most people to spend that much on a product that normally sells for 4-5 cents a round because eventually the ammo drought will end. If I'm wrong, I'll be out of ammo because I sold it to you, and you'll know you were right to pay that much.

These blocks will help hold the receiver flat and square while you finish the work needed to get your receiver machined into a firearm.  The blocks are machined to mil-spec standards, so every hole is right on the money.  The jig includes the drilled and tapped holes for the optional milling adapter kits (listed above).  

Applications

Using this jig is as easy as 1-2-3; (1) Place the blocks on both sides of the receiver and loosely tighten the two bolts, (2) Put the assembly upside down on the edge of a flat table and use another flat surface to make sure the back of the receiver is coincident with the back surface of the blocks ~this step is for locational purposes~ (these two location surfaces must be to finish specs before use), (3) Then simply tighten the bolts and you are ready to drill the side holes or do any other work that needs to be done on your receiver.

Bolt Catch Hole and Buffer Tube Area

This AR-15 jig will also aid you in drilling the bolt catch hole as well. Simply slide the block with the slots (as seen in the photo) over the receiver and clamp them together with a C-clamp and you are ready to drill the bolt catch hole, nice and straight without worrying about a crooked hole and ruined lower. To get the pistol grip hole finished just slide the pistol grip onto the receiver and mark where the hole should be drilled. Then place a 2 ½"" block under the receiver (as shown) to easily drill the pistol grip hole. This way of drilling the hole is by far the easiest method.

You can also use this AR15 jig to make sure you get that tricky buffer tube area drilled and tapped the first time. These blocks will even help you drill the front detent pin and any other work on top or bottom of the receiver. The jig is so EASY to use, that you can finish out your receiver using little more than a cordless drill with the proper drill bits. No matter what side of the receiver you need to machine or drill, these setup blocks will insure you hold your receiver flat and square every time. The blocks have a black anodized finish, so you will be able to use these blocks many times.  This is the same mil-spec anodized finish that the military uses, so you know it will last a very long time.  

The blocks are shipped with a quick start instruction sheet to assist you in using your blocks for the first time. You can also view the tutorial at this link CNC Gunsmithing Jig Tutorial.

This AR15 jig will save you time and money.  No more trashing a receiver because you drilled a hole off position or at an angle. This is a must have for finishing an AR-15 receiver the EASY WAY!"

Fluted Barrel With Mid-Position Gas Port, RGQTM Handguard, YHM Flip-Up Front Sight and Vortex Flash Suppressor.
FTF Only. $825 Firm. 

The custom machined match barrels used in RGUNS rifles and uppers are made from 4150 chrome-moly vanadium steel manufactured in the USA. Each 5.56 NATO barrel is properly head spaced with an M4 feed ramp extension installed.

Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and muzzle threaded � -28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion when the barrel heats up, and hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life.  

Each barrel has an eleven degree crown, polished chamber and lapped bore, as well as a pulled-button rifling,  producing a superbly accurate bore diameter with uniform rate of twist. Fluted models feature unique fluting designs to improve rigidity and aid in barrel cooling.

MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver is one of the most recent AR-15 Lower Receivers to hit the market. 
The MAG Tactical Systems AR-15 Lower Receiver is about 35 percent lighter than a standard aluminum receiver, and it is not plastic! 
The MAG Tactical Systems Generation 4 Lower is made of a proprietary magnesium alloy. The patented coating process that MAG Tactical Systems owns gives their lower extreme corrosion resistance characteristics.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver incorporates a machined in triggerguard that is larger than a mil-spec trigger guard, which allows the trigger to be accessed with thick winter gloves.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver front and rear pivot points are reinforced to avoid breakage of the receiver even when high torque is applied when it is in the break down position
Today’s warrior has been looking for a lower receiver that has the low weight and high feature list that the MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver has to offer.

 Mossberg International brings an AR-style platform. Shooting has never been more fun and affordable.
 Mossberg International’s new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today’s AR-style platforms with Mossberg International’s reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 16.25” barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 comes with a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4” – 14.5” LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine.

eretta characterizes its 9mm Nano as the “ultimate evolution of the micro-compact carry pistol.” The company’s first-ever striker-fired pistol is officially called the BU-9 Nano. It’s small, sleek and thin, weighing just a hair over 17 ounces. With an overall length of 5.6 inches and a width of .9 inch, it’s easy to see why the name “Nano” (referring to “nanotechnology,” or the science of the tiny) was chosen. If that concept isn’t yet embedded in your techspeak,  “BU” is the now-official abbreviation for “Beretta USA,” and the “9” is to differentiate this introductory model from other planned chamberings.

The design utilizes a removable, serialized steel subchassis that can easily be swapped into replaceable complete grip frames to accommodate different hand sizes, simple to disassemble and maintain. The development goals for the Nano were ease of use and concealment. Its size and snag-free design make it easy to carry and access.

It is chambered in .45acp and is one hell of a head turner! This is the ORIGINAL Officer model, not a 90's copy! Has the original box with matching serial numbers! Also includes two Colt bright stainless 6 round magazines and one Colt 7 round steel magazine. I bought this last year from the original owner where it was still unfired. I put about 200 rounds through it and other than that, it is my safe queen. I love this firearm and everything about it but I am looking to get a new competition pistol and you know how cheap those are... I have never seen another like mine and only a few pics even surface the internet. Especially with the original box. Here is your chance to get a one of a kind pistol, I really do not want to sell it but if the offer is right, I will let it go. This pistol will ONLY appreciate in time. Original Colt's become harder to find everyday."

MOSSBERG 935 WATERFOWL 12GA 26"" SYN 

Introducing the new Mossberg® 935 Magnum™ semi-automatic 3-1/2” shotgun. Built from the rock-solid foundation of the Mossberg 835® pump action — the original 3-1/2” shotgun — the 935™ is an impressive performer to say the least. Built to handle the hardest hitting 3” & 3-1/2” payloads — this is a shotgun that doesn’t hold back on features either. Just shoulder the 935™ and you immediately appreciate the seamless integration of stock and forearm to receiver. A receiver, it should be noted, that is painstakingly set at a perfect angle to generate instant eye-rib alignment for rapid target acquisition. You’ll appreciate as well the fiber optic sights on both waterfowl and turkey models when used in low-light conditions and the magazine quick-unload button for when the day is done. But make no mistake, the 935™ is not about collecting compliments mounted on the wall. It’s about filling a game bag. With a new self-regulating gas system that vents excess gasses to aid in recoil reduction while eliminating stress on critical operating systems, that’s exactly what it’s set out to do.

We’ve designed our SKS Detachable Magazines with serious shooters in mind. The mag body, made of high strength composite, has horizontal grooves cut into it for an enhanced gripping surface. We’ve used the highest quality interior components and incorporated a metal floorplate so you can expect maximum strength from this magazine. That, plus the fact that this mag is made in the U.S.A. so it counts for three compliance parts, you could say we’ve really thought of everything. Counts as 3 U.S. 922r Compliant Parts.

It was manufactured in 1897 for the Swiss Military. 

In 1911, the Swiss recalled all of their 1896's so they could be converted to the stronger action capable of handling modern firearm cartridges and this rifle was done in 1913. Then in 1964, this rifle was sold to a California company who then "" sporterized "" the rifle for the American market. This conversion took the form of re-tooling the stock for hunting purposes and re-chambering the action and barrel for the 308.Win round. The barrel, the action and the stock still have the Swiss Military markings on them. 

It has a detachable magazine and an original style "" stripper clip "" for it as well. There is a base to a scope mounted to the action of the rifle but no scope goes with it. The adjustable iron rear site is still on the rifle.

After doing some research, I believe these prices are what you would pay online for comparable new ammo, except online you will pay taxes and/or shipping. That's assuming you can even find this ammo for sale (especially the 9mm).

Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

Description:
The KWA Full Metal M1911 Mark III PTP Airsoft Gun is an astounding work of art. The frame and slide are constructed of metal which give the gun a very realistic look, feel, and sound when fired. Aiding in that amazing sound is the metal hammer and stiff hammer and slide springs. The barrel is conical which eliminate the barrel bushing, the end result is an updated 1911 look. The guide rod sits underneath the barrel to keep the slide on track. The rear sight has dots for faster target acquisition. The grip safety comes complete with a beaver tail to help control recoil and the traditional thumb safety is ambidextrous. The trigger has three holes bored out of it and the hammer is bored into an triangular shape. Finally, to help reloading, the magazine well has been slightly elongated and beveled at the entrance. KWA is well known for making some of the highest quality airsoft guns in the world, and this new 1911 definitely ranks up there with the best of them.

Manufactured Feb 2013. I have 7 of these up for grabs. These are awesome mags and have been a pain to get a hold of. Here's Surefire's description:

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine--slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length--fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Features:
-Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines
-Reliable functioning due to mechanical simplicity and high-quality non-binding coil springs--no lubricants required
-Long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance
-Easily seated in weapon with bolt forward
-May be kept fully loaded for extended periods without spring fatigue
-Only 1.66"" thick, less than two 30-round magazines clipped together
-60-round magazine is approximately same length as two 30-round magazines clipped together

This is a piece of history and with the gun ban/registration BS/etc crap going on, get it while you can.

* The gun itself W/ nylon grip support & low original serial numbers (Serial # 0003660)

* Barrel extension with shroud

* 8 - 35 round mags (all original grease gun style)

* 1 - 16 round mag

* Shoulder sling for the gun itself

* Book ""Full Auto Volume Three"". This is the bundle topper. It's a book on how to convert your semi-auto M10 into a Full-Auto M10. It shows many different ways it can be done. (I do not condone doing it as doing so would be a Federal crime if caught.) Book is completely legal as is the knowledge of the mods and is meant to be for novelty/collection only.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

$70 for the brick of Subsonic, $70 for the assorted lot.

Price is FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

I personally haven't seen any .22LR for sale in a retail store in about 3 months. The only reason I have these is they were purchased a while ago.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .22lr ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay.

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales.

If you would like to talk on the phone about these, message me your number, and I'll give you a call."

These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

 If you enjoy the adaptability of the AR platform then you're going to love the M4-177. The airgun features a rifled steel barrel and shoots both pellets and BBs. The rifle's variable pump action is easy to use for right or left-handed shooters.

 Expect velocities up to 660 fps with BBs and 625 fps with 7.9gr, .177 caliber pellets.

 There's plenty of picatinny rails for mounting your favorite accessories, plus the front and rear sights and stock are removable for the ultimate in upgrade possibilities.

◦Includes a Firepow'r 5-shot pellet clip
◦Reservoir capacity of 350 BBs
◦Adjustable stock to fit every shooter
◦Loop slots for adding a gun sling
◦Windage and elevation adjustments
◦Two aperture sizes instantly available on rear sight: just flip up the small one for stationary or bullseye targets or the large one for moving or large targets.
◦Removable magazine stores pellet clip and sight adjustment tool

 This is made for small game hunting or competition shooting. This is a pump action so you will never need to buy those expensive CO2 cartridges. Just pump from 3-10 times depending on distance and power desired and shoot! This looks and feels like a true AR style rifle! This is still ne and only has had about 50 or so BB's ran through it and I still hhave the box and almost 6000 BB's to go with it.

I also have computers I can throw in as well with the deal.

I have 10, 30-round, magpul magazines with windows on the way. Once I get them I can sell them to you for what I paid ($12 each).

Original box from academy sports not shown in picture, also included.
Scope comes off within 10 seconds and you can use the built in sights if you prefer.

If you want to test it out at the south sandy shooting range that is fine, just show me that you can pay for it so that I know you are serious about buying it.

$1,380 (Way less than what I paid after shipping everything in)
This is priced to sell fast.
If this add is still up I still have it.

From the Sig Sauer website:

The modern SIG SAUER® pistol story began with the P220®. In 1976 the .45 ACP P220 was introduced and quickly became recognized as one of ""the most accurate 45s right out of the box."" Since that time the P220 has earned an enviable record in hot spots around the world. The P220 features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear-resistant Nitron® finish, light-weight alloy frame with integral accessory rail, and the SIG SAUER® four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector.

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal
barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more. 

It comes with five 20 round magazine,sling and owners manual. I'll ship to an ffl for no extra charge. Serious buyers only."
