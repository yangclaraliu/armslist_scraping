While a new assault weapons ban isn't likely, a high capacity magazine ban could realistically gain enough support in Congress to pass. If you plan on putting some up for a rainy day, here's your chance to do so at a reasonable price.

Just got in some brand new black Tapco Intrafuse Gen II polymer 30 round mags for sale. Very sturdy, feed reliably, and wont dent or rust. Tapco provides a lifetime warranty for all of their magazines.

Tapco AK47 mags: $20 each, these fit like a glove in WASR's, and work great in Yugos, Russian, Chinese and others. Only AK I have come across that these don't fit are Serbian. I like these better than my surplus combloc mags, I cannot believe how sturdy these things are. I will also offer quantity discounts on these, ask for details.

Gen II Tapco AR15 mags: $20 each. From the manufacturer:

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

I can also make this a complete gun if you don't have an Ar-15 lower to pin this Monster down on. Also text me at 985-502-8347 Complete gun and ammo equal to this set up is going from $2800-$3200 on Gunbroker. With this being said bring me something very unique and interesting or cash offers with Kimber trades.

There is a reason why these are always sold out and are highly desirable. Direct drop in upgrade for your AR15. I only have 1 of these available. Cost me $46 with shipping, and these are impossible to get. I will sell it for $60 cash if anyone wants it. If interested please include a phone number to contact you on in your reply, thanks

From Spikes website:

Introduction
Looking for a heavy buffer to replace your standard carbine buffer? Well, we came up with something that offers the HIGHEST performance at a reasonable price. The ST-T2 buffer is one of the softest shooting, smoothest, and quietest buffers on the market; not to mention it looks awesome! It doesn't have any weights to move around or fluids to leak out like some other buffers, so it's 100% maintenance free! 

The ST-T2 buffer weighs in at 115g/4.05oz. (Depending on the density and size of the HDTP, the weight can vary slightly) and the body is CNC machined from solid billet Aluminum bar stock for strength and durability. To finish it all off, it's Anodized matte black and laser engraved with our Logo. 

So you're probably wondering what's inside of this thing to make this thing so great and different? 

Each ST-T2 buffer is filled with HDTP which is short for ""High Density Tungsten Powder"" and topped off with a Mil-Spec bumper. Because of this, there aren’t any reciprocating weights inside to make a lot of noise and it also makes for a very smooth cycling rifle. The ST-T2 eliminates the chance of bolt bounce, helps with muzzle rise when firing in full-auto, and cuts down on felt recoil. As you can tell, it's a HUGE upgrade from a Standard Carbine buffer! It's designed for .223/5.56 but it works in all Calibers! 

Get one for your AR-15 today and feel the difference! 
NOTE: Actual weight can vary between 4.0oz and 4.2oz.

Just got in some brand new black Tapco Intrafuse Gen II polymer 30 round mags for sale. Very sturdy, feed reliably, and wont dent or rust. Tapco provides a lifetime warranty for all of their magazines.

Tapco AK47 mags: $20 each, these fit like a glove in WASR's, and work great in Yugos, Russian, Chinese and others. The only AK I have come across that these don't fit is a  Serbian. I like these better than my surplus combloc mags, I cannot believe how sturdy these things are. I will also offer quantity discounts on these, ask for details.

Gen II Tapco AR15 mags: $20 each. From the manufacturer:

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

Hornady XTP bullets were designed for hunting, self-defense, and law enforcement. One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities.

Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition.

The firearm is manufactured at the Zastava factory and imported by PW Arms of Redmond, Virginia.  

I have fired the weapon many times and found it to be a reliable, fire breathing, bullet launching, ammo chewing machine.  The recoil and firepower is somewhere between a .22LR and a Howitzer… But it’s closer to the Howitzer.  

I have cleaned the firearm after every range trip.  As the picture shows, I fire name brand factory loads through it.  The bore is clean and the grooves deep and prominent.  

The firearm comes with 3 magazines, the issued holster, the issued cleaning rod, and 1,300-rounds (sixteen 50-packs).  The image should nicely represent what comes with the pistol.  

This is the Mail Carrier of pistols – it’ll work in the rain, sleet, and snow. If you are looking for a sidearm with stopping power and durability consider this as a suitable choice.  It’s solid enough that if you manage to miss your target with all 1,300-rounds you can still flip it over and beat them with the thing.  

See the picture, think happy thoughts, don’t tell your wife, and contact me with an offer.

Here is the description from the person I purchased from on Gunbroker:

New Old Stock, AUSA, 1.6mm (metal thickness) caliber 7.62x39mm, AKM receiver. 

This auction is for ONE, Semi-Auto-Only, fully CNC machined AKM 47 receiver, that has never been assembled into a rifle. It has the forged steel (Mil-Spec) center support (not a piece of steel brake tubing) and rivet correctly installed and the rails have been properly jig welded into place. YOU... will need to lay-out and then drill your own front and rear trunnion, rivet holes. These premium, 1.6mm receivers have not been manufactured in MANY years. 

Using one of these gives you THE BEST AK RECEIVER EVER MADE IN THE USA. Better than a milled receiver because they NEVER develop stress crack risers, as they are stamped out of 4140 alloy steel, stress relieved and then heat treated. These receivers WILL require some Gun Smithing skills to assemble. The narrowing of the front and rear trunnions will be required.

ftf only, I will not come to you, I will not trade for ammo, I just want to sell it.  This saves you shipping and hassle.  I am firm on price."

It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. A 25- and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. 

The .22 caliber HK MP5 A5 operates on a blowback system. The bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety switch rotates in the same manner as the 9 mm MP5.

I spent 3 hours removing cosmoline or what ever monkeys*** they used to store these. another 3 hours lightly sanding the surface. I removed just enough to reveal the CHU-wood (a very moisture resistant wood) and leave the 'battle scars'. I gave it  light stain and clear coat. Aesthetically, this is a stunning piece of history in my eyes. I have gone through the entire rifle and cleaned everything and finished with a light coat of oil. I have sent 100+ rounds through it with no problems of any kind and am laying 2 1/2"" groups at 100 yards with just the rifle sights. It has a non removable folding bayonet. The weapon is tight, clean & shoots like the vet she is. 

I bought 2 T-53's the same day, same place from the same crate. The top one is what they looked like before. The bottom one is what you are buying.

No cleaning rod, like 99.99% of these you come across. A standard 30/06 rod works just fine.

In addition to the pics, here are a pair of videos of me shooting the rifle. One of the great draws to this carbine is some of the powder doesn't have time to burn off before it leaves the crown, resulting in the dragon fire...lol. I learned the hard way (first shots in the daylight video) that you MUST wear ear protection when using this beast. It is LOUD! Take this one to the range and people WILL notice.

When you come to pick it up, I live in a rural area so you will have the opportunity to shoot it that you like before you take it home. I stand behind my work. I am in NO way a gunsmith, just a Mosin enthusiast. A note on the ammo. This is military surplus and is DIRT cheap. a span can of 440 rounds only runs $99 online. (Seriously! Find any other 7.62 round in that .20 cents a round range & I'll eat one...lol) This is a hard hitting round that punches through 7/16"" plate steel with the heavy ball. The light ball that i have shot tears the plate up pretty good too. 

FWIW, this round will take any animal on the North American continent and not think twice about it at all.

SIG SAUER P938 NIGHTMARE

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents."

(With the increase in availability of both the MAGPUL PTS and MAGPUL USA parts, there has been some confusion regarding the differences between MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products. All MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products are made with DuPont polymer and either forged steel or aircraft grade T-6061 aluminum alloy, and are close to indestructible. Because of MAGPUL USA’s military contracts and the regulations regarding sales of US Made firearm parts (ITAR Restriction), MAGPUL USA products are generally not available for sale outside the United States, and are even restricted in several US states. MAGPUL PTS parts are contract manufactured by MAGPUL internationally and are legal for sale anywhere in the world. Additionally, some PTS parts are specifically designed for use on airsoft rifles (like the MIAD grips designed to house electric motors) but the CTR stock for sale here is designed to fit both real mil-spec buffer tubes , and the MBUS sights will go on any 20mm rail — . Regardless, all MAGPUL parts are made to the same exacting professional quality you’ve come to expect from MAGPUL.)"
