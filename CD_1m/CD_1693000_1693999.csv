Want AR/AK Trades!,"NW Tucson, Tucson, Arizona",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, May 30, 2013",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"For starters, talk about beautiful.  Not only talking about the cosmetics, but the functionality of this legendary pistol.  The functionality alone is why our U.S. Navy SEALs trust this weapon with their life when they face adversity.  Not to mention the number of LEO, military, and federal agents worldwide that have chosen to have this weapon by their side.  Sure it doesn't come cheap, but when you want battle tested SHTF reliability, look no further than the ""to hell and back reliability"" quality of Sig.  Anyway It really does sadden me to get rid of this pistol.  But at the moment my want for an AR platform is what brought me to trade or potentially sell(for the right price).  So here we go..

I have: 
- Sig Sauer P226R (Railed) chambered in .40 S&W with black Nitron® finish and upgraded Siglite® night sights 
- 3-12 round factory Sig Sauer branded magazines
- Streamlight TLR-2s tactical light w/ laser combo and strobe    
- 2 new 20 round boxes of Hornady Critical Duty 175 grain Flexlock cartridges
- Subrosa Level 1 retention holster (carbon fiber I believe) very sturdy
- Hogue aftermarket grip
- 10 .40 S&W snap caps A-zoom (not pictured)
- 150 rounds of 180 grain FMJ by Remington and American Eagle brand (not pictured)
- Original factory plastic hard case (not pictured)

Pistol has approximately 130 rounds through it.  There is some minor wear on the barrel due to my snap cap dry fire practice and range visits.  This firearm has had 0 malfunctions through it all.  Cleaned and Oiled after every range visit.

*So I have been getting a lot of messages asking my ""rock bottom price"".  I did number crunch and came up with a figure based off of fair market value of my pistol and the lot of all the items.  Here's what I've come up with so there is no confusion.

Sig P226R w/3 factory mags and Subrosa holster: $925 cash

The aforementioned lot of items above, so everything listed: $1355 cash

Now remember one may subtract a few or most items.  We can configure a price based on what the buyer wants to take home.

It is the Enhanced model with a ""beaver"" tail and SRT trigger. The grips are not factory as I bought it used and they are the Hogue aluminum grips. Not sure of the round count but I have many trouble free rounds through it. There is a bit of a scratch on the Hogue grip but the gun itself is very clean. I would say 98% condition.

This is one of the nicest ar pistols you will see, and best handling i have ever seen.

I will also throw in a free survival sling that i make, which can be found here: http://www.armslist.com/posts/1146717/tulsa-oklahoma-tactical-gear-for-sale--paracord-survival-slings---rifle-slings-straps

Specs:

This specially designed weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the MP6920 Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) – ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt’s MP6920 is made with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, this weapon comes loaded with Magpul MOE accessories.

- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7″ (178mm) 
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- One 30-round Magpul magazine 
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness"

I'm selling my 2000 Blazer because I bought a new vehicle. It has just under 111k on the original engine and transmission. The previous owner was a mechanic and replaced a lot of parts on the vehicle prior to selling it to me (head gaskets, intake gasket, starter, muffler). The interior is very clean, but does show some normal wear and tear. It has an aftermarket JVC CD/MP3 player with an auxiliary output and aftermarket Pioneer speakers all the way around. It does have the wiring set up for an amp and subs, but does not include them. Body has some minor rust around the left rear quarter panel as well as some dings and scratches. It's been a reliable vehicle for me (drove it between Denver and Nebraska on several occasions) and the 4 wheel drive worked great in the snow. It has a newer set of tires on the rear with good tread. The front tires still have decent tread, but could probably be replaced. The A/C could use a charge as well. This is no show car, but it is a reliable car that starts every time and will get you from A to B with no problems!

I'M LOOKING TO SELL BY THE END OF THE WEEK. I'm asking $3000/OBO. Cash or money order ONLY!

It has a very good battery consumption and one battery can last 365 days kind of like the aimpoint pro but obviously the aimpoint lasts longer cause of the bigger battery. The removal of the battery on the MDRS is simple to remove unlike some mini red dots and it just comes out the top. This dot can be submerged under 66 feet of water for 2 hours. It has adjustable brightness and an awesome auto mode which changes the brightness of the dot according to the brightness of the room or outdoors.

I am from Oklahoma City, and am on vacation here in Colorado until June 1. I feel bad that the gang of sociopaths that likes to call themselves a government up here is getting their filthy hands on some of my money, so I am (re)importing as many standard capacity AR mags as I can into the state to make up for it. I have a stack of brand new in wrap Gen 2 black Magpul Pmag 30 rounders.  I still have 22 of them available.  I will sell them at my cost, which is $15 a piece. I am staying in Dillon, but will be heading into the Denver, Boulder, and Ft. Collins areas as well. I understand that the protection racket that runs Denver threatens force against people who have these objects on their ""turf,"" so it would probably be best if we meet somewhere else.  I can meet in the parking lot of the Tanner Gun Show on Saturday morning (June 1).  If I don't sell them prior to that, I will probably unload them at the show. 

If you're interested, email, text, or call me and tell me how many you want and where you can meet me. In selling these, I will give preference to folks who believe in civil disobedience and violent resistance to threats on their rights, so let me know if you are a three percenter. No law enforcement.

When an MP-40 and L1A1 somehow get into the mix, a 9mm PPS-43 with AR-15 furniture and sights with an L1A1 flash hider and bayonet are thrust upon a world both afraid and not ready for a concoction worthy only of a deep dark Soviet lab. 

Starting with a PPS-43C, the folding stock was cut off and a new production 9mm barrel added.  A flash hider from an L1A1 was welded on to obtain a minimum legal length.  A receiver extension was then crafted to allow the adjustable stock from an AR-15 to be attached which was then “crafted” into a homemade bump fire stock (no springs, etc.  = perfectly legal).  Finally, rails were added to the top to allow new sights and carry handle to be added. 

The result is the baddest, sickest, Mad Maxiest, Soviet-German-American-Britishiest mashup ever conceived by man.  Along with 5 original magazines (from which 9mm feeds beautifully), this is one serious lead spewing machine.  Add the included L1A1 bayonet and you don't even need lead to spew!

It was a project and I’m not looking to, nor do I feel I will, make a profit on it.  I’m not a manufacturer by any means so I’m just looking to move on to new toys.

With the money it takes to build something like this monster, a 1911 (Colt) or an M1 Garand would be a fair trade and I’d certainly take it but I’m open to offers.  I’m mainly seeing what kind of interest this would garner if any.  Make me an offer, any offer!
