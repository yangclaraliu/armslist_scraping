The rifle operates great and the scope is zeroed in at 25-300 meters. The only issue with this rifle is the rear sight mount. It was welded on crooked and the rear sight has to be moved all the way to the right to adjust the windage. That is the reason for the installation of the Barska 4-16 power, green lighted retical optic. The rear sight and all of the parts were removed to mount the optic low. I will only meet in the local area and will not seperatly sell the magazines from the rifle."

LWRC M6A2 SPR
Black 5.56
Spiral Fluted Barrel

Brand New! NO credit card fees!!


The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

Comes with original blue Sig case, four mags, Sig factory grips (shown), fine wood grips (Rosewood or Walnut (I don't which)), soft rubber Hogue grips, a Blackhawk holster.  The internals on this gun look unfired to me, or at least shot very little.

There is a lot about this gun that I don't know.  The sights are definitely Trijicon but they have additional dots on the top (two rear, one front) that really help with lock out.  The trigger has a super smooth action and I was told when I bought it that it had the Sig action enhancement work done on it but I can't verify that. I do know it has new springs and an extra power recoil spring. I think it has the SRT, but this one has lines on the pad area whereas my other 220 triggers have smooth pads.  The throat and ramp have have also been beveled and polished.  You'll have to judge for yourself but the action on this is like butter and definitely not stock Sig  If you'd don't have a 220, I'll bring one of my 220 carry pistols for you to compare it with.

These are not common and more a collector's pistol than other Sig P220.

Do not send me lowball offers.  I'm close to firm on the price and I don't ""need"" to sell this.  Please spare me your wily internet marketing skills."

It is semi automatic tube fed where you load the rounds in through the butt of the gun and it's even self lubricating.  This rifles are known to be insanely reliable in any weather conditions and Remington even put a lifetime warranty on all the nylon material from cracking, breaking or even fading because back in those days if it wasn't wood people didn't trust it.  There is a period correct scope mounted on it right now that is somehow still spot on after sitting for quite a while.  The Nylon 66 is known to be very accurate with just the iron sights and even was famous for attaining the aerial shooting record.  It's in good shape with a few scratches that you could buff out if that's what you wanted.  It has just sat inside the house, we did take it out and shoot it the other day and it was flawless and so accurate that we considered keeping it.

PMC makes quality, reliable ammunition in nearly every caliber. All PMC cartridges must pass through the rigorous inspection of our electronic powder check station. This station accurately measures the propellant charge in each round. If the propellant in any cartridge varies by a tiny amount, just two tenths of one grain, the system stops and that cartridge is discarded. No other ammunition manufacturer can truthfully assure you greater uniformity and reliability than PMC!

Beretta JS92M9A1 92 M9A1 9mm 4.9"" 10+1 LTD Black Synthetic Grip Matte Black

The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and
proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies
around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U. S.
Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and
performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing
missions of peacekeeping forces. The special PVD coating reduces friction,
while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation
within the round column, greatly increasing the reliability and functioning
of the M9A1 in desert or other extreme conditions.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. 

Features a Nitron®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame. Hogue® Grips round out this package.

Nosler Ballistic Tip Hunting bullets have been trusted by hunters for nearly 25 years. They are precision made and individually inspected for the utmost quality which translates to incredible accuracy with every shot. The heavy jacket base prevents bullet deformation during firing and holds together at extreme velocities as well as a polycarbonate tip that resists deformation in the magazine and initiates expansion upon impact. The bullet's mid-section keeps it together at any velocity until impact, and a uniform, pure lead core eliminates possible imbalance and erratic flight caused by air pockets. Great for thin-skinned game like deer, antelope and sheep. This is not loaded ammunition."
