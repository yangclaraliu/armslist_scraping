It comes with everything in the box instruction manual,warranty lock, 1-6rd mag and 1-8rd extended mag. This is the newest Beretta Nano Generation. Are you tired of bulky subcompact guns rubbing on your skin or being exposed? well I got the right solution for you, your looking at a pocket size gun that is light, slim and you can pretty much carry it any where you want without feeling a thing. This is the perfect gun for you. Whats great about this gun is that its by Beretta a military brand gun so you know its strong, durable, and reliable. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. The reason why I'm selling this gun because I have two of the same gun. I want to sell it for $540obo or trade it for Glock 26 Gen3/Gen4 or Glock 27 Gen3/Gen4. FTF in Vancouver,WA. WA ID is required for bill of sale. email me for pics."

""This is a FNH 223 / 5.56 FNC /AR15 30rd. Magazine Black Color. FNH USA offers 30-round magazines designed to fit the F2000, FS2000, FNC Carbines and AR-15 Carbines. Their solid steel construction will provide years of dependable service. The matte black exterior finish, low-friction followers and tough wire springs make them extra reliable in all conditions.""


Please really think about whether or not you want to pay this much for AR-15 magazines.

As we are all painfully aware, the price of AR-15 magazines has skyrocketed to ridiculous levels in the past several weeks, due to the threat of future restrictions.

If no legislation passes (and there is no hyper-inflation), you will be able to buy brand new military spec and P-Mag AR-15 magazines for $10 to $20 each -- and overpriced FN and HK brand mags for $30 to $50 each -- within a few months.  And the market will be so flooded with used magazines that they should be almost free.

If I believed that AR-15 magazines will not be available in the future, I would not be selling these.  If, however, somebody wants to pay inflated prices for AR-15 magazines, I can spare a few from my personal stash to finance some other projects.  When the market returns to normal I'll just buy some more.

The sad truth is that if you buy these magazines from me at this price, it means that one of us is going to be wrong about the future and will regret it."

Designated with the “AM” (Anderson Manufacturing) moniker to set them apart from traditional “AR” (Armalite Rifle) models, Anderson Manufacturing rifles offer design and build quality that exceeds that of other firearms manufacturers around the world along with RF-85, a proprietary metal treatment.

Anderson Manufacturing employs a proprietary metal treatment for all its rifles that reduces friction on all the steel surfaces by 85%, resulting in a more efficient and reliable weapon. Known as RF-85 (reduce friction 85%), the treatment offers significant benefits such as faster cycle rates and cooler operating temperatures. This results in significantly less wear on the weapon, thereby increasing its life. In addition, an RF-85 treated weapon does not need any lubricants. As such, the weapon experiences fewer failures due to excess dirt and carbon fouling in the action, thereby increasing its reliability.

The rifles have a lifetime limited warranty

.22 Long Rifle, Aguila Super Colibri, 20 Grain Lead Round Nose Bullet, 500 Round Brick.

Aguila Super Colibri is super quiet ammo that does not contain gun powder but fires from the force of the primer only. Powerful and silent, great for use in urban areas. This is a 20 grain solid lead bullet in a brass case. Will break glass and penetrate hard tin cans. Velocity is 500 fps at the muzzle with 11 ft/lbs of energy and can be lethal. This ammo works great and is intended for .22 handguns only."

FNH USA Product # REDACTED

2 magazines, new in boxes

$90 for the pair

I will not split this set up, since it would not be worth my time and effort to sell individual magazines.  I am located near Boulder, but can meet in the Denver metro area.

These are steel, not aluminum, magazines.

""This is a FNH 223 / 5.56 FNC /AR15 30rd. Magazine Black Color. FNH USA offers 30-round magazines designed to fit the F2000, FS2000, FNC Carbines and AR-15 Carbines. Their solid steel construction will provide years of dependable service. The matte black exterior finish, low-friction followers and tough wire springs make them extra reliable in all conditions.""


Please really think about whether or not you want to pay this much for AR-15 magazines.

As we are all painfully aware, the price of AR-15 magazines has skyrocketed to ridiculous levels in the past several weeks, due to the threat of future restrictions.

If no legislation passes (and there is no hyper-inflation), you will be able to buy brand new military spec and P-Mag AR-15 magazines for $10 to $20 each -- and overpriced FN and HK brand mags for $30 to $50 each -- within a few months. And the market will be so flooded with used magazines that they should be almost free.

If I believed that AR-15 magazines will not be available in the future, I would not be selling these. If, however, somebody wants to pay inflated prices for AR-15 magazines, I can spare a few from my personal stash to finance some other projects. When the market returns to normal I'll just buy some more.

The sad truth is that if you buy these magazines from me at this price, it means that one of us is going to be wrong about the future and will regret it."

If no legislation passes (and there is no hyper-inflation), you will be able to buy brand new military spec and P-Mag AR-15 magazines for $10 to $20 each -- and overpriced FN and HK brand mags for $30 to $50 each -- within a few months. And the market will be so flooded with used magazines that they should be almost free.

If I believed that AR-15 magazines will not be available in the future, I would not be selling these. If, however, somebody wants to pay inflated prices for AR-15 magazines, I can spare a few from my personal stash to finance some other projects. When the market returns to normal I'll just buy some more.

The sad truth is that if you buy these magazines from me at this price, it means that one of us is going to be wrong about the future and will regret it."

I have a CMMG Stainless .22lr conversion kit. It has the bolt hold open adapter, and the forward assist adapter. And the anti-jam charging handle is included, but it has a missing little piece (it still functions and CMMG will very likely replace it under warranty). And 3 Bolt Hold Open Actuation high capacity  Magazines. And 500 rounds of .22LR ammo that comes with it. This is a fantastic training aid for those that are trying to teach new shooters in this day and age, and it works fantastic for a simple drop into to your 5.56 or .223 or .223 wylde rifle.  

If you can't find a Bolt Carrier Group since they are nearly $400 everywhere, this is a much smarter idea to get practice in, get quality trigger time, and get used to your AR15.  Order a BCG, and wait for it to come in, all the while shooting .22LR through your AR15 and getting quality training in while you wait.  And shoot .22LR at $0.05 a round instead of $1 round for Expensive 5.56.  It'll save you more money than you can imagine.

Shoot 22lr of 5.56, you'll quickly save enough money to pay for this conversion kit outright.  And when done, you'll not only have better technique, the ability to shoot multiple calibers in your AR15, (not just limited to .223/5.56).

Did a quick search and I believe this is the lowest price on MN Armslist for a quality AR.  

This is a top-rated flat top rifle with solid components (check out the online reviews if you haven't heard of Windham - newer company but top notch rifles with lifetime warranty).  Comes with a sling, hard case, instruction manual, and the standard 30 round mag.  

As you may know, several years ago Bushmaster quality was declining, and so Windham Weaponry was started by many of the top Bushmaster owners/employees who wanted to produce the finest AR rifles in the country.

I like that they have taken the old Bushmaster AR and made it even better.  But the thing that sold me on this rifle is that there is the lifetime warranty, which can be transferred to a new owner, should you sell or trade the gun.  That says a lot in my book, when a gun company is so sure of their products, that they are willing to back them up forever against defects in materials and workmanship.  Check out the reviews online which speak plenty of praise for this rifle.


$1,275 cash and/or silver/gold coins. Local sales only.


** Recent sale fell through last minute (buyer cashflow problem) so I am reposting to Armlist for just the rifle.  I advertised this earlier with 9 extra magazines which may still be available as well by the time you respond (five 30 round pmags and four 20 round thermold)."

This is a side lock, percussion rifle. When I bought the rifle the open sights and ramrod were missing and were replaced (NEW). 
I also use Pyrodex 50 grain powder pellets instead if loose power, a new box of the pellets is included plus 18 additional pellets that came with some of the bullets and sabots. There are 3 different weight bullets included; there are 10 - 300 grain copper hollow point bullets with sabots, 12 power belt 245 grain bullets and sabots still new in pack. There are also 11 bullets and sabots, these have been open and I’m not sure of weight but I think they are 200 grain.  
When I began using the powder pellets the #10 nipple was just not hot enough to ignite them consistently so there is also a new #11 nipple installed plus 2 more still in the pack. A box of #11 percussion caps might be 8 or 10 caps missing (I have shot the rifle but  not enough to even adjust the new sight). There is a real powder horn; it could be made operable but it’s just for looks at this time because I use the pellets. All the above accessories except the powder horn fit in an old army mag pouch that I'm using as a possibles bag.
Also included is a Thompson Center Black Powder cleaning Kit and two knives from Smokey Mount Knife Works that have fake Damascus blades and plastic horn handles. (I had planned to replace the handles with Deer horn and make sheaths and a possibles bag from deer hide.)  

There is a couple of spots on the rifle where the factory finish has come off, I was going to refinish the stock just as soon as I got it lined out and shooting like I wanted, But due to sickness, then heart surgery I have not got around to it. 
Would like to get $300.00 out of it or maybe trade to a Hi-point (40 caliber?) carbine for plinking, or maybe a 9 for CC?  Might can add a little cash if extras are included.   The camo rifle case in photo is not included!    Thanks for looking."

No holsters.  Been a while since I fired either. Just a magazine or two over the last year. I have these as part of my collection but never carry or use at the range. Bersa comes with one 6 round mag. I did carry the Bersa a few years ago and it is an excellent concealed carry gun. A little heavier than the current composite types which helps with the recoil and accuracy. In my opinion.  Raven comes with one 6 round mag. My initial price estimate is around $250 for the Bersa and $125 for the Raven. These are not firm prices, just initial estimates. Having said that I am not looking to sell but it would be considered. Sale would require a Virginia Driver License and willingness to sign a simple bill of sale."

If you want a physical beauty that stuns the eyes, this one's not for you. If you're looking for a dependable, everyday user that will get done what you need done, then it will fill the bill. Did for me. Also has a new JD seat cover as well (photos taken before seat cover was installed). Mower will be ready to go upon arrival for the new owner (tires aired up, full battery charge). 
Might trade even for a handgun/tactical type rifle of equal value. Mower must be picked up by the new owner as I have no way of delivering. Feel free to text/call (8five9) 7four9-6ninefour9 with any questions or email me from this page with the title John Deere in the email subject. 
Thanks in advance for your interest."

It is a fun rifle to shoot, and the recoil is very manageable thanks to the muzzle brake.   It definitely draws a crowd every time I've taken it out.  It is definitely a ""chick magnet"" at the range.  Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for people who look like me, so I guess it balances out.

The reason I'm selling this is that I rarely get to shoot it.  There aren't many ranges I can shoot this at, so I only take it out once every year or so at W.H.A.C.'s annual ""Blow Up The World"" party, when the range is opened to the public.  If I owned my own land, this would definitely be a keeper.

""I’ve been entered in a long range rifle competition this Sunday aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico, a competition which STARTS at 800 yards and ends at 1,000. It’ll be the first time I’ve shot a 50 BMG rifle, the first time I’ve shot 1,000 yards, and the first time I’ve had a cheering section.""  |-----

""When I pulled the trigger for the first time, I was pleasantly suprised at how mild the recoil felt and how quiet the report was to me. I was expecting a punishing kick that would leave my shoulder red for weeks but instead it was more like a gentle shove, less than an M44 Mosin Nagant’s recoil. Even the sound of the rifle going off was quieter than I expected.""  |-----

""To fire that heavier round, everything about this gun has been super-sized. The rifle (when fully assembled) tips the scales at 33.2 pounds. With a 30″ barrel, the ArmaLite AR50′s almost 60 inches long. In an attempt to make this rifle fit in the trunk of a car, you can partially remove the stock—making the gun only about 50 inches long. Rifle cases? I’ve got a few. But then again, too short to mention. The ArmaLite AR50 made the trip from my apartment to my trunk wrapped in a green wool blanket as I nodded nonchalantly to my neighbors.""
...
""The AmraLite AR50′s action is butter smooth. There’s no magazine on the gun and therefore no follower to get in the way. Cycling the bolt is effortless. Even after 60 rounds of dirty machine gun grade ammo the bolt moved back and forth with ease. Closing the bolt is a little stiff, but not much worse than a standard Mosin action.""
...
""The AR-50 was designed to do one thing and do it well: hit targets at extreme ranges. According to their 1999 press release, the rifle is an ' . . . economical, accurate rifle for shooters interested in the challenges of long range shooting.' And that’s all it does. It’s a highly specialized piece of equipment with limited use. But where it’s useful, it’s perfect. It’s precisely the right tool for the job: punching precision holes in far away targets.""  |-----
