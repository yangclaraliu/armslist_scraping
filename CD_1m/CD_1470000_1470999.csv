This has matching munbers and good metal. There is some wear to the stock (normal for this variety) but nothing awful and no cracks of any kind. 
7.62 x 39

I am trying to sell or trade my Marlin XL-7. The gun is very accurate and has an adjustable trigger. I've got the trigger set to about 2-3lbs and it breaks like glass. With the gun comes a Nikon Buckmaster 3-9x40 scope as well as about 18rds of 165gr. Hornady ammunition.  Synthetic stock with no scratches or markings. Barrel had been kept clean and there are no rust spots. The gun hasn't seen much time in the woods so its in like new condition. I also have a sling and stock ammo sleeve I can throw in for the right deal. I am looking for cash or handgun trades only. If interested let me know. I can send pics if interested but it looks like the pics you can find online. I can meet FTF in the Raleigh/Cary area and I have permits for handgun trades. Thanks for looking

In case you're not familiar, this rifle is based on the Pre-64 Winchester model 70 action, which is generally held by real shooters to be one of the finest rifle bolt actions ever made. It's rock-solid and designed to outlast me, you, and your kids. :)

Hogue fully overmolded stock with a solid aluminum bedding block/pillar system, free floating the barrel.

The scope is a cheap NCStar, but it's VERY high powered (10-40x!) and worked well the day I took it to the range.

It includes a Harris-type bipod (brand unknown, may be a Harris, not sure) and a really nice padded tactical (shock) sling.

The metal has been Duracoated in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) inside and out to protect from the elements, should you decide you need to shoot in foul weather.

I've only had it to the range once (got it in trade a while back), but it shot just over 1 MOA with cheap steel case FMJ ammo at 200 yards in a nasty gusting crosswind. All the reviews and range reports I've found say that it's easily sub-MOA with decent ammo. I have no reason to doubt it. I shot about 20 rounds that day and the gun functioned perfectly throughout.

The previous owner told me he had some bolt work done to it, so it's supposed to be slicker than stock. I don't have anything to compare it to, but the action is very smooth.

The trigger is adjustable. I'm not sure how it's set at the moment, but my ""finger scale"" says it feels like around 3.5 lbs with very little travel, so I'm happy.

I'm not really looking to trade, since that would defeat the purpose of ""getting rid of a few guns"", but you're welcome to offer if you have something you think I might like."

-----------------------------------
Hi, my father was the original owner and stored it in his gun safe in an air conditioned bedroom closet. He passed and left me all his guns, so I am selling some.

My Jetfire comes with two original 8 round magazines. Gun and mags are in really great condition, look hardly used at all. All original parts. See pics.

I also found an old box of .25 cal bullets, 50 count, in the gun safe. Guess how many were missing... none. Shows how much he used this gun.

Asking $450 with free insured shipping for this rare pocket pistol (FFL required), and it will be shipped in a padded metal TZ Case with combination lock (unused). 

Please contact me if interested. Thanks.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification

Called the .45 GAP (Glock Auto Pistol), this cartridge is basically a .45-caliber bullet in a 9mm-length case. Glock developed the cartridge from the ground, but a number of other firearms manufacturers now make guns chambered for this new round. Most ammunition manufacturers build .45 GAP ammunition in a variety of full-metal-jacket training loads and hollow-point defense loads.

I own a Glock 19 and the 37.  The 37 is just sweet, easy to shoot and maintain, not to mention it recoils like a 40 and its much easier to shoot. 
Very clean, almost excellent condition only shot about a hundred times.  I have taken it to the range about 3 times and I have always taken care of my baby.

I'm putting up other listings too, but here's what I have for 9mm ammo:
500 rounds of Remington 115 grain hollow point (L9MM1B)
200 rounds of Federal 115 grain hollow point (9BP) 
800 rounds of Federal 115 grain FMJ (Champion)

100 rounds of Tulammo 115 grain FMJ (steel case)
200+ spent casings that someone can just have if you're buying ammo

I'm offering it at 65 cents a round for the hollow point and 50 cents a round for the full metal jackets with a minimum of 200 rounds being purchased at a time. This price is firm and first come first serve (if the add is still up I still have some left and I'll edit the add as quickly as I can after each sale). I'm not trying to screw anyone over, but we all know you can't find any 9mm right now and we also know it's not going to get any better for a long, long time. I know this is less than the big names (who claim to be ""cheaper than dirt"") are selling it for and it's less than others are selling it for BECAUSE I don't want to screw people over. I also think it's reasonable when there aren't any shipping charges or sales tax to consider. There's no way I'd be selling ANY ammo right now if my wife wasn't making us move to New York in a month. If someone wants to buy all of it or at least a large portion of it, I'll make you a heck of a deal just because of the hassle and time you'd save me. This is all factory new ammo (except the spent casings of course). The oldest box was purchased October 10th 2012, the newest on December 12th 2012 (so don't blame me for the shortages - LOL). They've been stored at 70 degrees with 48% humidity the whole time and have not been touched since purchased, so I consider them to be brand new.

Face to face ONLY because I'm not going to deal with the hassle of shipping. 
I can drive within 25 miles of the capital to meet you if needed IF you purchase a larger portion of it, but I'd prefer somewhere near St Paul.

The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward.  The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as SHORT and compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells) for a toal of 15!!!!!.  The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.  The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.  A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser.  The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.  Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included.  The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

I will trade for mags too, preferably mil surplus but heck I will hear offers of tapcos even. I'm not trying to benefit off of this but I am not taking a hit because I don't have an ar. I don't want to waste your time so please don't waste mine. Nothing is more aggrevating then turning away offers because you think you want them and decide not too. Thanks"

... so I'm selling off all my 9mm ammo. 
I'm putting up other listings too, but here's what I have for 9mm ammo:
500 rounds of Remington 115 grain hollow point (L9MM1B)
200 rounds of Federal 115 grain hollow point (9BP) 
800 rounds of Federal 115 grain FMJ (Champion)
400 rounds of Winchester 115 grain FMJ (white box)
100 rounds of American Eagle 115 grain FMJ (AE9DP)
100 rounds of Tulammo 115 grain FMJ (steel case)
200+ spent casings that someone can just have if you're buying ammo

I'm offering it at 65 cents a round for the hollow point and 50 cents a round for the full metal jackets with a minimum of 200 rounds being purchased at a time. This price is firm and first come first serve (if the add is still up I still have some left and I'll edit the add as quickly as I can after each sale). I'm not trying to screw anyone over, but we all know you can't find any 9mm right now and we also know it's not going to get any better for a long, long time. I know this is less than the big names (who claim to be ""cheaper than dirt"") are selling it for and it's less than others are selling it for BECAUSE I don't want to screw people over. I also think it's reasonable when there aren't any shipping charges or sales tax to consider. There's no way I'd be selling ANY ammo right now if my wife wasn't making us move to New York in a month. If someone wants to buy all of it or at least a large portion of it, I'll make you a heck of a deal just because of the hassle and time you'd save me. This is all factory new ammo (except the spent casings of course). The oldest box was purchased October 10th 2012, the newest on December 12th 2012 (so don't blame me for the shortages - LOL). They've been stored at 70 degrees with 48% humidity the whole time and have not been touched since purchased, so I consider them to be brand new.

Face to face ONLY because I'm not going to deal with the hassle of shipping. 
I can drive within 25 miles of the capital to meet you if needed IF you purchase a larger portion of it, but I'd prefer somewhere near St Paul.

Two professional custom jobs have been done on this Saiga 12. One by CGW (Cadiz Gun Works) They did the modification of pistol grip and Cutts Brake on barrel. The Cutts brake really helps reduce recoil. Second is the AK Lightning Bolt and Cerakote Firearm Coating. Also, there are four 10 round tan magazines and one 5 round magazine. This is a very sweet weapon to use in 3-gun comp or handling Anger Pumkins. For self-defense with buck shot one trigger pull puts 9 30 cal shot down range. With a ten round mag you have 90 30 cal shot to deliever down range.

Ultramax ammunition represents serious quality for serious shooters. Since 1986 Ultramax has provided top of the line ammunition with a reputation for accuracy, round after round at an unequaled value. All Ultramax ammunition is loaded to SAAMI specs and a visual inspection is performed on every loaded cartridge before it leaves the building.

All Ultramax remanufactured ammunition goes through a 10-Step Quality Assurance System. Once fired brass is inspected for flaws and is washed to clear the primer pockets and flash holes from any debris. Ultramax sizes each piece of brass to the same SAAMI specs as new brass. Remanufactured ammunition is often loaded with mixed head stamped brass. This ammunition is non-corrosive in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

The G26 4th Gen was purchased December 9th and has exactly 305 rounds through it; seeing that it's a glock that means you only have about 99,695 more rounds before it might break - LOL
I have all the stuff it came with:
   the box
   the paperwork
   3 - 10 round magazines that also each have + 3 pinky extensions
   the cleaning tool
   the speed loader
   the extra grip straps to customize the grip to your hand size
I also have a few nice extras:
   7 - 15 round magazines (4 of them have never even been used!)
   4 holsters (1 outside for the range, 1 appendix, 1 tuckable 
        and 1 adjustable tuckable for 6:00 to 3:00 position
   2 magazine sleeves (one for a 15 round and one for a 17 round - I don't have any 17 round magazines, the store shipped me the wrong thing)
   an extra magazine carrier that I don't think I ever used but I may have; I'm not sure
I had a light combat grip professionally stippled on the grip which makes this little powerhouse of a gun as easy to handle and control as a G19.
All combined I have $1,296.48 invested in this 
... I'm selling it for $850.00 or best offer for all of it. 

If you buy all of it I'll thrown in the ammo for free.
If someone just wants to buy parts of this grouping, like say the 15 round magazines for example, I'm willing to consider any offers - the worst I can tell you is no thank you.

I'm obviously not trying to screw anyone over on the price, and we all know you can't find a Glock 26 Gen 4 ... good luck finding any 15 round magazines especially brand new unfired ones anytime soon. I also think it's reasonable when there aren't any shipping charges, no FFL fees to pay and no sales tax to consider. The stippling is just awesome to hold in your hand. There's no way I'd be selling this perfect gun if my wife wasn't making us move to New York in a month (her mom is real sick). I'll even throw in 45 Silver Talons (these are just like the infamous Black Talons from years ago and are thee best 9mm self defense round in my opinion - I fired 5 rounds just to feel the kick ... WOW do they kick!!!) and 50 rounds of my favorite FMJ rounds just for the heck of it. It's been stored at 70 degrees with 48% humidity when not brought out to the firing range. Once I found out we were moving to New York, I started just using my revolvers so I'd get used to carrying them again. This is a sweet gun.

Face to face ONLY because I'm not going to deal with the hassle of shipping. 
I can drive within 25 miles of the capital to meet you if needed IF you purchase a larger portion of it, but I'd prefer somewhere near St Paul.
You'll have to leave me an email because I use my cell phone for business and I'm not allowed to publish it online.

I'm also selling a bunch of 9mm ammo if you're interested."

830,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1470830,For Sale:  Vintage Leupold M8 4x Rifle Scope for $125,"new river, Jacksonville, North Carolina",$ 125,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 17, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have an original M8 (now the FX mdl) 4x powered Leupold Scope.  Good condition, has some dings, but doesn't affect the integrity of the scope.  I currently have it mounted to my Ruger Gunsite Scout but I am looking to go for another scope variant so looking to sell this one.  Its a Leupold.....meaning great glass, great customer service, great warranty.  These are somewhat hard to come by and if it doesn't sell for a decent price, I will just hold onto it.  here are some of the data/specs on the scope:

All Leupold riflescopes come with the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee. You don't even have to be the original owner. If any Leupold Golden Ring scope is found to have defects in materials or workmanship, ever, Leupold will repair or replace it for free. There is no need for a guarantee card.

The M8 line has become the FX line, but remains Leupold's fixed power, 4-star line. FX scopes offer fully coated optics. All lens surfaces receive Leupold's standard magnesium fluoride anti-reflective lens coatings, and some models receive Leupold's Multi-coat 4 lens coatings. All FX's are built with 1"" diameter main tubes made of 6061-T6 aircraft quality aluminum alloy. Standard FX riflescopes are adjusted to be parallax free at a distance of 150 yards. The coin-slot windage and elevation adjustments are of the continuous friction type and are marked in 1/2 minute of angle increments on most FX scopes. FX scopes are waterproof and fog free.

Most Leupold FX scopes are shipped with the standard Duplex reticle. This type of reticle, with heavy a crosshair that becomes a fine crosshair near the center of the field, was invented by Leupold and has since been copied by virtually all other scope manufacturers.

The FX 4x33mm is the all-around big game hunting scope. The 4x is gloss black with a Duplex reticle. It is 10.5"" long and weighs 9.3 ounces. Field of view is 24' at 100 yards. The optimum eye relief is 4"". The windage and elevation adjustment range is 80 MOA. This is a good choice for rifles chambered for all-around cartridges such as the .260 Remington, .270 Winchester, 7mm-08 Remington, .280 Remington, 7mm Remington Magnum, .308 Winchester, .30-06, and .300 Winchester Magnum. At 4x it offers all the magnification necessary for shots out to 300 yards on medium size big game animals."

For cash or For a trade up or down I can work with you (cash,ammo, accesories etc), But don't expect me to just give it to you for magic beans or some garage sale item and don't try to lower the agreed on price at the last minute.

Also I do not buy from or sell to Resellers/Amateur unlicensed dealers, So if you start with telling me how you won't make any profit or anything like that you're out. I personally can't stand these people price gouging and hijacking ammo from decent priced places for profit."
