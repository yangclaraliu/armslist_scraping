I believe this gun was purchased around 1935-45 
The Model 67 had a 27 in (690 mm) barrel with a simple post front sight and a buckhorn rear sight that was drift-adjustable for windage. When it was first introduced, the rifle could chamber .22 Short, .22 Long, or .22 Long Rifle cartridges interchangeably. The rifle featured a stock made of plain uncheckered walnut  and was a takedown design; the barreled action was easily removed by turning a screw under the stock using a penny. A composition buttplate was used.
Several variants of the Model 67 were produced. Complete original gun, no changes ever made and shoots very accurately."

This is a great gun and is crazily accurate and reliable. I have two of the ""S"" models and want a P30 with the LEM trigger. I have only put about 300 rounds through this one. It comes with 2 magazines and a Blackhawk holster. I also have the original lock if you really want it.

Early fair or carnival midway item. It is a cast iron, spring loaded mechanical target with much of the Original Paint Intact. Features two roosters and a round target on the bottom. I believe this target is attributed to the Hoffmann Co. circa early 1900's. This target is fully functional. You shoot down the two roosters, then shoot the bottom round target to reset them. Still maintains MOST of the ORIGINAL PAINT. It measures approx. 10 1/4"" x 8"" ."

I had a well known gun smith in Raleigh put his gun together and it is nasty accurate and is better than anything that I have fired from the factory. It has top of the line parts on it front to back. Not only did I put this gun together to perform flawlessly but I also put it together to look good. It is Sexy............

Are you having issues getting your consignment items back from Steve and Michael at Mid Oregon Armory in Roseburg Oregon?

I've been trying for over six weeks now with no luck. I have admittance of selling one of my guns and yet to see any money, plus those things that may or may not of sold. 

Not one mention of ""hey we're closing down our business, come get you stuff"". But instead I find out the hard way like everyone else that has personal items there... A sign on the front door that reads ""closed for a family emergency"". Look at their Facebook page, no mention of anything closing down until someone posts on their wall ""where are you, I want my guns back"". 

Maybe you are in the same boat as I am in? Steve and Michael are just stringing you along telling you that your stuff will be shipped to you, and weeks later still nothing. Contact me if you want to join me in taking action against these individuals that show no intent in following through with getting what rightfully belongs to us. 

I have email after email, text after text with either no response back to those communication attempts or empty promises of ""things will ship, I'll get you a check, things are in storage, things got mixed up during the move, I'll replace your things"", ect... 

MOA... Maybe you have come across this listing and have had the chance to read this... Stop delaying in getting your consignment clients taken care of. Return to us our items we entrusted you to sell for us, and return to us the money you have received for those items that were sold.

Most likely what has taken place here is that items have sold, money has been spent, and bankruptcy will be filed. Why else the delay to hand over what you have that belongs to others? Because you probably do not have it any longer and you're buying your time to file for bankruptcy to protect yourself from the many lawsuits that are coming down the pike for you.

new in the box beretta nano with two mags
The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

The gun ships with custom set of Redding type S dies seen in pictures with no bushings included and 50 fire formed pieces of fire formed brass with 3 firings on them. Also included is a custom Lucas bore guide made for the rifle. Accuracy in this gun is 1/2"" or less with both my hand loads and while fire forming standard 338 lapua ammo. the break works so well it kicks less than my heavy barreled .308. barrel has under 200rnds through it. always treated well and cleaned properly. gun was chambered and Duracoated by well known and professional gun smith. using a Dave Manson reamer to match the dimension of the reloading dies. the gun is in perfect shape except for a few spots that the Duracoat rubbed off while in a heavy drag bag. The Surgeon mag included has been modified to feed the improved round. If your looking for a long range rig with serious accuracy and stopping power this is the gun for you. Case life and barrel life are one of the benefits you can get with this improved 338. not to mention a big increase in velocity over a standerd .338 lapua. SCOPE AND RINGS ARE NOT INCLUDED.

Has anyone else had problems with recent batches of Federal auto match? Fired a 130 rounds of it through a marlin model 60 the other day and on the 25th shot had an explosion not a bang. Found the blown out casing in the receiver and when it was cleared it fired the next 105 rounds just fine except for one failure to properly eject at around 67 rounds or so. I have always had great luck with it until this new batch and just the one round. I called Federal and sent them pics. They say it's a gun problem. That it did not chamber the round when it fired, yet it fired 105 rounds after this one just fine. I did notice that it seemed the carbon was dirtier and grittier than earlier boxes I had gone through. Anyone else had issues or heard of issues recently? I've heard that with production at this fast a pace they are having quality issues."

Barrel Length: 16.5 inches
Weight: 3.5 pounds
Condition: New

Product Details:
Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.

Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.

positions with a full-length top rail at the 12 o’clock position. Compatible accessories such as lights, red
dot sights and lasers can be mounted for additional functionality.

The ACP brings Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) features to almost any handgun.

I'm tired of that shit, and read the posting, what I say comes with it, is what comes with it, if it doesn't a holster, there isn't a holster.  I'm tired of dealing amateurs on here.  Now, I have a Para Odnance P12 1911, it is a high cap 45 it uses the double stack magazine instead of the traditional single stack of most 1911s.  It has a 3.5 inch bull barrel, I just put in a brand new spring upgrade kit, and did a custom camo paint job with DuraCoat Firearms Finish.  The paint job was done the right way, unlike most people who don't know how to correctly apply the paint with the hardner and the clear coat.  I have three high capacity mags to go with it, two 12 round mags and one 14 round mag.  This is the perfect piece for conceal carry, you get the stopping power and reliability of the 1911, but aren't hindered by the low mag capacity and size of the G.I. and Commander 1911.  I have had it for a couple of years now and have take it to the range a total of three times, mainly just to maintain familialarity and proficency."
