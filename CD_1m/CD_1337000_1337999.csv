 Hello, if your looking at this listing chances are you know what your looking at, but for the people not familiar with this, 1911 full frame/Spain made/military issue firearm, it was the crown jewel of STAR industry. The 30MI or 30m is a true tried and proven workhorse, one of those ""I will never sell because it has a special place in my collection"". I had it for years and it has never ever jammed/misfired/not gone boom! Regardless of what ammo you put on it, 100% shot every time. Full metal body (run out of ammo hit them in the head) it has always been cleaned/lubed after use. If you dont know the history of Star, do yourself a favor and Google it ! Very rare to have one of these in the market, specialy in this shape and with 2 (original) mags and grip. 

Here are some specs and features:
The Mod30-M is a SA/DA pistol. Length of pull in single action is .098 inches; that’s right folks, under one-tenth of an inch. It’s a smooth pull, breaking at 4.41 lbs. Emptying the 15 round magazine is simpler than snapping your fingers. Keep the hammer down, and double acti. pull length is .472 inches and breaks at 7.94 lbs. Overall length is 8.07 inches, with a 4.33 inch barrel and a sighting line length of 6.3 inches. Using standard 115 grain FMJ loads, and stretching the pistol to it’s “effective rage” of 164 feet (50 meters), penetration depth of 3.94 inches was recorded in pine boards. In the interest of safety, the pistol incorporates an ambidextrous thumb safety which requires the shooter to move their hand from a firing position to physically work the safety. Additionally, the Mod30-M has a magazine safety which prevents the pistol from being fired with the magazine removed.

Assembled from left over parts after the end of WWII. This HJ knife has the original nickel plated hilt with twin slab black checkered plastic grips held with two nickel rivets. 
Centered in the front grip is the HJ red, black, and silver insigne inset between the two rivets. blade is plain and shows wear from use. 

Blade is marked Germany on the front for export law and SM/1940 on the other side . The standard black scabbard does attract a magnet and has the metal insert to hold blade and has the dimple. I believe this to be an original scabbard just marked germany for the export law. Its identical in every way to my war time scabbards. Not the rolled lip ones like the reproduction ones had. Rivets are tight and snap and keeper in good shape. Has the leather washer as well. 

This is a nice example of the real HJ knives assembled from original parts after the war for sale to soldiers still stationed over in Germany and for export as well. I have a pristine SM/1940 knife identical to this one that my uncle bought while still stationed in germany after the war and brought home in 1947. Scabbard, knife everything is the same. So this is not one of the new cheap made reproductions you find for 20 dollars.

I've bought and sold these and know what they go for online on gunauction.com, ebay, gunbroker and other sites when they do come around. Not going to sell this for 20.00s

I'm selling for 175 that includes the shipping within the US, no shipping to hawaii. Or I'll trade within wisconsin for a mosin nagant rifle, carbine would be more desired but open to a long rifle as well.

If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750 (If you want the ""Holo-sight"") If you want to save yourself $100 and have your own sight you can have it for $650.

This quality AR15 has received many positive reviews. It has never been chambered. I put the scope up there to see how it looks. Sorry the Leupold VX-1 scope and the Burris mount is NOT included. They are brand new and I do have use for them on my other rifles. However if you really want to buy them as a package, it's $300 more. UTG PRO quadrail is installed professionally. Yes it's free float. I will include the original MOE Handguard (FDE). Or you can just put FDE rail overs on it to make it look color matched :)


Reason for selling, have 3 ARs and I want a new toy to play with, e.g. an AR10, or an AK. I am not in a rush to sell this though.  Low ballers will be ignored. Trade offers such as your LCD monitors, TVs, broken pickups, unwanted furtinures...etc, will all be ignored.

It was an impulse buy a while back, and I Never got to shooting it (b/c I didn't need it and I shouldn't have bought it) - until this past weekend, I took it to the range, and Oh My God was it frustrating.  I've never dealt with such a piece of shit in all my life.  I don't know if the gun wasn't cleaned well prior to me buying it, or if its the defective mags or the ammo (as ive read online GSGs have problematic mags and are finicky with certain types of ammo)  I was shooting CCI 22lr ""quiet-22"" 40gr.  

Here's what happened: I'd charge 1 round into the chamber on a full mag, shoot, then click click (a round wouldnt fire, as the gun was not auto loading the 2nd round as it should) so I'd have to charge it manually before it would shoot. and on top of that, much of the time when I was doing the manual charging, the rounds would get bent up and would fail to feed.  SUUUPPPPERRRR FRUSTRATING.  I gave up. and I couldn't even look at the thing, much less clean it upon arriving home from the range.

Someone please take this off my hands.  I do not want to even mess with it.  This is what I get for making an impulse buy without doing Any research.  Laughable, but I thought it ""looked cool"" so I figured what the hell, cheap ammo, should be fun.  Stupid mistake.

Not saying all GSG's are flawed, or that mine even is - I just know what I went through and I want Nothing to do with it ever again.

Please do not try and Kill me on this deal, as I'm willing to eat a bit of a loss obviously, but give me some credit for at least being upfront and honest.

Last thing I'd want to do to someone is dick them over with whatever problem I've inherited with this GSG.  Hopefully someone can figure out what the deal is and restore it to good working order.

Sorry for the length of the post, thanks for looking.

Just make me an offer.  I'll obviously consider cash.  Ammo (45, 40).  guns.  Would be willing to add cash towards intriguing deals.

Again I really dont think theres anything mechanically wrong with the gun, I think theres something small thats causing the problems, or its just the ammo straight up.  Either way, I do not want to go down the path of trying to figure it out.  I'd rather cut my loses and let someone else who knows more about rifles deal with it.

I wanted to let you know about a new petition I created on We the People,  
a new feature on WhiteHouse.gov, and ask for your support. Will you add your  
name to mine?  If this petition gets 100,000 signatures by April 23, 2013,  
the White House will review it and respond!


We the People allows anyone to create and sign petitions asking the Obama  
Administration to take action on a range of issues.  If a petition gets  
enough support, the Obama Administration will issue an official response.


You can view and sign the petition here:


http://wh.gov/HOjc


Here's some more information about this petition:


Start teaching Hunters safety in public schools. Give the youth  
the proper education on firearms. Not in games or movies

If the youth is informed about the do's and don'ts of firearms  
from school they maybe less likely to imitate movies and video games. Im not  
faulting hollywood it seems more like a parenting issue that is not  
addressed. you would not have to involve actual firearms in the class. Altho  
it would be nice if it was offered as an extension to the class. The parents  
could decide if they ""the parents"" would like to accompany there  
child to the shooting portion of the class with there own firearm. I would  
assume the shooting portion would be at the parents expense. Hey the children  
may even teach there parents whom may not be educated on the proper use of  
firearms. Wouldn't think it would take much work since the classes  
already exist, i took mine after school at my grade school."

(( THE BLONDE ONE ))))

I have refinished this mosin to a honey blonde color using a wood stock from a standard mosin. Attatch a recoil pad .

The Bayonet has been cut off (was lose and wobbled badly) so you cannot use a bayonet with this rifle without changing the front sight mount from another type 53.

I paid $125 for the rifle +25 fee + $30 for the stock + $12 for the recoil pad +$25 for the materials to refinish.

please dont proceed to email me about how you can buy one for 100-150, just go buy it like a big boy then.

This is not a rip off, yes you can buy type 53 for $120-$150 but it will look like hell..thats why they are cheap, so as you can see, the work is done, and i just want what i put in.



I think my price is fair and the trade is fair as well, again, an H&R pardner single shot used is $150-$180

The bore is sharp and bright, action is smooth, wood is great, finish is good. you will not be disappointed. I receive a lot of compliments at the range on the condition.

People that have shot it cannot believe how smooth the trigger is. Features the Black rubber Pachmeyer grips. I do not have the box it was misplaced at some time. I really hate to sell it but due to arthritis and torn rotator cuff injuries can't shoot it very well any more unless from a rest. It is accurate as it can be. 2"" or less groups from a rest at 25 yards. This would be a great revolver for the guy who wants to hunt deer with a revolver. or for dedicated home protection gun.

Assembled from left over parts after the end of WWII. This HJ knife has the original nickel plated hilt with twin slab checkered plastic grips held with two nickel rivets. Centered in the front grip is the HJ red, black and silver insigne inset between the two rivets. Blade is plain and shows wear from use. But still in good shape. Has the leather washer. 

The blade is marked Germany on one side for the export law and SM/1940 on other side. The black scabbard is magnetic as originals are and this one is the same as the scabbards on my WWII issue knives. It has the liner inside and the dimple on front. No rolled stamped lip like the reproduction ones.  Also has germany stamped on it for the export law. Most of my italian carcano rifles have italy stamped on them in the same manner for export. And they are all WWII and pre WWII year dated recievers. 

Keeper and snap are in good shape, rivets on scabbard good as well. This is not a 20 dollar repro you get at a knife show or online. this is assembled from original parts and they were sold to soldiers still stationed in germany after the war and for export sales as well. My uncle gave me two youth daggers and one is an original pre war dated example and I have others in my collection. And he gave me a Sm/1940 just like this that he bought while still stationed over there after the war. 

I know what they sell for on auction sites, ebay and other places and not going to give it away and don't try and tell me its something its not. I know what it is and have done my research. I collect the originals and the ones made from original parts sold after the war ended. I have originals stamped with germany on them for export and paid alot of money for them. The germany is there because of the export law.

The USP Tactical is a civilian version of the MK23.  At roughly half the price and similar performance the USP offers superior performance and rugged reliability.  If its huge capacity and battle tested  toughness this pistol is meant for you.  The barrel is also threaded, so a silencer can be installed on this pistol.  If that is something you want, as a class 3 dealer, that's something I can help make a reality.

DoubleStar doesn't spend as much on marketing as some of the more well known brands. Spikes, Colt, Bushmaster, Windham, S&W, Sig Sauer, Daniel Defense, PSA, olympic, DPMS and Bravo Company all make fine ARs. They also spend more to promote them, so their names may be better known.

DoubleStar Corp’s Origin
Many people ask “where did DSC come from?” After 25 years of success with J&T Distributing selling black rifle parts and accessories, Teresa and Jesse Starnes (Double-Starnes’) created a full line of complete weapons to satisfy the thousands of requests to build an AR-15. The J&T Distributing customer base demanded a rifle that incorporated the versatility and quality that J&T had been providing them for so long.

Manufactured in Winchester Kentucky, DSC has continued to supply not only the commercial market but military and law enforcement forces across the world with high quality firearms they can depend on. Every rifle built uses only US made parts, and is built with precision, care, and pride. Each rifle is built, test fired... not just some rifles... all of them.


Differences in AR-15 type rifles?
Some general info provided by an FFL that specializes in black guns...
USGI and/or mil-spec.: 
Commercial parts are made by casting and stamping, which requires weaker, softer steel to do. Parts wear out faster. USGI and mil-spec are forged and milled, much harder steel. And commercial parts don’t always work with mil-spec if you need a replacement, whereas all mil-spec works with all mil-spec. 

The DoubleStar costs more, but it is all USGI, all mil-spec. The DS-4 is a rifle with flattop. It does not come with a rear sight. They do that due to differences in personal preference. 
The DS-4 Comes with magazine and manual. 

The DS-4 bolt and carrier are far superior to most commercial ARs. Many commercial AR vendors say they have a mil-spec bolt carrier... probably not completely. The DoubleStar is USGI, M16 blueprint (no others can say that), all parts x-rayed and particle tested. Carrier is internally lined for the bolt travel and has a chrome firing pin. 

Finish and machining on the DS is far superior to most all manufacturers, and they use a higher grade 7075 aluminum. Most commercial manufacturers use 6061 aluminum, substandard and not mil-spec. 

I can go on and on. Only the billet and really high dollar manufacturers can really even compare to DoubleStar… And if I was to stake my life on it, I would want it to be the DoubleStar…"
