I am throwing in 320 rounds of boxed ammo, and 124 loose. You'll also get a Pro Mag 30 round magazine. Sorry for the next comments, but realize that most of my dealings so far on Armslist have been with nut jobs. I am having a harder time with everyone becoming an expert, if you do not understand the difference between a Yugo pieced togethered SKS from Cabela's for $300.00, and a high quality all matching number Norinco/Poly SKS, then please do your actual homework before you tell me my gun is  $300.00.  The price is firm, and if you cannot provide me with a current drivers license, then move on. This will be cash only, no trades. Lastly I will not deliver nor meet, so please know where Delta Colorado is before you contact me."

Aimpoint red/green dot reflex sight. Its a cheap one but didnt know if I ld like it or not so I wasnt gonna but a 200 dollar one. But, after sighting it in it stayed put. I used it with the flip up sights up because I couldnt keep my eye in the exact posistion to keep in on target. I just dont quite got the hang of it yet I guess.

For protecting a valuable select-fire receiver, or even a semi-auto receiver that has seen a high volume of fire, these non-rotating trigger and hammer pins are a must. Anti-creep retainers keep the pins from constantly rotating during extended firing sessions and weakening the receiver walls. The 0.1555-Inch diameter option is for use with Standard Small Pin receivers with enlarged hammer and trigger pin holes. Modification II pins retain the popular original -Inchdogbone-Inch look of Generation I pins, with added strength for longevity. Not compatible with Jewell match triggers."

You have to turn the plate after each stroke of the handle.  I am only selling because I have another one of these units.  While I do have other units, I prefer my 650 for making top quality tournament grade loads OR take five minutes and adjust it to accept 3"" or 3.5"" shells and press out the perfect turkey, pheasant, duck, goose, dove or whatever other load you may need.  This will not only save you several dollars per box of ammo, but give you the satisfaction of having done it yourself.  The 650's versatility also allows you to load several boxes per hour for practicing clay target shooting!

The press is easy to use and understand, plus MEC has phenomenal customer service if you ever have a problem...they will walk you through whatever the issue is, no matter how big or small and will treat you with respect every time.

You asked and we listened. The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, v5 is perfectly adapted for end-users who plan on attaching the ever popular red dot, holographic or magnified optics to their firearm. The slick top monolithic upper receiver provides operators with valuable top rail real estate for accessories that fit their shooting needs.




Daniel Defense was always apprehensive about releasing a factory made firearm with a set or clap style gas block. Therefore the Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, v5 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

* This rifle is the incarnation of the wildly popular AR-50 chambered for the powerful 50 BMG Cartridge. A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V shaped stock. Designed to be an economical answer for the challenge of long range shooting, the AR-50A1 is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition.

Improved Modstock, appropriately named the “IMod”. Since 2002, the original Modstock has become well known and respected by Military, Law-Enforcement and sports shooters worldwide. Even though the Modstock is considered the best on the market, Vltor believed it was time for improvements. The improvements are subtle but necessary. Feedback from end users will make the IMod the choice over the competition. 

When compared to the original Modstock, the IMod series is now available to fit either the Milspec or Commercial diameter receiver extension/buffer tube. Unfortunately, the IMod will not fit both receiver extensions, so when ordering, pick the correct item and part number. 

The improvements of the IMod are as follows: Integral, but removable non-slip buttpad (color matched to stock components) 

•Rolled/angled buttpad toe with wide traction area. This will assist in running the stock high on shoulder, making the IMod system more user friendly when using web-gear and/or body armor. 
•Improved lock paddle, making it easier to operate and making the contact surface non-slip when operating the lever. 
•Removed most sharp edges that may cause “snag points” to web-gear or other vital equipment. 
•Improved strength throughout construction of the stock chassis. This will provide maximum strength during “Mortaring exercise” or unexpected impact. 
•Integral, but removable non-slip buttpad (color matched to stock components) 

Installation note: The installation of the IMod stock should only be performed by a qualified gunsmith and/or certified armorer. 

IMOD at a glance: Details 
Design Removable rubber buttpad and storage compartments. A true Modular buttstock for the AR15/M16/M4 carbine series.

Savage 93r17. Accutrigger and Bull Barrel. Only shot 15 rounds through it. I really like it but I have so many similar rimfires, I figured I would see if I could trade it for something else.

Also, I have 950 rounds or so of extra ammo to go with it (CCI, Hornady, Winchester, Federal..) It has a centerpoint 4-16x40 scope on it.. and a sling.

Why mess around with an AR15 that was built by a no body with no warranty and a big price tag.

I just decided to keep my two AK-47's because I have at least 4000 rounds of the 7.62x39 so I'll sell my only AR-15. I just like the Russian round better and it is a personal preference.

This is a heavy profile chrome moly vanadium 16"" steel barrel which has better accuracy and will hold tighter groups after repeated shots, than the lighter AR15 barrels. 

This model comes with a detachable handle, 6 position stock, and a Picatinny rail for simple optics attachment. The upper and lower receivers are machined from 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum forgings for light weight and added strength.

Comes with hard Bushmaster case and two Bushmaster 30 round mags, front detachable handle and a shoulder strap.

Also have 210 rounds of .223 ammo with additional (2) 30 round mags and (1) 40 round mag to throw in for the right deal.

Looking to trade for Glocks: G19 or G21SF or G32 (in either Gen3 or Gen4.) or a quality 1911. Will consider as partial trades other handguns as well. I like 9mm &.45 ACP.

I would prefer a good trade; but would also be OPEN to an all CASH offer for everything.

Send me an email with what you have or your reasonable CASH Offer. Any potential trades has to be in Like New Condition."

     My name is Will and I have decided to sell or trade my Ak-47 today. It is Romanian and imported by Century Arms. It is not a WASR 10 or 63. The rifle has had around 300 to 500 rounds through it. I have experienced a few stovepipes and double feeds with the rifle. I am almost positive it is due to using brand new mags. The modifications include two (2) quad rail for-ends. On is UTG I believe and the other is midwest industries. One (1) bayonet. One (1) Tapco T6 stock. I installed a retaining plate for the trigger, safety, and hammer pins. The rifle will come with four ( 4 ) 30rd mags. THE PRICE IS FIRM. If you have any questions please contact me through e-mail. Thank you for your time.

    If you are wondering about the picture along with six mags and the slide fire stock, it is due to I broke the slidefire while firing it and the feed lips on two mags. Don't waste your money on the damn thing, I used the slide fire two times. 

You are paying for the gun and four mags. 

     If you appear to be some punk kid, criminal, gangbanger, or any other form of hoodlum I will not sell to you. I am not kidding, I have sold many weapons on here and there are a lot of shady people I've ran into.

The PPS-43C is chambered in the potent and battle-proven 7.62 x 25mm Tokarev due to its highly penetrative characteristics. When there isn't a nationwide buying panic going on, This ammunition is readily available in both new production and surplus offerings. Even though derived from a folding stock SMG, this closed-bolt model is ATF approved - the stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the 14” barrel length weapon is classified as a pistol, not a SBR.

Super Fast Shipping!  Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate.  All items ship via USPS priority mail.

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.
 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits!  Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

First and best offer gets 'em all.

I have the following:

1936 S/42 German Mauser K98, Was a russian capture the finish is missing from where the russian numbers were. The receiver had a scope mounted on the side of it the holes were apparently filled up. The finish is missing there as well. The stock is israeli, but works for shooting. Aside from some cosmetic issues, this is a VERY SOLID rifle. 8mm mauser. It has a straight barrel, deep rifling and clean bore! Comes with a sling! 

Fabrique Nationale Browning 1922 pistol, .32 acp w/nazi markings. Comes with a hip holster, 50 rounds of .32acp ammo. VERY interesting shooter! 

S&W top break, .38 short revolver. The finish is gone but the gun is solid. Shoots fine. 

Caracano tipo I, which is an experimental Type of rifle that was made for the Japanese in 1938 prior to WW2's outbreak. Great piece of history! This one is sporterized and the finish is gone as well. But it is a very interesting rifle. 

I am a college student and usually away, I don't give out my phone # to random people, because the best way to contact me is email. 

I would prefer to ship to an FFL but if you are serious I would consider a face to face transaction. 

I would take a Colt or S&W 1917 revolver plus $400.00 in trade for all these.

Or Cash is king. I would prefer to not break everything up. BUT If the price is right I can. No tire kickers...(aka just looking). I'm not a gun store, just a college student liquidating an antiquated collection.

Thank you all kindly."

I accept PayPal ""gift"" payments or Postal Money Orders.
Super Fast Shipping!  Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate.  All items ship via USPS priority mail.

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.
 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits!  Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

Colt 1903 Pocket Hammerless .32 ACP Model M, Type III:  It holds 9 rounds, 8 in the magazine plus 1 in the chamber. The .32 ACP round is also known as the 7.65 mm.  

Information:
The Colt 1903 Pocket Hammerless .32 caliber (or 7.65 mm) was manufactured by Colt in Hartford, Ct from 1903 until 1945. The price of these guns varies depending on condition, features and history with provenance. This gun was one of the last issued with checkered hard rubber grips with the ""Rampant Colt"" molded into them. In 1924 the grips were changed to checkered walnut with the Colt medallions. Note: ACP is the acronym for Automatic Colt Pistol.

The name ""Pocket Hammerless"" is misleading in that the gun is not truly hammerless, the John Browning design features a concealed hammer. Humphrey Bogart used a similar gun in ""Casa Blanca"".

These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

Purchased last week because it was such a good find, and took it to the range once.  This gun shoots beautifully, and feels like a 9mm instead of a .40.  Comes with super comfortable E2 grips.  Just has too many bells and whistles for me.

**I will throw in a box of Remington Golden Saber hollow points for home defense and a 50 round box of target ammo so you have something to shoot**

Here is what Sig has to say about it:


The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

This new P226 TACPAC bundle now includes the SIG STL-900 Weapons Light with strobe feature and integrated Laser System. In addition you receive a holster specially built to fit the pistol with the STL-900 which is not available outside of the TACPAC bundle!

$1100 firm.  No FFL fees, no background check fees, or any other hidden costs.

Historically, sales of the Five-seven pistol were restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but in 2004 the new Five-seven IOM model was introduced and offered to civilian shooters for use with 5.7×28mm sporting ammunition. The IOM model incorporated several modifications to the weapon's design, such as the addition of an M1913 accessory rail, a magazine safety mechanism, and fully adjustable sights. Although offered only with sporting ammunition, the Five-seven's introduction to civilian shooters was met with strong opposition from gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign."

These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

Here are some tips on how to do that effectively and not piss everyone off.

1) Realize that a savvy buyer is going to alt+tab and check both the MSRP and current going rate of your firearm on auction sites like gunbroker, gunsamerica, etc. Your glock 19 is not going to sell for $850 just because your local gunstore has it on backorder. Be reasonable.

2) Listing your firearm as ""custom"" because you tacked on some magpul or ncstar shit you bought from your local tacticool outfit is douchey. Custom is generally accepted to mean you built or had it custom built (i.e. barrel, reciever, wildcat chambering, etc) meaning you should probably name the gunsmith that did it or your own credentials at gunsmithing.

3) Associating your firearm with ""special forces"" or ""navy seals"" or "" what they are using in afghanistan"". You are probably wrong, these outfits change weapons continually as it suits them and there is no way in hell you are going to keep up on the trends unless you are a member. Plus its just douchey. No one cares that your grip-pod has been to afghanistan. You don't need to include that in the description.

4) current pictures. It is so easy to take a picture and post it, this is self explanatory.

5) Package deals. Making the asking price of your USED gun and all the USED crap that goes with it the msrp of all those items added together is stupid. Your customer can just go buy it all new and not deal with the inconvenience of arranging a meet.

6) ""Im not necessarily looking to sell"" or ""i really dont want to sell this"" WELL THEN WHY THE HELL HAVE YOU POSTED IT FOR SALE? This is a silly tactic that is somehow supposed to communicate that you love this gun so much, you are only going to take top dollar. It is a giant turn-off to buyers unless you have some badass 24k gold plated wildcat shit made by P.O. Ackley himself. WHICH YOU DON'T. So please spare us.

7) Trades. Look up the trade values, this is self explanatory. Your M&P 15 is not worth a straight trade for an M1A ebr. Your M1A Socom is not worth a LaRue OBR. Just add in the disclaimer that you are willing to add cash on your end, or look like a retard.
