You need to research the AK-74 because it's about half the price per bullet right now. About $0.30 a round. And when people pull their head out of their @*$ and stop trying to scam you for ammo even though the ban is NOT going through, it'll be rediculously cheap. Up for sale or maybe trade, if you have something good, is a real AK74. Not an illegal bulgarian or romanian copy. The Izhmash factory in Russia makes these Saigas as sporting rifles. They are often converted to full Kalashnikov. Mine is really converted, not like the lazy ones who just convert the butstock and pistol grip and call it a day... Instead of being lazy and slapping on a rail system (because it's cheap and easy) I fitted a gas tube with upper handguard retainers, lower handguard retainer, AK74 furninture (which I refinished myself) including pistol grip, buttstock, and upper and lower handguards. Also, my saiga has the AK74 front sight with bayonet lug and an AKS-74U muzzle break. It doesn't get any better than this, not your WASR, not your bulgy copies, this is a russian AK74 in all respects. After fitting the gas tube I op checked the rifle with two 40 round magazines in about 10 seconds (including reload :)) without a hickup or defect. It is extremely accurate, even has a side rail for scope rails as a true AK should. I have about 90 rounds of 5.45 silver bear left to go with it. My price is what I paid for it plus the full conversion cost so I'm not making any money off this. If it's too expensive, buy a WASR, they're great guns if you know what to look for but they are just copies and I've had 4 of them, 2 of which had major issues in functionality and reliability (one with a crooked gas block and front sight, the other had a VERY sticky bolt that would lock back at least 5 or 6 times trying to run through one 30 round magazine)."

""The Target Grey stainless Ruger GP100 was one of our most popular double action special make up revolvers.

The GP100 has been the workhorse in Ruger's revolver line for years. When they started putting the Target Grey finish on some of their other stainless guns, several of the Lipsey's employees commented on how good it would look on a GP100. The Target Grey finish was applied by taking the stainless parts and putting them in a tumbler. This gave the stainless that darker almost titianium look. The guns came out very nice and now that Ruger doesn't do that finish anymore, it will be a great addition to any collection. ""

A Ruger Mini 14 Tactical w/ the ATI folding stock, that's had very few rounds down the barrel (less than 200), and a couple of upgrades along the way. I added the ATI full-length bottom rail, a Tech-Sights adjustable rear sight, and a Sight Mark Ultra Shot Z-Series holo-sight. Also, a friend and I crafted a muzzle brake for it out of 6061-T6 aluminum that works great. Overall there are very few signs of wear, and it is great plinking or home defense rifle, I'm just moving on to something else now.

It gives the the capacity of a much larger gun (13+1, and two mags in this case), the reliability of a hammer all in a compact, non-bulky package. I feel confident that I could defend myself and my family in the woods or in the city with this gun and a magazine full of HP rounds. One of my favorite parts of this gun is the polygonal rifling, which allows me to achieve deadly accurate groups with a compact handgun. I have two identical versions of this gun, and I'm only selling this one because my wife really prefers a revolver when hiking... there's something about the S&W Airlite that her dad gave her that I just can't convince her the wisdom of 9 more rounds, but she likes what she likes. If I could come up with some reason why I needed two I would keep it, but fortunately one of these on my hip is all I need. 

For the sake if clarity, this is a 9mm version. It is also double/single action so it can be fired with or without first cocking the hammer. It has an ambidextrous safety and a small key that can be used to secure the trigger mechanism when stored. If you are planning on using this for home defense I would not recommend using the key when it's in your bedside table, because I wouldn't want to have to fumble around with it in a stressful scenario, but that is of course your decision. 

I am selling hers which is all stock and has less cosmetic wear since she's only carried it once, but we have both shot this one at the range and it probably has about 200 rounds of Hornady HP through it with out any jams. Mine has had that plus a few hundred FMJ  and reloads without a single jam, stovepipe or misfire. The hammer on this has never failed to activate one of my reloaded primers, which I can't say is true for a certain well loved/hated striker fired pistol of mine. All in all this model is my favorite gun to carry because of the hi-cap, small size, accuracy, and hammer fired reliability and I'm really glad that I don't need to sell mine. I'm sure that you will enjoy this gun as much as I do. Thanks for your interest."

ROCHESTER, NY – American Tactical Imports is proud to introduce the FX 45 Fatboy Lightweight, exclusively from ATI. The new Fatboy LW weights only 27 ounces, making it ideal for conceal carry situations. The lightweight version is very similar to classic officers model 1911 pistol with 3.20” barrel length and an overall length of 6.89”; however, the Fatboy LW comes with an aluminum frame and a skeletonized aluminum trigger. The Fatboy Lightweight offers a double-stack magazine that holds either a 10 or 12 round capacity, in 45ACP. With its low profile rear sights and military style slide-stop and safety lock, the Fatboy Lightweight is the complete package in an officer's size 1911 model."

The first carbon fiber helmet made with our next generation helmet liner technology. Leveraging our expertise in helmet liner development and our long-standing partnership with the U.S. Military, the EXFIL™ Tactical Bump Helmet is our first complete solution for head protection in the tactical market. Using technology largely developed under an Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center program, the EXFIL™ features a hybrid sling/polymer structure impact management system that offers improved multi-impact performance. The liner also allows for superior air flow and ventilation by creating standoff between the wearer’s head and the helmet shell. Made of durable TPU, the liner is resistant to wear and environmental extremes. Designed with functionality in mind, the EXFIL™ is made of lightweight carbon fiber and is compatible with tactical communication headsets. Picatinny rails provide a wide range of attachment and positioning options, and webbing slots offer cable management. The EXFIL™ is compatible with most 3-hole NVG shrouds and mounting systems. A custom Wilcox shroud is offered as an add-on option. The helmet also comes equipped with Team Wendy’s newest retention system made with cam-lock sliders for easy and secure adjustment and a Boa® Closure System for optimized stability and fit.

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

The Benchmark for 22 Rifles – Experience the Tradition. The Ruger® 10/22® rifle is America’s favorite 22 LR rifle, with proven performance in a wide range of styles for every rimfire application. Ideally suited for informal target shooting, ""plinking,"" small game hunting and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate. With a variety of choices – from the standard 10/22 Carbine, to the tack-driving accuracy of the Target model, the 10/22 is still today’s most popular 22 rifle. It looks right, feels right, shoots right and continues to perform under heavy use - inspiring the most fanatical loyalty from its owners. With proven design, legendary reliability and the modern features demanded by today’s 22 LR shooters, these firearms are priced right to make keeping tradition affordable.

Model 11100 K10/22TD Takedown .22LR 18.5"" Stainless Steel Barrel Adjustable Sights 10 Round MGAZINE And Includes a quality Backpack-Style Case

This rifle separates into two halves for convenient transport and storage options. Barrel and forend easily separates from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need adjustment after the first reassembly. Lockup is secure and repeatable ensuring an accurate return to zero - even when receiver mounted optics are used. Shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide extra storage. Padded, single-shoulder strap. Gun features include a black synthetic stock and forearm, an 18.50 inch stainless steel barrel with six grooves and a 1:16 inch right hand rifle twist. Clear matte finish. Adjustable rear sight and gold bead front sight. Ten round rotary magazine included. Weighs 4.67 pounds and is 37 inches long when assembled with each half being less than 20.25 inches when disassembled.

 The Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America's favorite rimfire rifle by your side."
