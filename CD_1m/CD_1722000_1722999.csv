These are the people waiting in line at Walmart, Dick's Sporting goods, etc. and buying out the ammo to resell before you can get yours and actually use it as it was intended. There are some websites that I use to find ammo cheap: gunbot.net and ammoseek.com. See images for other site examples. You can search by price, caliber, etc. Just be patient. Cablea's and other places offer Federal & Remington 22LR in 500 round bricks for $20-$25 dollars but you have to check daily because they will get a big shipment in and sell out in a couple of hours. Also, Walmart and Academy Sports are starting to get regular shipments of ammo. The Sportsman's Store in Dickson has a waiting list and when they get ammo in, they will call you. They have 9mm boxes of 50 for $19 and 500 round bricks for around $22. If people keep paying $40-$50 for a $20 brick of 22lr, this cycle will continue and people will make a living reselling ammo at your expense."

I purchased this for a Silencer Co. Osprey I wanted. I Decided to go a Different route. I have fired 100 rounds though this. Recoil is very light due to the dual recoil spring. The nice crisp trigger and fine match NIGHT sights made 100yrd shots easy. (compared to my 226 combat or Glock 22) I love everything about this gun I just never get around to shooting it, so it just sits. 

The pistol is worth $1500, however it is a used gun so i am not expecting that. I will sell the pistol with out the case and take two mags out if needed. 

I am up to trades. However, I am particular.

While they are around, they are somewhat scarce. This is a blued 9 1/2 inch, 22/22mag. It was built in 1994 and has not been fired. Both cylinders have very slight turn lines but neither the cylinders or barrel have seen use. It does have a small scratch in the finish on the bottom of the pistol grip (safe accident). Sorry but I don't have the box or papers, althought I may be able to dig up a factory book (Ruger will send you one free for the asking). The well broken in western style holster is included as a package deal. This pistol looks very intimidating but really is a hoot to shoot and still cheap on ammo. Very fun and challenging on the sage rat fields. I can send more detailed photos to your e-mail. Just shoot me a message and specify what you want to see.

I have 2 sealed CCI Mini-Mag Ammo cans.  Each can contains 1600 rounds of CCI mini-mag 22lr seperated into 100 round packs.  I will only sell face-to-face with fellow law-abiding Pennsylvanians, and I reserve the right to choose the meeting place (this is non-negotiable).  Offers from people outside of PA will be ignored.  Offers asking me to ""meet you halfway"" will be ignored because offering means that you agree to meet where I choose (location in Pittston) as stated above.

Price is $160 for each can.  This amounts to $10 per 100 round sleeve.  Fair and going rate at many local shops (if they receive an order, in which case they'll let you buy 200 rounds).  I am not trying to take advantage of fellow gun owners.
Feel free to message me with any questions, thank you for your time."

What a deal on this package!! Add it up and see it is the best deal on a Sig 290 ""RS"" on Gunbroker! I will send all the relevant documentation, and the original box and manual. This is a black Nitron-coated Sig Sauer P290, with SIGLITE Night Sights. It was purchased by me after it was FACTORY REFURBISHED in 12/2012 and is rated by the Sig factory as being in EXCELLENT Condition. I put about 250 rounds through it and sent it to Sig to modify it with their upgraded ReStrike Trigger System ($155 total). Since that upgrade, it has had only about 200 more rounds through it. Included are a total of two (2) 8-round extended mags, and two (2) 6-round magazines (one of which has the upgraded finger extension). Each of the extra magazines costs $64, totaling $192. There is an unused, leather 1-mag pouch costing $35. That's $382 worth of additional goodies--not including the tax and shipping! THE P290 (""RS"") SUB-COMPACT 9MM, is Sig's newest polymer pistol. Designed to be the ultimate in conceal carry. This unique 9mm pistol is the perfect small defense handgun that meets the demands of todayâs law enforcement professionals as a backup duty gun, and responsible citizens as a conceal carry gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts.

What a deal on this package!! Add it up and see it is the best deal on a Sig 290 ""RS"" on Gunbroker! I will send all the relevant documentation, and the original box and manual. This is a black Nitron-coated Sig Sauer P290, with SIGLITE Night Sights. It was purchased by me after it was FACTORY REFURBISHED in 12/2012 and is rated by the Sig factory as being in EXCELLENT Condition. I put about 250 rounds through it and sent it to Sig to modify it with their upgraded ReStrike Trigger System ($155 total). Since that upgrade, it has had only about 200 more rounds through it. Included are a total of two (2) 8-round extended mags, and two (2) 6-round magazines (one of which has the upgraded finger extension). Each of the extra magazines costs $64, totaling $192. There is an unused, leather 1-mag pouch costing $35. That's $382 worth of additional goodies--not including the tax and shipping! THE P290 (""RS"") SUB-COMPACT 9MM, is Sig's newest polymer pistol.

Definitely better than new! I will include up to $300 in upgrades for only $190 if you wish. I've completely stripped this pistol and it is in excellent condition (>95%). There is very mild external holster-type wear on the slide-release. I personally carry a G36 and I'm proud to offer such an incomparable SD pistol. Trijicon tritium has about a 10-year useful life and the Trijicons on this pistol appear to have about 1/4 of the brightness I would expect from new ones; I will attach new ones ($120 retail) for $45. I have ALREADY performed the well described and WORK-INTENSIVE ""25-cent Trigger Job"" on this pistol (look it up on youtube!). I can also install (free install) a fantastic McNally Trigger System (see:http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=342683634 AND http://www.ghosttargets.com/mcnally_trigger_info.html) for $134; the retail is $159 and it's going to $179 in 2 months). I can also perform the popular recessing of the trigger guard where it meets the frontstrap; this allows a fuller, more comfortable grip that is higher and nearer to the bore axis, and it brings the front sight down from its falsely elevated point-of-aim to a natural position (see: http://www.defensivecarry.com/forum/defensive-carry-guns/137992-glock-trigger-guard-mod.html). Framesmiths charge $20-30 for this mod but I will do it for FREE if you desire. This G36 comes with 2 magazines. I will not sell to a person in any state that has unique restrictions (i.e. California), so check your ability to legally own this weapon before you bid!! SHIPPING: $22.50 paid by the buyer for USPS PRIORITY MAIL with insurance and Delivery Confirmation, directly to your preferred FFL-holder. ACCEPTED PAYMENTS include: PayPal, USPS Postal and other money orders, and Bank Teller's Checks; the item will be shipped to you immediately upon my receipt of this type of payment. PERSONAL checks are also accepted BUT shipment will be delayed until your check has cleared my bank. These items are for domestic sales ONLY, as firearms and parts are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

They don't make them like this anymore. This gun was made in December 1995 - not strictly speaking a pre-ban but made before they stopped using USGI parts. Originally it did not have a USGI flash hider with bayonet lug - but it does now.

Also, it was a special model (forget the exact model number) but it was refered to as the GI Collector edition. Aside from USGI parts it came with a collector quality USGI walnut stock. The pictures don't do justice as the stock has a beautiful grain to it - and perfect Defense Acceptance Stamp and P cartouches.

I do pefer a local sale in D/FW (I am in Fullerton CA). If it does not sell within a day or two I will ship. I need cash only at this time, no trades - sorry.

This M1A comes with the following for $1350:

USGI flash hider that has been national match reamed
USGI Web Sling
USGI Buttstock Cleaning Kit

This gun is 15 years old but has only had a couple of hundred rounds down the tube. It is mint. You won't find a better M1A for a better price - at least I did not.

You can read a review of this model here: GunBlast.com Review 

The DT Sport proved to be one hundred percent reliable, as expected. The carbine fed, fired, and ejected every cartridge perfectly. Accuracy was excellent, especially considering the mil-spec trigger. I do much better work with a match trigger, such as the Alexander or Timney, but this carbine is built for fighting, and the trigger is well-suited to that task. The AR-15 is a wonderful concept, and Del-Ton executes it very well. The Del-Ton rifles are built very well, and just because the DT Sport is one of the most affordable AR-15 carbines available, does not mean that it sacrifices on quality. The DT Sport has everything that you need, and nothing that you donât. It performs as well as rifles costing three times the price, and buying a basic rifle such as this leaves a lot more cash to purchase a good optic, plenty of extra magazines, and ammunition. You canât have too much ammunition. The stuff keeps well, needs no refrigeration, and several thousand rounds will fit neatly under your bed. Buy it while you still can.

458,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1722458,For Sale:  NEW PRICE! EOTech 3x Magnifier with Mount by EOTech,"Williamson County, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 425,"Listed On: Friday, June 28, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"New in Box Never Mounted

G33.STS
The new G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.


This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.


G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing.


Magnifcation Fixed: 3.25X 
Eye Relief: 2.2 in 
Field of View: 7.3 degrees 
Length: 3.9 in 
Temperature: -40 degrees to 160 degrees F

Includes all the original:
- Sig Sauer P938 Rosewood 9mm Pistol
- Sig Sauer Lock & Keys
- Sig Sauer Manual
- Sig Sauer Hard Plastic Carrying Case
- One six round magazine

AND the following Sig Sauer EXTRAS we purchased separately:
- One extended seven round magazine (still in package): like this one, but only one of them http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR4.TRC1&_nkw=P938+magazine&_sacat=0&_from=R40
- Sig Sauer OWB kydex-type holster (see photo)

From Sigs website:
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Features a NitronÂ®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame. HogueÂ® Rosewood Grips round out this package.

The MSRP for this gun is more than I am asking for this very hard to find gun with the extra mag and holster. No shipping, FFL fees, or taxes: http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p938-rosewood.aspx

Called Winchester to find the year of manufacturing and the gun I seen has a misprint for the serial number which they said was super rare the serial number is 6**30 and looks like to backwards Cs and they said they should of been zeros and if they were it would make the gun a 1998.

This generator has a pull start and electric start, runs fantastic and has seen very little use, looks like new.

According to the EPA info sticker, it was CA compliant as of 2006, so it was made some time either in 2006 or later.

884,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1722884,For Sale:  Draco AK-47,"Harris Co., Columbus, GA, Georgia",$ 850,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 5, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a nearly new Romanian ""Draco"" AK-47. Legally,these are imported as pistols,not rifles, therefore they are not bound by the regulation (usc 922r) limiting foreign made parts in assault rifles. This means that the ENTIRE weapon was made in the Romanian Cugir arsenal, where they make their military weapons, from brand new parts. Most AK's circulating in the states have been re-manufactured, by law, from a mix of foreign and US made parts. So,while this is a Romanian weapon, and even imported by Century Arms , it hasn't been cobbled together out of used,mismatched parts by the infamous ""ham-fisted chimps at CAI"", like the sometimes-questionable WASR AK's. This is ALL genuine East Block AK, the reciever,trigger,chrome-lined barrel,etc. and everything is straight,solid and very well put together.
I've added a few extras, like a Picatinny/tactical rail forend, a sling mount adapter and a high-end AK sling, a Krinkov flash hider, and a slightly larger after-market grip ( or I could put the original Bake-lite grip back on it.) I'm also including the original wood fore-grips, as well as a couple boxes of good Russian ammo.
(Now, the usual fine print: No checks, no shipping, FTF local cash sale only, purchaser MUST be over 21 and Georgia resident, with valid ID to prove it . I'm the original owner, and a 50-year-old Georgia resident with my CCW permit, so everything's good on my end. )

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non ColtÂ®-spec platforms such as the HKÂ® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FNÂ® SCARâ¢ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 NON-Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.
