Product Information
The AR-Stoner Enhanced Bolt Carrier Assembly features a fully staked gas key. The carrier body has a relief cut at the rear to allow for the installation of a carrier weight system (like the Tubb CWS). This cut eliminates the need to remove both takedown pins to slide the receivers together, the gun pivots on the front pin as normal.

Technical Information:

Ceramic:  Excellent heat resistance and provides for rapid cooling. Applied through a proprietary process that penetrates the substrate of the metal and CAN NOT be removed without removing a layer of the metal itself. The hotter it gets the slicker it gets-continues to resist fouling even during extended firing sessions."

See below for description from DD website:

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

I've only ever found 1 of these new in the store.

 This is an awesome item! Ruger came up with an innovative design to couple two magazines together. It comes with a rubber dust cover to prevent the intrusion of dirt and debris for the on deck magazine. Once the first 25rds. are used, all you have to do is remove the dust cover and flip the mag. over. As reliable as the standard BX-1 10-round Ruger rotary magazine. Stainless steel feed lips are designed to present cartridges into the action at a 30 degree angle for better feed reliability. Stainless steel, constant force spring provides feed consistency round after round. Anti-tilt follower is injection molded from a high lubricity polyacetal for consistent reliability. BX-25 X2 magazines will work with any factory original Ruger 10/22 Rifle, SR-22 Rifle, 22 Charger Pistol and 77/22 Rifle. The BX-25 will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition. 

 These are going for upwards of $145 on gunbroker.com before shipping!

When fired, the recoil impulse from the ignited cartridge drives the barrel and slide back, locked together until the bullet leaves the barrel and pressures drop to a safe level. A locking block integrated into the frame then engages a lug at the base of the chamber and drives the barrel downward, separating it from the slide and terminating any further rearward movement while the slide continues back in a straight line. The Steyr M series also has a very high grip profile which holds the barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the Steyr M more comfortable to shoot by reducing muzzle rise and allowing for faster aim recovery in rapid shooting sequence.

Hammerless and striker-fired, the Steyr M features a double action only (DAO) pre-set trigger mechanism[1] marketed as a ""Reset Action"" trigger. When the trigger is in the forward position, the firing pin spring remains lightly compressed (pre-cocked by the forward motion of the slide as it returns to battery). Pulling the trigger all the way to the back will compress the firing pin spring completely, draw the firing pin fully to the rear and position the trigger bar to release the firing pin and fire a round. The trigger travel is 4 mm (0.16 in) with a pull weight of 25 N (5.6 lbf).[3]

http://www.huntercompany.com/

This is a fully functional pistol with a 6 ½” barrel, blue finish, and cocobolo grips. It’s a cowboy pistol that’s still made in the USA - like they're supposed to be. This Heritage is both classy and functional.  

Spring is here and the wagon trains filled with .22 ammo can’t be far off.  What better way to spend a warm spring day than to take your new pistol out to the range and shoot up some cans.  In case those wagon trains are delayed, this will shoot .22 long, .22LR, .22 short, and .22 birdshot rounds.  

This is a newly manufactured steel frame pistol. This is not an aluminum frame like many of the old .22 revolvers were. Feel free to bring your own magnet and stick it to the frame. :) 

This firearm comes with the original box, all of the paperwork, and a light coat of oil from the factory still on it.   I will also include 100-rounds of .22LR ammo.  

This revolver is suitable for wearing at your side while cooking beans over a campfire, moseying down to the local saloon, or meeting Black Bart and Ned Pepper at High Noon.  

I'm not interested in shipping this firearm. FTF sale and I will need to see a permit to carry or purchase and valid ID. I will fill out transfer paperwork for my records; the paperwork is not intended to go anywhere else.

I am mostly interested in cash(due to surgery) but am willing to hear you out on partial trades for MILILARY SURPLUS FIREARMS(only Russian/German/Finnish). Would like to get a cheap shooter german luger or some mosins.

Im giving this until tomorrow and then im either selling it to the local pawn shop(They offered me $1000) or just putting it back in safe and waiting for next shooting(as terrible as that sounds)
I did not ""Screw"" people over in this panic, but now that the panic is over and people have already maxed their credit cards I am finding it hard to sell stuff that 4 months ago people would have sold their soul to get..

Anyhow, make me an offer. I am in Raleigh, I dont want to ship."

I would judge 85-90% but I will let the pictures do the talking. It also comes with the original box (not shown)
As for value, honestly I really don't know the value so I am going to say $900.00 for everything.

But lower end 229s will add cash but if its the guns listed above it won't take much to get me to deal. AR-15s by reputable manufacturer with magpul furniture and quadrails get my attention also.

Imported from Czechoslovakia and manufactured D-Technic. 
- Built on milled receiver
- 7.62x39 caliber and take all standard ammo corrosive and non-corrosive)
- Czech made cold hammer forged chrome lined barrels. 

Advantages of Sa vz. 58 over AK47 rifles (cited from Richard Rich Chris)
- All vz. 58 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK47s utilize stamped sheet metal receivers and are not as rigid as the vz.58 receiver.
- Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK47.
- The bolt of the vz. 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired – the shooter immediately knows the firearm is empty and allows for quicker reloads.
- The vz. 58 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
- The vz. 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
- The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the vz. 58. Unlike the AK safety, the vz. 58 safety can be operated by just a forefinger with the hand remaining on the pistol grip.
- vz.58 has no need for an ejection port dust cover as the receiver is completely enclosed. A cover (on the safety lever) must be used on the AK47 to prevent debris from entering the receiver through the reciprocating charging handle slot.
- The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the vz. 58.
- The vz. 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
- The alloy magazine of the vz. 58 is half the weight of the steel AK47 magazine.
- The vz. 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.

Imported from Czechoslovakia and manufactured D-Technic. 
- Built on milled receiver
- 7.62x39 caliber and take all standard ammo corrosive and non-corrosive)
- Czech made cold hammer forged chrome lined barrels. 

Advantages of Sa vz. 58 over AK47 rifles (cited from Richard Rich Chris)
- All vz. 58 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK47s utilize stamped sheet metal receivers and are not as rigid as the vz.58 receiver.
- Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK47.
- The bolt of the vz. 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired – the shooter immediately knows the firearm is empty and allows for quicker reloads.
- The vz. 58 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
- The vz. 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
- The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the vz. 58. Unlike the AK safety, the vz. 58 safety can be operated by just a forefinger with the hand remaining on the pistol grip.
- vz.58 has no need for an ejection port dust cover as the receiver is completely enclosed. A cover (on the safety lever) must be used on the AK47 to prevent debris from entering the receiver through the reciprocating charging handle slot.
- The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the vz. 58.
- The vz. 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
- The alloy magazine of the vz. 58 is half the weight of the steel AK47 magazine.
- The vz. 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.

FROM VIKING TACTICS SITE BELOW:
Unlike any sight on the market, the Revolutionary design of the Viking Sight will enhance your ability to close with and destroy the threat, day or night. The Viking Sight from Viking Tactics, Inc. features a tapered front sight that will draw you immediately to the correct aiming point. This sight is not only tapered for speed, but to help with accuracy at distance when needed. The tapered sight leads to an indestructible fiber optic that will help to drive your focus where it is needed. These sights are extremely fast. The rear sight notch has also been cut lower than normal to not only enhance speed, but to allow the shooter to see the tritium vials that have been inserted below the fiber optic. The Viking Sight will allow you to have the fine aiming point that you want and need, coupled with fiber optic to help draw your attention. If the sun goes down you are now able to use the tritium that is slightly below the fiber optic.
Tapered Front Sight; Serrated Front and Rear Sights; Fiber Optic Speed Sight; Tritium Night Sights."

 TRUE STORY: Happened Late March 2013
 Great friend in Montana was in a LGS (Local Gun Shop) chatting up the owner. In comes a woman who asks about the 12lbs (yes, TWELVE POUNDS!) of ""Reloader 19"" on the shelf for $24.95 each. She says ""I'll take all 12"". Owner asks, ""what're you reloadin'?"" ""Nothin"", she replies and blatantly professes to the owner her plans to RE-SELL the powder on some List-of-Craigs-or-other Site for $50 apiece: As if there were nothing (ethically/morally) wrong with what she was intending to do. While LEGALLY there probably isn't (supply vs. demand); the owner kindly asked the woman to ""Get The F**k Out!"" However, given a site in which the users can control the postings of others, I share this story others of us who know IT IS INHERENTLY WRONG. WE DO HAVE the OPTION and the POWER to exercise FREE MARKET by saying ""Don't even bother coming at us with that BULL$#!T""... I'm Personally Tired of browsing $300 kegs of powder to effect the feeding of $2k No-Name M-4's/AR's/AK's. $700 Glocks that've ""Been fired once"" - CONGRATS!!! It's a used Glock; here's $450 (Night-Sights, bud)...
 Now I'll just browse for posts to FLAG by GREEDY DUMBA$$ES and I challenge other like-minded shooters to do the same; before Billy-Joe-Jim-Bob becomes the next middle-man. 
We now FIGHT for our responsible rights to purchase, maintain, and bare arms at International Levels; let us do it now at the local levels as consumers: FLAG ALL the adds that are asking for way more than they're worth. There REALLY is no huge shortage; except that which has been imposed by OUR OWN greed, impatience, or lack-of-knowledge/experience/preparation. 
To Those (in or out of our sport) trying to make ""a fortune"" via (deprivation of) supply vs. (irrational) demand AND STILL calling it ""Thee 'Mercan Way!"" - ""Hope ya' don't forget which end of the gun is which, oh, and I hear '00' tastes grrreat"" KC"

(very similar to CCI AR Tactical or Mini-mags).....Gander Mtn was selling this for $55+tax/brick BEFORE the gun craze....you can NOT find it anywhere!  Gunstores sell 22LR cheap-o bulk ammo for $75/brick....this is actually good ammo that wont constantly jamb on you!

$65/brick

4 available.....all new & unopened....

This is the BEST bulk ammo you can get for your 22LR.  It will not jamb, fte, stovepipe, etc like all the cheapo stuff.  It is black copper plated round nose & feeds great!  I have personally shot 2,000+ rounds through 6 guns....stock 10/22, custom 10/22, s&w m&p 15-22, Remington 597, Ruger mark iii 22/45, and a ruger single six with ZERO PROBLEMS!!
