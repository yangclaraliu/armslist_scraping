The original nickel finish comes in at about 50% with a nice even patina. The pictures look like rust but there is no rust on this pistol. According to the serial number it is a .38 double action 2nd model. These were made between 1880 and 1884 with 115000 manufactured it has a 5 digit SN which puts it around 1882 or 3. It sports what I believe is probably original S&W walnut target stocks, they are a sound tight fit and obviously have been on the gun for a long time. The gun however does not have the adjustable sights which are very rare and didn’t come out until the third model. However the grips were available for the 2nd model. It is a very comfortable balanced revolver. The bore is immaculate as are the chambers with no corrosion or pitting present(how often do you see that!) The timing and lock up are right and tight and rock solid. The recoil plate shows very little signs of use as  does the front of the cylinder. I don’t believe this revolver has been shot much if at all in it’s 130 years of life. The mechanics on this little guy are better than many modern revolvers."

It's quite heavy and accurate. I can shoot gallon jugs at 75 yards with not much trouble. I've  only shot approximately 150-200 rounds as I have another that I typically shoot with. The firearm is cleaned after each use as any good gun owner should. Bonus: It is also legal to hunt white tail in Ohio.
FYI: ""629-1 was original and came about in 1982 or so, based on the blued model 29. starting with the 629-2E and 629-3 models in the late 80s, there was a beefed-up cylinder hand/star/and locking bolt. The -4 models had small mods (to ejector star, yoke screw, and rear sight leaf). The -5 of 1997 had a MIM hammer, firing pin in the frame, and ugly cylinder stop scar on the left side. The -6 change in 2001 added the internal lock. Most buyers want a -1 to -4 model, with the -5 and -6 models less desired.""

Looking to sell the 629-4 outright, but will consider both handguns and long guns by Kimber, Browning, Beretta, etc. Not interested in toys, but rather quality hunting and sporting items. Will not consider offers significantly below asking price.

These are built as seen in Russia by the famed Molot factory, which uses heavy RPK strength receivers, unlike their inferior Izmash built cousins, the Saiga 12.  These shotguns come from the factory in the original AK pistol grip configuration.  Saiga 12s are imported with the trigger group moved back and have to be ""converted"" in the US, and are often converted by do-it-youselfers at home.  Even some of the ""professional"" conversions are crappy and have reliability issues.  The Vepr 12s are famous for shooting all types of shells without any modifications, thanks to their improved gas system.  The Vepr 12s also have a magwell and the magazine inserts like an AR mag, instead of having to be rocked in like a standard AK.  This makes for much faster and easier mag changes.  However, this also means standard Saiga 12 mags do not work in a Vepr.  You must use a mag made for the Vepr 12.  These come with the original box, manual and one factory 5 rd mag.  I have a couple extra 12 round Vepr stick mags for $75 ea (as seen in one of the pics).  The last pic shows the difference between a converted Saiga 12 (top) and a factory built Vepr 12.

 A patented process forms the hollow point cavity in two stages. The core is pre-fluted to define the ""fault"" lines of expansion, controlling final diameter and retained weight. The second process finishes the cavity and controls the rate of expansion. Select, clean burning propellants deliver optimum velocity while ensuring consistent chamber pressures. Non corrosive CCI primers are used for highly sensitive and reliable performance, as well as nickel plated brass cases for smooth feeding and durability.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol(.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates
on a unique hybrid blow back /locked-breech system. This operation system

the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a design that holds 30
rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a
crisp single action with an over travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb
activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide
locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also
provided. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip,

60 Rounds Federal SMK Gameking 165gr. BTSP for game out to 500yds. (Same trajectory as GMM SMK)
~20 Rounds Total Hornady SST, Federal Bonded Tip
QD Bipod, All Original Boxes and Manuals

The model 12 varmint rifles are known to be the most accurate, out of the box rifles anywhere close to their price range. Gun only has 20 rounds through it. First 10 rounds were: shoot, clean, check gun. Next 6 rounds were sighting in at 50/100yds. Last 4 rounds were 0.5MOA at 200yds. I am the reason it didn't shoot better. Scope is still not 100% dialed in and needs to be if you want to hit plates at 1000yds.

Price is $900 Cash, Firm. At this price I'm giving the scope and ammo away. Serious inquiries only. First with cash in my hand gets it."

The original K-31 sling and bayonet were purchased afterward, and the bayonet is in excellent shape. Other items include a clamp on off-set scope mount (but not including the rings or scope), spare parts: extractor, band spring (for the stock band), bolt cylinder, bolt locking piece and cocking piece. If the bolt cylinder is ever replaced the head space should be carefully checked. The current one is unmarked and so is the replacement so they should be a perfect match. 80 rounds Swiss military GP-11 and 30 rounds Privi Partisan ammunition and 1 stripper clip also included.

Shoots like a dream - Invincible in durability.  Don't get out enough for birding.

OVERVIEW:

Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

KEY FEATURES:

Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable
Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces
SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54%
Our softest-shooting pump gun ever
Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics
Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably
Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels
28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes
Sling swivel studs built-in
Includes Modified Rem Choke

It shoots perfectly, 2 1/2 inch spreads from 100 yds away with open sights, and hits bulls eyes every time when sighted in with your choice of ammo.  It shoots all modern rounds I've used, the Horandy lever evolution and others.  20 inch circular barrel, nice and compact, 6 + 1mag. 

This gun is selling for around $400, and I've saw higher than $450 for the better years.  I'm asking $450 for the gun because its a good year,  well before the Remington takeover and the crap it makes now, and it's in near perfect condition. Awesome overall rifle.

This is an extremely accurate rifle. If you are looking to get into long range shooting this will do it all day long. I did the load developement on it and with my hand loads I shot .367""@200yds I am sure it will do better, that was the best I could do that day. With the gun you will also receive the load data for the gun as well as 100 rounds of my hand loads. There is approx 450 pieces of brass,  300-325 of which are ready for reloading and a set of Hornady New Dimension  F/L Dies. This gun is a blast to shoot. It has a low round count about (450-500 rounds down it) Gun is in great condition. Asking $2500.00 May be willing to trade . If you have any questions please call me at REDACTED

This gun is like new but is used, I purchased it 5 months ago and went to the range and shot a box of 20 rounds of 45LC when I 1st purchased it. Cleaned it and it has been one of the guns I carry but now that it is summer it is just to big to hide while wearing shorts and a tank top.

What a name! It's based on the fact that many judges are now carrying it into the courtroom with them - and for good reason. We know of no better self-defense firearm. Whether loading all .45s, all .410s, or alternating them in the cylinder, the Judge is the ultimate shotgun/revolver duo. With the Ultra-Lite forged alloy frame, you'll be amazed how light this gun is and how easy it is to tote around.

This item is new, we are a licensed gun shop and we received it from the manufacturer or a distributor. It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

One compact with a 3.5 Inch barrel. Has one 12 round mag, and one 10 round mag. I have less then 150 rounds through this gun. Its great for concealed carry, holds alot and easy to hide. I have carried it and suprised a couple friends with how well it hides. I put a True Glow green front sight on it, but I still have the original in the box. 
The other is a 4.2 inch barrel. Has 2 12 round mags. You can change the back of the grip to help fit your hand. It has 3 of these inserts, small, med, large. 
This gun has about 150 rounds through it. I have also carried this one a couple of times. I acctualy prefer this one to the compact, however its always nice to have a back up. 
They are both striker fire like a glock, with a double action/single action trigger. A little indicator pops up on the slide to tell you its got one chambered, thumb saftey on both sides for right and left handed operation. They shoot alot like a 1911 except that first round its double action. I got used to this quickly and very much like it. They also have a ""key"" that will lock the gun, so you cant pull the trigger or rack the slide, but you can still pop the mag in and out. Both come in original boxes. I like the guns but I need to sell for other endevors.
I also have some ammo. Not alot but a little. Asking 500 a peice but willing to take an offer if the offer is right. Money talks."

Not looking to trade for any other guns so don't offer, may trade for a nice quad though, I may seperate the gun and ammo but really would like to sell whole, thanks.
Have more pics of ammo and everything just couldn't upload them."

It's a Model 1917 (an updated 1907 with the fat grip) that lacks the model designation stamp on the side, added later in the production. Serial number is in the 240xxx range (an online lookup I found through google estimates a production date of 1920). 

Aside from normal use marks, the finish is worn in places. The worst you can see on the sides of the frame below the cocking serrations & near the muzzle. A lot of bluing remains elsewhere & the gun has been spared by the rust monster. Trigger still shows case-hardening. Armslist limits me to 3 pics but I can take plenty if you want. It looks clean for a 90+ year old working gun.

I field stripped & fired the pistol and everything seems fine EXCEPT the magazine.. I don't know if it's the factory original or bad aftermarket parts, but it does not seat well and it does not feed rounds, they just go nose up. The mag follower doesn't move smoothly, seems to be riding on a rusty bent spring. Replacement aftermarket mags are available from Triple K if one was inclined to get this old gun checked out & turn it into a plinker again. I am not a professional, and something else may be wrong with the functioning entirely, this is just my guess from handling it. In any case, the gun is ""AS IS"".
