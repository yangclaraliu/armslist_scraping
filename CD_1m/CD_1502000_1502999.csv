The old models, called a 3 screw were made from 1963 to 1973 and this one was made in 1972.  Fully adjustable rear sight, and hardwood grips. The action typical of an old model is very smooth with a great trigger pull, something you don’t find in a new model. The feel of the old model in both size and action is exactly like a colt single action but it is much more reliable. It was not sent back to the factory to have the transfer bar conversion installed. So if you carried it in a holster it should be loaded with 5 round and an empty chamber under the hammer. The bluing very good shape with no drag lines on the cylinder or holster wear on barrel or cylinder. . $450 Cash firm  Mac REDACTED"

Below is an excerpt from one of the gun writers (from Guns & Ammo I believe) about the Llama Omni III 9mm pistol back in the early 1980's.

""Back in 1982 - Llama introduced the ""ultimate"" 9mm/.45 series of pistols - the Llama Omni, it had micro ball bearings integrated into the slide so it would not wear when it cycled against the frame, along with some new innovative features for a semi-automatic pistol. This was the most original and sophisticated Llama ever designed, incorporating such unique features as ball bearings for the hammer pivot, separate drawbars for the single and double action sears, a deeply undercut trigger guard to allow high hand positioning for recoil control, a 13-round double stack magazine that tapered to a single column at the top  and ""buttressed"" rifling, which used a 2-stage ""step-down"" from the lands to the grooves, for less bullet deformation and a better gas seal  Most of these features have never been found all together in any other single design, and provide this pistol with an extremely smooth and reliable action."""

It's comfortable in the palm having a slightly larger than normal grip.  It has the elongated trigger guard that is nice w/ gloves.  It was imported by CAI here in VT.  The pistol is in very nice condition and I would rate it a 9 in dependability from what I've seen thus far.  I would say a 10 but I would need several hundred rounds through it before I'd go that far.  My price is firm.   A FFL transfer is required if purchaser is out of state.

Little being the word.  This is one of the smallest semi auto pistols made.  It is very slim and lightweight.  It comes with 2 clips and the soft case.  It has fixed sights and the safety is a very long trigger pull.  I have shot a box of rounds through the pistol w/o incident.  No jams or misfires.  Being a .32 it has a lot more punch than a .22 but I will say it's accuracy really opens up on anything past 40 ft.  At 20 ft I was able to keep a 4 inch pattern in a 5 group shot.  This would be better with a seasoned shooter.  The great thing about this pistol is it's concealability.  It will fit easily in a pocket w/o discomfort. My price is firm on this pistol.  Please don't e-mail me only to ask if it's for sale.  I will end the ad the moment I have been paid for the pistol.  A FFL transfer is required for any out of state resident.  In state folks will need to provide a copy of positive identification and sign and bill of sale.

The sight design is phenomenal. Overall gun condition is 95% or better. Under 500 rounds down the tube. The Steyr M9 are highly sought after, due their accuracy, reliability and minimum recoil. In my opinion, better than any Glock. This is by far one of the most comfortable 9mm handguns that I have ever shot. Excellent personal protection or carry firearm.

The Chiappa Model 1911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, the redesigned action utilizes a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

Treated Barrel (Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years."

Not really picky about the brand - Remington Golden Bullet, Federal Bulk Pack, Winchester M-22.  NOthing fancy required at all.

From my perspective, you will be doubling your money.  Admittedly, you might hang on longer, perhaps even do a bit better (12 cents or 15 cents), but there is the risk you will be stuck with the ammo entirely, or end up selling it for less than 0.10/round, once manufacturing catches up... and that day is coming.

Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories."

 This build is by no means ""pretty."" It's finished with high-temp engine paint. The rear-most trunnion rivet snapped off during pressing, so it's not there. This doesn't hurt function at all, it's just ugly. I've fired several hundred rounds through this gun with zero failures, whatsoever. 

I am also including around 400 rounds of Russian surplus 7N6 and 3 30 round magazines. 1 Bulgarian, 1 Tapco Bakelite, and 1 Pro-Mag. 

Again, this is NOT an Aresenal, or Black Forge... It's a garage-built AK: It's gnarly, it's bad ass, and it gets the job done. 

I am NOT interested in trades, unless it's a Glock 17 or 19 plus cash. This is NOT an OBO sale. I have a no B.S. bottom dollar.

North Side of Fort Wayne

Bought this about 3 years ago, because I just had to try a Glock. Well, I’ve tried but they just don’t fit my hands well and I hate just letting it sit in the safe. It is a great shooting pistol, has been completely reliable and accurate. I bought it used, so I do not know the actual round count, but I don’t believe it to be very many (look at the wear on the outside of barrel – not much there). I have personally only put (60) – (75) .40 rounds through it and (32) 9mm rounds. Since I have owned it, I have added the following;

-(3) Additional standard capacity magazines – LE Marked, if that matters to you.
-Trijicon “Operator” night sights. They are 2008 vintage and still have plenty of glow to them.
-Crimson Trace Grip mounted laser – Not currently installed. Works very well. Have original box and tools.
-KKM .40 to 9mm conversion barrel, bought used, previous owner claimed about one hundred rounds through it. I have put another (32) through it. It is actually for a long slide model (35?), but fits and functions just fine. I had plans to get it threaded, but never ended up doing it. 
-(2) standard capacity 9mm mags and (1) 10-round 9mm mag.

As for condition, everything looks really good except for some very light finish wear near the muzzle end of the slide and on the slide release. As far as value goes, here is what I am figuring (I could be wrong too);
-Pistol, box, (1) magazine and orig. accessories = $400 
-(3) additional magazines @ $25.00 each = $ 75.00
-Trijicon Night Sights = $100.00
-Crimson Trace grip mounted laser = $125.00
-KKM .40 to 9mm conversion barrel = $100.00
-(2) Standard capacity 9mm mags at $25.00 ea. = $50.00
-(1) 10-round capacity 9mm mag at $15.00 = $15.00

Subtotal = $865 (Prefer to sell or trade this as a package.)

I would prefer to sell but we could work out a trade on one or more of the following (in no particular order). Depending on the accessories included with your gun, the trade could be + cash on either side (as long as it is not plus much on my side). Also have some Speer Lawman ammunition I might be convinced to part with as part of a trade."

It will also come with the Henry Model Cantilever scope mount. Henry doesn't drill and tap nor do they cut scope grooves in the brass receiver of their Golden Boy, so they make and sell their own scope mount just for this rifle. The scope mount attaches to the top of the barrel by removing the rear site and bolting scope mount to top of barrel with the included screws. It's all new, it's all Henry. I intended on putting a scope on here, that's why I ordered their scope mount. I went through some pictures of Henry Golden Boys with scopes installed and found the scope that looks great on this cowboy rifle...it looks right- so I ordered it. It will likely be here after the rifle is sold. I'll put it on something else I guess. The wood is very dark and is beautiful on this rifle. I have the regular Henry, the ""blued"" .22 lever rifle and the wood on this Golden model is so much nicer. I have never had anything like this rifle; the lever action is smooth like butter, the brass gleams all over like it's made of gold...it will be hard for someone to shoot it because it is so incredible looking. It came with a velvet ""sock"" wrapped around the brass receiver, Henry shipped it that way. It's a piece of art. It's not cheap, but there's nothing else like it.
I've got $695.00 in it, with the scope mount... I want $600.00 for all of it all of it, to sell it. It is hard to find one of these right now. Henry Manufacturing experienced a Hurricane and then a fire at the plant over the last 10 months and production halted. That's made Henry .22's a little hard to get. But either way, I drove for a 5 hour round trip to get this one. Then ordered the scope mount from Henry. All total I've spent 695.00, I need 600.00 of it back or I won't sell it. I Can't believe I'm selling it, but I have to have the money. But I won't give it away. The pictures are with the Henry scope mount installed. You can see how it sits over top the receiver without touching the receiver. It's ready for a scope. The Henry box for this mount is in the picture too. I will take the mount off if you want...and put the site back on if you like. Or leave it the way it is and give you the rear site in a ziplock. However you like. Email if you want 10 or so more pictures.
The pics don't do the brass justice...not at all. It's perfect. I'll also give you 200 rounds of ammo just in case you have none."

The INTRAFUSE® Sling System makes sure you don’t have to. This sling system comes with everything needed to attach as a single point or a 2-point sling. Never leaving good enough alone, we have also enhanced some of the components in the system. We have replaced the old HK style hook adaptor with a new MASH Hook making it easier to use with gloves and allowing it to fit almost any size connector. The hook is also covered with an elastic “sock” that protects the firearm from scratches and reduces noise. It does not stop there though. We have also made sure that our sling system will work with all popular stocks, fixed and collapsible, by adding a short and long loop attachment.
