I'm getting out of the military and have no use for all of this anymore (except for the small amount I kept for myself). These supplies save countless Servicemen and local lives in Afghanistan. If some of these supplies seem ""too advanced"" for what youre looking for, its because this is a combat trama kit, not a ""ouch i scratched my knee"" kit. These are current military issued combat trauma supplies so these supplies are directed towards gunshot wounds, amputated limbs, sucking chest wounds, severed arteries, and shrapnel. Here is what I have:

 -(5) Quik Clot Combat Gauze 3in. X 4 yards (heat free/X-Ray Detectable)
 -(2) ""H"" Bandage Comprehensive Combat Dressing (compression bandage/hasty tourniquet/emergency sling)
 (1) HALO Chest Seal for sucking chest wound/torso wound
 (2) C.A.T. Tourniquets
 (1) NATO tourniquet (not new, used for instructional purposes and carried with me in Afghanistan. This tourniquet will never break...ever)
 (3) H&H Compresses Gauze 4.5in. X 4.1 yards stretched
 (3) Disposable Large Chemical Heat Pack (great used when treating for shock)

ALSO: (2) H bandages(opened and used for instruction), 1 Ace wrap(opened and used for amputated limb or ""stump wrap"" , water purification tablets, medical tape.

These products combined retail for over $375 however I would never ask tht much obviously. Mainly interested in trade values at a minimum of $300 or just $200 cash. Medical supplies come with instructions, however, expect a quick run down on how to effectively use everything here.

Violence in America and prices of firearms and ammunition are no exception.

The grand standing disingenuous, anti-gun politicians are hard at work blaming you and me for the actions of psychotic killers like Lanza in Connecticut and gang bangers in Chicago. With all it's gun laws Chicago has a homicide rate higher than much of the 3rd world and about 4 times the national rate, and they want to BLAME YOU AND YOUR RIGHTS for their homicides. I don't know about you, but I haven't gone to Chicago and killed anybody, and I'm sick of hearing that me and my rights are the reason Chicago's homicides are out of control and that my rights are to blame for some sick freak exploiting a gun free killer safety zone and murdering children. Instead of controlling guns and the millions of law abiding people who own them, how about we control, violent criminals, gang bangers and sick freaks who like to kill our kids? If they are too dangerous to own guns, explain to me again why they are wandering around loose free to kill with whatever weapon may come into their hands? 

Numerous gun bills are now threatening our second amendment rights. From Feinstein's badly crippled (but not yet dead) ""assault weapon"" ban, to bans on standard capacity magazines, wrongly called ""high capacity magazines"", to so called ""universal background checks"" that attempt to implement defacto gun registration schemes and allow the Obama administration to stop all legal gun sales at a whim simply by taking NICS offline. Think about this last threat in particular: Do you really trust the most anti-gun president in history not to abuse his power by taking NICS offline to prevent all legal firearms sales at the slightest excuse? I don't. This is the same president who, a few months ago, was claiming he had no interest in additional gun control and simply believed in ""enforcing existing law"". 

 Meanwhile, in 2010, the last year for which I could readily find data, there were 72,659 failed NICS checks. Know how many the Obama ATF referred to the Obama DOJ for prosecution for lying on form 4473 or anything else? 62. Yes, 62. Not 62%, not 6,200, not 62,000, only 62. This is not the number necessarily prosecuted. This is the total referred for prosecution. I'm not making it up, see below for proof. I couldn't make this up if I tried, I don't have that much imagination. So much for that ""enforce existing law"" thing. Why only 62 cases referred for prosecution? Because the Obama DOJ is more interested in enabling the running of guns to Mexican drug cartels to undermine your second amendment rights than they are in enforcing any existing gun laws, that's why.

 The following report backs up the above claim regarding prosecutions, or lack thereof and is a goldmine of information on what a joke the NICS system has become, everyone should bookmark it and/or download and save a copy. Remember these numbers when politicians claim they want gun control to increase public safety. IT'S A LIE. They want gun control to control law abiding people. They have no interest in even enforcing the law when it comes to criminals.

 Email your senators and reps now and tell them:

 NO MORE GUN CONTROL FOR CRIMINALS AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO IGNORE! Also tell them to allocate funding and provide incentives to school systems to implement real security including trained and armed security in schools. Without this critical step there will just be more school shootings, which endanger our children and our rights. Obama has unleashed a full frontal assault on the 2nd amendment. This gun control agenda needs to be killed decisively or he will keep trying for the next 4 years. He has only so much political capital to spend on gun control. Make him realize he's fighting a losing battle.

A donation to the NRA-ILA would not be a bad idea either. New York City mayor and ardent anti-gun (and anti - big delicious drink) activist Michael Bloomberg is throwing 12 million into anti-gun adds across the country. It takes money to combat this. There's no way around it.

Regular Magnums shoot 800 yards, this Ultra Magnum goes the full 1000
Scope and Bipod included.
This is a true 1000 yard (3000 feet, over half a mile) rifle. 
Let me begin. Exquisite is the word that describes this rifle. The checkered grip wood is so hard and has such a sheen that it looks and feels like marble.
The metal is new all over, inside and out and the rifle has detailed and elaborate factory etchings (on the metal)  ...the receiver, the bottom plate and on the bolt, all from Remington's factory and beautifully done.
The scope is a top of the line BSA Catseye model  6-24x zoom and is 50mm with specialty scope rings.
The bipod is a Harris design that has telescopic legs that operate separately. Bipod comes on and off with no tools and leaves no hardware or marks of any kind on rifle. Take it off, with no tools, and set it aside and you'll never know it was on there. Goes back on just as easy.
*Comes with 50 rounds of Remington 7mm Ultra Mag Level III Polymer tipped (Bear Killer rounds) ammo.
Let me explain the ammo options.....it comes with 50 rounds of level III. 
Remington makes 3 levels of ammo for this gun, and this gun shoots all 3. All 3 levels go to 1000 yards. But level I  isn't as destructive...it is good for white tail and coyote and Remington says it has the destructive power of a standard .270 round...but with the 1000 yard reach.
Level II is equivalent to the standard magnum and is a elk/moose/hog type round....also good to 1000 yards.
Last is the mother of all rounds...level III, yes level 3  :)  Remington says it's the Bear round and good for yes, you guessed it, 1000 yards. That means I can stand in Kentucky and kill bears in Tennessee.
The bear rounds are serious business and are about 150.00 for the 50 I'm including. Use 'em for the next 2 or 3 years on deer or elk, or save these high priced rounds and go get level I or II ammo for whitetail. Your choice.
I can't say enough about this rifle. It looks the absolute best, it shoots the farthest, it has the most versatile ammo choices...
I will travel some to sell. Email and I'll send you 30 pictures...but have 950.00 when you do, OR, I will trade, see below"

Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.
 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters."

The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.
 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters."

You will not be disappointed with this gun. Will ship as soon as we receive payment( Cashiers Check and Money Orders Only)"

I picked up some ammo but having a little buyer's remorse. I'd be able to shoot it up, but financially I think I should only be keeping about half of it. If I can't sell it off, no big deal to me. This said, I'm not going to lose money on these. I'll take 17 per box, up to 10 packs. I'm in the Willmar/Spicer area, so unless you are coming here don't bother messaging because I will NOT be delivering or shipping outside of Willmar/Spicer area.
