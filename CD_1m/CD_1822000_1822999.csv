A standard 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment. All models feature a free-floating, aluminum, M1913 quad rail and 1:7 right-hand twist bore configuration. An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded ½x28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts. All upper assemblies are shipped with a recoil buffer and action spring. These components must be installed to ensure proper function of the SIG516 upper assembly on your AR-type lower receiver."

It had a trigger problem out of the box but Benelli fixed it at the factory and it's been 100% ever since. 

It has some light marks on the stock in a couple of places, but it has never been dropped or dragged. It's been consistently cleaned and well taken care of. 

Everyone loves this gun and I'll hopefully be buying another in couple of years, I just can't afford to keep it right now.  Pics aren't great due to my camera and lack of photography skills, but it's a lovely gun I'll be sad to sell."

 My glock is almost new, I got it new earlier this month and have only put 150 rounds through it. Comes with the box and warranty paperwork, and FIVE mags, two 9 round mags , one with a flat base and one with an extended pinky grip, and three 15 round glock 22 mags. For the right trade I can also include 60 rounds of .40 and a leather holster.

 As the title says Im wanting to trade it towards a motorcycle.
 Im primarily interested in a Suzuki sv650 or a Ninja, but I would consider just about any good running sportbike 500cc's or bigger or an 800cc and up cruiser. No junk or projects, and nothing older than early 90's preferably, I've spent way to much time, money, and hassle messing with the older bikes. I can add about $1000 cash for the right bike. Not interested in dirt bikes or four wheelers or anything like that, street bikes only please.
 Id love to keep the glock too though, so if you have a good running motorcycle for the cash price let me know.
 I'm only wanting to trade towards a motorcycle, not really wanting to sell it.

If it didn’t leave the manufacturer as compliant in your state it will not be sold or shipped. Email before you bid so we can clear any issues before it causes unnecessary trouble for the both of us.

IMPORTANT READ BEFORE YOU BID!
BIDDING TERMS
NO SALES TO CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK ON ANY ITEMS . As per Gunbroker policy: by placing a bid and winning an auction, we will be charged a final value fee which is fine if you complete the transaction but quite a problem if you don’t. gunbroker does not have an easy cancellation process after you have bid, we have no other choice but to file a non-paying bidder request to get a credit for the non-payment, this process is long, drawn out and requires us to have our product off the shelf unprofitably for far too long, armslist rules do not allow us to start the application process for final value fee credit for minimum of 10 days after the auctions end. sadly we have heard just about every excuse under the sun about the ""accidental bid"" situation but the truth is that there really is no way to place an ""accidental bid"" as there are just too many steps in the bid process for this to happen. If non-payment is absolutely unavoidable for an honest reason, then only way to deal with this and keep all parties in good standing would be for the bidder to pay the final value fee that was charged to us and to pay a reasonable 5% restocking fee for keeping our product off the shelf until the process is complete.
COMMUNICATION:
 See item description below for clarification on words used to describe condition. Ask ALL your questions . Do not call the phone number with questions about auctions as this number is ONLY used for non-auction business and payments. Be warned that correspondence will require patience. Emails will be answered as soon as we can tend to them. It could be at LEAST 2 days and even longer on gun show weekends before we can get to them. We use a GunBroker email address for a very good reason, so if your computer or other individuals that access your mail identify our email address as spam/junk, then you will need to correct this in order to communicate via email.
SHIPPING:
ITEMS ARE SALE TO ANY PART OF THE  STATE. Shipping listed up above for handguns and long guns to the lower continental United States unless stated otherwise. Alaska and Hawaii are required to pay adjusted shipping rates if it is possible to ship at all. No international sales. Insurance will be additional at buyer’s expense and is strongly advised. Handguns will be shipped USPS GROUND and all other items will be shipped Fed Ex or USPS GROUND unless other arrangements are made at buyers expense. Buyer assumes all responsibility for shipping malfunctions if you choose not to insure the item. All non-gun items shipping will have a set rate in the description. Once again Alaska and Hawaii are required to pay adjusted shipping rates if it is possible to ship at all. No international sales. Tracking numbers will be provided for firearms ONLY (no tracking numbers for non-gun items) and by request ONLY through email (no phone requests). This will only be done one time so make sure your email is working and nobody on your end is loosing/deleting your email. If you desire to know when your payment arrives, for a fee at the buyers expense the post office offers delivery confirmation. If you choose to not have delivery confirmation through the post office please allow 2 weeks before inquiring about the receipt of your payment/FFL. If you use the delivery conformation this does not mean that your shipping will jump ahead of other payments that were received before yours. We are just a humble gunshop not a big automated shipping machine so we ask for your patience with shipping. Shipment of item is usually within a two to three days of payment but some days are busier than other days. Every now and then things like certain presidents being elected and political talk about gun control tend to delay shipping significantly and please don’t forget that business days of operation are Wednesday through Sunday, of which shipping is not available on Saturday and Sunday.
ITEM DESCRIPTION/CONDITION:
NO SALES TO CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK ON ANY ITEMS. Ask all questions before you bid. Listing is done by GunBroker standards ( new, used or old stock). In addition, we use NRA grading standards that use words like ""excellent, good and poor"" among others. Be familiar with the definitions of these words to understand our opinion of the items grade. NRA grading standards do not really apply to military surplus guns. We make every effort to accurately describe the condition of our military surplus item. Assume that a description with the word ""surplus"" in it is a used item. For example it may be new in box from century but still a used/issued item or maybe refinished and or new parts added for 922r legality. Pictures maybe stock photos on new or used items if they are identical models, wood grain may/will vary from one gun to the next. Pictures will not always reveal minor scuffs or scratches. Most new guns are not absolutely perfect as far as the finish goes. We are a gun shop and we do display our firearms. That being said it is likely that the advertised item has been displayed and possibly handled. New item warranties will be handled by the manufacturer and only the manufacturer. Used/consignment items are sold ""as is"" with no warranties/guarantees expressed or implied. We do not test fire new, used or consignment firearms before shipping. Description of used firearms will be based on visual inspection, not to include a complete tear down. With all used items expect wear and tear, it is not argued that unseen damage or replacement parts maybe necessary at the buyers expense. No sales to any place that this item is considered to be illegal. It is the bidder's responsibility to check your local laws before you bid.
PAYMENT:
NO SALES TO CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK ON ANY ITEMS. Payment can be done by CERTIFIED CHECK, MONEY ORDER, Paypal . DO NOT send a PERSONAL CHECK.  Payment and FFL/age verification are to be received within 10 days of the auctions close. Include your auction number and item description with your payment. It is strongly advised that you send the payment and FFL together to avoid confusion. Expect shipping delay if your check and ffl do not have the afore mentioned info on both. Age verification is necessary for non-gun items such as ammo, mag’s and accessories. Colorado residents are required to pay sales tax. Bidders must be 21 years or older to buy unless you can prove that the item is legal for you to have in your area.
FAQ/ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 we will not except or respond to lower than listed offers. 2) no 3 day inspection, all sales are final 3) if the gun is listed as used we have no idea how many rounds have been fired through it. 4) we do not end auctions early for low offers. 5) unless listed we do not know the year of production. 6) auction includes what is in the picture and description and nothing else. 7) we only accept faxed ( if legible ) or hard copy by mail of the transferring FFL's license.

If you're not familiar with Windham, look them up.  The folks that run Windham used to be Bushmaster.  When the Bushmaster name was sold the old employees started Windham.  The quality is on-par, if not better than Bushmaster and Windham has a LIFETIME warranty.
""We are so sure of the quality of our rifles that we back them up with the strongest Warranty in the industry - one that guarantees against all manufacturer's defects in material and workmanship for the Lifetime of the Firearm to the Purchaser. Additionally, this warranty is Transferable from the original Purchaser to subsequent buyers.""

For sale (or possible trade) is a Windham Weaponry SRC AR-15.  The MSRP on this model is $1,040.00
Less than 200rds down the barrel.
Comes with:
-5 Brownell's mags ~$50
-120 rounds of Herter's .223 Remington 55gr FMJ (steel case). ~$45
-Gerber Expert M light ~$150
-NcStar 4x34 P4 Sniper ~$50
-NcStar green laser ~$50
-MOE handguard and fore-grip ~$50

All told this complete package would run close to $1,500 and the condition of everything listed is practically new.  Sat in my house for most of the time.  Not a full on Safe Queen, but pretty darn close.

I am in no rush to sell (or trade) this piece, it's in wonderful condition and is perfect for home defense, plinking , or taking to the woods for a fun weekend.

Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.

I bought this rifle new, a long time ago, and used it for woodchucks.   It's never had a factory round through it... ever.  The first group fired from a new barrel measured under an inch at 100 yards, and it's been getting tighter.

It prefers a load at slightly less than maximum velocity, and it shoots best with 52 grain HP bullets, either Sierra or Berger.  It will also shoot Nosler BT's very well.  Add a bipod, and this is a woodchuck machine ready to go.

It comes with the cases prepped for it and whatever I have loaded for it.  It's favorite load recipe is as shown.

My woodchuck shooting is closer ranged now, and I don't spend days tramping the big fields anymore, so it's up for sale.   I hope the buyer treats her well, because she's a SHOOTER!

FTF In the Lancaster area, and serious buyers may shoot her at my local range to try it out.   I don't wish to ship it."

 This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
 Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** Hogue® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil.

This gun was purchased new in March 2013.  Since then I have put somewhere around 1000 flawless rounds through it (did not keep an exact count).  It has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  It does have an idiot scratch (my first 1911) and faint stain in the checkering on the housing.

Offering at $2200 (last price drop before deciding if I want to list on gunbroker) which is a $700 savings over pricing for a new Executive Target either directly from Ed Brown or from other online sellers/auctions (possibly more if you include potential costs for shipping, FFL, CC fees, taxes).

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  

The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

The pictures are very recent, taken specifically for this ad.

 This load was designed for those who need a deep penetrating 357 mag. or 38 SPL load to be fired from lightweight alloy 357’s and any 38 SPL revolver. Lightweight alloy 357’s develop multiple problems when firing our 180gr. 357 mag. hard cast turbo charged (Item 19A) ammo or any make of full power 357 ammo. Yet many folks want a deep penetrating “outdoor” type of load for their lightweight pocket 357’s, so here it is. Whether you are shooting gators or bears in the head, this load utilizes a hard flat nosed bullet, at sufficient velocity, even from 2 inch barrels, to fully penetrate either.

This load is safe to shoot in all 38SPL and 357 magnum firearms of modern design that are in normal operating condition. In the super lightweight alloy revolvers (around 11-12 oz.) the bullet will not jump crimp under recoil provided you do not subject an unfired round to more than 5 or 6 firings. In all steel guns, even short barreled ones, crimp jump is not an issue as the all steel snub nosed revolvers are much heavier than the alloy versions.

This load utilizes a flash retardant powder that will not blind the shooter in low light conditions, which is important as wildlife and criminals get much more active when darkness comes.

This bullet is hard cast and properly lubed and as such will not substantially lead your barrel. You should find no degradation of accuracy when firing many cylinders full of this ammo without cleaning."

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"
