Up for sale/trade is a pre-lawsuit GSG-5PK imported through American Tactical Imports.

If you don't know about this lawsuit what happened was Heckler & Koch sued German Sport Guns and ATI because their line of GSGs were practically exact clones of the H&K MP5 (just in .22LR). H&K won the lawsuit and GSG was forced to alter all of their new guns quite a bit, making it highly apparent they were not H&K MP5s. However, this gun released before the lawsuit is unaffected, and a .22LR virtual clone of the H&K MP5PK. 

This pistol has had all internal screws upgraded/replaced with a popular kit available online, and it comes with two brand new magazines that have only been test-fired once!

There are seven magazines total - 6 of which hold 22 rounds, & 1 is the 10rd pistol mag
The three magazines on the right side of the picture showing them need a little TLC (they load and fire, but sometimes stick - most likely a spring issue?), but the other 4 magazines work great and two of them are basically brand new.

The pistol also comes with a detachable compensator and a GSG tool.

This package comes from the factory set up like this, not mix and match. Can buy it online at http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/69998, but out-of-stock right now. Avoid the shipping, FFL transfer fee, and wait; buy and inspect this like-new M&P in person!

Asking $560 cash FTF.

I do a lot of buying and selling locally, all successful transactions, references available upon request. Deal with confidence!

If you don't know about Rock River Arms, you should because after outperforming 10 other manufacturers in rifle abuse tests, Rock River Arms was awarded a contract with the Drug Enforcement Administration for a minimum of 5,000 LAR-15 rifles.

And keep in mind these prices are when the pieces are available, because Rock River Arms has an indefinite backorder time right now...

This rifle also comes equipped with the Wylde Chamber, which was designed as a match chambering for semi-automatic rifles. It will accommodate both .223 Rem and 5.56mm NATO ammunition. It is relieved in the case body to aid in extraction and features a shorter throat for improved accuracy. 

So if you have been looking for a high quality AR-15 at a reasonable price here it is! 

Just let me know if you have any questions..."

723,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1713723,For Sale:  Kahr CM9,"Miami, OK, Oklahoma, United States",$ 429,"Listed On: Monday, September 23, 2013",Handguns,Kahr                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

this is a single/double action, 8+1 capacity, 380 auto, compact pistol.
it has ambidextrous safety lever and mag release.  great first gun and yes it will conceal fairly easily.
  I am the 2nd owner and purchased it from one of my best friends who is a police officer.  Between the two owners, it has successfully fired 1,500-2,000 rounds without any malfunctions.  so far has been a great gun,  easy to rack, easy to load and easy to shoot.  
 it was just recently serviced at Ram Arms in durham nc: it was given an ultrasonic bath and had the springs on the safety lever strengthened to prevent accidental engagement of the safety while operating the slide.  since then i've greased all the factory recommended spots and oiled the barrel for storage.

i will consider some trade value if you have any fmj 9mm target load, but i can't pay/negotiate the ""post sandy hook"" inflated price, as i am not inflating my cost on ammo.
  i'll only sell to north carolina residents with a valid i.d. AND a valid cwp, or handgun permit.  i work in durham and live in chapel hill, so anywhere in between the two is fine for a meeting spot.  i'll do an ffl if you don't mind paying the fee.

Matching Upper and Lower- No Slop whatsoever!

This thing is lean and mean and made for using... If you want one to ""pimp"" out, Look at, and store in a safe- Buy a Colt... you're not going to shoot it anyway???

But if you want one to shoot your backyard deer, plug a Zombie between the eyes, or just scare the neighbors with a 30 round salute in the middle of the night... then this is it. 

The Ugly Truths:

*A True 14.5 inch barrel with pinned front to make it Legal (a hair over 16 inches)- Can be Un-Pinned and Flash hidden

*Ejection Port Cover
*Forward Assist
*M4 Feed ramps
*Chrome Lined
*M203 Grenade Launcher Cut-out
*Fixed Carry Handle

***  ""MPI""  FULL-AUTO BCG  ***  (Carrier and Bolt- the extra weight makes it close super solid plus it's one step closer to ""Rockin' and Rollin') 

*Brand New (the BCG)
*Titanium firing pin/ Titanium Bolt ""rings""
*Phosphate Coated (Bolt and Carrier)
*Proper Staking of the gas key screws

*6 Position Stock- Commercial Spec (Com-Spec is a little beefier than Mil-Spec)
*Carbine Length Hand Guard 
*Bottom Rail (room for grip, lights, and Lasers- but who needs those??? IT'S AN ASSAULT RIFLE!!  for heaven's sake)
*Vertical Grip

*SightMark .223/5.56 Laser Bore Sighter IS included- Rifle is already dialed in though..
*2 30 round and 1 10 round (original BM Magazine) The 2 30's will be Full so you get 60 rounds on me...
*Original BM case made by KolPin

Columbus/Harris Co., Columbus, GA, Georgia",$ 800,"Listed On: Monday, June 3, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"For sale is a nearly new Romanian ""Draco"" AK-47. Legally,these are imported as pistols,not rifles, therefore they are not bound by the regulation (usc 922r) limiting foreign made parts in assault rifles. This means that the ENTIRE weapon was made in the Romanian Cugir arsenal, where they make their military weapons. Most AK's circulating in the states have been re-manufactured, by law, from a mix of foreign and US made parts. So,while this is a Romanian weapon, and even imported by Century Arms , it hasn't been cobbled together out of mismatched parts by the infamous ""ham-fisted chimps at CAI"", like the sometimes-questionable WASR AK's. This is ALL genuine East Block AK, the reciever,trigger,chrome-lined barrel,etc. and everything is straight,solid and very well put together.
I've added a few extras, like a Picatinny/tactical rail forend, a sling mount adapter and a very nice sling, a Krinkov flash hider, and a slightly larger after-market grip ( or I could put the original Bake-lite grip back on it.) I'm also including the original wood grips, as well as a couple boxes of good Russian ammo.
(Now, the usual fine print: No checks, no shipping, FTF local cash sale only, purchaser MUST be over 21 and Georgia resident, with valid ID to prove it. Fortunately,everyone I've met on Armslist and Craigslist have been real solid folks, but if I get any sketchy/thug/criminal vibes, I'm just walking away. I'm the original purchaser, and a 50-year old Georgia resident with my CCW permit, so all my ducks are in a row here, and I don't need any headaches. )
Thanks..........M."

More pictures available on request. Looks to be fired very little. Below is original specs. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. Variant 1 Double action/single action with ""SAFE position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame.
