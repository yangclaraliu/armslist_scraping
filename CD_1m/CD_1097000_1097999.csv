If you really feel the need to pay almost three times what this less than awesome rifle lists from Sturm Ruger right now, feel free to blow your hard earned cash in any way that you like.

Ammunition is also available, but if you search around here you would think that we are in fact surviving the end of days right now. $1.00/ round for .223? Are these people on drugs? 
Look around you right now. If you or your friends are trying to find a decent rifle at a price that won't break the bank, wait for a couple more weeks. Half of the people that snapped up the so-called assault weapons are really liberals that saw the same opportunity as those in 1994: A sudden appreciation of investment that was guaranteed to more than double the up front investment. Do you really want to line that scum sucking parasite's pocket with your money? Think it over, you know I am right. The same story applies to the assholes that wipe an entire shelf of rimfire ammunition into a shopping cart when it comes in, do you want to reward that kind of behavior?

For those preferring a holster without a thumb break, the Skin Guard allows for a faster draw. It is a cousin to the Bare Skin. This leather gun holster is also a high ride two slot holster. It features a skin guard, hence the name, which prevents the slide, hammer and sight from wearer contact. It has double stitched seams, 15 degree forward cant, a covered trigger guard, open muzzle design and a tension screw for adjustment of the draw. The recommended carry positions to wear this holster are 3,4,5. The material is produced exclusively for High Noon Holsters and is made of a specially extruded Laminate Skin with a vegetable tanned leather backing. It features a leather-like grain texture. With its sleek, stylish good looks, super tough, low-maintenance finish, steel-like strength that resists abrasion, nicks ,scuffs and is fade resistant to maintain its sleek look through years of use and abuse, its a great choice for concealed carry. It is also exceptionally easy to clean and maintain. It is made to fit up to a 1-3/4"" belt {1-1/2"" is optimum} and is available in black finish only.

Model number is NP1-P18

This is a Remington 870 clone, manufactured for NEF (who is now owned by Remington coincidentally). In my opinion, the quality of this gun is superior to that of the current generation Remington 870 Express guns, of which it is a copy.

Gun does show some minor wear from racking and storage, but it is the kind of thing that you'd expect to see after a week or two of use. I was told the gun is unfired when I bought it, and believe that to be the case (I have not fired it since I purchased it). My best guess is that it was purchased, unboxed, and loaded and stuck in a corner until I bought it.

This is an ideal home defense gun, esp for someone on a budget. It's even factory drilled and tapped to accept a scope or red-dot sight, so you could even use it for hunting if you were so inclined.

Price is firm."

The Miami Classic is quite possibly the most imitated shoulder holster system in the world. A direct descendant of the original shoulder system first introduced by Galco in 1970 (then the Famous Jackass Leather Company), the Miami Classic has since become the favorite of professionals worldwide. 

A key component of this patented shoulder system is its spider harness. All four points of the spider harness pivot independently and are connected by our unique clover shaped Flexalon swivel back plate, which is a Galco trademark. This results in a perfect fit and lasting comfort for all sizes and shapes.

This system is constructed of premium saddle leather and includes holster, harness, ammo carrier and a set of system screws. The Miami Classic is fully modular. Optional accessories and components may be purchased separately.

You are looking at a Remington 700 that I set up last October to do some hog hunting with. It is the heavy barrel version. Comes with a Nikon BuckMasters BDC 6-18x scope, a sling, a Harris bi-pod and a Pelican case to transport it it. Everything is new, set up and I have only put about 150 rounds thru it. I have decided I still prefer to hunt hogs with my M14 so I have no real use for this rifle. So, I will sell it lock stock and barrel for $950.00 All rules apply, you must be legally able to own this fine rifle and must present your FOID card. Additionally, you must sign a bill of sale. Sorry, not into trading for trinkets...no Iphones, car alarms or other ""stuff"" like that."

It also has one tiny spot of rust on the piston housing tube. Could replace the tube for 20 bucks or just buff it out.
The rifle comes in a cheap plastic case with (2)  5 rnd mags and (2) 40 rnd mags (which are selling for $100 each on here and gunbroker)
Has a polished feed ramp and 20""chrome lined barrel.
This is one of the most accurate ak47's you'll ever shhot and own!
These are getting hard to find and when you do fetch a pretty penny! People love to turn these into galil clones because actual galils will run you $3k!
The conversions are simple, and all you have to do is move the trigger forward and than change the forend and stock.

Wood is in good condition, blueing on the barrel is also in good shape, but most of the blueing on the receiver is worn, but that's typical of the pre-64's that have not been stored in a safe most of it's life. $500 is the asking price and for that, this rifle is in great condition. I bought a copy of a manual for the Winchester 94 that will be included along with a box and 1/2 of ammo.

(at the start his career, Uberti had a partner for the first 4 years, after which he bought out and went on his own)  This reproduction is a top quality piece, built in 1962. It is said that all the parts and assembly were done by hand in the earliest years of Uberti's career.   It has been extremely well cared for, and looks to be in 98% condition.  I have searched for and found all the makers marks on this gun.  They are as follows:

The top of the octagonal barrel reads ""Navy Arms Co. Ridgefield NJ - Italy
The bottom of the barrel reads ""Gregorelli & Iberti Gardone VT-Italy"" Just before that are two marks, the first appears to be shield shaped, with a star inside a squiggly circle. The second is PN with the same star in a squiggly circle over it
On the right side of the frame, there is same PN and Shield both with the same star inside a squiggly circle. Then there is XVIII
Under the left grip is ""83""
Under the trigger guard is ""83""
On the loading level is ""83""
On the front of the cylinder is PN
The serial number on the bottom of the butt is 2919

This revolver came from a collection that I am currently liquidating.  All of the firearms from this collection are in excellent condition, as the owner took superb care of them.  Many are so well cared for, even a trained gunsmith could not determine if they had actually been fired or not.  This one appears to have been fired a few times, but not all to many.  This replica is over 50 years old!  If you have any questions, email me and I'll do my best to answer them.  If you'd like pictures other than those posted here, just let me know and I can take pics from any angle desired.  $250 Cash only, no trades

All meetings to view or purchase this Revolver will ONLY take place at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming, off GA400 exit 13.  Please do not bother to email and ask me to meet elsewhere as I will not respond.  Also, the reason I list a price is that is what I am selling it for.  Don't email and ask me ""what is your best price"" as I can tell you now, my price is what you see here.  Also, if the ad is up, it's still for sale."

This is the next Gen to the FNP tactical 45...It's the flat dark earth model with extended barrel and thread protector. Anyone who has seen or heard of this gun knows that ""incredibly badass"" doesn't even begin to describe it! The High-profile Combat night sights are dead on at 20 yrds and all controls including safety decocker, mag-release and slide release are all ambidextrous, for all you lefty's out there! This gun is essentially brand-new. I purchased it new less than 2 months ago and it has seen exactly 150 rounds down the pipe. The Tac-45 comes with all paperwork / test fired shell casings,and 4 interchangeable backstraps. It also comes with a very nice soft modular case from the factory and 3 x 16 round magazines for a total capacity of an incredible 17 rounds in 45acp!! It also comes with mounting plates for a ( optional ) trijicon or doctors mini red-dot that will co-witness with the rear (yellow night-sights) and front (green night-sight). The color break-up in the sights makes for a nice contrast and in my opinion...quicker target acquisition. This gun has EVERYTHING...and by the way, it's very smooth and very very accurate! It absolutely screams tactical, and can be carried ( cocked & locked ) If you have been wanting this gun then now is your chance because they are next to impossible to get a hold of! It is on the large and heavy side of the spectrum...just so you know! Asking $1375....which is still $75 less than what I paid! Thanks for looking, no trades please...."

The Ottomans placed their first order with Waffenfabrik Mauser for 500,000 rifles and 50,000 carbines patterned after the Gewehr 71/84 bolt action rifle. This black powder rifle was chambered for the 9.5x60R military round. The rifle held 8 rounds in the tubular magazine. The Ottomans eventually made the switch to smokeless powder after accepting 270,000 of these rifles and the remainder of the contract was filled with the Model of 1890.

This is a rare rifle and in good condition.  Made for the Turkish army in the late 1800's.  It is the last black powder rifle made by Mauser before turning to the smokeless 8mm rounds.  It is missing the nose cap and the cleaning rod.  The barrel is in good shape as well as the bolt.  The bolt is miss matched.  It fires the 9.5x60mm round.  It would be a great piece to any collection.

703,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1097703,For Sale:  Winchester 1873 First Model - Collectors Item,"Mesquite/Balch Springs, Dallas, Texas","$ 3,000","Listed On: Monday, March 11, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Gun: Winchester 1873 Carbine in .44-40

Appraised Value:  $6,500 to $7,000 and possibly up to $8,500

History:  The Winchester 1873 was the most popular lever action repeating rifle made in America.  Introduced in 1873 and produced through 1919, there were over 720,000 guns made.  There were three Models of the 1873, with only minor differences except for the dust cover.  This particular gun has serial # 22741, placing production in late 1876 and making it a First Model.  This 1873 carbine has a 20” round barrel, barrel bands and is a 44 WCF (.44-40) caliber.  The gun is rated between fair and good condition.  The barrel metal retains about 50% original bluing, the surface is pitted in 2 places and the worn but lettering is readable.  The receiver is also worn with less than 10% bluing as patina with most on the rear receiver and finger lever.   The wood is in good condition, without cracks but with a number of handling marks down both sides of forearm and stock.  The stock has the correct carbine metal butt plate with trap door.  Dust cover and cleaning rod are missing.  The correct original front and rear non-adjustable leaf sights are still on the gun with the latter having graduations from 100-300 yards. Bore is in good shape with 75% rifling.  Overall, this gun looks all original and would fall somewhere near good condition (by NRA Standards).  In 2013, the retail value of this carbine would lie somewhere between $6500 and $7,000.  The value of the rifle could go to $8,500 for the age and caliber, depending on the buyer.

Alloy frame, with stainless cylinder and barrel
The upper part of the frame, as the photos show, shield the hammer; but still exposes its cleat-serrated hammer spur enough to produce a cocking motion for precise single action firing. The lightweight stainless variant of the Airweight Bodyguard, the 638, was introduced as a limited run in 1989, then added as a regular part of the Smith & Wesson line in 1996, when Smith & Wesson beefed up the J-frame sufficiently for it to handle High Performance +P ammunition. This third, current variant of the 638 has a .312 MIM Metal-injected-Molded .312 smooth combat trigger and MIM flat-faced hammer with floating firing pin. All S&W Revolvers have an internal transfer bar safety that prevents accidental firing if a loaded weapon is dropped, and in 2002, the 638-3 entered the market with Smith & Wesson's patented internal lock. Barrel length is 1 7/8 inches, and this 5 shot pocket revolver only weighs 14 5/8 ounces empty."

With a drift adjustable style rear sights, the finish of the Tactical version is matte blue. The Citadel M-1911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The Citadel M-1911 .22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Citadel M-1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring Hogue grips. The G.I. Model has all the same features along with G.I. style hammer, sites… all the way down to the lanyard loop.

The subject of this review is my own Bushmaster XM-15-E2S that was made in Windham, (I got mine!). It is an A3 model with an A2 style fixed buttstock, handle sight, 20 inch heavy barrel with 1 turn in 9 inch twist rifling, bayonet lug, birdcage flash suppressor and it came with a 30 round magazine.
This Bushmaster rifle is chambered for .223 Remington and 5.56mm NATO rounds and is marked as such, so both may be safely used. I don't recommend that these rounds be used interchangeably in any firearm that is not specifically marked for both. There are many that believe that the .223 Remington and the 5.56mm NATO round are the same but in fact they are not. According to Small Arms Manufacturers Institute, Inc, (SAAMI), it is unsafe to fire 5.56mm NATO rounds in firearms chambered for .223 Remington. If you do a little Google searching around the Internet you can find the technical information related to that subject if it interests you. Be careful and only use the ammunition your firearm is designed to fire safely."

Am I a bad enough dude to buy some brass?

Do I really think I can handle the sheer awesomeness that is a cardboard box full of raw heart-throbbing (admittedly, fired) 223? Can these little guys pack a punch? You betcha. Can they blow a hole the size of my massive ego into whatever's downrange? Oh yes.

Do I wish I had some brass? Absolutely.

You know you want it. I know you want it. Go ahead, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.

Did I count up these suckers? Hell yeah I can count -- but only up to 722. Fortunately, that's the exact number of empty shells I have. I tried to count up the other miscellaneous empties I have lying around, but 722 is my limit. Pick up these, the rest are yours if you want 'em -- and you can take that to the bank.

Though, in retrospect, taking firearm components, even empty brass, to the bank may not be the wisest plan. Don't do that. Laugh all the way home on the great deal you got on some honest-to-god once-fired reloading supplies!

The pistol comes with the factory case and two factory mags. It has less then 100 rounds though the pistol and no rounds since i have done some work to it. So in saying that the pistol is not completely factory but i have not gone crazy with it yet.
MODIFICATIONS:
1.Trigger job (used factory parts),. 4&1/2 lb (can be tuned to 4lbs)
2.Fit & instal C&S short match trigger
3.Bevel magwell to match external mag well, Polish mag well on frame.
4.Custom fit Guide rod and high polish.
5.Fine sanding and polishing: barrel, guide rod external mag well, Hammer
6.Purchase and fit S&W M.S housing and magwell.
7.Reliability package(includes: Polish feed ramp and barrel chamber, Stoned Rails and deburr, etc.)
8. Brand new Crimson Trace grips

Factory the pistol had a 6lb spongy trigger pull, sloppy trigger, Slide rack was gritty and all the unsatisfactory issues that a mass produced gun has. It also had a few small light scratches which i blended.

Normal charge for the work done is $450 including parts but not including the new grips.  This pistol does not come with any holsters or any other accessories. Just the factory case and two S&W 8 round mags.

The pistol is for sale only now with the new grips. I found a truck that i need so i need to sell this pistol asap. PRICE IS $1450 FIRM. Do not bother offering less because i will not respond. You can not buy this pistol and have the work done cheaper then what i am selling it for unless you find someone desperate enough to sell the same gun for half the price stock then pay to have the work done. Crimson grips are right on target and will shoot unbelievable groups. I do good work and do not do half A$$ work. Non stainless parts have not been re- painted but if you buy it and want the black parts painted in (combat black, tactical black, Dark earth, Stainless or OD green i will paint them for 50$ more. Any other mods can be done as well but original price will have to be paid first and a bill of sale with contract stating what work will be done. Contact me for any other work you would want done or text me. Or if you want it like it is.

New price of stock pistol is 900-1100$ Pistol now has less then 150 rounds. Less then 50 since modifications to test and zero. Shoots great and target pic is 3 mags with no misses from 7 yards and 10 yards standing. NO REST USED!"
