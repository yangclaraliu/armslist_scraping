If you haven't tried one out you really should. I've put a box of 2 3/4 00 thru her and it really isn't bad as far as kick. Granted a 2 3/4 inch isn't the same as 3 1/2 Turkey loads, but if you've got to empty that many shells on a bird you probably hadn't ought to be hunting Turkey anyhow.

There are plenty of accessories out there for these things, and mags are not that hard to find.  You can even go back to the green stock if you wanted.  There is a Nato version stock available that takes AR mags.    I bought this rifle new from Ratworx this past fall.  I still have the box it shipped in.

The model 86 is also chambered for the .380 ACP (9 mm Short) cartridge, but differs significantly from other models in the series, because it has a redesigned front end with a tip-up barrel that hinges at the muzzle to open the breech. This allows the shooter to load a cartridge directly into the chamber and not have to operate the slide.

Original Case included, The magazines have Kel Tec brand pinky extensions to get a better grip on the weapon without adding much more bulk. Kel Tec has a lifetime warrenty and I have never had a failure. It was cleaned prior to shooting initially and after every range trip, as well as once a month from being carried. The slide has minimal wear from a holster and this gun is in great shape. It's small enough to fit in a cargo pocket or carry inside the waistband and not even know it's there.

In case you were wondering about the paint, I have painted it similar to the weapons I used in overseas combat in iraq. I served as a medic for a scout/sniper reconplatoon the paint on the weapons serves two main purposes. 1) an all black weapon allows someone to use the black weapon slung across your body as a perfect measurement reference for range estimation. 2) basic camouflage purposes, a painted weapon blends better in the environment, essentially makes it harder for the enemy to acquire you in their optic as a potential target.

Self-Lubricating Surface Treatment Provides Smooth, Reliable Function

Drop-in bolt has a self-lubricating surface that eliminates the need to apply oil or grease that can attract dirt, dust, unburned powder, and carbon and lead to cycling failures. Proprietary EXO treatment produces an exceptionally hard surface that’s 40% more wear resistant than chrome plating, with an ultra-low friction coefficient. Surface is actually harder than the substrate underneath and will not peel, flake, gall, or rub off. EXO-Treated Nickel Boron finish bolt/carrier groups have been tested to function reliably without additional lubrication up to 50,000 rounds. Reduced friction also means less heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer. Easy to clean, too—fouling brushes right off. Before treatment, parts are shot peened for surface uniformity and magnetic particle inspected to make sure there are no hidden flaws. Bolt includes extractor, ejector, and gas rings installed."

Please read the whole ad before emailing me with any questions. Please don't email me just to ask if they are still for sale, if I will take less, or without including a phone number. If they are still listed up for sale - then they are still up for sale. The price listed is firm, and that is the bottom dollar. If interested and serious please include a phone number to contact you on. Price is $35 per box for only 1 or 2 boxes, 3 for $100, or all 5 for $150.

These are a good quality and accurate ammo that makes a great affordable choice to test how reliably a gun will feed hollow point self defense ammo, and also to be able to practice with the same rounds you carry, at only $30 per box of 50. Thats about half the price compared to the usual $25 for a box of only 20 rounds that most self ammo of this type normally costs.

This is not Interarms or Smith & Wesson. There is a tiny import mark (the smallest i've ever seen, I didn't notice it until after I had the pistol a while) on the right side front of the slide that says CDI Swanton VT (it is barely visible in one of the pictures below).

Cosmetically it is good on the right side and very good on the left side (mostly holster and handling wear).

The action is perfect and it shoots like a dream. The bore is like a mirror (this was carried but hardly shot IMO). The decocker/safety functions flawlessly. This is 100% ready to go.

It comes with three 8-round magazines; the original that is pictured (sorry for the bad picture, I tried numerous times) and two Mec-Gar stainless ones (only shot once). They function flawlessly. The original sells on Gunbroker for $100 and the Mec-gars sell for $30 each.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!
