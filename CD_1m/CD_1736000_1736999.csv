First, we've basically tried to kill this car. It has 234xxx miles on it but it still runs strong. The engine just keeps on going. Second, because it roars to life.

Here's the deal - this was our daily driver for a family of five until late last year. Last year we replaced the battery, all of the tires, put in a new alternator, put in a new (used) transmission, put on a new break line, etc. The year before we put in different breaks and new spark plugs and new wires. I didn't realize that we already had more spark plugs just sitting under the dash, so we have another 6 spark plugs and another light that are currently just sitting there under the radio - consider them a gift if you buy this car. So - that's all good & well, but then a few months ago we broke the windshield wiper & I'm just DONE. I don't want to fix it anymore. When you turn on the windshields, they sort of do a little dance & slap each other. It's kind of funny, and to fix it would probably cost like $50 for the part, but I don't care. We bought a different van & have been sporadically driving this van around ever since. Now I'm tired of looking at it, and thought I'd try to sell it on Craigslist before taking it to a yard.

The van is what it is - it's old and beat up, but runs great. It has power windows that work. The AC worked last time I drove it. It does have an oil leak - it leaks about a quart every 1000 miles. So, I just check the oil & dump in a new quart a few times between oil changes.

There are obvious rust spots, that we will show you on pictures if you want this van after I wrote all of this. Oh - and it roars to life (quite literally) because the muffler has a split down the seam...aka it's pretty loud.

So, that's pretty much the most honest thing I can write about this car. It's for sale or trade - would be a decent car for a family that doesn't have much money & maybe can fix the windshield wiper..."

I really like this gun, but it isn't something I really need right now. It functioned flawlessly at the range, have 150 rounds through it personally, it was cleaned (with CLP) and properly greased (with Tetra gun grease) and put back in it's case. 

It includes the black plastic foam lined Sig factory case, the pistol, 3 15 round factory Sig magazines (no cheap aftermarket mags) and three holsters. 

The gun is the standard single/double action trigger P229R, and it has the newer E2 grips. The bore is nice and shiny and the rifling is nice and sharp and no wear to the crown. 

The holsters are a Blackhawk Serpa CQC (includes paddle and belt loop platforms), the second is a Galco 3-slot COP leather holster with thumb break and the third is an Aker Model 168 Flatsider holster. 

The three holsters alone are worth almost $200 new. These guns typically retail for $850+tax with just 2 mags, but mine includes a third which is another $40. It would easily cost more than $1000 to buy everything listed new. My cash price is FIRM at $700 for everything, and if it sells before Sunday evening I will include a 50 round box of Federal 115gr JHP ammo as well.

Trades: +/- cash based on value (please note that just because my cash price is $750 it does not mean I will accept as an ""even"" trade something which can be purchased brand new for $750, new item retail values will be used as a determination of trade value)"

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact-resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floor plate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

This latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floor plate when not in use to prevent possible loss. 


Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer
Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes.

The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines.

The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate."

All prices plus tax, some models are on gunbroker and I will NOT take down the ad until you are physically here with money to buy. NO trades on cash prices listed. These are priced to move quickly and get paid off. These are all brand new Glocks, some with Davidson's Inc. Lifetime Warranties, and are cheaper than most USED glocks on here. I will take trades but I will not give you top dollar towards my low cash prices. Credit cards welcome but you have to pay the 3% fee for an in person swipe. I will ship to any FFL if you cover shipping, and credit cards over the phone are 4% (Sorry, they charge me more and I wait 30 days to get paid)
Oh, your uncle Ralph sells new Glocks at $289 out the door? Then go buy from him. 
Oh, your brothers 2nd cousins nephew's dog walkers plumber can get them cheaper? Go buy from him. Please don't waste my time with stories and BS. Don't tell me you have a ""one of a kind"" hi-point pistol worth $400 you want to trade in. If you want to buy one of these pistols for the prices listed then I'm available anytime. I will do 1 week layaway at these prices only if you put down at least a $100.00 deposit. I've got a ton of magazines, pinky extensions, mag extensions, night sights, ghost trigger kits, lights, lasers, mag-grip inserts, cocking handles, Magpul mag base plates, extended take down levers, extended and forward extended slide lock release levers, and even tac rail bayonets for these pistols!

The Chiappa M9-22 is a beretta clone. And fires awsome extremely accurate. The only thing about this pistol is that it has jammed ( I think it's the ammo ) the other thing is that the double action doesn't always work. So this one is the lowest priced pistol I have.

This Leapers UTG AccuShot scope is a hunter's dream come true. While the red-green reticle has become commonplace, Leapers' has jumped ahead of the competition with their unique 36-color reticle. That single feature will deliver better results for hunters, who often track their quarry in poor lighting conditions. If the sun doesn't always shine or the moon isn't always full when you're hunting, then you need this scope! Never again will you have to say ""I don't know if I'm on target"" because you can't see your reticle. This fine scope has a 30mm tube and superior optics, which will surprise you with the amount of light it transmits. Put this on any gun...firearm, air gun or airsoft rifle...and commence to shootin'.

The STG-44 (Sturmgewehr 44) was developed in Nazi Germany during WWII and was the first ‘Storm’ (or assault) rifle to see major deployment.

Retaining as many of the original specs as possible, the GSG 22.LR version of this piece of history flawlessly sends 25 rounds of ammo accurately and quickly downrange, and is perfect for casual plinking, target shooting, and hunting. Stunning wood finishing, easy-to-adjust iron sights, and simple safety features add to the STG-44’s superb level of quality. Packed in an old-world style pine crate made by Amish craftsman, the STG-44 offers everything to make any shooting experience a memorable one. 

I shot one 325 round brick through it.  I am a big guy (6'7'') and this gun is a little small for me to be comfortable.
All the original bits come with the rifle in the wooden crate.  In addition it also comes with 2 extra 25 round mags and a 325 round brick of 22 lr ammo.

Price is firm, thanks for looking."

646,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1736646,For Sale:  WTS/WTT: Yugoslavian Zastava M48 Mauser  7.92x57mm (8mm Mauser),"North Platte, Nebraska, United States",$ 350,"Listed On: Friday, June 21, 2013",Rifles,Zastava                                                                                ,8mm Mauser                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is a fine example of a Yugoslavian Zastava M48 Mauser in 7.92x57mm (8mm Mauser). This rifle is in excellent condition, with all matching numbers. Blueing is about 98% with very little wear on moving part surfaces. Excellent bore, shiny with strong rifling. The wood has a minor scratches and dents from handling but nothing that really attracts attention. It appears this one was never issued (Most of the M48s that were made were put into storage soon after manufacture because the Yugos were fielding their variant of the semiautomatic SKS at about the same time). It has one of the nicest two stage triggers that I have encountered on a military Mauser. Has standard ramp sights, with a hooded front sight. The barrel is 23.25"" long.

Yugoslavia produced the M48 with FN tooling from 1950 to the early 1960's. They are similar to the previous issue Yugo 24/47 but received a couple of minor upgrades that were inspired by the German K98k (of which the Yugos captured many and also refurbished). Like the K98k, the M48 features a turned-down bolt which makes it easier to manipulate from certain positions and gave the rifle a slimmer, refined feel. Also similar to the 98K is a stock with sling cutouts instead of sling swivels. The M48 will accept the K98k sling and bayonet and uses standard stripper clips to load quickly.

8mm Mauser ammunition is one of the only calibers you can still find ""cheap"" surplus ammo available making it more economical to shoot than the more in demand calibers like .308 and .223 right now. While it's not nearly as cheap as it was a few years ago, you can still find it for under $0.30 per round. The 8mm does everything the .30-06 will do and loaded to their full potential, many will argue the 8mm does it better. I've almost talked myself out of selling the rifle but I have financial obligations that require me to sell.

Asking $350 OBO. Can meet for a FTF deal in Lincoln county, or ship at your expense. I can ship to your door if you're in Nebraska (yes, this is completely legal under state and federal law) but I will need a copy an 01 or 03 FFL to ship to if out of state. Trade interests include ammunition (5.56mm, 7.62x39mm, .308, 6.8SPC, 9mm, 45acp), a .357 magnum revolver or lever action, or other pistols/rifles. Let me know what you got, the worst I'll do is politely decline. Additional pictures available via email upon request."

4 swords total ;

1) Wakizashi is signed by Minamoto Toshishige, Hitachi Ekiju Nyudo ,1716 .

The sword is in full Shira-saya.

The sword measure 25 1/2' long in total length, with a blade length of 21. 25 inches.

This sword looks like it has a rough life, would need a complete polish, and new shira-saya, as the blade seems to have been stored improperly over the years, and needs a proper polish, but it is signed by a famous smith.

With a full polish being done and new Shira-saya, this would easily be an 2500.00 dollar sword, if not more.

2)  Paul Chen Ninja-To - beautiful work, and razor sharp, just google him, his swords are not cheap.

3)  Ninja-to short sword - very rare, not too many of these were made.

4) Ninja-to short sword - very rare, not too many of these were made, shorter then one above.

5)  KYOGETSU-SHOGE with attached chain and large ring at end of the chain.

6) KUSARIGAMA with chain that hides inside the handle.

7)  Tonfa - set of two total.

8)  KUSARI-FUNDO / MANRIKIGUSARI

9) TEKAGI / SHUKO / ASHIKO  - hand and foot claws

10) METSUBISHI  - egg types, these are the traditionally made, using egg shells, with a combination of sand - black pepper - salt - fire ash - 4 total, made traditionally.

11) Tanto two total, traditional in the belt / sash, and hide away up the sleeve.

12) KUSARI-FUNDO / MANRIKIGUSARI - traditionally made, straight from a instructor of the arts in Japan, made the way they was made in the feudal times.

13) TETSUBISHI - these are the mass produced items, but each one has been sharpened for full effect, I have a whole bag of these, not just the 3 pictured, there are more of these that go with the sale.

14) AIKUCHI / Tantos - 3 traditional types.

15) Hand spike set, made for self defense attacks.

16) Bo- SHURIKEN - 4 total, they come with the bamboo holder, really nice, straight from Japan also.

17) SEMBAN & HALF-MOON SHURIKEN - These are from Japan, made traditionally, the way they was made back in the feudal days, no markings on them at all, not stamped where they was made, as that would throw off the balance on them, they are not sharpened like some people think they are, these were thrown, and held in the hand tightly for close quarter battle, for raking of the hands, the eyes, and throat.

The buyer to make sure this is legal in your area, 
This item is new, i am a licensed gun shop and i received it from the manufacturer or a distributor. It has never been fired and since my shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.
 This is a new in the box hard to find Knights Armament SR-15 E3 Mod 1 with the new rail system. This KAC is chambered 5.56 nato/.223. With this rifle you will definitely be the envy of all your friends.

Here's what KAC has to say:
The Stoner Rifle 15 series are semi-automatic rifles featuring a 16"" chrome chamber barrel, a URX free floating barrel system, an ambidextrous control system, a two-stage trigger, an improved multi-lug E3 bolt and integral front sight and sling mounts. This is already a comprehensive package on its own and does not require excessive modular accessories for performance enhancement. The KAC SR-15 is the first rifle model with an Integral Weapons System (IWS) that combines both built-in and modular features.

The STG-44 (Sturmgewehr 44) was developed in Nazi Germany during WWII and was the first ‘Storm’ (or assault) rifle to see major deployment.

 Retaining as many of the original specs as possible, the GSG 22.LR version of this piece of history flawlessly sends 25 rounds of ammo accurately and quickly downrange, and is perfect for casual plinking, target shooting, and hunting. Stunning wood finishing, easy-to-adjust iron sights, and simple safety features add to the STG-44’s superb level of quality. Packed in an old-world style pine crate made by Amish craftsman, the STG-44 offers everything to make any shooting experience a memorable one. 

I shot one 325 round brick through it. I am a big guy (6'7'') and this gun is a little small for me to be comfortable.
 All the original bits come with the rifle in the wooden crate. In addition it also comes with 2 extra 25 round mags and a 325 round brick of 22 lr ammo.

947,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1736947,For Sale/Trade:  NIB Les Baer UTC 1911,"Canal Fulton, Ohio, United States","$ 1,900","Listed On: Saturday, June 8, 2013",Handguns,Les Baer                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Selling my NIB Les Baer Ultimate Tactical Carry model. I purchased this gun new from Kames in Canton a year ago and it has been sitting unfired in my safe since then. I'm selling it to fund a different Baer model.

As I said, this is the 5 inch Ultimate Tactical Carry model. It has the fixed night sights, single sided safety and the thin Cocobolo grips. The sharp edges have also been nicely blended which I find to be both functional and good looking. This gun also has the blued finish. Les Baer builds an incredible 1911, but their blue finish seems to be hit or miss at times. I can honestly say that the finish on this gun is perfect. I see a lot of Baers with different shades of finish on the frame and slide when they are new, but the bluing on this gun matches perfectly. No scrapes or scratches anywhere, as you would expect from a new gun.

The frame to slide fit is perfect, and the lockup is tight as a drum. Anyone familiar with Les Baer 1911s knows how tight some of them can be, and this one is no exception. As with most of the semi-custom manufacturers, Baer recommends a 500 round break-in period for each of their guns, after which they smooth out considerably. Whoever buys this 1911 will have the pleasure of getting to know the gun during the break-in, as you will be the first to fire it outside of the factory.

I have many close-up high resolution pictures uploaded to my Photobucket page. Unfortunately, Armslist does not allow clickable links in their ads, and some people have still not figured out how to copy and paste, so send me an email and I will answer any questions you have as well as send you the link to the pictures. It's very rare to find a high-end 1911 on Armslist that is not for sale by a dealer, so get it while you can and skip the taxes. Buyer must be over 21 years old, have a valid Ohio drivers license and be able to legally own a firearm in the state of Ohio. CCW holders are preferred but not required. If more than one person responds to the ad, I will give priority to anyone with a CCW. Thanks for looking."

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.
