I spoke with the Beretta Rep as I was purchasing the only one he had seen in Colorado. This gun was just brought to the market this weekend! This particular gun is serial number #111 of the first production run of 500 shipped to the US.

This gun is made with care and precision by Umarex in Germany. The magazines are available on beretta's website. Plus all kinds of accessories. No need to worry about the magazines- they are readily available - since nobody owns this gun yet!

I really love this gun and every time I hold it I get closer to never selling it. But I'm listing it for sale and trade because you might love it even more than I do. It is a SWEET gun, beautiful design, the video of it's performance at the SHOT show on media day is incredible.

This is much cooler than the S&W M&P 15/22. If only for the fact that nobody else has one yet!

Be the First to own this rifle in 22LR for $775 including the ammo. You will pay more than that for shipping, FFL transfer, and ammo if you try and get one of these from some out of state dealer."

This gun has run flawlessly regardless of what brand or type of ammo I've fed through it. Both .223 and 5.56. The upper came from the factory as a 11.5"" barrel and so the port was drilled accordingly to adjust for the gas level.  All in all it's a really great looking pistol and can easily be converted to a Short Barrel Rifle by obtaining the tax stamp and changing out the buffer tube. Surprisingly this thing shoots softer and more accurately than my 16"" bravo company upper. Of course know the law and if you have any questions feel free to ask me.

The Regent R200S comes equipped with the same quality as the R100, but with a stainless finish, serrated slide, ventilated trigger, and hammer, a beavertail safety, combat 3-dot sight system and an extended thumb safety. It is an affordable semi-automatic 1911 pistol built with a level of quality that you can customize. This reasonably priced, high-quality .45 ACP caliber M1911 is one of only a few guns of its style and quality that retails for around $600.

Offered in .45 ACP only, the R200S has a stainless finish and comes standard with Hogue® rubber grips. The slide is manufactured from CNC machined bar stock with a low-cut ejection port, the frame is steel investment cast, and the barrel is hammer forged stainless steel—all manufactured to ISO 9001 and NATO AQAP 120 quality standards.

The Regent R200S accepts virtually all aftermarket parts made for M1911-style pistols, giving you the ability to customize your pistol. Also, almost all aftermarket accessories designed for M1911-styles can be added, whether it be specialized custom grips, added sights, tactical enhancements, or other customizations.

It can shoot 22 short, 22 long and 22  long rifle (.22lr ). Bought this gun at Cabela's 2 months ago. Didn't shoot much. Approx 120 rounds down the pipe. Very accurate and fun to shoot, the action is very smooth as butter. I've mounted a Simmon 3-9x32mm Rimfire 22 Mag scope with heavy duty high profile rings ( it helps when you cocked the rifle, then low the hammer down as safety with your thumb. When you're ready to shoot, cook the hammer back again and pull the trigger ). The gun was sighted in at 25 yards distance. 3 shot almost went through the same hole. Can't be better than that, isn't it? I planned to use this as a squirrel hunting rifle, but I have to many guns, and I like semiautomatic action, which easier for following up shots, like the Marlin rather than lever action type. I have original box for the gun, the scope and the package of the rings as well. The gun is 97-98% like new condition, no scratches. The wood, the blued finish are beautiful. Cabela's price is $299 plus 8.5% sales tax= $324.41 with no scope and rings. The scope I bought at Opticplanet for $54, the rings from eBay ( not the cheap ass rings like others ) for $19. So, I paid around $400 for this package. Asking $300

Thanks to a individual, this information was provided to me. I am not well versed on this item and this information is greatly appreciated: Under the Versailles treaty (WW1),Germany was not allowed to make new 9mm Lugers,so the secret code on top of the receiver was used to fool them.^K^was used for 1934,and ^G^ for 1935,as they got stronger under Hitler they went back to the actual year in 1936 thru 1942.Since these guns were difficult to manufacture,Mauser switched to full P-38 production in 1942,along with Walther until 1945 (end of War)."

I just can't afford to keep this. I hate to let it go. It s a very smooth shooter..
I have been asked about the upper. Here is what I can tell you. There are no markings on it. 
RRA did not mark the older ones. There is a Cardinal Forge Stamp on the side which is appropriate for an RRA upper. On top of the Barrel is is stamped DSC 5.56 Nato 9-1. Looks to be a Double Star Corp. Barrel? Was that factory for RRA? I don't know. I am sure some of you will. This is a very nice higher end AR.

It does have some scratches on it from previous owners and the slide is a little sticky. I also took off the safety catch as I hate safeties! Its a SAO. This little gem is finicky with ammo. The best I have found is 115 grain (HAS TO BE ROUND NOSE) FMJ. Hollow points will only get jammed. Magtech and Independence are the best 9mm ammo I have used. They run very well through this pistol. Then I have a CZ 52. It shoots the 7.62x25mm ammo and this pistol has been very well taken care off. No dings or scratches. Has a lot of work redone on it that I am not sure what. I personally put 50 rounds through it today and have had no problems at all! The one thing I do not like about it is that it does not have a slide lock and does not lock back when magazine is empty. All in all though I fell in love with this pistol and this 7.62x25mm round.

I added a couple more things and am offering different price options because too many lowballers responded to the first ad. I'm moving to New York shortly and I won't be carrying my P11 anymore because of being restricted to only 7 rounds. 
... so I'm trying to find it a good home.

here's what it includes:
the original case
the gun itself
professional combat style stippling on the grip (I love it!)
  {if you don't like stippling you can buy new grips for only $35.00 in 3 different colors}
the original instruction manual (nice, ESPECIALLY compared to other manufacturers)
hard chrome slide 
hard chrome barrel
upgraded recoil spring (and an extra)
upgraded recoil spring guide (and 2 extra guides - Kel-tec sent me an extra by mistake and told me to keep it and then sent me a hat for free; they do nice stuff like that)
extra front sight
extra rear sight
2 - extra frame pins
3 - 12 round capacity magazines (New York only allows 7 round magazines)
3 - pinky extensions (stippled for MUCH easier control and drawing from concealment)
3 - original magazine base plates for REALLY deep concealment or with ankle holsters
1 -  in the pocket holster
1 - magazine holder (not in the picture because I forgot about it when taking pictures)
95 rounds of 115 grain FMJ
$500.00
IF you email quick enough I'll also have up to 200 rounds of 9mm Hollow Points I'll sell only you for .35 a round ... otherwise a lady my wife works with is going to buy them tomorrow night for .65 a round. Just the ammo alone could be resold on this website for over $200 if you feel like reselling it; so essentially you could get this whole package and only spend $300.00 after it's all said and done ... pretty nice deal, huh!
all in all this is easily worth $700.00 with all the extra stuff
if you don't want any ammo at all, I'll let the rest of the package go for only $400.00

This is a fair price for an extremely reliable handgun with a lifetime unconditional warranty from the manufacturer (most other handguns do NOT offer that). You cannot find a brand new P11 right now because they sell out right away or people working at the stores are selling them for $200 more than they're worth. There's no way I'd ever sell this little guy if my wife wasn't making us move to New York in 2 months. This was my backup gun (B.U.G.) so I only shot 300 rounds through it just to know how exactly to hold it with each hand, correct point of aim, my wife shot 100 of those rounds, my 16 year old daughter shot 75 or so of those rounds and to make sure it was able to be 100% counted on if I ever needed it to protect my family or myself. I've owned approximately 40 different handguns over the last 20 years and this one is just a sweet little powerhouse. If you've ever shot a high quality NICE revolver with the long dual action trigger than you'll love just how smooth this action feels when shooting. It comes with an attached belt clip so you can hook it up to a belt, just your pants without a belt, front or back pocket, jacket or sweatshirt pockets - it ""hides"" very easily in many different ways. I've had it in my front pocket of my Levi's many times and no one knew I was carrying. When I was a groomsmen, I carried it and no one could tell with the thin rented tuxedo pants. It works with just sweatpants, too. Like I said this was my daily carry backup gun, so it was field stripped and cleaned weekly and detail stripped and cleaned every month (you have to keep dust out of automatics if you rely on them to save your life if ever needed) - it was very well cared for. I bought it new 4 years ago. It has the updated chrome barrel to handle +P ammo, but I always shot standard loads because I just prefer standard loads in all my guns. I purchased all the extra parts just in case something would wear out and I'd immediately replace it with a new part while waiting the week or so for Kel-tec to replace the broken one (it takes time for the post office to get the parts there and back), but nothing ever went wrong with it because it's basically still new with that few of rounds through it. When I move back here to Minnesota again, I'm buying another Kel-tec P11 the first day I get home again ... but there's no sense in leaving it in a safe for 10 years. It'd be against the law for me to even have the gun just in my house in New York ... so I need to find it a good home, so to speak - lol.

I will ask you if you are legally able to own a handgun.
Face to face ONLY because I'm not going to deal with the hassle of shipping, plus then you don't have to pay FFL fees. 
I can drive within 25 miles of the capital to meet you if needed.
My schedule is pretty open different times throughout the day.
I fully expect this to be gone by the end of the day so act quickly if you want a super reliable and super lightweight handgun.
I don't need to sell this quickly, so if you really want it, but have to wait a little while for the money, we can probably work something out.
I'm open to trades of almost anything, even not gun related, but I won't trade for an automatic that holds more than 7 rounds because New York thinks honest citizens shouldn't be able to protect themselves as well as Minnesota does ... nor as well as the criminals in New York. (I'm not happy about moving there!)
You'll have to leave me an email because I use my cell phone for business and I'm not really allowed to publish it online."

582,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1477582,For Sale:  CNC ar15 lower receiver drill jig,"Dalton,Ga, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 90,"Listed On: Thursday, April 18, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"AR15 LOWER RECEIVER DRILL JIG

The original CNC machined setup blocks / drill guide for completing your 0% - 80% (casting or forged) AR15 lower receiver. The blocks have a black anodized finish. I enjoy helping people get started in this hobby, so let me know if you ever have any questions. YOU WILL NOT FIND THIS KIND OF SUPPORT ANYWHERE ELSE!!!

A great deal of research and design time was put into these blocks to make sure they were as user friendly as possible. These blocks will help hold the receiver flat and square while you finish the work needed to get your receiver machined into a firearm. The blocks are machined to mil-spec standards, so every hole is right on the money. The jig includes the drilled and tapped holes for the optional milling adapter kits (listed above).

Applications

Using this jig is as easy as 1-2-3; (1) Place the blocks on both sides of the receiver and loosely tighten the two bolts, (2) Put the assembly upside down on the edge of a flat table and use another flat surface to make sure the back of the receiver is coincident with the back surface of the blocks ~this step is for locational purposes~ (these two location surfaces must be to finish specs before use), (3) Then simply tighten the bolts and you are ready to drill the side holes or do any other work that needs to be done on your receiver.

Bolt Catch Hole and Buffer Tube Area

This AR-15 jig will also aid you in drilling the bolt catch hole as well. Simply slide the block with the slots (as seen in the photo) over the receiver and clamp them together with a C-clamp and you are ready to drill the bolt catch hole, nice and straight without worrying about a crooked hole and ruined lower. To get the pistol grip hole finished just slide the pistol grip onto the receiver and mark where the hole should be drilled. Then place a 2 ½"" block under the receiver (as shown) to easily drill the pistol grip hole. This way of drilling the hole is by far the easiest method.

You can also use this AR15 jig to make sure you get that tricky buffer tube area drilled and tapped the first time. These blocks will even help you drill the front detent pin and any other work on top or bottom of the receiver. The jig is so EASY to use, that you can finish out your receiver using little more than a cordless drill with the proper drill bits. No matter what side of the receiver you need to machine or drill, these setup blocks will insure you hold your receiver flat and square every time. The blocks have a black anodized finish, so you will be able to use these blocks many times. This is the same mil-spec anodized finish that the military uses, so you know it will last a very long time.

The blocks are shipped with a quick start instruction sheet to assist you in using your blocks for the first time. You can also view the tutorial at this link CNC Gunsmithing Jig Tutorial.

This AR15 jig will save you time and money. No more trashing a receiver because you drilled a hole off position or at an angle. This is a must have for finishing an AR-15 receiver the EASY WAY!"

This pistol has only been to the range twice and has been cleaned after each time including multiple times in between.  It is in FLAWLESS condition without a scratch on it!! 

Many state agencies have switched or are switching to this model for the stopping power of a .45 but the light weight, accuracy, and manageable recoil of a 9mm.  This gun was built for thousands of rounds with an indestructable frame and internal mechanism.  It is the same size as the Glock 17 and 22 but packs a lot more punch. 

Also included is the orignal Glock hard case, 4 boxes of range ammo, 1 box of Federal Premium Defense hollow points, loading assist, and 2 - 10 round magazines.

This is one of the most accurate, flat shooting pistols I have ever owned.  You will not be disappointed.

The quad rail comes with the protective rail covers shown in the photograph below. The original stock factory handguards will also be included. 

Everything is brand new and unused. The gun, scope and rail were only taken out of the box for the photographs. Everything will be put back in the factory boxes prior to shipping except the quad rail, which we will leave on the rifle.

The rifle is shown with the scope attached and the quad rail already installed. The scope has a quick release mount so it’s very easy to take on an off, both red and green dots you can select from, as well as the ability to increase or decrease the size of the dot. This is a nice, well made scope. The quad rail allows you to attach additional optics such as scopes, lasers, lights, etc. (not to mention it looks very cool!) The quad rail comes with the protective rail covers shown in the photograph below. The original stock factory handguards will also be included. 

Everything is brand new and unused. The gun, scope and rail were only taken out of the box for the photographs. Everything will be put back in the factory boxes prior to shipping except the quad rail, which we will leave on the rifle.

Shipping is $40 within the Continental US via FedEx Ground. We ship only to FFL’s. The rifle and accessories will be double boxed to ensure they travel safely.
