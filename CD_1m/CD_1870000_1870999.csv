6""x 6"" and 6"" x 8"" Curved Side Plates $55 each

Free Shipping, When you buy two or more plates, any size!



Best price, best quality and fastest shipping!

We only offer one version of our plates (the best configuration you can get!) Curved and a maximum Line-X buildup (over 1/4"" thick on strike face)

We do not recommend bare steel or a minimum anti-spall buildup for armor. If hit, you and others may suffer injury from projectile fragmentation and spall.

At our price, quality and speed of fulfillment it pays to have the best!

Features:



High Quality Steel and Coating, Made in the USA

Sprayed with an anti-spalling protective coating to help mitigate spalling, fragmentation and impact force.



Strike face has over 1/4"" of anti-spall coating for maximum fragmentation containment



Plate edges are smooth and free from burrs or sharp edges



All plates are formed (curved) for a comfortable fit, a must for prone position!



Waterproof, durable, reliable, chemical and wear resistant, no special storage or handling requirements



Can take several hits without anti-spall coating delaminating



No shelf life, lasts a lifetime



Thin profile just over 1/2"" thick with coating, thinner than ceramic



Inexpensive, a fraction of the cost of ceramic



Will fit most standard 10” x 12” plate carriers



We do not guarantee our armor will contain 100% of the fragmentation & spall but through our testing we found it will give you significantly better odds of protection than using bare steel or a light coat of anti-spall coatings

Finish: Black
Quantity: 3

Ultra-Rigid Polymer Body, Smooth-Feeding Anti-Tilt Follower

The ARC magazine has a reinforced polymer body with unparalleled crush- and impact resistance, plus the latest features to ensure outstanding reliability. The top half of the two-piece body has straight walls and the optimal angle for reliable feeding, with a constant-radius curve in the lower half to aid in stable movement of the round stack. Molded-in reinforcing ridges, four interlocking tabs, and advanced, industrial-strength adhesive ensure that the joint between the halves is the strongest part of the body. Without a separate floorplate or lengthwise welded seam, the body forms an ultra-rigid, five-sided box that won’t fail when dropped free on hard pavement. Sealed body keeps out dirt, dust, and moisture; if necessary, clean the inside by blowing compressed air or water through relief holes in the follower. Proprietary anti-tilt follower of self-lubricating polymer rides smoothly in slots to ensure reliable, snag-free ammo flow. 

Premium-grade chrome-silicon steel spring is heat-treated to relieve stress and moly-coated for corrosion resistance and smooth movement; fully tested to ensure retention of spring force through 100,000 compression cycles. Reinforced feed lips stand up to the battering of sustained full-auto fire. Deep serrations on the front and rear of the body, plus an aggressive waffle pattern on the sides, give a non-slip grasp.

**************OTHER NICE ITEMS I HAVE-VERY NICE STUFF-READ IT ALL SO YOU DON'T MISS ANYTHING-ALL KINDS OF NICE ""GUY STUFF""******************************
***I have a complete commercial grade Oxy-Acetylene Torch setup with everything needed to go to work or just have around the house for projects- top of the line made by ºVICTOR and its 100% complete with the safest and most high quality, strongest components made. Cut, Weld, Fabricate or whatever you want. I PAID $2000 FOR IT BUT SOLD BUSINESS AND NO LONGER NEED I BUT I KNOW SOMEONE DOES- WILL CUT UP AN ENTIRE CAR IN MINUTES- PERFECT FOR PEOPLE SCRAPPING CARS AND METAL OR ANYONE NEEDING TO CUT, WELD, HEAT, Etc. Sell or Trade for fair price. 
***Dayton Heavy Duty 1000 pound electronic chain hoist, lightweight and easily portable but very strong, will lift/lower a range of 10 feet, very handy around the garage, shop, business, warehouse,  plugs into common household 110V power outlet or extension cord for even greater versatility than most and all you do is stand back and press up/down on the remote. Works like new, bearely used- great for pulling engines and mechanic work or lifting heavy equipment parts, etc. I use it to lift the lawnmower up to remove the blades, sharpen them, and put them back, and do maintenance on it and stuff like that and it hasnt ever been used much but should be since its such a handy piece of equipment to have around. I paid $1000 for it a couple years ago but it needs to go somewhere where it will be used. Sell or Trade for fair price. 
****I have lots of nice name brand power tools, both electric and cordless: Craftsman Pro Series HD ROUTER New in Hard Case , DeWalt HEAVY DUTY SAWZALL, DeWalt Drywall Pro Electric Screw Gun with depth settings, etc., 1/2"" Drive Electric Impact Wrench thats very strong, 18V Cordless Drill, etc.

Plus with this deal you get the heads, new plugs, gaskets, and the valvetrain is already good to go and handled a trick flow hydraulic roller camshaft perfectly and will handle common aftermarket high performance cams from Ford Racing, Comp Cams, Trick Flow, etc. The stock GT40P head springs are very weak and wont even hold up to a .444/.444 lift stock 5.0 H.O. Camshaft so if you buy a set you have to budget in $200-$300 for a spring upgrade kit and if you dont have a spring compressor, valve spring height checker, and the know how to take everything apart and put it back together and install the valves with springs at proper height and shim them if needed(doing this 16 times takes a while and machine shops have pretty expensive labor rates, plus they need to be magnafluxed for cracks invisible to the naked eye and vatted/cleaned) plus re-seat all 16 valves by lapping them and hope  all 16 valve guides and valve seats are in good shape and dont need to be replaced or the bill goes up, and that is after you pay $300 for the heads so the budget heads are not such a great deal anymore when you spend $600 buying them and having springs installed plus another $125-$150 for gaskets and plugs, etc  I have everything you need including the rocker arms and pushrods, bolts, etc. (they are not special-you just use the stock stuff from your engine that you used with your stock heads when you inatall these. HOWEVER, THIS IS A GOOD DEAL FOR SOMEONE SINCE EVERYTHING IS UPGRADED AND IN PERFECT WORKING ORDER WITH NO ISSUES WHATSOEVER AND ALL OF THE MONEY GETTING THE HEADS IN THE CONDITION THEY NEED TO BE IN HAS ALREADY BEEN SPENT PLUS YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SPEND ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY.  YOU JUST BUY THESE HEADS AND GO HOME AND INSTALL THEM WHICH IS VERY EASY SINCE THERE IS NO ADJUSTING VALVES OR ANYTHING-JUST INSTALL GASKETS, PARTS, TORQUE DOWN THE BOLTS AND GO-IM INCLUDING NEW High Performance Spark Plugs still in the box and all FEL PRO GASKETS NEEDED TO INSTALL EVERYTHING LISTED ON A FUEL INJECTED OR CARBURETED 5.0, 289, 302, 351 with a

I'm also including roughly 200 115gr 9mm bullets (just the bullets, not whole cartridges!) from Berry's Bullets and a few hundred uncleaned used 9mm brass.  Asking $40 for everything."

 A patented process forms the hollow point cavity in two stages. The core is pre-fluted to define the ""fault"" lines of expansion, controlling final diameter and retained weight. The second process finishes the cavity and controls the rate of expansion. Select, clean burning propellants deliver optimum velocity while ensuring consistent chamber pressures. Non corrosive CCI primers are used for highly sensitive and reliable performance, as well as nickel plated brass cases for smooth feeding and durability.

- 2 extra magazines
- 100 rounds of CII Stinger 22 LR ammo

The gun does have minor wear marks from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo. 

Other than that, it's a great little shooter - I have no complaints. I'm asking $450.00 OBO for everything."

 Designed for use in IHMSA long range shooting on steel animal silhouettes. The IHMSA organization started in 1976 with the purpose of promoting handgun silhouette competition. The object of the competition is to knock down metallic silhouettes (chickens, pigs, turkeys and rams) at various ranges to a maximum of 200 meters. The sport has spread to many countries and matches are shot all over the USA. Many of the innovations you see in hand gunning today came from the sport of Pistol Silhouettes and the International Handgun Metallic Silhouette Assoc.

The Bounty Hunter single action revolver has been sold in the USA for over 20 years. Made in Germany and available in 22LR / 22WMR, .357 Mag, .44 Mag and 45 LC, it is simply one of the best single action revolvers produced. You can purchase a more expensive, or a famous brand, but you won’t be getting a better single action firearm. The Bounty Hunter is a traditional 6 shot single action revolver with traditional resting notch, but it also has a transfer bar and recessed chambers for shooting safety.  There are a lot of single action revolvers out there but none better than The Bounty Hunter from EAA Corp.

It is marked as having a 1-9 twist rate, chambered in 5.56, and chrome lined. (no manufacture name on upper as to who made it- but it is factory assembled, not made by bubba in his shed).
It has a charging handle, but the bolt carrier group was sold earlier so you would need one. 
It comes with cheap but totally new/ functional NC Star front and rear sights and a tapco front sight tool. 

I also have 100 rounds of 55 grain Remington UMC that is available if you buy the upper, but I do not ship ammo- face to face only anywhere between Pgh and Johnstown on the Western side of the state.

option 1:
Price: $300 for the upper, sights, and charging handle. This includes shipping in PA. Outside of PA you pay the full cost of shipping. 

option 2 (preferred):
Price: $350 for the upper, accessories and 100 rounds of Remington UMC ammo. will also throw in one 30 round metal magazine. This option open to PA residents on the Western side of the state. It will be face to face where ever we can both feel safe.

option 3:
Make offers. I am willing to split the package up. May take partial trade of a .22wmr + some cash on your side.

I am not willing to 'hold' any of the items. First come, first served. I don't want to hear any sad stories. I am willing to negotiate with reasonable people, but don't expect the price to drop too much unless you are driving to me. The further I have to drive, the less likely I am willing to negotiate- gas ain't free and I can't find a better deal so I doubt you can either. If I am wrong, show me and I'll match the price."

I paid $492.76 (including tax) for the revolver. I'm not looking to make a profit, I'd just like to come close to getting what I paid for it.
My sale price is $450.00 and I'll throw in the remaining 208 rounds of .22 Magnum/WMR at no cost.  You must have a PTP or CCW in order to purchase.  I would prefer to sale to someone in Minnesota.  I will accept cash only.  We can go to an FFL south of the river and you will be responsible for the transfer fee.  I believe it's around $20 to $30.

I've recently fired a steel frame 9mm and decided that I like it a little more.  Therefore, before I go out and purchase it, I wanted to see if there is anyone interested in maybe trading theirs.  I am looking for the trade to be in very good condition.  Also, I forgot to mention that I would be willing to put cash in on my end depending on how new it is, and how much is being asked (basically if the value matches the condition of the pistol, and is competitive with the current market).  I am not in a rush to trade and will continue to shoot, just thought I would see what was out there.  
Thanks alot.
