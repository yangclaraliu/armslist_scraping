N.I.B.This weapon is pristine! You will not find a  SCAR 16S better than this. The weapon you are bidding on is the one pictured. It comes with a 30 round magazine, flip-up sights, box, manual, rails, etc (listed below). It also comes with an ATN MK350 Guardian Night Vision Scope (also new), a tactical extendable bipod, and 500 rounds of Remington Law Enforcement 62 grain ETSP. You will not be disappointed. It is milspec all the way around, and definitely the ultimate pig-hunter. This is the semi-automatic version of one of the newest rifles used by U.S. Special Operations personnel as well as numerous law enforcement agency tactical teams. The 16S has a huge advantage over the 17, due to the availability and cost of .223/5.56 NATO vs the significantly more expensive and allusive .308/7.62 NATO. The value of this weapon is far better than a Colt 6920. It is gas-piston operated - a pricy upgrade for a regular AR-15 style assault rifle. It has four quad rails for accessory mounting (at 12, 3, 6, and 9). Additionally it has ambidextrous safety and magazine releases, as well as the ability to mount the charging handle on either side."

Not just for zombies anymore

While it would be a lot of fun for our marketing department to sell the Camp 10 as the ultimate zombie-whacking tool, the truth is, it actually has a lot of other uses that you just might find to be of a more immediate nature than zombie defense. Not that we’re ignoring to the coming Zombiepocalypse, mind you. We just think that the Camp 10 makes a pretty awesome camp knife and that it does a great job of whacking campsite or other outdoor chores down to size in very short order.

From clearing brush to making kindling, the Camp 10 is the ideal outdoor and survival tool. Cut, chop, slash, hack, split, scrape—just about any task you ask of it, the Camp 10 can handle. The full-tang Camp 10 is made of carbon tool steel for toughness and wear resistance. A basic black powdercoat protects the steel and makes maintenance easier.

You’ll like the secure, contoured grip of the Camp 10, too. The handle has a built-in hand guard and is drilled in both front and rear so you can attach a lanyard either place—or both—for carrying versatility. Of course, if a zombie does get up close and personal with you, then yeah, you’ll be pretty glad to have a Camp 10 in hand, too.

Stevens ~ Savage Arms 12 gauge double barrel shotgun
Tang safety on top. Double triggers. Cocks as you open and close the breach action (It's hammerless).

28"" inch barrels ~ 2/34 chambers. The bore is clean and shiny.
Marked ""5100"" but that is really the number they placed on these to note the action, not so much the ""model"", but they are known or identified both ways.

This shotgun has ""forged steel barrels, NOT Damascus. It is quite safe and pleasant to shoot. No function or safety issues. It's wonderful to carry all day, bust clay pigeons, or I used it a couple time for sporting clays at Wild Marsh and it was a hoot and quite well suited for that. 

EXTRAS:
Comes with/included, a case of Remington number 7.5 shot Sport Loads. That is a case of 4 boxes of 25, meaning ""100 rounds"". New, unopened. 
Comes with an Outers Tico-Tool, sort of a ""fuzzy pool cue"" for cleaning 12 and 16 gauge shotguns. I used it today for the first time to try it. 

I am pricing this fairly at $400.00 cash/no trades/no checks for the PACKAGE, Shotgun, ammo, cleaning gizmo, and a free Remington soft-sleeve case to get you home legally...  Serious BUYERS can see this by appointment. 

My best effort at researching this fine old shotgun is that it was produced pre-1949. It has NO serial numbers!  NEVER did... It was common before 1968 for some shotguns and long guns to be produced and they were not ""requred yet"" to bear serial numbers. 

Further investigation yeilded no typical tell-tale coded proof marks that would have positivly dated this sporting arm. The ""lack of"" the coded number/proof mark ~ (specifically where it should be) provides per research that is was produced pre-1949. 

In that era, Savage was also building the Fox B for Fox. They introduced the Fox B in 1949. Most or all of the parts are interchangable. Parts are still available today. 

I did find a stock repair on my shotgun here, I never noticed until today. Hey, it's 64 years old+. It never impaired my ability to down grouse or bust a clay.

The price is quite firm. If you show up, point out that there a spec of something here or there, and make a lower offer, I will pass. The gun is 64 years old+. Some of the bluing has worn. It's very presentable, a great shooter, hang it on the wall or CARRY IT HUNTING as I did. 

EDIT:

Another reader was kind enough to provide this:

The 5100 that you have was made between 1931 and 1941. The exact date you probably will never find. Savage came out with the 5000 model in 1923 and ran that until 1931 the it was changed over to your model the 5100 and that ran until 1941 then it was changed to the 311 and that lasted until 1989. They are actually the same as the fox with a few differences which are cosmetic/carvings-engravings only."

So, you can display it and/or take it to the range if you want. Although it has a very clean and shiny bore, the exterior does have some fine handling scratches and imperfections. The authenticity history information, taken from the Colt records, that is included with it shows that it was shipped to Oak Lawn Gun & Sport's on January 16, 1968. That makes it at least 45 years old. However, we do not have the ""presentation case"" that originally came with it. All this is reflected in the $450 asking price instead of some that I have seen at $650 to $1300.00, check them out on the net.
I have shot Long Rifle rounds as well as Shorts in this gun. With it's 4.75 inch barrel and fixed sites, it is  a very accurate shooter and leaves the small grouping(s) up to your steady hands and shooting skills. A lot of nice looking and easy handling, but inexpensive fun! 
I will sell this beauty to only an Illinois resident with a valid F.O.I.D. and in person. The Illinois 72 hour waiting rule applies."

I got it for varmints and such but have not had ocassion to ever use it in several years.  It has grooves on the top so I put a four power Tasco scope on it but don't believe I zeroed it.  I must have planned to as the caps for the adjusters are missing.  The real wood stock and bluing are very good.  It is tube fed and has the charging handle on the left.  It has a bit of heft and feels like a real rifle not a toy.  Looking it up online, I found it was made in 1951 for Sears and labeled as Sears item #583.71, which is on the barrel.  According to a search (http://www.histandard.info/PDF/Sears%20Rifles.pdf), it was made by High Standard, which is a rifle considered better than those made by Stevens, according to research and reviews.  Its a nice rifle that is made better that modern ones costing much more."

The class lasts about 7 hours total, includes a written and range test, basic handgun safety, handgun cleaning, handgun knowledge, handgun marksmanship, and qualifies you to apply for a CCDW license in KY. Students should bring a modern functioning handgun with 50 rounds of factory new ammunition and appropriate cleaning supplies for the firearm. Don’t have a handgun, ammo, or supplies? No worries! Get in touch with me and we can work out the details. There is also a $60 fee divided between the state and local police that is normally paid 2-3 weeks after the completion of the course. A criminal background check will be done by the Kentucky State Police after the completion of the course. Due to high volume, it is currently taking up to 5 months after the class for the actual license to be issued by the Kentucky State Police. Feel free to contact me, and thanks for your consideration!"

SIRIUS GUNS is a Davidson’s GOLD dealer and a stocking dealer for Springfield Armory, Beretta, Kahr, Magnum Research, Ruger, Smith & Wesson, and Taurus.

Ruger 13014 P Series P95 9mm 3.9"" 15+1 w/Rail Blk Poly Grip & Frame/SS Slide

Each metal frame P95 series pistol with rail is made of hard coated A356T
aircraft quality aluminum alloy; Ruger's proprietary Terhune Anticorro
stainless steel (chrome-molybdenum steel in blued models); nearly
indestructible resin grip panels; custom, compounded polymer frames of the
P95 andP97; and long strand fiberglass filler that is a natural shock
absorber. P95 series pistols easily field strip for cleaning, without the
use of special tools, into five major subassemblies. Ruger offers several
ambidextrous variations on the proven P95 series double-action design.
Operating features on all centerfire models include a firing pin block that
prevents firing unless the trigger is completely pulled and held fully
back. Manual safety models incorporate a manual ambidextrous lever that,
when engaged, prevents firing unless the lever is in the ""fire"" position.
Decock only models allow safe return to their ""at rest"" mode when either
ambidextrous decocking lever is depressed.

With the addition of the Px4 Compact in 2010, Beretta completed the Px4 family of pistols.

Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range. 

The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package.The 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready. 

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols.

This pistol comes with two 15 round magazines, speed loader, hard carry case, lock, and all manuals. Come by The Arms Room in Fayetteville to check out this fine handgun. Give me a call at 479-445-six4eight0 if you have any questions about this gun. Shipping is available. Thanks for looking."

I fired a total of 6 new rounds through it, ammo is expensive so I just wanted to test/ see how it fires. I was able to fire 3 rounds in about 5 sec's or less and that was doing it double action twice  & striker fire/cowboy style and they all hit in a pie plate group...I have 44 rounds of the New Box of Ammo(old but NIB &price on box 34.99!!back then) & 29 loose/in bag reloads for it, the gun has some issues but looks great for its age/ better than most ive seen looking around, knowing how it shoots it actually wouldn't be a bad  revolver for a pocket pistol, bottom line its a interesting and functional light weight revolver for a night stand /personal protection it would do the job!!

Lower:
The lower is an Aeroprecision model AP-15.
It's built with a Rock River Arms Lower parts kit (single stage).
It also includes a Magpul B.A.D. lever and a Magpul Moe trigger guard.
The grip is a DPMS Panther with an adjustable palm shelf.
The stock is a Magpul PRS, which is fully adjustable for both cheek and shoulder. It also has a picatinny mount area for a monopod.

Upper:
Minus the Midwest Industries handguard, the upper is all DPMS.
The barrel is 24', is chambered in .223 and has a 1-9 twist.
It's a heavy barrel (bull) and is fluted all the way down, minus where the block (also not DPMS - switched to low-pro for handguard) sits.

As far as accuracy, this thing will put holes in holes with ease at 100 yards.

I do have boxes for some of the parts, if you're interested in that sort of thing. Being that this was built for my wife, it's been sitting in the cabinet more often than not. I would guess 300 rounds down the tube.

The Atlas Bipod is not a part of this sale. If you want it to be, just tack on an extra $275... it's probably one of the best bipods out there.

There are no discernible marks or chips on the weapon anywhere. It looks and acts brand new. Taken care of meticulously.

Let me know if you have any questions and thanks for looking."

Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.

The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

The top right side of the grip has a few small scratches from being packed. The gun has one two places on the gun other than the holster wear I will get them all in the pictures. I am going to give you every picture that I can so you can see for yourself the condition of this gun. It's not really bad at all to be what it is. I am not sore if this is the original case the gu originally came in but I'm sure some of you colt fans will know. It has adjustable rear sights that can be moved or changed. Also the front sight can be changed"

So here for sale is our 2001 Bantam Trail Lite by R-Vision. This camper is in great shape, comes with all the amenities of a full RV but at only 21 feet, folded up, it is surprisingly maneuverable. It has a GVWR of 4280LBS, and a dry weight of 2980LBS.

 Can be used on the fly without deploying the pop outs with the table beds inside, when fully opened up you can easily sleep 6 to 8 adults comfortably. 

 Comes standard with automatic 3 way fridge and freezer, gas oven, gas 4 burner range, two basin sink, large automatic hot water heater, huge water reservoir, bathroom with toilet sink tub and shower, spare tire, forced air furnace, air conditioning unit, TV hook up and antenna, large front awning, heavy extension cord, inverter/converter.

 Also comes with some very unique aftermarket additions; 

 built in stereo that will play CD's radio or has an AUX to hook up your lap top for movies or to your MP3 IPOD etc... microwave, outdoor table/cutting board located under the awning above a propane outlet and next to the AC oulets, (this is a great place to set up an outdoor BBQ, espresso maker, place a lantern, set drinks etc...) The counter inside has a deployable cutting board next to the sink which can be stowed when full seating is needed but deploys in a minute or so for extra counter space, several flip up drink holders placed strategically at seating areas, two deep cell batteries, two 20LB propane tanks, reliable hook and grommet with bungee dormer retainers.

 I am also including all the items to run the trailer; stabilizer crank, awning pull down tool, user's manual for trailer, white water hose, sewer pipe and fittings, boards for leveling, propane hose that fits the outdoor propane outlet, winterizing tools, tire chock, 220 to 110 cord adapter.

 This trailer is a very solid and a great recreational vehicle for the active family. I have had it on one trip this year, purged the systems of the winterization antifreeze, put tank treatment in to ensure the water is taste free, started everything up and ensured that it is set for another great season. This trailer is travel ready and should be good for many more years of use. 

 All systems work perfectly and I can run any prospective buyer through the ins and outs of everything that this trailer has to offer.

Camping and hunting season is on us, and this unit is ready for the high lakes or the backwoods.

I still have the box.  i never followed through with getting involved in shooting trap or bird hunting.  It may have a tiny nick from being in the safe I don't know about but it has been handled very little.  There are a couple of extra choke tubes.  I have seen some critical talk about it online.  Of course, online critics who prefer $1000 to $2000 guns are not hard to find.  No, it is not as good as a Browning Citori.  But, take a look and judge for yourself as to whether the stock and bluing don't look to be of very good quality.  The fit of the wood and metal are good, contrary to what some self-appointed experts say.  Maybe mine is different because its an older model.  I don't know.  The single trigger is smooth not gritty.  The action is very tight from not being used.  When layed against the often promoted Remington 870 and Mossberg 500, it looks and feels much more expensive.  I have both.  I am asking what I paid without tax and inflation or storage fees."

These are for guns I no longer own and I'm just trying to get them to someone who can use them.  Price is firm, if you're going to point to a website that has them IN STOCK and the price is higher than it would be for the IN STOCK magazines plus shipping, I will modify my price.

AAC's MODEL-7 rifle is chambered in the new 300 AAC BLACKOUT cartridge which offers an accurate, light weight, and compact package for hunting or target shooting. 

The action is made by Remington to AAC's specifications. It has all the features and safety you come to expect from a Model-7 action (a shorter version of the Model-700), A 20 MOA scope rail is mounted to the receiver using M24 type 8-40 screws. The X-Mark Pro™ trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs and provides the feel needed for precision shooting. The barrel is a 5R 1:7 twist and threaded 5/8-24. A thread protector is included. The nitride surface of the barrel, bore, and chamber provide maximum service life and durability - longer than even hard-chrome but with the accuracy potential of a stainless barrel. Corrosion and wear resistance of the bore is extreme."
