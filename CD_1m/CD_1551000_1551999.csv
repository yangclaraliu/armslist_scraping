Less than 50 rounds fired. The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semiautomatic pistol designed for concealed carry and personal defense. Borrowing features from predecessors like the Beretta M9 and Beretta 92 it is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for law enforcement (both on and off duty) private security forces and responsible citizens. The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact compact and full frame versions. Checkered grips on all models provide a sure grip in less than optimal conditions and three backstraps (included with every pistol) can be swapped for comfort and fit. The design is based on that of the M9 and 92 and the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way fit. 
An ambidextrous safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement. A non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty.

The blueing is in pretty good shape for the age of the gun(no rust or pitting). Since I bought the gun I have changed the scope, rings, and bases... It now has leupold rings and bases along with a 4-12x50 hawke optics scope. The gun has had a professional trigger job done to it and is pretty crisp around 2.5lbs.. I would consider selling the gun without the scope for the right price but will no sell the ammo seperately. The gun comes with 7.5 boxes of federal 100gr and one box of hornady 85gr... This is a very smooth shooting hun and I hate to sell but the bills have to get paid..

This rifle was one of the earliest of the AK kits to be imported.  I was generally not very excited when it arrived, given the well used condition of the rifle (barrel was pitted), prior to it's demilling.  I spent years collecting parts to assemble it, which included an Arsenal milled receiver, FSE trigger group, and a US made barrel.  The kit was assembled by a reputable AK gunsmith in Montana, I believe (been a while).  I chose not to spend alot on refinishing, but it does have a durable finish on all the metal parts.  It was assembled in compliance with the 922R requirements, and has fired no more then 200 rounds, with no problems whatsoever.  This is my very first AK."

Included is the blue box, owner's manual, eight magazines (*see below).

The night sights, labeled ""6"" and ""8"" are dimming, but still shine.  

I have had the weapon a few years and have never had any issue.  It is kept clean.  My primary use was a carry weapon in a backpack, I didn't carry it on my person.  It has spent most of its time with me as a ""nightstand gun"".

*The magazines are:
1 zipper-backed ten round capacity
2 LE marked zipper-backed twelve round capacity
3 LE marked flat-backed twelve round capacity
2 flat-backed twelve round capacity

If you'd like to make an offer for some or all of the magazines, that is highly negotiable; however, I will not sell all of the magazines without the pistol going as well.

This is a rare Marlin 39A that was made in 1947! My gun is in way above average condition for a gun of its age. Mechanically, the internal parts are very good and there are still sharp angles to the steel. The bore is clean and shiny. Magazine tube holds 22LR/long/short rounds. The gun features a 24 inch barrel, easy take-down of the gun into two sections, and a vintage Weaver G4 era scope. There are the minor basic scratches and a little wear on parts of the metal, a few small nicks in the wood, and someone in the past bunged up three screws. The American Gunsmith Marlin 39A Technical Manual on DVD is included. Firearm consultant and author Randy Wakeman writing for the ChuckHawks gun review site wrote: ""The Marlin 39A remains my favorite lever action rifle of any type and one of the finest .22's made"".

I have a 525 round brick of new .22LR ammo that I would be willing to sell for $29  (the same price that Big 5 charged me) to the person who buys the Marlin 39A.

Oregon residents only. Bill of sale for my records only. Meet up in SE Portland. The price of the Marlin 39A is $575 cash sale."

This Rossi Overland in the .410 has the 26 inch full/full barrels, beautiful walnut stock and fore end and the Exposed Rebounding Hammers that do NOT rest on the firing pins. Nice safety feature you don't see any more. This model has long been out of production.
This one has NEVER BEEN FIRED and was put together for the first time when I shot these pictures. I had an Uncle who used to see something he liked and would just buy it on a whim. He was in a wheelchair and rarely got out to shoot, never even put this one together. He passed some years ago and his sister (my Mom) ended up with most of his things. This was passed on to me to give to my little guy so he could start bird hunting with me but it's just TOO NICE to even think about taking it afield. 
Don't know how many others you'll find like it but the last one I saw on one of the gun auction sites brought over $600 and had been fired, was noted at ""98%"" and didn't include the box and paperwork. 
Would prefer to deal with someone local to avoid all the shipping and such but am open to interested parties as long as they're in the USA and NOT in CALIF, COLO, CONN or any other gun hating state. Of course if it goes out of NV it'll have to go the a FFL, etc. NV FTF will require you to provide a copy of a valid NV DL. I'll do the same if any trade + cash is involved.
Would consider partial trade of a Henry AR-7 + $250 CASH or something similar. Already have a single shot 20 gauge lined up for the little guy but might consider something like that and some CASH too... Let me know what you might be thinking.

...........FREE SHIPPING IN TEXAS..........PAY WITH PAYPAL..............
One of the finest AR-15 / M16 mags on the market today. Extremely reliable and durable and at a great price. By collecting input from military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters, TAPCO has designed a magazine that can be depended on from a trip to the firing range to deployment overseas. Molded of reinforced composite with aggressive horizontal ridges that provide increased gripping surface for insertion and extraction of the magazine in wet or muddy conditions. This also helps to eliminate feed lip separation. The anti tilt follower has been designed to allow more dirt and grime to pass than any other magazine on the market. This allows the magazine to keep feeding ammo, despite loose dirt or sand that may have entered the magazine. The spring is made using a 1770 Stainless steel wire, featuring a unique shape for smoother, quieter loading through all 30 rounds. It also reduces overall stress on the magazine body, preventing spine cracks. 30 Round capacity. Fits All AR15, M4, and M16 Variants. Made in the U.S.A. with a lifetime warranty from TAPCO"

The top of Savage's line of firearms. 26"" fluted stainless steel barrel, stainless steel receiver, Accu-trigger, oversized bolt handle, Laminated stock with beaver-tail forend. 

I have put about 50 rounds through it. It is clean and the metal finish is flawless. The stock is flawless except for a 3/16"" X 1/32"" dent in the underside of the wrist (where your fingers wrap around). The owners manual and trigger adjustment tool are included. I do not have the box. If you want the lock that came with it, I'll throw that in too.

The 12 currently is sporting a Seals 8-32 X 50 mm, 30mm tube scope with red & blue illuminated range finding reticle, side focus (parallax adjustment) and target knobs (1/8"" adjustments). It's mounted with Leupold standard rings and bases. The rifle is zeroed for 100 yds. It is capable of shooting sub - 1/2"" groups repeatedly. I know, I've seen me do it...

New, this rifle sold for $1100.00 retail. The scope sells for $450.00. Ring and bases retail at around $80.00. That would be a $1630 investment. If you'd like it as is, with the optics, the price is $1100.00. If you'd prefer to mount your own optics, the price would be $750.00 for the rifle alone. Shipping is $35.00 (It's heavy!).



I will consider trades for a high accuracy .308 bolt gun, but I think that's about all I'm interested in...

Close to new condition. Holds 11 rounds of .357 ammo in magazine tube. Mechanically excellent with a nearly unused mirror-clean bore. Other features: blued receiver with 20 inch octagon barrel, crescent shape steel butt plate, top tang safety, spent cartridges angle up and outward towards the side. My gun was made in New Haven, Connecticut in 2004. Rare gun: Winchester made about 1,025 of my Model 94’s version from 2004-2006 the only time they were manufactured. My gun is distinct from other Trails End versions such as those with the round barrel, standard (non-western) style stock, and cross-bolt safety. Winchester closed down USA manufacturing operations in 2006 and now outsources their lever actions to Asia.
