ISSC M111006 M22 *CA Approved* 22LR 4"" 10+1 Desert Tan Poly Frame Black Slide

Designed for inexpensive, high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate
rapid-fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut
for modern defensive pistol practice at the range. The M22 gives shooters
the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a
match barrel, an extremely crisp, 4-lb. single-action trigger and a
windage-adjustable sight. The M22 pistol from ISSC has five safety
features: hammer drop-down, loaded chamber indicator, trigger safety tab,
magazine disconnect, and an external key-lock. It uses easy to load
10-round magazines in a lightweight polymer frame with an integral rail for
training with lights and lasers. These models are CA approved.

As some of you probably know, the Ruger SP-101 is considered by many to be the finest .357 magnum revolver ever made for CCW or nightstand/glovebox duty.  Very SOLID construction handles the stoutest loads and minimizes felt recoil . . . 38+P feel like 22s out of this piece.  Small frame, 5 round cylinder and 3"" barrel keep it compact . . . not a pocket gun, but carries well in a proper holster.

If you research reviews of the SP-101, you will see that it is one of the most popular revolvers out there . . . but due to overwhelming demand, quality control has suffered over the past few years . . . fear not, this one is an early model, back when they took their time putting them together, and fit and function are PERFECT.  You will not be disappointed with this piece at all.

Small frame makes it a good choice for individuals with smaller hands.  If you are recoil sensitive, it will also fire .38 Special.  Very accurate, reliable, durable gun in excellent overall condition.  Has been stored in a safe for the past ten years and rarely shot.  Just took it to the range last week and it ran great.

I will include a belt holster and a brand new unopened box of Winchester PDX-1 125gr .357 ""Elite Defender"" ammo . . . arguably the BEST possible round for this gun.  The ammo sells for over thirty bucks, and it is sold out everywhere right now.

Not too interested in trades (unless you are adding cash) and only interested in hammerless J-frames and NAA minis.

Local sale only.  CASH only.  Will not ship.  Must be CO resident legally permitted to own a firearm.  I reserve the right to refuse to sell to anyone for any reason, and reserve the right to withdraw this item from sale at any time."

Manufactured in 1983. Hot Flash refinishing done in 2013 cost $199.00.

The Marlin Model 1894 is a lever-action repeating rifle introduced in 1894 by the Marlin Firearms Company of North Haven, Connecticut. At its introduction the rifle came with a 24-inch barrel and was chambers a .44 Magnum. Rechambered variants remain in production today.


Marlin produced its first lever-action repeating rifle as the Model 1881, made for powerful hunting rounds. This was followed by the model of 1888 which was a top eject action like the 1881 with several improvements, most important was the incorporation of a locking lug locking the breach. It was chambered in the WCF (Winchester centerfire) family of cartridges originally developed for the Winchester 1873 rifle, 44WCF, 38WCF & 32WCF also known as the 44/40, 38/40 & 32/20. The Model 1889 that followed was the first lever action rifle to have a solid top with side ejection of spent cartridges. This model was chambered for the same cartridges as the 1888. Design improvements to the Model 1889, such as a one-piece trigger and a two-piece firing pin to prevent the rifle from firing unless the finger lever was fully closed or if the locking lug were missing, resulted in the Model 1894. Additionally, the finger lever lock of the Model 1889 was eliminated on the Model 1894 and replaced by a latch built into the lever itself."

Consists of a modified USGI fiberglass stock fitted with a machined aluminum adapter supporting an AR-15-style receiver extension for the collapsible “clubfoot” buttstock of tough, molded polymer. Five locking positions on the extension provide a length of pull adjustment from 10½"" to 14"", and a 1"" range of vertical adjustment helps you set the correct stock height for a solid cheekweld. Two, detachable, full-length storage compartments provide additional cheek support; each waterproof compartment holds up to 3 AA or 4 CR-123 batteries. Another, permanent storage compartment on the left side of the buttstock holds two more AA batteries or other small items. The aggressive surface texturing and hand-filling contours of the pistol grip ensure positive weapon control. Storage recess in the grip can hold more batteries or other small items; flexible rubber cap seals out dirt and moisture. The receiver extension tube has a waterproof compartment that is ideal for a field cleaning kit. Sockets on each side of the stock adapter accept the included quick-detach, push-button swivel for an ambidextrous 1¼"" single-point sling. Removable, ½"" thick rubber buttpad features an aluminum strike plate. Note: stock is designed for use with the Springfield Armory CAS-14 Cluster Rail system and does not have a forward sling attachment point"

This handgun features a grip safety similar to the 1911, and is known for being a  very safe as well as practical firearm. Instead of having the grip safety at the palm of your hands it is at your finger tips which in my opinion is an awesome feature.

This model has been used by police and military forces all over the world, the gun in specific has issue branding of the Military Police of the Bundeswehr, both on the lower and upper of the gun.

This handgun is in fantastic condition and has little to no wear.  I have never carried this handgun and it has spent most of its time in the safe.  Included is the original box + 2 factory Sig 7rnd magazines. I would estimate that I have fired only 300 - 350 rounds out of this gun since I have had it and every round has fired flawlessly.  I also will throw in a Fobus SG-21 OWB holster with this deal.

I am only willing to sell to Colorado residents and individuals over 21.  Please bring ID to verify both of these criteria.

REDACTED

This case is designed to hold one or two of the M-4 carbines with a collapsible stock and a 16 inch barrel. It will also hold similar carbines with a collapsible stock, a folding stock rifle, or any other weapon that is under 35 inches in overall length. This 36-inch Voodoo Tactical brand padded rifle carrying case will help protect your rifle from the hard knocks of transportation, whether in your vehicle or in the field. It can also be used if you break down your gun or to carry different uppers.

Inside are two sets of adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case that has foam only on two sizes or the flimsy egg-crate foam of some hard-shell cases. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement.

Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories.

This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six standard size magazines and the center pouch is even larger.

This Voodoo Tactical gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear."

When I started bow hunting I opened my wallet to buy all of the top of the line stuff I needed and that looked cool and ***used it twice*** and then my archery buddy couldnt go anymore due to health problems.  Depending on the trade I may throw in the Nikon range finder.  The bow is a compound made by Hoyt.  it is the Basspro/Redhead XP 32.  Its only been taken out in the field twice other than that i wax the strings here and there to keep them fresh.

This bag is large enough to carry your armor and other deployment gear with ease. At 39""L x 18""W x 15""H you will be thrilled to see how much gear you can pack into its cavernous central compartment and the multiple assorted-size exterior pouches. Then you can use the double compression straps at each end to tighten your load down and prevent things shifting around.

Need even more pouches? You can add any MOLLE compatible pouch to the PALS webbing on the exterior.

Includes a wrap around carry handle in the center, adjustable removable shoulder strap with movable pad to give you shoulder a little bit of protection. When the load gets too heavy, unfurl the padded adjustable shoulder strap harness concealed in the bottom of the bag and carry it like a giant backpack."

I have shot less than one 30 round magazine through this AR. 
You will swear it is new.
It shoots awesome....
I am only selling to fund a new project.

About the Custom Tactical Billet AR15.

This AR15 comes with both a billet upper and lower receiver.

Lower Receiver:

This is a Mag Tactical Systems Gen 4 Lower.
These are Top of the line lowers.
They are also 35% lighter than a standard lower.  How do they do this?
Mag Tactical Systems use a Proprietary Magnesium/Aluminum alloy.  

Not only are they 35% lighter they are stronger.
They have reinforced trigger & hammer axle pin placement points.
Their front pivot pins are reinforced to eliminate any fracturing during torque when receiver is in the break down position.
So yes they are lighter and stronger where it matters.

The Lower also has an the larger integrated winter trigger guard.  This not only looks cleaner but adds strength to the lower.


Upper Receiver:

This Billet Upper is made from 7075 Aluminum.  
7075 is almost twice as strong as the average forger 6061 upper.  Not only is this aluminum stronger this receiver is much thicker than the standard forged receiver.
So not only is this billet upper stronger it looks tough as nails.

Barrel:

This is a 16” M4 Stainless Steel 1X9 twist barrel with M4 cut Nitride coated barrel extension. 
This Barrel is manufactured in the U.S.A.  It is made from US certified 416r Stainless steel. 
This is a top of the line Barrel.



Some of the upgrades over a standard AR15 other than those mentioned above:


Free Float Barrel:  	Free Floated Barrels are used for only the most accurate of rifles.  By free-				floating a barrels you isolate the barrel from any outside forces normally 					associated with most AR15's. The hand guards on a standard barrels apply force 				to a barrel when gripped.  This cause the barrel to flex or move ever so slightly.  				Ever so slightly amounts to ever so big at 100+ yards.  A barrels that is free 				floated does not have outside forces working against it and will shoot straight 				every time. 


Mid-length Free Floated Quad Rail: The quad rail allows for the operator to mount a slew 							of additions accessories to there weapons platform. This mid 						length Quad rail is also longer than the standard Carbine length 						hand guard allowing for more room to mount your accessories like 					a Bi-pod, Light, front sight and optics.  An added bonus to having 						a longer hand guard is that is also protectects the Gas block from 						being damaged or moved. 



Emod Style Modular Stock:  This stock is simply amazing.  This Stock offers versatility like no other 				buttstock, in a full package. The fit, finish, and feel are comfortable, 					durable, and manufactured with the operator in mind. The buttstock sports 				3 compartments for tools, batteries, special loads of ammunition. It 					includes a durable, cushy buttpad to absorb the recoil of your rifle. It 					sports a comfortable cheek rest allowing you to obtain a clean sight 					picture. 

				The buttplate of the the stock is slightly wider and longer at the toe than 					the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions 					from the ready feel much more natural. This stock was given enough 					weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated 					with negative pitch buttstocks.  This stock also transforms into three 					different stocks by simple removing or adding the transformable  pieces 					to your custom feel.

 Tactical Charging handle:  This allows the shooter a larger surface to grap when charging the AR15.  				This also makes it much easier to charge the weapon when wearing 					gloves in cold weather.

Magpul Moe Pistol Grip: The MOE Grip provides Magpul quality, feel, and durability for the AR15 Pistol grip. The ergonomic, hand filling design combines aggressive texturing with storage core capability. 

Ambidextrous tactical end plate:  Allows for a sling to be attached to either the right or left of  the AR15.


What extras are included with this rifle?

The Red Dot Scope is included.  	(It is just a standard Red, Green, Blue illuminated Red Dot Style 						Scope) 

One brand new Magpul 30 round P-Mag is also included

Trying to slim down my collection to be more focused, and I am selling my Taurus.

I really like the double or single action style trigger on these style guns, and in a full sized high capacity pistol, makes it alot of fun to take to the range, or use for self defense.  While the gun itself was light enough to conceal carry if you dressed appropriately, it is a full sized gun, and the weight of a fully loaded mag make this not very practical for that purpose, but I can attest that it can be done.  

It comes with a set of Hougue grips which really improve the hold on the gun for someone with small to midsized hands like me.  I also have a set of Pachmeyr grips for it somewhere that were a bit bulkier, and if I can find them, they will go with as well.
It comes with the factory box and factory 15 round mag with the gun at this price.

 If you are interested, I am selling separately 1 each Ramline and Mecgar 17 rounds magazines.  They make up to a 19 round magazine now that still fits inside the grip without overhanging if you want the ultimate in high capacity, although you may have to go the gunshow and pay the big $$ to find them these days.

I also have a Bianchi Shadow II 3 slot pancake holster (Model 7 Size 19 Part # 18656) which fits the Taurus models 92 and 99, and Berretta 92/96D Brigadier, 92/96F Centurion, 92F, 92FCM, 96F models

If you want all of it, I can bundle it all together as well, otherwise I'll sell the accessories after the pistol sells.

If you don't know the story behind the Taurus Models 92 and 99 and why it looks so close to the Beretta Model 92.  From their website:  the Taurus company purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92.
