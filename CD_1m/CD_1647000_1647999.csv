As I have read from different sources, competitors complained about the kick of the .45 at the matches and politcked for a .38 wadcutter version and they got it. There were three versions and they finally got it right with the Mark III. Beautiful deep bluing.

I bought it because my elderly brother, who used a .45 as a Marine in the 1950s, couldn't handle my .45 safely anymore. A friend recommended this model and my brother enjoyed the heck out of our time at the range from then on. It really does shoot softly. My brother recently passed away.

While EMAG remains 100% compatible with the AR15/M16 platform, its unique geometry is optimized for foreign-made weapons such as the British SA-80 (L85A1/A2, L86A1/A2, L22A1, L98A1/A2), HK 416, M27 IAR, and others.

EMAG features the same pop-off Impact/Dust Cover as the PMAG GEN M2 to prevent dirt and debris intrusion and protect the feedlips from potential impact damage during transit and storage. When not in use, the Impact/Dust Cover can be stored on the magazine's floorplate to prevent possible loss.

For easy and accurate identification of loaded round count via the large, dual-sided MagLevel windows, the stainless steel magazine spring is coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color. Numerical indicators are added to the body to identify 5, 15, and 25 loaded rounds.

Don't let the name fool you. It is certainly one of the better target and plinking ammunitions, and the powder burns relatively clean so it will function well in semi-autos, but it is definitely not ""match grade competition"" ammo.
Stop feeding the scalpers and prolonging this high priced and unavailable ammo nonsense!
In less than the last 60 days I have been able to get Federal Auto Match for $14.27 a box, Federal 9mm 100 round pack for $22.97, and Winchester 5.56 20 round box for $12.27 at only 2 nearby walmarts just by wandering in when I have free time and asking for it. Even the local gun shops are only running about 5% higher than last year, with the exception of a few who are acting like scalpers and will never get my business again.
I can appreciate selling ammo you don't need and making a couple extra bucks in these interesting times, but buying everything off the shelves and reselling at as much as 5 times the cost is BS!
It only takes a little patience and the ability to say ""NO, I will not take it in the rear for ammo"", and you too can buy it in the store again for a fair price.
This is a manipulated market and the scalpers are scaring you into buying from them by getting it before you can at the store. If you don't buy from them, they don't have the money to buy it out from under you anymore. Let them choke on it! 
I bought the Auto Match 22 LR just last week!
I bought my 3 boxes and left the rest for other customers. I did not take my whole family and buy it all.
Just take your time and don't expect to find it immediately. It took 2 months of going to the stores and most of the time leaving with nothing to get these. I like to use walmart.com too. It will give you a heads up as to what they've got.
Winchester 22 LR 555 round boxes were all over recently for around $25.00 but sold out fast. They'll be back soon. a little here and there, but the more the scalpers cannot afford to buy, the more we will start to find on the shelves again. Slow at first, then a lot. Hang tough and don't get robbed. In the last 2 weeks both cabellas and midway usa both sold 1000 round boxes of M-22 Winchester 22lr for nearly $50 a box. They sold out fast, but they had it at a FAIR price."

The dynamic dual-button tail switch design allows you to instantly access the disorienting 1000 lumen power when needed. This tactical light also allows you to use cutting edge Lithium-ion power supply technology.

This is the brighest tactical light on the market!  We deisgned this light because criminals break into your house at night.  The 1000 lumens serves two purposes.  If someone breaks into your home you can blind them with the light.  A criminal with a gun can't shoot when he is blind.  And, if it comes to the situation where we have no other choice but to shoot; 1000 lumens makes sure target acquisition is easily achieved.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer. We have 1 compact model in .40S&W left at The Arms Room 479-445-6 four eight zero"

It is 3 in the morning and you hear it, an intruder has entered your house.  You feel the pressure.

As your eyes begin to focus you reach over and grab your shotgun.  You rack in one of 14 rounds available to you in your 28.3"" shotty.  You turn on your 200 lumen Cree LED spot light that is incorporated into your shot gun.  You’re ready for whatever comes your way.  A dream?  Absolutely not!

A relatively new concept of the bullpup design has produced the UTAS (Ohh Tash) UTS-15 - A bullpup designed shotgun.

This gun is like little you have seen before.  It has dual magazines that sit and are loaded on top of the barrel.  This leaves the barrel in line with the shoulder reducing muzzle climb.

EASY TO OPERATE

The UTS-15 loads via two magazine doors that open up to expose the feed opening.  Each magazine can hold 7 rounds of 2 3/4"" shells and each magazine can hold up to 10  of the 1 3/4"" short shells.  You put one in the chamber and the is 15 or 21 rounds of blistering hell going down range at your intruder.  If you use 3"" shells you max capacity is 13.

GUARANTEED TO WORK

I have met these guys and I know one of the creators of this gun.  They feel that this gun will work or they will make it right.  As UTAS says, ""we will either fix it, replace it or refund your money....so long as there aren't tire tracks on it.""

If service is ever required it will be picked up at your door and shipped right back to you at the same address.  You can't get much more simple than that.

DON'T LET THIS BE A DREAM

The UTAS is still legal in all 50 states.  But soon Colorado will outlaw it.  Is your state next?  You must act now.

This gun can be in your hands in less than 4 weeks at a steal of a price at $1080 PLUS a free Blackhawk sling that has a bandolier that will hold 15 rounds.

Don't be unprepared when danger strikes, have your UTAS UTS-15 ready when you hear the bumps in the night.

*************************************
Now I am one of UTAS's bigger dealers and I get guns in every week.  I know just about all there is to know about the gun and I am here to answer any questions that you may have.  Here are some stats from their website:

The UTS-15 tactical shotgun is a 12 ga. pump action shotgun with two 7-round alternately feeding or selectable magazine tubes. The UTS-15 has a 28.3” overall length with a 18.5” barrel, chambered for 2 ½” 2 ¾” and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weight only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation

There are many accessories available for this gun and I deal in then all.  Just give me a call.

Add in a 200 lumens white tactical light as well as a 10 lumen navigation light and make all of the user controls instinctively activated, and you have the most complete sighting and target identification system on the market.

This pistol caliber carbine is a blast to shoot, VERY accurate -- silver dollar size groups with iron sights at 50+ yds .  Comes with 2 factory 10 round mags and the clips on the stock to hold 2 extra mags..  
    Great self defense gun -- short, easy to manipulate, packs a good punch but the 9mm won't over-penetrate through your neighbors house (if you ever have to use it for self defense indoors).  
    I was getting 1300-1400fps with regular loads, and it is factory rated for +P ammunition as well.  
    It's a ton of fun to shoot and best of all, with 9mm ammo, you can afford to shoot it!

This pistol caliber carbine is a blast to shoot, VERY accurate -- silver dollar size groups with iron sights at 50+ yds . Comes with 2 factory 10 round mags and the clips on the stock to hold 2 extra mags.. 
Great self defense gun -- short, easy to manipulate, packs a good punch but the 9mm won't over-penetrate through your neighbors house (if you ever have to use it for self defense indoors). 
I was getting 1300-1400fps with regular loads, and it is factory rated for +P ammunition as well.
It's a ton of fun to shoot and best of all, with 9mm ammo, you can afford to shoot it!  I wouldn't be selling, but I just got a 9mm JR carbine and I don't need three 9mm rifles. I keep my guns spotlessly cleaned and lubed (with Frog Lube only).  I've never had a FTE or FTF with this firearm.

No low-ballers, I'm not in a hurry to sell and it's priced right.
Please don't bother e-mailing me to ask if it's available, I'll take down the ad after it sells.

The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

I have received multiple emails, but none of the responders read the advertisement or met the criteria. Very simple, I am posting again and will put all the information I have. I am selling it at lower price, as I have other projects (non firearm related) I am working on, and would like to get going on those projects.

Firstly, I will only deal local face to face, no shipping on this rifle. 

I have had people ask about manufacture, age, caliber- Here is the down and dirty.

K98 (Mauser) used by the Nazi German military during world war 2. 

This is a Czech manufactured Mauser. As the Germans moved east they captured firearms manufacturing companies that had tooling and were producing mauser rifles and integrated them into their production. This rifle was manufactured in 1944, it was later captured by the Russians and while the Swastika and proof eagle and still visible, and stamped, the Swastika has been stamped out (now just an indent) the Eagle remains. The rifle is not original matching, as no Russian capture rifle was (to my knowledge) they were sent to various countries in the eastern bloc where they were disassembled, cleaned, and rebuilt and then electro penciled (so since the re-arsenal the rifle is matching). 

The rifle was brought in by Century, (probably the 90s?) and has the import mark hidden under the barrel (something they are not allowed to do anymore, and why all their imports have the ugly mark on the receiver) It was drilled and tapped and has reproduction high turret scope rings (repros go 100-200 dollars online) It has a scope (american made, non repro to original, Redfield 6x zoom). Currently the scope is not mounted or bore sighted, as I have been shooting irons. 

Rifle Details-
8mm caliber
Bore in excellent shape
Action clean and smooth
Usual milsurp wear and tear, no major flaws or damage
Shoots straight and with military ball ammo and iron sights I was getting sub 5 inch groups at 150 yards, I am sure with better ammo and the scope it shoots better. 

I will also include the scope, turret mounts (can see iron sights with scope attached) as well as 15 rounds of 8mm mauser (milsurp). 

M44 Nagant pictured with mauser has already been sold."

The only changes made to the internals was replacing the retaining spring with a Tapco retaining plate (much more durable and easier to remove and put back in when cleaning). The gun has functioned fine every time, and the bore is in very good bright condition (it's also chrome-lined).
