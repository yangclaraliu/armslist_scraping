what is the difference between a German Sig pro and a USA made one now days?  the finish is different, the German one has a larger internal extractor, it doesnt feel as cheap(if you know what i mean) and it doesnt have that goofy metal piece that acts as a loaded chamber indicator on top of the slide.  lets face it if you need that to tell you if your gun is loaded then you shouldnt be handling the big boy toys.

comes with 2 - 15rd mags, 1 - 10rd mag, night sights, extra grips

to the buyer an optional comp-tac iwb holster for an extra $45

my price is firm again as this is not the cheap academy or else where version, this is a German import before they moved production over here, someone who knows Sigs and appreciates the quality of the German/Swiss stuff will know what i mean."

A 26.5mm heavy duty, all steel construction flare pistol. Finish looks black in the pictures but it's actually a very dark gray - almost like it's parkerized. I think there is a very good chance it's unfired as there are no marks or burns in the barrel at all - it's bright and shiny. It does have some tiny handling/storage marks but is in overall excellent shape.

A Kennesaw Cannon Company .22LR adapter that allows any type of .22LR ammo to be fired safely in this flare gun. You simply open the action, drop it in and your flare is now a single shot 22 pistol. The adapter is still in it's original sealed package as I never opened it. It measures about 4"" long so it should  provide the same sort of velocity/power that any .22 pistol with a 4"" barrel would.

A dark green nylon lanyard strap that clips on to the pistol at the bottom of the grips.

A jumbo 26.5mm size cleaning rod.

An all leather carry case with green nylon shoulder carry strap in excellent shape. This case stores everything - the pistol, cleaning rod, .22 adapter & .22 ammo store on the front side & the 26.5mm cartridges store in stitched in loops on the rear. Both front and rear compartments are protected by button down leather flaps.

100 rounds of Remington Viper hyper-velocity .22LR ammo.

Finally (5) 26.5mm shells: (2) brilliant white parachute illumination rounds, (1) red rain round, & (2) orange smoke rounds (for daytime use). Note the standard 12 gauge shotgun shell in the last picture for comparison. The large shells are over 5 inches long and slightly over 1 inch in diameter so they dwarf the 12 gauge shotgun shell.

Asking Price for the complete outfit including the ammo described above is $225. This almost has to be a pick-up item because the flare cartridges can only be shipped by FedX as a hazardous material. So there is a large hazmat fee in addition to the regular shipping.

Last, because this flare pistol easily becomes a real firearm if the adapter is installed - I'm going to require that purchaser is at least 21 years old.

Thanks for looking."

-----------------------------
From BERETTA.COM:
The Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and
interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
6. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol. (not included)
7. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
9. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
10. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling."

The Smith and Wesson Model 39 was a semi-automatic pistol developed for the US Army service pistol trials of 1954.[1] After the Army abandoned its search for a new pistol, the Model 39 went on the civilian market in 1955 and was the first of Smith & Wesson's first generation semi-automatic pistols. Used by the Illinois State Police and the US Navy SEALs, it was a groundbreaking pistol for use with the military and law-enforcement agencies."

I am not one of the people you see on here who is selling dusty parts from their spare parts piles that they bought 2 years ago and now want to quadruple or more the price they paid. I HATE YOU PEOPLE - NO ONE IS GOING TO BAN AR-15s nationwide! Now if you live in a liberal state then that could happen but at the national level - NOT GONNA HAPPEN - READ MY LIPS! 

WHY AM I ASKING SO MUCH? Because unlike most people on here, I bought this stuff after everything went crazy because I was stupid, got caught up in the craziness myself and consequently paid a lot more than I should have. So now as it stands I'll lose my ass on all of it - even at the prices I'm asking here now I'm losing around 3 Benjamins! - lesson learned for me I guess.

In the end, I'll take the best deal I can get and cut my losses.

Having said that, if you insult me with a ridiculously low offer and it is apparent that you are low-balling me so that you can turn around and sell for more, or just want to kick a guy while he's down, I will tell you to take a hike. So what does that mean? It means if you offer me $160 for the barrel or $100 for a complete upper, you most likely won't get a response. Just being honest boys and girls! 

I will be glad to provide additional photos, answer any questions, or talk on the phone.

Prefer to meet face to face in Louisville area but will ship for cost of postage plus insurance

Cash is preferred but a paypal ""gift"" is okay too.

I’m not sure how this will work out but I thought I would give this a try and see how it goes!

I’m looking at selling or trading two cars and some spare parts for weapons, ammo, cash!

I really DON’T want to do this but I’m beginning to lose interest in the cars because they are just sitting around waiting for their next phase! I’m either going to get rid of everything and clear out my garage so I can have room to do the woodworking that I’ve wanted to do for over decade OR I’m going BIG, which means I’m going to sink another 10-12K in the car and make it a freaking monster – an XL clone with 427 Tri-power & 5 speed!

What I decide to do will depend on what kind of cash or weapon / ammo trade offers I get!

Make me a deal I can't refuse and both cars and the parts are yours to play with!

The two cars I'm offering are:

A very nice low mileage numbers matching Guardsman Blue 1964 Galaxie 500, 2 door sedan (Fastback) with two-tone blue interior (CAR IN AD PHOTOS)

A donor car - 1964 Galaxie 500 XL, 2 door, 390 4-BBL, console shift automatic

Some information on the Blue 289 car:

The Guardsman Blue (car in photos) has: the original a 289 2BBL engine and Auto. Transmission (Crusi-o-matic / C-4), PS, and PB. The car is 80+% restored. There's not much left to do to make it a show quality car. If you want a really nice daily driver or rod run car, it's ready for that now!

I'm supposedly the second owner of this car - technically, possibly the third. The car was sold at an estate sale in and I lost the bid, only to end up doing a side deal for an additional $1000 a few minutes later with the person who won the car! Don't ask! :-) Anyway, the guy who won the bid not only made a quick $1000 profit but he refused to let me just pay the auction house the selling price, then write him a check for the $1000 and then take the car home. NO - He made me bring cash to his dealership a few days later! I can't remember the details - whether or not his name was on the title already - but he gave me the title and I went to the local courthouse and had it put in my name. I'm pretty sure he didn't have enough time to have it put in his name in just those few days but just in case there was something going on that caused Frankfort to have the car in his name, that's why I may ""technically"" be the third owner!
Before the auction started I got a chance to talk to the original owners son. He said that he was pretty sure that his dad bought it new and as far as he knew it had always been kept in the same garage it was parked in when I first saw it at the auction. He said the car had just been painted and the engine was rebuilt but he wasn't sure about the transmission. Before the auction started, he started the car, it sounded great, there was no smoke, no unusual noises, so I believed him about the engine.

I drove the car about 50 miles home, it ran great, and I had no problems with it so I was still happy with the engine. The next day I checked the compression for each cylinder and took off the valve covers. It was clean inside and the pressures were all good so the engine was looking even better. Knowing I was going to detail the engine compartment and go through the car, I took a few days to pull and strip the engine down to a short-block. After carefully inspecting everything, it was apparent to me that the engine was in fact rebuilt recently – at that time.
Despite knowing that the engine was already fresh and all I really needed to do was install new gaskets and put everything back together, I spent several months cleaning, inspecting, repainting, rebuilding and replacing every part I took off of the engine. All male and female thread surfaces were cleaned with a tap and die set and solvent, blown out and then lightly oiled.
New internal parts include: master rebuild gasket set, oil pump, timing chain/gears, and freeze plugs.

The heads are not set up to run on un-leaded gas so you have to add lead to the tank each time you fill up the tank - not a big deal and it's relatively cheap and easy to find.

Other new parts added to the engine: OEM distributer, cap and internals; coil, plugs & wires; water pump; fuel pump, and generator.
All engine brackets and attaching parts were made to look better than new – cleaned, stripped, and or bead blasted - and then primed and painted as necessary to the proper paint code.

The transmission was rebuilt locally and it was installed with a new filter, torque converter, and modulator valve.

I completely stripped the front end of this car down to it's bare bones (the frame) - from the firewall forward. Then I cleaned, rebuilt, refinished or replaced EVERY THING!
Most replacement parts are either NOS FOMOCO, brand new FOMOCO, FOMOCO licensed reproductions, or a high quality name brands. I went to great lengths to get as close as I could to making this car look just as good and in some cases better than it did on the day it rolled off of the assembly line. Some subtle modifications / substitutions were made but you will really have to know these cars to find them!
All new ""MOOG"" front suspension parts.
All new or rebuilt Power Steering parts.
The brakes were gone through, inside out, from front to rear, and they now stop the car on a dime! I bead blasted, painted, and then resurfaced the OEM drums; replaced the wheel bearings and seals; installed new hydraulic wheel / brake cylinders; put on new pads with all new attaching hardware and springs - all 4 wheels have new parts on them.
I also put on a new OEM style brake fluid reservoir W/ OEM style cap with a new power brake unit behind it. I even put SILICONE brake fluid in the system so it won't rust from the inside out!
NOTE - you CAN NOT mix normal Dot 3 brake fluid with silicone brake fluid! With this car You will either have to add silicone fluid whenever you need it OR you will have to drain and flush the whole system, then remove all traces of the silicone fluid with a solvent - alcohol works best - and then replace with DOT 3 and re-bleed the whole system.

Both front fenders and fender wells were stripped, bead blasted, primed and painted. The underside of the inner fender-well and most of the underside of the car was also undercoated with eastwood rubberized undercoating.
All of the rubber spacers and seals for the fenders and radiator core support, and most of the fasteners (mounting bolts and cage nuts) were replaced with new OEM style replacements.
The original radiator was replaced with a good quality after market radiator.
I dropped the gas tank, flushed it out, stripped and cleaned the outside, then I primed, painted and undercoated it. Since I had the tank out I stripped off the road grime, undercoating and paint from the underside of the trunk pan. I sandblasted some minor surface rust areas and the tank straps and then I zinc primer coated the whole area, painted everything, and added rubberized undercoating. Before I installed the tank I replaced the fuel sending unit, ran a new steel gas line all the way to the front and replaced the rubber hoses on both ends.

I went through the rear brakes and did some work on the rear end. I bead blasted, painted, and then turned the rear drums. I replaced the rear axle seals and bearings; the hydraulic brake cylinders; the brake pads, attaching hardware and springs; and the metal brake lines.
I did not pull the whole rear end and springs out of the car like I wanted to but I did drain and refill the hoghead with high temp gear oil after I replaced the gasket, yoke seal and both U-joints. No leaks and no strange noises in the rear end!
The rear end of the car does sag a little so I have a brand new set of replacement leaf springs that I will include with the trade.
The inside of the trunk is clean – no rust! It has the original liner and jack assembly, both of which are in very nice condition and the trunk does not leak!

All of the chrome and stainless trim is in really nice condition. The glass looks great except the windshield which has a BB ding along the bottom few inches, almost centered left to right, and clearly out of your field of view. The donor car has a good windshield in it!

The car has new radial tires – has a very smooth ride.

The interior is a 9.5 out of 10. The headliner and padded dash were replaced and all of the seat covers were professionally recovered. The carpet and door panels are like new originals. The OEM Radio, clock, gauges, lighter, speedometer, dash lights, switches, heater and controls, all work and look great!

Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlin_Model_60

""The Model 60 has a manual ""fully open"" bolt hold position, activated by pushing the charging handle inwards towards the gun when it is in the fully retracted, open breech position. To close the bolt with the manual bolt hold-open engaged, the charging handle must be pulled out, away from the gun, before the bolt will go forward. Since 1985, the Model 60 has also included a patented automatic ""last-shot"" bolt hold-open. This latter feature is a safety feature that locks the bolt half-way open after the last cartridge is fired, thereby allowing the safe inspection of the now-open action. This also notifies the user when the gun is empty..............During the late-1980s, the capacity of the rifle was reduced to a 15 round maximum limit, to meet New Jersey's firearms law for semi-automatic assault weapons. For a few years in the mid-1980s the Model 60 rifles had both the ""last shot hold open"" feature and also held 18 rounds in the tube magazine. Those rifles with those two features are among the most sought after Model 60s. ........"""

Check gunbroker, I'm not out of line.  And I'm open to offers.  If you have a problem, move to North Korea where you can hang with Dennis Rodman.

Product Information:
 The Lancer Systems L5AWM Magazine is a polymer and steel hybrid that combines the best features of each material. The one-piece steel feed lip unit is permanently fixed to the polymer body. The steel is hardened so the dimensions will not change in long term storage or rough use. The PTFE coating ensures the steel will not rust. The polymer body is designed with an internal dimension that is a constant curve, combined with a no-tilt follower for maximum reliability in feeding 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition. The exterior texture of the polymer body is aggressive for improved grip when changing magazines. The steel feed lip assembly and the polymer body are corrosion and chemical resistant. The Floor plate slides off similar to a USGI magazine for cleaning and maintenance.

The rifle is in beautiful condition, comes with the carrying case and even the barrel tool and front sight hood! The butt plate has a small length of cord that allows you to pull it off without tools, allowing you to store useful items such as more ammo or magazines. This model also features a bolt-hold lever, making it easier to keep your shooting grip while you chamber the next round. The Micro-Groove rifling makes for a very accurate shooter, the bright orange front sight blade is easy to pick out for fast shooting, and the barrel has never come loose on me. She feeds reliably and easts anything, a must for any survival rifle. Best of all, everything breaks down and fits in the factory dark blue nylon bag (which floats!), blends in without screaming ""I have a gun!"" to the world. 

In short, this is a must-have survival gun. Ammo is cheap and you can pack a ton of it, the stock has storage space, the gun is very reliable and accurate, and the stainless barrel will make maintenance a breeze in whatever post-disaster world you envision yourself in. You could easily use this rifle to feed and defend yourself, and break everything down into a tennis racket case so you can carry on without drawing attention to yourself. 

Comes with the following: 
Marlin Papoose in stainless
Floating carry case
Two 7-round nickel coated magazines (one is NIB!)
Barrel tool

No rust on the gun, barrel and sight are straight, less than 400 rounds through the gun. Hard to come by, but easy to love. Buyer pays $400 (shipping included) with USPS Delivery Confirmation and Insurance to your FFL. Sorry California & New York, you won't be shooting zombies with this thing-- blame your elected officials! Payment via USPS money order only please.

P.S. The paper in the pic is the Hawaii State license for this rifle to show that it is legal; HI State driver's license copy to be sent with rifle to your FFL."

I’m not sure how this will work out but I thought I would give this a try and see how it goes!

I’m looking at selling or trading two cars and some spare parts for weapons, ammo, cash!

I really DON’T want to do this but I’m beginning to lose interest in the cars because they are just sitting around waiting for their next phase! I’m either going to get rid of everything and clear out my garage so I can have room to do the woodworking that I’ve wanted to do for over decade OR I’m going BIG, which means I’m going to sink another 10-12K in the car and make it a freaking monster – an XL clone with 427 Tri-power & 5 speed!

What I decide to do will depend on what kind of cash or weapon / ammo trade offers I get!

Make me a deal I can't refuse and both cars and the parts are yours to play with!

The two cars I'm offering are:

A very nice low mileage numbers matching Guardsman Blue 1964 Galaxie 500, 2 door sedan (Fastback) with two-tone blue interior (CAR IN AD PHOTOS)

A donor car - 1964 Galaxie 500 XL, 2 door, 390 4-BBL, console shift automatic

Some information on the Blue 289 car:

The Guardsman Blue (car in photos) has: the original a 289 2BBL engine and Auto. Transmission (Crusi-o-matic / C-4), PS, and PB. The car is 80+% restored. There's not much left to do to make it a show quality car. If you want a really nice daily driver or rod run car, it's ready for that now!

I'm supposedly the second owner of this car - technically, possibly the third. The car was sold at an estate sale in and I lost the bid, only to end up doing a side deal for an additional $1000 a few minutes later with the person who won the car! Don't ask! :-) Anyway, the guy who won the bid not only made a quick $1000 profit but he refused to let me just pay the auction house the selling price, then write him a check for the $1000 and then take the car home. NO - He made me bring cash to his dealership a few days later! I can't remember the details - whether or not his name was on the title already - but he gave me the title and I went to the local courthouse and had it put in my name. I'm pretty sure he didn't have enough time to have it put in his name in just those few days but just in case there was something going on that caused Frankfort to have the car in his name, that's why I may ""technically"" be the third owner!
Before the auction started I got a chance to talk to the original owners son. He said that he was pretty sure that his dad bought it new and as far as he knew it had always been kept in the same garage it was parked in when I first saw it at the auction. He said the car had just been painted and the engine was rebuilt but he wasn't sure about the transmission. Before the auction started, he started the car, it sounded great, there was no smoke, no unusual noises, so I believed him about the engine.

I drove the car about 50 miles home, it ran great, and I had no problems with it so I was still happy with the engine. The next day I checked the compression for each cylinder and took off the valve covers. It was clean inside and the pressures were all good so the engine was looking even better. Knowing I was going to detail the engine compartment and go through the car, I took a few days to pull and strip the engine down to a short-block. After carefully inspecting everything, it was apparent to me that the engine was in fact rebuilt recently – at that time.
Despite knowing that the engine was already fresh and all I really needed to do was install new gaskets and put everything back together, I spent several months cleaning, inspecting, repainting, rebuilding and replacing every part I took off of the engine. All male and female thread surfaces were cleaned with a tap and die set and solvent, blown out and then lightly oiled.
New internal parts include: master rebuild gasket set, oil pump, timing chain/gears, and freeze plugs.

The heads are not set up to run on un-leaded gas so you have to add lead to the tank each time you fill up the tank - not a big deal and it's relatively cheap and easy to find.

Other new parts added to the engine: OEM distributer, cap and internals; coil, plugs & wires; water pump; fuel pump, and generator.
All engine brackets and attaching parts were made to look better than new – cleaned, stripped, and or bead blasted - and then primed and painted as necessary to the proper paint code.

The transmission was rebuilt locally and it was installed with a new filter, torque converter, and modulator valve.

I completely stripped the front end of this car down to it's bare bones (the frame) - from the firewall forward. Then I cleaned, rebuilt, refinished or replaced EVERY THING!
Most replacement parts are either NOS FOMOCO, brand new FOMOCO, FOMOCO licensed reproductions, or a high quality name brands. I went to great lengths to get as close as I could to making this car look just as good and in some cases better than it did on the day it rolled off of the assembly line. Some subtle modifications / substitutions were made but you will really have to know these cars to find them!
All new ""MOOG"" front suspension parts.
All new or rebuilt Power Steering parts.
The brakes were gone through, inside out, from front to rear, and they now stop the car on a dime! I bead blasted, painted, and then resurfaced the OEM drums; replaced the wheel bearings and seals; installed new hydraulic wheel / brake cylinders; put on new pads with all new attaching hardware and springs - all 4 wheels have new parts on them.
I also put on a new OEM style brake fluid reservoir W/ OEM style cap with a new power brake unit behind it. I even put SILICONE brake fluid in the system so it won't rust from the inside out!
NOTE - you CAN NOT mix normal Dot 3 brake fluid with silicone brake fluid! With this car You will either have to add silicone fluid whenever you need it OR you will have to drain and flush the whole system, then remove all traces of the silicone fluid with a solvent - alcohol works best - and then replace with DOT 3 and re-bleed the whole system.

Both front fenders and fender wells were stripped, bead blasted, primed and painted. The underside of the inner fender-well and most of the underside of the car was also undercoated with eastwood rubberized undercoating.
All of the rubber spacers and seals for the fenders and radiator core support, and most of the fasteners (mounting bolts and cage nuts) were replaced with new OEM style replacements.
The original radiator was replaced with a good quality after market radiator.
I dropped the gas tank, flushed it out, stripped and cleaned the outside, then I primed, painted and undercoated it. Since I had the tank out I stripped off the road grime, undercoating and paint from the underside of the trunk pan. I sandblasted some minor surface rust areas and the tank straps and then I zinc primer coated the whole area, painted everything, and added rubberized undercoating. Before I installed the tank I replaced the fuel sending unit, ran a new steel gas line all the way to the front and replaced the rubber hoses on both ends.

I went through the rear brakes and did some work on the rear end. I bead blasted, painted, and then turned the rear drums. I replaced the rear axle seals and bearings; the hydraulic brake cylinders; the brake pads, attaching hardware and springs; and the metal brake lines.
I did not pull the whole rear end and springs out of the car like I wanted to but I did drain and refill the hoghead with high temp gear oil after I replaced the gasket, yoke seal and both U-joints. No leaks and no strange noises in the rear end!
The rear end of the car does sag a little so I have a brand new set of replacement leaf springs that I will include with the trade.
The inside of the trunk is clean – no rust! It has the original liner and jack assembly, both of which are in very nice condition and the trunk does not leak!

All of the chrome and stainless trim is in really nice condition. The glass looks great except the windshield which has a BB ding along the bottom few inches, almost centered left to right, and clearly out of your field of view. The donor car has a good windshield in it!

The car has new radial tires – has a very smooth ride.

The interior is a 9.5 out of 10. The headliner and padded dash were replaced and all of the seat covers were professionally recovered. The carpet and door panels are like new originals. The OEM Radio, clock, gauges, lighter, speedometer, dash lights, switches, heater and controls, all work and look great!

I have for sale a DPMS Lite-16 with:
Magpul adjustable 6 position sliding stock
Magpul pistol grip with storage/battery compartment
Magpul trigger guard with battery compartment in bottom
Magpul sling mount
Magpul hand guard
Magpul 20 round Pmag
Magpul single point tactical sling
(above items all in matching OD Green)
Magpul rails
Magpul vertical grip
NcStar rear adjustable peep sight
new front sight (with a crosshair built into the winged sight) with bayonet lug and front sling mount
muzzle brake
UTG CQB red/green dot sight with two quick-release mounts, integrated sunshade, flip-up covers, and extra battery
UTG flashlight with pressure switch that mounts on the side rail
2 brand new 30 round Gen2 Magpul Pmags in the plastic
Factory hard case
100 rounds of PMC Bronze .223 ammunition to get you started since it's so hard to find these days (not pictured)
Seven-pocket US military AR 15/M16 bandoleer with pin and strap (not pictured)
Two magazine couplers/clamps for quick magazine changes (not pictured)

This is a lightly used gun. It shows some sign of wear but is in great shape with no abuse. A few marks on the rear sling post, some residue from the pressure switch mounting on the forward vertical grip, etc. It works great in the daylight or at night, however, and is very accurate as well as lighter than your standard AR, even with all the extras attached.  This is everything you need in one package, whether you're an AR veteran or looking to enter into the black rifle world.

I'm hoping to get cash for this to pay the doctor bill for my baby, so I'm not really looking for trades at this time. However, if you have a 9mm or .45 handgun you need/want to get rid of and are willing to add cash to it I may consider a trade. Lowballers will be ignored. I'm willing to drive a little ways to meet if you're coming from a long distance away. Prefer face to face meeting with cash only.  Wisconsin ID required, and CCW preferred so I know you have a clear background. If you have any questions (other than ""do you still have this?"") please feel free to contact me."

I just need some ammo for practice and some shooting competitions.  Best way to get a hold of me is text my cell 308-520-78five3.  Thanks."
