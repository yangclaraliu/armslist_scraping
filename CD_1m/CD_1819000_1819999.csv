It has a 28"" barrel that is marked 38 CAL C.F.C.. It’s in very good condition and is 100% correct. It is all there in original and never molested condition. Wood is in great shape, both sights are next to perfect, action is tight and crisp, trigger is firm, iron is what you would expect on something this age with some original bluing left. The bore is pretty clean and has good rifling. The only negative (if you can call it that) is there is a little of what looks like very slight pitting in the bore valleys in a couple spots only. My guess is, it is possibly from condensation collecting while resting on a wall type gun rack for years and years, as it is only visible on the bottom side of the bore (this is a family heirloom, so I grew up seeing it on that rack LOL). I see no reason it shouldn't be able to shoot just fine. For those that don't know, the Whitney Arms Co. is the predecessor of Remington, and E.L. Whitney, the cotton gin guy we all learned about in grade school, is the same Whitney that designed and manufactured these firearms, that in time sold his company out to Remington, who actually continued this style of rifle for awhile.

This build was done using quality components from proven manufacturers - Adams Arms & Stag Arms (details below - Adams Arms operators manual and warranty info included). After assembly it was test fired and then cleaned. It functions very smooth with very little recoil. This item also comes with one 30 round Gen 2 PMAG (with window) or one 10 round aluminum magazine (if high capacity mags are not allowed where you live). It also comes in a metal exterior, padded interior hard case. Since this is a pistol, not a short barreled rifle, NFA & Class III regulations do not apply. However, please verify this item is allowed to be owned where you live. Additional details are below. Feel free to ask any questions you have. Shipping is FREE anywhere in the continental US. I accept the following forms of payment:PayPal, money order, or cashiers check. Adams Arms’ proven piston system doesn’t vent hot gases and burned powder into the bolt carrier and receiver, so the gun runs cooler, with less fouling and wear on the action, and easier maintenance. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling, smoother feeding, and reduced felt recoil. The receiver is forged from 6061 T6 aluminum and features M4 feed ramp cuts and a 13-slot Picatinny-cut flattop rail. The adjustable gas block allows three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Picatinny rail on top of gas block accepts a variety of clamp-on tactical sights. It has a chrome-lined barrel chambered for 5.56mm NATO, with an A2 flash hider and a black Melonite® finish for superb wear resistance and up to 60% more corrosion resistance than traditional phosphate coating. We've also added a 4"" Samson drop in rail for any shooters tactical options. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper. Caliber: 5.56x45mm NATO/223 Remington Barrel Length: 7.5"" Barrel Twist: 1:7 Barrel Profile: Medium Contour Gas Length: Pistol Fore Arm: 2 Piece Drop In Quad Rail Flash Hider: A2 Flash Hider Overall Length: 16.5"" The lower is a brand new, STAG ARMS AR-15 complete pistol lower receiver with Rock River Arms pistol buffer tube and a Hogue rubber pistol grip.

All Stag Arms receivers are made of forged 7075 T6 Aircraft quality Aluminum. The are all bead blasted and coated with TYPE III CLASS 2 HARD COAT to insure strength, and durability."

There are instructions on the internet showing the use of washers and other parts. This is unreliable and unsafe! Use an actual part that is designed for the job. This lets the hammer move properly and at the correct speed. You will be pleased with the fit and final result with this bushing. If you know how to clean this gun you can easily remove the disconnect. Removing the disconnect allows the magazines to fall free, allows them to seat properly and does allow the gun to fire with the magazine out for tactical competition and self-defense scenarios.

The Px4 Inox brings a fresh look and unique style to the Px4 family. Starting from a solid bar of stainless steel, the slide is bead blasted to a smooth satin finish, ensuring a non-reflective surface that is highly resistant to the elements (barrel is black). Mated to the highly refined, techno-polymer reinforced fiberglass frame, the Px4 Inox is optimized for use in the most challenging environments.Together they create a two-tone finish that is not only practical and functional, but distinctly attractive.These features make the Px4 Inox perfectly suited to humid climates or harsh environments.The Inox continues to maintain the proven features of the Px4 line of pistols.The three interchangeable backstraps make fitting most shooters with different sized hands quick and easy.The magazine release is easily changed to accommodate both right- or left-handed shooters, and the unparalleled reliability of the in-line feeding system keeps the Inox running shot after shot.The Px4 Inox epitomizes functional elegance for the most demanding shooter.

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

It is not cracked or anything so I just think it needs a battery.

310,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1819310,"For Sale:  Beretta PX4 Storm, 40S&W Full Size","Fortville, Indianapolis, Indiana",$ 589,"Listed On: Monday, August 5, 2013",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and
interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds.

9. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

10. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.

11. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

12. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

I'm looking for a smaller 9mm or 45 like a Nano , XDS, or something in that size range. I'm willing to trade or sale. It's been to the gun range once and has been in the case you see in the photo ever since. I shot less than 100 rounds through it because bullets are very hard to come by, and I needed to keep some for protection. Let me know if you are interested. 

Thank you

Description

The FNH FNAR is a semi-automatic tactical rifle chambered in .308 Win. or 7.62 NATO.

The FNAR has three sub-models: standard, heavy and standard 16”, but they all use the same action.

The FNAR is made out of a lightweight aircraft grade aluminum alloy. It has a cold hammer forged barrel, which means a machine carefully rifled it and it will shoot straight for a long time. On the tip of the barrel is a target crown, which helps maintain barrel harmonics so the rifle doesn’t vibrate too much and throw off the trajectory of the round. It has an ambidextrous magazine release. The upper receiver is forged with a Picatinny rail and three rails on the sides and bottom of the fore-end for easy mounting of scopes, sights, lights, lasers, or grips.

FNH recommends the FNAR for leisure, sport and competitive shooting."

This gun is the commercial version, and the 6th variant (there were six model variants?). The Ortgies pocket pistols were made (officially) from 1919 to 1924. This particular gun (according to the serial number) was made around 1922-23. The Orgies semi-automatic pistols were excellent, well made guns. The design was ahead of its time. This gun has the factory original 7rd magazine. Overall, this gun is in very good condition. Has all matching numbers (barrel, frame, slide). Bluing is in really good condition for its age (this gun is at least 90 years old). All original finish, not re-blued, or anything like that. Has factory wood grips. The grips has no cracks, splits, or damages. Has a few minor dents and dings. Barrel is in very good condition - has a few minor surface rust. Bore is in very good condition. Has a a few minor rust (the Germans or people back in the old days used highly corrosive ammo). In addition, there's an old Ortgies owner's manual. It's really worn out, tattered, but all the pages are there (but not intact - it looks like as old as the gun itself). You must be at least 21 years old or older and have a valid Kentucky driver's license (KY CCDW) to buy/trade this gun. Local (Kentucky) sale/trade only. No shipping. Just email me with any questions. Serious inquiries only please. Thanks for looking.

 -- Below is an excerpt from one of the Ortgies websites. It is not my own. I am just giving a credit to the author/creator of that particular website. You can do a google (or yahoo) search on this particular pistol on the internet. There are several Ortgies websites on line --

 "" The Ortgies pistol has a number of unusual design features. The most obvious is its grip safety which, once squeezed, stays in the “fire” position without further pressure of the hand on the grip. A button on the left side of the gun allows the grip safety to pop back out. Since the grip safety is powered by the striker spring, the safety can only be popped out, i.e., placed in the “safe” position, when the striker is cocked. Hence, if the safety is enabled, the gun is cocked. When the grip safety is enabled, the sear is prevented from moving downward and the tension on the striker spring is reduced. Pressing the safety- enabling button also allows the slide to be lifted off the frame rail for disassembly. The striker serves as the ejector. ""

SEVERAL GUN SHOP EMPLOYEES I'VE TALKED TO SAY THEY WILL NO LONGER BE DOING TRANSFERS!  I KNOW I'M ASKING TOP DOLLAR FOR THESE GUNS, SO I'M ACCEPTING OFFERS. LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO!  THE WORST I'M GOING TO SAY IS NO!!!!

Hello, I need to sell a gun or two to pay for my new ones. I'm sure you guys know how that is. Don't need or want to sell all, but figured it would be easier to make one ad. So here goes...

I have a Saiga 12 with a Tapco adjustable stock, original 4 round mag, and a nib Pro Mag 20 round drum. Has maybe 500 rounds thru it. No damage, but it is used and works great. Also has different barrel thread protector and different sight on top(not a big deal, but they're aftermarket). I want $1,500 for it.

I have a Springfield XDM competition model with fully adjustble rear sight (elevation and windage) with the 5.25 inch barrel chambered in 9mm Luger. This gun has maybe 80 rounds or so thru it. It will come with 5 total 19 round mags, and 100+ rounds (brass cased) as well as all the XD gear (mag holder, holster, case etc). This gun is looks and functions like new. This obviously isn't like rifles, this is full size model which can only accept 19 round mags. That being said, you will not see these for sale in Colorado next week. In addition to that, you cannot buy a handgun from neighboring states like you can long guns. This may very well be your last chance to get your hands on one of these. I want $1,200 for everything. 

Last but definately not least...my Draco pistol. This is a Romanian AK style pistol chambered in 7.62x39 imported by C.A.I. (I believe). I have two original steel mags and rubber Hogue grip and 760 rounds of Tul-ammo (some FMJ but mostly HP). This gun has no more than 25 rounds thru it and looks and functions like brand new. I want $1,300 for everything. 

I am only selling the guns with the apropriate things with them and will not split things up (like mags, ammo etc). I will make a deal to you if you buy multiple guns. I am not accepting trade offers, sorry guys!!!!! All prices are firm. I'm not trying to gouge anybody, just trying to get what i have out of these things. I unfornuately can't find a deal on anything to save my life so I need what I need. Please don't tell me you just bought one for x amount, I know there are deals out there to be had, I just wasn't so lucky. Best way to get ahold of me is to call/text me at REDACTED. If i don't answer, it's just because i'm busy, so please leave name number and what your interested in and I WILL get back to you when I get a chance. I am a motivated seller, as I only have 6 days to get these sold. Sorry, but in can only text pictures. FYI, I live in Byers (which is about 40 miles east of Aurora) but will meet in Aurora (somewhere around Tower and I-70) if your a serious buyer. Sorry, but i cannot drive that far to have people take a look. If you come to my place you could test fire (that's a couple rounds, not 100). Will do Bill of Sale!"

Please be advised that after posting these handguns, I have had several people try to purchase them illegally.  I require from my sellers, what the current North Carolina requires for a face to face....that the buyer either have a Concealed Carry Handgun Permit or a Purchase Permit.  I will not violate the law and jeopardize my freedom and right to bear arms, to sell to someone who thinks they can buy a gun online without being legally allowed to do so."

This was a very popular gun back in the day and won a few shooting competitions.  I only have 1 mag for the gun but will throw in 250 rounds of 380 ammo into the sale because I need the cash to pay bills as I was just laid off.  BE WARNED 150 rounds are good ammo that I bought from the store HOWEVER 100 rounds I got from a pick and pull type place where you look through and pick out bullets and pay for bullet so they may not all fire and some could be dangerous, just saying be careful and to inspect the bullets before you attempt to fire.  So with the going rate of $30 bucks a box and $10 bucks a box of questionable ammo you are only paying $150 for the gun if you think about it, which is a really good deal considering I haven't seen these guns cheaper than $220.
