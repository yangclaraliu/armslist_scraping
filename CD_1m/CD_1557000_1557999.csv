The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

The two glocks listed below are for sale;
1)	Glock 19, Gen 3 with 2 magazines and trijicon night sights. Approximately 1500 =/- factory ammo through it (about 10 range trips, cleaned after each one). Little to zero finish wear. Standard barrel hood finish wear. Gun was very well maintained and has never had a failure to fire (it’s a glock! Neither one has!); mostly kept in safe till range time or next to the bed. 

2)	Glock 30sf, Gen 3 with 2 10 round mags (1 with the pierce grip) and a flush fitting 9 round mag that makes it just a bit larger than baby glocks. Only 200 rounds of Remington white box through it (two range trips, 100 each) and 5 rounds of Horniday Critical Defense. Literally zero inside wear, some outside minor finish wear from kydex carry holder. This glock also comes with the Kdyex holster mentioned (DeadEyeLuke). Also has Talon Grips.

I am looking for 500OBO for each glock; I am not really interested in many trades I need the money to use towards other projects. I am in the Harrisburg area and will travel (within 30 or so min) to meet and sell/trade. I WILL NOT SHIP! Face to face only please. I am in no real rush to sell these so please don’t give very lowball offers…they can continue to sit in my safe, I’m in no rush! I consider these very fair prices for these guns; and I am willing to negotiate within reason.

Trades I will consider: 1911s (Springfield, Colt, etc) Yes I can add cash. 9mm Sigs? ONLY 9mm or 45ACP please, I am vested in these calibers. Although, I may be interested in a S&W 686+…

Flashlight is slightly used and is in new condition.

Information from Surefire:
Kroma - Selectable Output / Multi-Spectrum LED Flashlight.

Compact (pocket sized), high-intensity, selectable-output/multi-spectrum LED flashlight for tactical, self-defense, recreational, and general use. The Kroma's virtually indestructible primary light emitting diode (LED) provides two output levels of white light: a long-running low beam and a brilliant, tactical-level high beam with nearly three times the light of a larger two-D-cell flashlight—enough light to temporarily blind an assailant. Its TIR (total internal reflection) lens ensures that the primary beam is perfectly focused—no dark holes, hot spots, or shadows. Red and blue secondary LEDs also feature two output levels suitable for operations requiring minimal light; for preserving night vision while navigating, tracking, map reading, or other close work; or for negotiating outdoor terrain without disturbing wildlife (many animals can't see red light). A rotating selector ring allows for no-look control—just twist to change beam color or output level.

Features
Selectable, dual-output white primary beam and dual-output secondary beams of blue and red
Electronically controlled LED light source has no filament to burn out or break, lasts for thousands of hours
Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens produces tightly focused central beam
Rugged aerospace-grade aluminum body, Mil-Spec Type III hard anodized in black
O-ring sealed, weatherproof
Tempered Pyrex window
Heavy-duty pocket clip
Tailcap switch: press for momentary-on low beams, press further for momentary-on high white beam; twist for constant-on low or high beams
Switch lockout prevents accidental activation during transport or storage
Output/Runtimes:
White high: 50 lumens / 1.5 hrs
White low: 1.4 lumens / 20 hrs
Blue high: 3.4 lumens / 8 hrs
Blue low: .48 lumens / 80 hrs
Red high: 6.3 lumens / 8 hrs
Red low: .52 lumens / 80 hrs

I can meet you in the west Knoxville or Downtown areas. I can also ship the flashlight to you if you prefer... just email me a label or I can do it for you with addition of the shipping cost."

This is not necessarily a wall hanger since it is able to shoot. Make cash offer or would like to trade. REDACTED

377,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1557377,For Sale/Trade:  Pentagon May Court Martial Soldiers Who Share Christian Faith,"ALL/USA, Dayton, Ohio",$ 111,"Listed On: Thursday, May 2, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Pentagon May Court Martial Soldiers Who Share Christian Faith 
Doesn't this make you sick?
I really hate to see this, especially when there's a Muslim Mosque located within the Pentagon...
I hope this indeed means all faith, including the Muslim faith, otherwise we have to admit they have now gotten a strong foothold within our military, as well a our everyday lives.

""The Pentagon has released a statement confirming that soldiers could be prosecuted for promoting their faith: ""Religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense...Court martials and non-judicial punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis...”. 

The statement, released to Fox News, follows a Breitbart News report on Obama administration Pentagon appointees meeting with anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein to develop court-martial procedures to punish Christians in the military who express or share their faith. 

(From our earlier report: Weinstein is the head of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, and says Christians--including chaplains--sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ in the military are guilty of “treason,” and of committing an act of “spiritual rape” as serious a crime as “sexual assault.” He also asserted that Christians sharing their faith in the military are “enemies of the Constitution.”)

Being convicted in a court martial means that a soldier has committed a crime under federal military law. Punishment for a court martial can include imprisonment and being dishonorably discharged from the military. 

So President Barack Obama’s civilian appointees who lead the Pentagon are confirming that the military will make it a crime--possibly resulting in imprisonment--for those in uniform to share their faith. This would include chaplains—military officers who are ordained clergymen of their faith (mostly Christian pastors or priests, or Jewish rabbis)--whose duty since the founding of the U.S. military under George Washington is to teach their faith and minister to the spiritual needs of troops who come to them for counsel, instruction, or comfort.

This regulation would severely limit expressions of faith in the military, even on a one-to-one basis between close friends. It could also effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military, as it would not allow chaplains (or any service members, for that matter), to say anything about their faith that others say led them to think they were being encouraged to make faith part of their life. It’s difficult to imagine how a member of the clergy could give spiritual counseling without saying anything that might be perceived in that fashion.

In response to the Pentagon’s plans, retired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin, who is now executive vice president of the Family Research Council (FRC), said on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning:

It’s a matter of what do they mean by ""proselytizing."" ...I think they’ve got their defintions a little confused. If you’re talking about coercion that’s one thing, but if you’re talking about the free exercise of our faith as individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, especially for the chaplains, they I think the worst thing we can do is stop the ability for a soldier to be able to exercise his faith.”

FRC has launched a petition here which has already collected over 30,000 signatures, calling on Secretary Hagel is stop working with Weinstein and his anti-Christian organization to develop military policy regarding religious faith.

**UPDATE**

The FRC petition has now exceeded more than 40,000 signatures at the time of this update.""

As the add states;  I am willing to sell the majority of the ammo off at fair prices, but I don't want to sell it to 500 different people.  All of these are new in box and are NOT re-loads.  They are all new within the last 2 years.  So here is the deal:

.223
100,000 - Rounds of PMC Bronze 55gr - $40,000.00

Buy them all for $125,000.00 and all throw in a bunch of ammo cans.  These prices are much less then what ammo is going for.  I will not negotiate the price.  You either want it at a steal or you don't.

These 80% Lower Receivers are made from a solid piece of billet 6061 aluminum. These 80% units provide you with an excellent receiver. There is machining required to render these 80% units operational. The material where the control group (hammer/trigger assembly) is located must be removed. 3 holes must be drilled in total, 2 for the hammer/trigger pins, and 1 for the selector switch. All other machining visible in images has been completed. All other holes have been drilled or tapped.

Our units also come with threaded bolt catch pin holes which negate the use of a hammer and punch. Instead, you simply insert the solid pin (included) and secure with a set screw (also included). We have also threaded the takedown pin detent spring hole. This makes installation of the buffer tube assembly much less cumbersome.

It does not include a muzzle device but I will throw in a set of Magpul MBUS sights and a Magpul AFG2 fore-grip.  This was an upper that I built with intention of using it on a pistol lower but I don't want to waste my only stripped lower on building a pistol, especially with how hard it is to find a stripped lower these days.  I have test fired this on a friend's pistol lower, so it has a 15-round mag through it.  Been in the gun locker since then.  From what I understand, you can build one of these through Daniel Defense's website for $1200 but it does not have the full-auto rated BCM BCG or the BCM Gunfighter charging handle.  The BCM BCGs are going for $400-450 alone right now.  $800 or please make a REASONABLE offer.


*Check local laws before contacting me.  As this upper is in its current state, it must go on a pistol lower, registered SBR, or you must permanently attach a 1.5"" muzzle device before mating it with a non-SBR registered lower.  I am not responsible for you creating an NFA-restricted firearm."

I have an absolutely beautiful Ruger 77/17 .17 HMR rifle with an American Walnut stock and superb bluing on the barrel and receiver. It has a factory polished stainless bolt assembly with a factory installed titanium firing pin. This gun has had 6 rounds through it, fired after I installed the brand new Leupold VX-1 QDMA edition 3-9x40 scope. These guns are very rare and this one is truly LIKE NEW! I still have the box for the scope with the Leupold window decal and the owner's manual in it. This scope is mounted on Ruger rings that were supplied with the rifle when it was purchased new. I've never seen such fine workmanship as what has went into the machining of these scope rings. They're great. The rifle will come with (2) Ruger 9rd rotary magazines just as it did from the factory. I'm asking $1,000 for this fine piece of work, but the price is negotiable if the buyer has cash in hand. I'm open to trades of all types. For more information or to make an offer, call or text REDACTED OR send me an email. Texting will get the fastest response. Thanks for looking."
