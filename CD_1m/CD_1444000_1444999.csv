I'm in the market to find a 223 Bolt Action or Break Open/Single Shot gun. Preferred brands for Bolt guns: Savage. And break open/single shots, my preferred brand: H&R.

It doesn't necessarily have to be a showpiece, but it does have to function 100% and not be trashed up/abused (I draw the line between general wear and outright abuse). Also - I can go buy a new 223 bolt right now for right around $300 right now, maybe a bit more (the break open cheaper than that price)....So please don't expect more than new price - For a good used gun i'd be looking to spend around $250 or so depending.

Have something you think i'll like that fits these specs? Shoot me an email - I'm easy to deal with and love dealing around with other good people.

I'm also located in the Madison County area - So it'd be great if you were close or could meet here or within 10-15 miles.

* Also some other things I might consider are a 243, 270, etc. (bolt or break open/single shot) - Just about any break open/single shot are pretty cool in my book."

I purchased it from an aging WWII veteran a number of years ago and when I took it all apart I realized I had a real treasure. Obviously manufactured at the Springfield Armory at some point during WWII it must have been serviced at an arsenal depot on one of the war theaters, for it has a Winchester trigger group and HRA bolt, to my knoweldge, WWII parts.

I sent it off to Dean's Gun restoration and had the wood replaced with a beautifully well reproduction WWII stock in period stain color. It was completely reparkerized, every single part broken down and refinished, all springs replaced. 

It is a great shooter. I'm selling it because the tax man cometh in force this year.

If you are looking for a genuine piece of World War II history, this M1 Garand is for you. It is truly a collector's piece, would be a real treasure of a gift for an aging WWII veteran or to add to your collection.

I'm selling it with a reproduction WWII era soft case and reproduction leather sling.

The Muzzle wear is  minimal, around a 2.5 I'd guess, and the throat is in good shape. Unfortunately, I do not have the tools to give you a more precise measurement.

I have put only around three clips of ammo through it and it functions flawlessly.

You simply will NOT find Garands today in this kind of great condition and completely restored to their wartime, from-the-factory glory.

SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY.

I have a LOT more photos I can provide, just let me know.

In the STL area? FTF only at neutral location, Bob Evans at 141/44 at a mutually agreed upon time. I will not travel anywhere else to sell the rifle.

NO TRADES. Not interested, so don't ask.

Out of state? No problem. $45 for professional packaging and shipping. If you are a C&R holder, I can, of course, ship directly to you, just need a copy of your C&R License. Otherwise, I will ship to your FFL dealer. You are responsible for having your FFL dealer provide a copy of his FFL license, etc.

Even at a reasonable price.

Pistol comes with original box, case, lock and manual.

I have made two modifications to the pistol. One, I added a grip extension. It is a NAA Guardian grip extension, which was fitted with virtually no modification to the magazine. Adds enough room to get all of the ring finger on the grip. Original magazine floor plate included. I also painted the rear site white and the front site green, using real gun sight paint, to make the likelihood of hitting something much better. 
It also comes with the slickest kydex pocket holster that has a narrow ridge to put your thumb against when drawing the gun, meaning you are not relying on friction in your pocket to hold onto the holster. You pull the butt with your finger and press down with the thumb. A very precise draw that works every time. Holster was $50 delivered.

Gun with holster is $275. Without holster, because I'm sure I can sell it separately, is $250.

Must have a valid Minnesota driver's license and either a permit to acquire or permit to carry. NO EXCEPTIONS."

This is a former Austrian police pistol;SW inventory markings (SW = Sicherheitswache Wien = safety guard Vienna/Austria). I would rate the bluing on this pistol at 70-75%; the bluing on the front and backstraps is virtually gone, but the gun is rust free. I've since added grip tape to protect the bare steel from hand sweat/salt. I replaced the grip tape about a month ago to check for any rust and still spotless. The rest of the bluing is pretty much intact with just the slide exhibiting some holster wear, but the gun is in otherwise perfect condition. Like most of these old Walther's, lots of handling wear, little use wear. This gun is perfect for reblueing or just a straight up plinker. Wouldn't make a bad carry piece either.

The pistol comes with 1 mag, no box or papers. 

Buyer to pay fees, prefer to do transaction at Ammo Bros Cerritos, Bain and Davis or Insight Shooting range for PPT, but willing to meet halfway depending on where you're located. Will ship on buyers dime.

There appears to be a lot of misinformation out there about these pistols as well, so here's some info to clear up these myths.

The gun will come with its original Manurhin grips installed. The ones shown have since been put on another Walther.

I like face to face cash transactions with legal buyers.  I prefer not to ship.

The matte-black gun has a 20-inch cylinder-bore barrel and full stock with a pistol grip. It is chambered for 2 3/4-inch and 3-inch shotshells.  

Most noteworthy among the Cobra Force’s features is that the fore-end is mounted on a return spring. Once the gun is fired, the fore-end can be pulled rearward, compressing the spring and ejecting the hull. The fore-end is then slid forward with a considerable assist from the spring as the action chambers a fresh round. In fact, if the fore-end is released at its rearmost point, there is sufficient spring pressure to drive it forward, chambering a round and locking the action into battery. 

The virtue of the system is said to be improved speed. Additionally, it is claimed that because less force is necessary to slide the fore-end forward, accuracy is enhanced. 

The spring is easily removed if desired. Take it out and the Cobra Force functions like any other tactical pump shotgun. 

The big, hand-filling grip is covered with soft rubber, providing both secure purchase and pleasant cushioning."

Its triangular barrel contour is a product of years of rigorous research
and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and
promoting rapid heat dissipation. To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this
uniquely contoured 22"" barrel has an integral muzzle brake that’s machined
in during production. Along with the barrel design, brought together a host
of other cutting edge features on this super accurate Model 700 platform.
The results are nothing short of astounding. Chambered for the inherently
tight grouping 223 and 308 calibers, each model engineered with a rate of
twist optimized for tactical style bullets, the Model 700 VTR is compact
and swift handling thanks to its sleek lines and short action. The
legendary “three-rings-of-steel"" and the many other superior design
elements of this rifle deliver the highest degree of out-of-the-box
accuracy available today. Plus, it’s matched with the new X-Mark Pro
Trigger system for the ultimate in crispness and shot control. For improved
consistency, the green synthetic stock has a vented beavertail forend that
promotes rapid cooling. Its overmold accents provide a firm gripping
surface, and the dual sling swivel studs permit convenient attachment of a
bi-pod and a sling."

I got this gun a while back from a family member. It was his ccw weapon. When he gave it to me, he told me is has seen 1000 rounds or so. It has sat well oiled in a safe ever since he moved and hasn't seen action. I personally have never took it to the range, so I honestly can't comment on its functionality. It is a Dan Wesson though, and I've only really heard great things about them. I would take it to the range, but .45 is out of budget. I am used to my glock and don't see a reason to change. It's honestly too heavy for me . I'm too used to polymer.

The gun's finish is great considering it was carried everyday. The top of the gun is bead blasted and does have wear, it really isn't noticeable unless you rotate it under the light. The flats of the gun is a polished metal and there are blemishes on the frame where the slide release is (The scratches are really only seen when the slide release is removed). There is a light 'idiot' mark on the gun. Honestly these cosmetic flaws won't bother you unless you're buying the gun to camp in your safe. If you're looking for a gun to shoot and carry everyday, you won't mind any of it. The trigger breaks very clean. Gun features of course a bobtail as well as an aggressive front strap checkering. The Kramer holster is incredibly comfortable, and glove fit for the gun. The horsehide translates into a a rigid holster that won't lose shape like regular leather. The sights were changed to an XS Express 24/7 Big Dot, old sights included. Mainspring housing Backstrap is an ed brown part, i'm sure it isn't the only one.

I have included pictures highlighting the blemishes as best as I could. Some of the scratches are hard to see in person.

The scope mount attaches to the top of the barrel by removing the rear site and bolting scope mount to top of barrel. It's all new, it's all Henry.  I intended on putting a scope on here, that's why I ordered their scope mount off of the Henry website. I went through some pictures of Henry Golden Boys with scopes and found the scope that looks great on this cowboy rifle...it looks right-  so I ordered it. It will likely be here after the rifle is sold. I'll put it on something else I guess. The wood is very dark and is beautiful on this rifle. I also have the regular Henry, the ""blued"" .22 lever rifle; the wood on this Golden model is so much nicer. I have never had anything like this rifle; the lever action is smooth like butter, the brass gleams all over like it's made of gold...it will be hard for someone to shoot it because it is so incredible looking. It came with a velvet ""sock"" wrapped around the brass receiver, Henry shipped it that way. It's a piece of art. It's not cheap, but there's nothing else like it.
I've got $695.00 in it, ..it's hard to find one of these. Henry Manufacturing experienced a Hurricane and then a fire at the plant and production halted. I drove for a 5 hour round trip to get this one. Then ordered the scope mount from Henry. All total I've spent 695.00, I need 600.00 of it back cash/trade or I won't sell it.  I won't give it away. The pictures are with the Henry scope mount installed. I put it on so that you could see it installed. You can see how it sits over top the receiver without touching the receiver. It's ready for a scope. The Henry box for the mount is in the picture too. I will take the mount off if you want...and put the rear site back on if you like. Or leave it the way it is and give you the rear site in a ziplock. However you like. Email if you want 10 or so more pictures.
The pics don't do the brass justice...not at all. It's perfect. I'll also give you 200 rounds of ammo just in case you have none."

TAVOR Assault Rifles
Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a  last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.
Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability."

We’ve designed our SKS Detachable Magazines with serious shooters in mind. The mag body, made of high strength composite, has horizontal grooves cut into it for an enhanced gripping surface. We’ve used the highest quality interior components and incorporated a metal floorplate so you can expect maximum strength from this magazine. That, plus the fact that this mag is made in the U.S.A. so it counts for three compliance parts, you could say we’ve really thought of everything.

The Noreen 338 Lapua weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA.

This was at one time the smallest semi-auto pistol available.  This gun was made in the early 20's.  Considering the age, I would say this pistol is in excellent condition.  It is in perfect working condition.  Any flaws are only cosmetic.  

The grips are not the correct grips for the early production model (which this is).

The magazine is not marked Walther, so I assume it is after market.  

There are some slight surface scratches and worn areas but overall the finish is excellent.

I appreciate most all that are military service men and women do for this country.  However I don't much appreciate my tax dollars being spent on the magazines ammo and equipment that seems to be ""falling off a truck"" and ending up on Armslist at an alarming rate ever since magazine/ammo prices have soared.  It's theft- and you're a theif in a uniform if you're selling gov't ammo or mags out of your truck- the fact that you're in a uniform makes you no better than if you were in a hoody crawling out someones window- in fact it makes it worse.
I've reported some obviously stolen magpul magazines that a crew-cut Jacksonville boy tried to sell me- and I hope others out there will report this theft as well.

BLACK FINISH

The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom-most chamber, which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm, allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target.

This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat-sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. The Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.
