The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines"

It's chambered in 30-06 and in great condition. Bluing is still dark and full. The barrel was drilled for open sights. The previous owner removed the rear sight for optics. The front sight remains. The stock is a DARK FIGURED WALNUT. The bore is bright with lands and grooves sharp to the muzzle. I doubt it's been fired much at all since there is NO copper residue on the bolt face. There is NO rust anywhere. There are some small dents on the left side of the stock. The stock has a 14 coat, hand rubbed, Tru-Oil finish with a high gloss. Beautiful wood!!!



All in all an very nice specimen of a rifle that was known to be accurate and tough.



Price is $425.00 picked up in Midtown, Houston, or I can ship to your FFL for $30.00.

Included with the sale will be the gun, the factory box, cleaning rod, brush, locking cable, 2 ten round magazines, 15 round magazine (PRE BAN 1994) 100+ rounds of target ammo, and 20 rounds of Winchester Black Talon 200grn carry ammo. 

I have owned this gun for less than a year, and have fired less than 20-25 rounds through it. There isn't a scratch,mar, or anything imperfect about the gun at all. I haven't even taken it out of the case in over 9 months. I bought it for hunting, used it once, and put it back in the case. I can assure you that you will not find a used 10mm in better condition. 

I feel that the price is fair considering what you are getting with the gun. I am not trying to price gouge anyone. I was offered $575 on a wholesale trade at a gun dealer last week just for the gun, so a $75 dollar increase is fair considering the condition and the ammo. The Black Talons alone were $59.95 for a box of 20!

The blade is clean, no knicks, and carries a wonderful old patina. My research tells me that this knife was probably made with an early version of 1095 carbon steel.

It features a short-recoil, locked-breech pistol chambered in 9×19 Parabellum with a frame, slide and barrel CNC machined from steel forgings. The sample gun featured stippled rubber grips that provide a very slip-resistant surface that will help prevent this solid piece from squirming out of your hand. The matte blue finish, while not fine, is evenly applied, and there were no sharp edges on the gun.

Thumb safeties are seeing a resurgence of popularity, and the Arcus 98DA comes so equipped. This feature, when combined with the gun’s automatic firing-pin safety, allows the gun to be carried either cocked-and-locked or with the hammer down on a loaded chamber, but extreme caution must be exercised when lowering the hammer since there is no decocker. Because the thumb safety cannot be engaged with the hammer down, there is no third option. The magazine release, located behind the triggerguard, worked properly, and when pushed, magazines dropped free like a 500-pounder from a B-17. Reloads were easy because the narrow snout of the double-stack magazine is slipped readily into the wide magazine well. The Arcus also has a lanyard ring, another practical feature from the past that is regaining popularity.

Disassembly of the Arcus 98DA is like that of a Browning Hi-Power, the design on which the Arcus is based. The slide is first locked to the rear by engaging the safety, not the slide catch, in a takedown notch. The slide catch is then pushed up and to the left to remove it, which allows the slide to be taken from the frame. Last, the barrel, recoil spring and guide rod are separated. An interesting design feature is a deep recess at the front of the barrel lug that positively engages the rear of the recoil-spring guide.

Manufacturer’s description is as follows:

AAC's MODEL-7 rifle is chambered in the new 300 AAC BLACKOUT cartridge which offers an accurate, light weight, and compact package for hunting or target shooting. 

The action is made by Remington to AAC's specifications. It has all the features and safety you come to expect from a Model-7 action (a shorter version of the Model-700), A 20 MOA scope rail is mounted to the receiver using M24 type 8-40 screws. The X-Mark Pro™ trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs and provides the feel needed for precision shooting. The barrel is a 5R 1:7 twist and threaded 5/8-24. A thread protector is included. The nitride surface of the barrel, bore, and chamber provide maximum service life and durability - longer than even hard-chrome but with the accuracy potential of a stainless barrel. Corrosion and wear resistance of the bore is extreme.

The gun is very lightly used and in like new condition. 10mm is an awesome caliber- it is as powerful as the .357Mag but since it's a semi-auto you get 15+1 rounds instead of only 5 or 6. I bought this gun new a little over a year ago and have put just 105 rounds through it. It will come in the original case with all the original paperwork and all the original Glock accessories like the cleaning tools and the magazine loader. The gun is equipped with a right-handed Clipdraw which was professionally installed at Diamondback Police Supply. This gun also comes with a Saf-T-Blok so that it can be carried cocked (technically half-cocked) with little worry of accidental discharge. The gun also comes with a trigger lock.

This gun has never failed to feed or eject and has never malfunctioned in any way, shape, or form. It has always been properly and thoroughly cleaned after firing. The trigger internals were polished last year and I'm pretty sure I haven't fired it since. Except for a few trips to the range this gun has spent its entire life in the safe. I bought it with the intention of carrying it but I changed my mind and since I don't shoot much any more I've decided to sell it. 

About the SF: I have fairly large hands- I'm 6' and around 250lbs- but I went with the SF because when I compared the 20 and the 20SF side by side I felt that while both frames were fine size-wise the differently contoured backstrap of the SF caused my hand to line up closer to the middle of the gun making it balance better in my hand. The SF also let me keep my wrist straighter which felt more natural to me, more like the grip angle of a 1911.

I am asking $600 for this gun and all its accessories plus about 15 rounds of defensive ammo. The price is firm and I am not looking for any advice about it. I will only sell face to face in Tucson, AZ. If you are interested or have any questions please email me and I will get back to you shortly.

The P250, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers;(9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. It's modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""to hell and back"" reliability you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Manufacturer's Description:

The SP-223 lower is made of 7075T6 billet, and is type III hard anodized black with Teflon coating. Our lower has features like no other lower on the market. Some key differences of the SP lower are the oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, large front grip, and a nice beveled mag well opening. The oversized, built in trigger guard allows the use of a thick winter glove. The magazine release area has been designed to allow quick and easy access to the release button from any position. Also, the mag well is wider and elongated in the front for a sure grip as well as having a large beveled opening for fast, smooth mag changes. An upper receiver tensioning screw is located under the grip, and it also includes a captive detent spring to retain the rear takedown pin.

The Gen 2 Lower features an ambidextrous bolt release (Pre-installed)"

The wood to metal fit is spot on. The bluing is 99%. There is absolutely no rust or pitting anywhere. The receiver HAS NOT been drilled and tapped for scope mounts; only outfitted with an adjustable peep sight. The bolt and follower have been jeweled. The action is super slick and the trigger is smooth. The stock has handling marks from use but no cracks and a dark rich color. The stock also wears a steel butt plate like the ones put on pre 64 Winchester Model 70s. The pictures speak for themselves. Serial number puts manufacture date at 1942. This is a sweet shooting rifle that I hope goes to an individual who can appreciate a classic.  Located in Enterprise.

I was acually suprised I havehad it that long when I looked at the date. Anyway everything is original except the extended slide stop lever and that is also an original Glock part. I do have the old one if you would want to change it back.  I have a couple holsters and I think three magazines all with the extension on them so your hand fits nicely on the weapon.  I can send pictures via text due to the fact that is the only way I know how to send them.  Last is I live in San Diego and this would have to be a face to face transaction at a FFL gunshop we BOTH agree on that way we are both comfortable.
