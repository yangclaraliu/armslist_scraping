It is in great shape, and has around 350 miles (130-140 or so hrs), I cant remember off the top of my head. What I do know is that it is an absolute beast, and is really not even broken in. 

Im not kidding when I say this 2006 could pass for showroom new.

-- It has 27"" Kenda Executioners on ITP Delta Black wheels 
-- Full system Muzzy Pro stainless exhaust 
-- Dynatek Ignition 
-- Dyno Jet re-jet professionally done by Rainbow Cycle in Rogers 
-- Elka Stage 3 rear suspension (rides like an absolute dream + more ground clearance) 
-- Two year aftermarket warranty that can be transferred to the next buyer for $50 
-- comes with winch but it was never hooked up 

All of the modifications were done with the intention of long summer rides, but unfortunately between work and summer school I have had absolutely no free time. It has been taken out ONE time since these modifications were installed, and I still have the stock exhaust and tires and wheels (with half + tread life) that will be included. 

To put it mildly, this thing is an absolute monster. Without question the best ATV I have ever owned, and there have been many. For those of you that know your stuff, not much more needs to be said. For those who are curious come check it out and I promise you wont leave without it. There is well over $4,000 in aftermarket parts alone on this Brute, not including labor.

Runs perfect, never wrecked, rolled, flooded, or even taken into water deeper than the tires. Plus, it comes with the extended warranty for extra peace of mind.

I also have a very nice trailer (the one in the picture) with full size tires and wheels that I will include for an extra $500. You absolutely will not find a better setup for the money.

It's because idiots keep paying $50 for a $20 box of ammo.

Because idiots are paying $50 per box, the gougers are motivated to go stand in line at whatever time Walmart sets out their ammo stock for the day, and they buy it all up.  They then run home and post the ammo on Armslist for 2 to 3 times what they just paid for it.

Stop paying gouger prices, and the gougers will lose interest.  They'll stop buying out the supply at Walmart or wherever it is they get their ammo, and things will start returning to normal."

The lower receiver is a take-off from a Sig Sauer M400 and is at it comes from the factory.  There have been a minimal amount of rounds fired throughout this rifle as it was put together and has basically been a “safe queen” since.

The upper receiver is a Bravo Company Standard 16 inch mid-length upper receiver group with a Daniel Defense Omega X9 hand guard (four-sided rail).  Inside the upper receiver is a Bravo Company Auto complete Bolt Carrier Group.  Bravo Company makes some of the best AR-15 rifles, parts, and accessories in the business.  Like the lower receiver, this upper and the barrel have seen a minimal amount of rounds sent downrange.

The front sight of this rifle is a standard A2 front sight post, and the rear sight is a folding Sig Sauer M400 folding rear sight.

This rifle is pictured with a LaRue Tactical A-P.E.G. pistol grip but is currently outfitted with a standard A2 pistol grip, and is being sold with the standard A2 pistol grip.  I will include the foliage green ergonomic vertical Foregrip, made by Mission First Tactical, if the buyer expresses interest.

This is a high quality rifle and I am asking $850.00 for it.  Price is firm, as I believe it is more than fair considering the quality of the rifle.  

Please note that I am not guaranteeing that this rifle will come with any paperwork or original packaging and is being sold “as-is.” If this sells, I will do my best to find what I still have.  That being said, it will work perfectly.

The only trades I am interested in are a Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion in .45ACP or a Trijicon 4x32 ACOG, with or without a back up red-dot, and preferably in a LaRue Tactical mount.  I will listen to other interesting offers but prefer cash.

This rifle is in “like new” condition with a minimal amount of rounds put downrange, and has always been cared for and cleaned regularly.  This rifle is part of Lewis Machine & Tool’s MRP series that means that with minimal effort – two screws – you can change out the barrel and the caliber of the rifle to something like 6.8 SPC or 300 Blackout.  

Rifle comes with four-sided LMT rail system and comes in stock configuration with black Ergo pistol grip, three (3) black Tango Down rail grip covers, and an LMT SOPMOD six-position stock.  This rifle does NOT come with sights.  The standard charging handle has been replaced with a Bravo Company Gunfighter Mod. 3 charging handle (Large Latch).  Bravo Company’s charging handles are, in my opinion, infinitely better than a standard handle.  If you would like a standard charging handle instead, I can replace it for you.  I will also include a MagPul Generation 3 30-round PMAG with the rifle.

LMT lists this rifle at $2,100.15, but they are currently out of stock and it is my understanding that these rifles will be backordered for multiple months.  I am asking $1,450.00, firm.  Yes, you can get an AR-15 cheaper, but it won’t match up to an LMT.

The Trijicon TR-24 AccuPoint 1-4x24 30mm Riflescope with LaRue Tactical LT104-30 mount is not included in the rifle’s price, and is not available.

Please note that I am not guaranteeing that this rifle will come with any paperwork or original packaging and is being sold “as-is.” If this sells, I will do my best to find what I still have.  That being said, it will work perfectly.

This started life as a Surefire vertical Foregrip weapon light with an incandescent light, but the head has been replaced with a Surefire KM4 LED Weapon Light conversion kit, making this the equivalent of a Surefire M900V. 

This light gives off 150 lumens of white light and can put out 120 mW of infrared illumination for use with night vision devices. 

There are also two small navigation lights that can be used to help you navigate in the dark without having to activate the full power of the light.

The Weapon Light attaches using an A.R.M.S. thrown mount, making it easy to switch the light from one system to another while still remaining tightly and securely attached to your rifle.

Not only is this a top-notch Weapon Light, but this also doubles as a solid vertical Foregrip to help stabilize your rifle while shooting.

This grip has seen some use but is in perfect working condition with no noticeable cosmetic problems.

Surefire lists the M900V at $760.00, I am asking $375.00 firm.

This EOTech has the standard 65 MOA circle with the 1 MOA dot in the middle.  This sight runs on two (2) AA batteries and is compatible with night vision devices, if you run with them.

The GG&G Completion Kit includes flip-up lens covers that protect your optic when not in use, while the front lens cover acts as a sunshade when in the up (shooting) position.  It also includes the Accucam Quick Detach System, which allows you to mount and un-mount the EOTech using a quick throw-lever.  I have found this is also much more reliable than the turn screw that comes with the EOTech sight.

This optic has seen some use, but I take pride in caring for my belongings and the optic is in great shape.  It works just as well as the day I bought it.

GG&G sells this package at $566.00.  As this is used, I am asking $350.00 for the package.  You will not be disappointed in this optic – it is top quality like the professionals use.

- 100 rounds of CII Stinger 22 LR ammo

The gun does have minor wear marks (on the slide - visible in picture) from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo. Other than that, it's a great little shooter; I have no complaints.

     The MKM Maten KeyMod sets are extremely difficult to get and most folks are charging $1200 for a set.  These are a matched upper/lower set and you will not find a tighter upper and lower on the market.  Total for this build was over $3100.  I built this as project waiting on 300blk to become more readily available. I have put 60 rds of American Eagle M1A 168gr OTM through it. (I have 1000rds of AE 168gr OTM for sale as well $1/rd)  I have set the adjustable gas block to be able to run this gun both suppressed and unsuppressed with 168gr, but you can adjust it for your own needs/ammo.  I did not shoot any subsonic though it.  The combination of the JP Silent Recoil spring and the adjustable gas block make this a soft shooting 308 AR.

      I am willing to remove/exchange some parts if you are not interested in the higher end stuff.  1.  Exchange the trigger to either a Rock River 2 stage ($100 less) or a standard milspec ($175 less)
2. Change the AAC Brake for a standard A2 Flash hider ($100 less)
3. Remove the optic completely ($475 less). 

      Do not ask to exchange any other parts. This gun is tuned with what’s on it now.  I suggest you don’t change a thing but I know not all folks need a match trigger or a suppressor ready muzzle brake.  I don’t do super long range stuff with AR’s which is why I opted for the Vortex PST 1-4x24.  I run this optic on a few other AR’s and it is by far the best optic for the $.  I also have (12) Twelve more LR-308 20rd PMAGS ($40/ea) These are currently going for $50-60 online and only available to the buyer of this rifle. They are all NEW except the one I used when I zeroed the rifle."

I was disappointed when I bought it because the trigger was so tight (set from the factory, the trigger is double action only with 11 pound pull.) I don’t consider myself weak but this trigger was so tough to pull that it was affecting my groups. I read about this problem and while the a polish and lube helps, nothing was as beneficial as wearing the weapon in. By the time I took my CCW test with the weapon it was tuned in perfect (about 500 rounds.) I matched my Dad in grouping; he was using an East German Makarov, impressive for a gun with a barrel the size of my pinky. Gun is nice and worn in; also well taken care of. Gun has two magazines and everything that is sent with the gun from the factory, including the laser wrench. 13 rounds (CC ammo, fills two mags and one in the chamber ir your brave) of Hornady Critical Target ammo comes with it. Also a BlackHawk small of the back concealed carry holster is included. Gun is small, accurate, loud as hell, extremely reliable and has a manual safety. I love this gun but I never shoot it so I would like to sell it to someone who will. 400.00$, I am always open to offers.

Speer brought sport shooters and law enforcement the excellence of Lawman over 35 years ago. Back in 1968, the line included all our centerfire handgun ammunition, and quickly earned a reputation as a high performance and reliable product. Today, the evolution of the Speer ammunition lines has let us differentiate the ammunition by use. Lawman encompasses all our brass case, general purpose ammunition. Bullets are either Speer TMJ or conventional full metal jacket depending on the product. There are times you don’t need a hollow point bullet, like when target shooting, training, or out for an afternoon of plinking. Lawman is right at home. Lawman is attractively priced, and the cases are reloadable. We load clean-burning propellants and reliable CCI primers to complete the package. Many Lawman loads duplicate the velocities and bullet weights we load in Gold Dot so your practice is realistic. Lawman is made in calibers from 25 Auto through 45 Auto. Shooters have trusted Lawman for over a third of a century. Today, it's earning the trust of new generations of shooters.

I purchased this gun new a few years ago for a prarie dog hunt out west. I purchased 1000 rounds and the trip turned out to be a bust so I never really shot it. I customized and tastefully decked it out but I really just don't have a use for it now. I made sure it shot and ejected good with 10 rounds then I had added the base, rings, scope and bipod. I then gave it to Scott at Danny's Gun Repair and had him Duracoat it. Since then I have shot it about 80 more times and it has performed flawlessly. I put a bunch of time and money into it so it took me a while to realize I was never going to use it again. 

I have over $1k in this thing with the ammo and although I don't expect to get all of that back, I'm certainly not going to trade for a catostrophic lose.

This optic is in MINT condition.  I have taken it out shooting a few times and it is spot on target.  I absolutely love the Mark 4 CQ/T but I need a scope with more magnification to shoot long-range.  If you are looking for a close-quarters optic out to a couple hundred yards this will suit you well.  You can find the complete specs for this optic on Leupold's website here: 
http://www.leupold.com/tactical/scopes/mark-4-cqt-riflescopes/mark-4-cqt-1-3x14mm-incl-carrying-handle-mount/
MSRP is $1,374.99, however you can find it on Optics Planet for $1,099.99 so I'm only asking $900 which is more than fair since it is in mint condition.  Please email or text me if you are interested.  Thanks for looking.

This is NOT a SNIPER! She was produced with only the bent bolt, NO holes, this one was never made into a sniper. She is very rare, only a handful of the 91/30s were produced with a bent bolt.

New unfired in the factory box Ruger SR556 E. This rifle comes with 4 PMAGs, ruger soft gun case, and a set of flip up sights. This is a great piston driven rifle. From the factory websight:THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

I would estimate that it's comparable to a CMP correct or collector grade. Please see the pictures and judge for yourself. Pictures here

It has been most reliable in my experience, as I and my family have fired hundreds and hundreds of rounds of ammunition through it without issue, and there are many more thousands left in it. I can no longer afford to feed or house it though. As the photos indicate, the wear is principally cosmetic where the exterior moving parts are. Anywhere the action moves, even well lubricated, gets a little shine after a while.  Rifling is of course clean and sharp. This is not a clapped out GI barrel that has had a GI cleaning rod rammed down it thousands upon thousands of times. As you can see from the photos the muzzle is in pristine condition. 
The front swivel for the sling is still stiff. The fit of the action in the stock is solid. The exterior is free of dings and scuffs. The only real wear from handling is the buttplate.

Items included:
1 outstanding condition Iver Johnson carbine
1 very good to excellent condition sling and oiler
9 magazines: 3 15 round and 6 30 round. The photos will show what you're getting. Some of them are still wrapped in the original greasepaper. It will take some degreaser to get it off.
474 rounds commercially  loaded M1 carbine. These are made in the US. Given the current cost of 30 carbine this is an excellent deal."

I added a aluminum ar stock adapter that is also top of the line with a magpul ctr stock.  This stock set up collapses and makes for a more compact solid shooter.  Lastly i added a hogue pistol grip that really makes the rifle feel perfect in your hands.  I have all the stock furniture for the rilfe as well.  This rifle has never had a ftf, jam, or any other problem, it is the most reliable weapon i own.  Contact: reply to add or text 304-Nine4zero-028one
