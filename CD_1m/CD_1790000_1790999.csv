After firing, the barrel and bolt, still locked together, move rearward inside the receiver and compress two recoil springs. Then the bolt is held back while the barrel is returned forward by one of the springs permitting extraction and ejection. Once the barrel is returned, the bolt is returned forward by the second spring; in so doing it picks up a fresh round from the magazine and chambers it.

I purchased this rifle about 6 mo. ago, never have fired it.  I cannot say for certain if it was ever fired, as I bought it used from a dealer - though it appears unfired and indistinguishable, inside or out, from new (to my eyes anyway).  Comes also with factory rings, still in package, manual, paperwork, etc

It currently has an ATI strikeforce folding stock in desert tan, brand new and still have the box.  Also have the original wood stock, completely flawless. 

will sell with stock, 5 rnd mag and black/red ruger case (also new) for $850...if you want addittional items, please see below.

we can discuss trades for a GP100 in 3"" or 4"" if you are willing to contribute add'l cash, depending on condition of gun and whether 3 or 4"".  No 6"" please (got one).  I know how nice they are but would not give much weight for a wiley clapp model, I plan on this as a working gun.

additional options for purchase:

I have 2 NIB ruger factory 30 round mags; $50 each

I have 1 NIB and one used 20 rnd ruger factory mag; $40 new, $30 used.  Used in great condition.

I have 3 promag steel 30 rnd mags, used, $15 each

I have several hundred rounds of .223 in various brands; will count them later and post the total and price; if I sell the ruger or trade it, these will be available for seperate sale or trade for .45 ammunition.

Prefer buyer/trader have a CHP permit and willing to complete simple bill of sale for our mutual records (I know this is overkill, but I sellp better at night).  This firearm is not registered with the city of omaha as I also have a CHP."

I purchased it new so I am the only owner, It has been very well taken care of. Its only been shot a few times and Its always been cleaned after.

I was going to shoot the bullets I have before selling it, then I heard it was really hard to get these bullets right now so I figured I'd include them so you could shoot right away!
INCLUDED:
-AR-15 Rifle
-About 250 .223 Bullets (good bullets NOT steel case ones)
-TWO 30 Round magazines
-Rifle scope with 30x Zoom
-High rise blocks AND rings for the scope so it is mounted properly
-I also have the original box and a nice Quad Rail I paid $100 for if Interested

I have only shot this gun a handful of times, I never got a chance to take it hunting, so its only been fired at the range probably five times and that's it. I have only fired good bullets through my gun, never steel case rounds. IF you want the gun only and not the Accessories, let me know.

Vertical grip with quick-deploy bipod legs is an economical alternative for applications where the original GPS-02 Grip Pod’s function and benefits are desired, but the steel reinforcements in its legs are excess to requirements. The GPS-LE (Law Enforcement) locks to the bottom accessory rail of your tactical rifle’s forend, just like the GPS-02, to provide the same enhanced control during CQB and a stable bipod rest for precise long-range fire. The grip’s hand-filling contours and deep grooves provide a solid purchase even when your hands are wet. Hit the large, deeply grooved release button, and a powerful spring deploys the legs instantly. Conveniently placed for thumb activation, the button sits flush with the surrounding surface to prevent accidental deployment. Extended legs provide sufficient elevation for a standard 30-round magazine to clear the ground, and will not snag on brush, vehicle interior, or other gear when retracted.

This was another of my ""squirrel hunters"" I have a FDE magpul grip, trigger guard, and fore grip on this one. This m4 .22 has a quad rail and a few covers. It is a flat top rifle, and I'm keeping the lepould off it, so it will need optics or front sight. Gun also comes with 1 mag.

Item Description: I've got a pretty little .45 in need of some parts. She's in excellent condition except for her action and screw set. I did a little amateur gunsmithing when I found out the cylinder was spinning freely regardless of hammer position. From what research I've done it could be either the cylinder stop or the arm. Putting it back together I stripped some screws. They're still able to be unscrewed but no one wants a gun with beaten up looking screws on it. I've looked up prices on Taylor's Firearms (supposedly Uberti's mother company) and found a whole new action kit and screw kit for under 100. The back strap also has a slight gap in between the frame and itself.  I'm down for bulk ammo trades in .45 or 5.56 as well as a plain Jane 870 for HD. Feel free to shoot me an offer. The worst I can do is rudely say no."

Bersa 380 thunder - duo tone, very good condition, 7 round mag and a 9 round extended mag.  154 rounds through her.  This thunder is my daily concealed carry weapon.  very minor holster wear on the right hand of slide.  Shes never had a hiccup.  will throw in 16 rounds of powerball hollow points as well.

Taurus pt111 g2 9mm - Very good condition pistol.  solid black, 2 12 round mags.  bought brand new right when this model came out in February.  have put about 350-400 rounds through her.  has a minor issue though, will only fire in double action.  No problems in double action but the striker wont stay on the sear to shoot single action.  I contacted taurus and they told me 8 weeks to get it fixed so thats the only reason i haven't sent it in yet.  Taurus has a lifetime warranty on their guns so if you get it they will let you send it in if you want to get it fixed but shoots fine as it is.  Will throw in whatever 9mm rounds i have left over.

Paid 350 at a gun show for the taurus.  Paid 305 at a local gun shop for the bersa.  I am the first and only owner of both firearms.

Personally the bersa is a top of the line handgun to me.  The taurus is a bottom end but i am looking to trade both of these for your high end 45.  Im specifically looking for a springfield xdm or xds 45.  Must be a very well taken care of pistol as these are.  will also consider trades for any size springfields and glocks.  Can also add cash if need be for the right piece.  Will require bill of sale and prefer to do business with conceal permit holder.  VA residents only."

This gun comes with factory installed night sights.  The Carry model features a full sized grip and accepts full sized, 8 round magazines.  The SAS designation stands for Sig Anti Snag, which is a melt effect applied by the factory to round off corners and sharp edges, making this gun great for carry.

This gun is in immaculate condition!  I took it in on a trade and put 100 rounds through it with no issues.  Shoots very well out of the box, beyond my ability.  I believe this gun has a very low round count as it is extremely clean and shows no wear on the exterior surfaces, or the slide rails.  I am selling this gun to put money towards a different model P220.

This gun comes with 4 factory magazines (1 pictured) along with the factory case and paperwork.

I am asking $850 cash for this pistol.  Bud's had it on sale once upon a time, but it is OOS everywhere I've looked, and it retails higher, so I feel that this is a fair price for this gun, especially with the extra magazines."

I got this rifle about 2 years ago and have only fired 30 rounds total out of it and found its more accurate than I can shoot!
It was carried to the range in a soft case and was well cleaned and oiled for storage when I brought it home,back in the box and into the safe it went.
Im just not that into it and have decided to get out of 5.45x39 all together so I thought Id let someone who wants a 5.45 get it.

Ive checked around on prices and found them hitting 1500 or so but if you feel Im out of line,give me a reasonable offer.

I can travel short distances but cant make it to someplace like LA or OC anything like that.
I can ship to your FFL but in selling on armslist I cant prove my honesty to you so that would be up to you and I would need a money order or cashiers check.
we would exchange numbers etc and I would keep constant communication,tracking numbers etc until you receive the rifle."

This will be hard to find on searches because they made so few of them in the mid 80's.

The gun has some scratches on the stock and slight blueing wear between the pump arm and the receiver and I can send more photos upon request. This would make one heck of a skeet or bird gun I just don't have the use for it I thought I would.

Everything about it screams out quality. I also own a CZ 452 Military Trainer & it is by far THE BEST GUN I have ever had. The accuracy is incomparable. The CZ 452 is a tack driver. It has real IRON SIGHTS and the stock is beautiful and unflawed walnut wood. The front sight is hooded. It comes with the factory 5 magazine clip, the box, books, and all paperwork. If you do not know about these rifles I encourage you to read up on them. They are difficult to find and are no longer made. This is your opportunity to get one of these sought after tack drivers before it's too late. This gun will only go up in value the longer you have it. the price is $600 firm. I am not a dealer, but may consider shipping (buyer pays shipping costs) with full insurance and signature. I have many more photos so just email if you want more or need more info. Text me your number if you want to talk about it 870-two67-three7six7

CZ is not making this model anymore. Get yours now. You will be very pleased with your decision."

I am selling the 20 round magazines for $65 apiece and the 10 round magazines for $30 a piece with the option of a trio of 1 20 round magazine and 2 of the 10 round magazines for $125. I have several available bulk deals are acceptable if price is right. I am also selling some 5.56 ammo, .223 ammo, .45 ammo check a look at my other postings.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer

These are a great piece of our history and a very fun firearm to shoot. After shooting one you see why they were so popular by our troops in WWII.

The IBM has an original IBM barrel and a good deal of IBM parts. Would take minimal effort to make 100% correct. Selling it for $950. (SOLD)

The Standard Quality has an Underwood barrel and is correct for this manufacturer. Standard did not make their own barrels and was part of what was called the free barrel program. The wood on this is very nice. Selling it for $950. The three phots below have been updated to be all of the Standard carbine.

Of the 5.5 million or so of these made (who really knows how many remain after war loss, US governemnt destroying these with captain crunch and the large number given to our allies)IBM and Standard were of the most rare. Standard made only about 247 thousand and IBM made only about 346 thousand.

Both are from the CMP, and I will include the paperwork and documentation. If you want magazines or ammo, I will sell as part of package for reasonable (at cost) price. USGI 15 rd magazines (will try to make match rifle manufacturer) for $20 each. 30 rd magazines for $22 each. 50 rounds of carbine ammo for either $25 a box (Aquila) or $30 for Lake CIty. I may even have a M4 bayonet or two if interested.

I will be posting photos this afternoon, just wanted to get these listed ASAP because I want to move these this weekend and the prices reflect that for nearly correct carbines. Frankly I was not planning on selling but the new laws have me concerned that when I liquidate my collection it is going to be a pain in the a$$. I will also have additional photos upon request.

FTF only and thank you for looking. If these do not sell this weekend, I will consider shipping but first priority for expediency and to provide last opportunity to buy one without government meddling is face to face in Colorado"

The gun shows minor pitting on the barrel but other then that still in very good shape. It comes with three mag's not original to the gun. All the numbers match and has all the Nazi markings. The rifling is very bright and nice. The action is smooth with no problems. I keep her oiled, cleaned, and in a dry place.  It does not have the holster. A very cool piece of history that you can still shoot, display, and enjoy. $1000 CASH FIRM. Thanks for looking.
