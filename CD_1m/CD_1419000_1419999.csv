I bought it used.  I would say condition is 80%.  I tried to get some hi-res close-up pics so you can see.  It does have some wear on the finish but no dings/dents and such.  The gun functions flawlessley and is extremly accurate.  My soon to be fiance had never fired a gun before so I bought this to help hear learn.  Of all my firearms this one is the only one she can could shoot well.  I've since bought her a real PPK so I really have no reason to hold on to this any more.

The previous owner did a poor job of keeping it clean so first thing I did was take it apart and completely clean and oil it.

It comes with the (2) holsters I got with it and (2) magazines.  One is a pocket holster and the other is a left handed, leather Bianchi.  I'll also throw in a box (50rd) of Federal Tactical Hydo-shok ammo and (2) new snap caps.

I paid $290 for the gun and would like to get $290.  I'm hoping the ammo and caps make it a decient deal.  Figure someone out there may want to help someone learn to shoot with a smaller firearm before spending the money on something that person may not like or shoot well like I had to go through.  Also a nice little gun to keep in the glove box.

At this point I'm not intrested in trades or low ball offers.  Thanks for looking ~Tom"

This is an awesome rifle with awesome 30 caliber power!! It uses AR 16 7.62x39 magazines. The rifle is in almost new condition. I have fired 20 rounds through it. I purchased this for my collection and it has sat in my safe for too long. Priorities change. Time for someone else to enjoy it. The Daewoo is one of the best designed semi-auto rifles that I have ever encountered. It utilizes the gas piston system of the AK47 and the bolt and receiver of similar design of the AR15. The Lower was made by Kimber. This rifle uses the AR 15 trigger group, so replacement parts for the fire control group are not an issue. That along with the chrome-lined barrel help make this probably the most accurate 7.62x39 rifle you will ever fire. This rifle comes with 1 30 round magazine, 2 10 round  magazines, factory field cleaning kit and 120 rounds of Wolf 122 grain FMJ Ammunition in a hard rifle case. This is a fairly rare rifle with a low serial number. You will hardly ever see one of these for sale. Reason being once you own one you never want to get rid of it. They are just that good. Asking price is $1500.00 cash or best offer. Will consider all trade offers. Looking to trade for 5.56 AR-15."

The ""snakes"" are getting hard to find, especially in an 8"" barrel. 
The Anaconda holds six rounds and weighs 59 oz. It was originally introduced in 1990 & is chambered for the .44 Magnum cartridge. Colt has billed this pistol as among the most accurate .44 Magnum revolvers in production. Its fit and finish resembled an up-sized King Cobra married to a ventilated-rib barrel reminiscent of the Python's. Initially marketed with a satin brushed stainless finish, Anacondas came equipped with four, six, or eight inch barrels, neoprene synthetic rubber finger-grooved combat-style grips with nickel colored 'Rampant Colt' medallions, large target type hammers and triggers, as well as open iron sights with a red insert front and fully adjustable white outline rear. The trigger actions on these guns are rated as very high-quality, and the heavy-duty solid construction and weight tends to absorb recoil, making the Anaconda relatively easy to shoot with heavy loads.
For buyer not local West Plains, MO, would require that the transaction be completed by shipping through an FFL. I have a purchase agreement that I will sign and have notorized that will give the details of the transaction. Buyer can pick his choice of an FFL local to me and I will leave the pistol with them. Buyer can then call them and give instructions for how things will be done and I will also leave a copy of the purchase agreement with them that will give detailed instructions about how things should be handled. After buyer is able to verify that the FFL has the pistol, he will then send them a cashier's check for the purchase price. After the FFL receives the funds they will ship the pistol out. This will protect both buyer and seller and will ensure a smooth transaction."

This is my final listing for awhile.  This is all I left to trade.

Stoeger Model 2000 Tactical 12ga 18 1/2"" Barrel

Reliability, versatility, and value make the Model 2000 the ideal semi-auto shotgun. Inside the Stoeger Model 2000 semi-auto shotgun is the Inertia Driven operating system, the heart of the world's most prestigious and reliable autoloaders. The Inertia Driven system has only three moving parts in the bolt, the inertia spring, the bolt body, and the rotating locking head, for more reliable operation. The operating system is mostly contained in the receiver, giving the Model 2000 a trimmer forend with better balance. The Stoeger Model 2000 fires everything from 1-1/8 ounce field and target loads to the heaviest 3"" waterfowl loads without adjustments. Plus, with no propellant gas venting into the operating system, the Model 2000 stays cleaner. The bolt assembly includes an inertia spring and a rotating locking head and a cavity is designed into the butt stock of the Model 2000 to allow installation of an optional, mercury-filled recoil reducer. The Defense version of the 2000 features a matte black synthetic stock with a pistol grip and a blade front sight.

Gun has the following:

Wilson beaver-tail, Novak/Trijicon night sights, after-market ambi safety, trigger job (done by a smith) has crip pull/break (and a insanely nice reset travel, clicks at 1-2mm travel), after-market 2 piece mag release (the fat stud can be removed, which leaves a regular button), after-market main spring housing (metal), all new Wolf springs, threw some Springfield wood grips on to keep my after market grips.

Comes with 2 Wilson Combat magazines, Bladetech IWB kydex holster, and box of Federal Hydrashoks.

Got this in trade from a family member, decided to go another route. Seems to like oil and 7rnd mags; kinda finicky to me, but I'm use to shooting Glocks, Sigs, and HKs.

Bill of sale will be completed for my records only; can provide duplicate, if needed.

Yeah, I know the grips are retarded, but I put them on to keep price lower...toss on a set of your own, and you're good to go.

This gun does have the ghost sights but did not come with the tube extender. Also for anyone who is not familiar with this model it has a button on the fore-end which allows you, when pumped, to eject a shell with out chambering a new round making it much faster and simpler to change loads in tactical situations. I also have a magpul sling on the gun that can go with it. The photos are off of the web but I will upload pictures of the actual gun itself as soon as I get the chance.

Its hard to tell from the pics but it does have a gold anodized finish. The pistol is extremely light. Ftf cash only. You drive to the east side. $600 obo. Not going any lower. You wont find one better and this is already well below how much itd cost you to do it all yourself. Serious buyers please."
