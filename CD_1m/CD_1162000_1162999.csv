We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at info@freerepublicfirearms or by phone at 3309040222 with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

I've put a couple of hundred rounds through it and it shoots great.  In my pistol league so far it has outshot my XDM 4.5 in 45 ACP and my Kimber Super Carry Ultra and my Sig P229.  In other words...it's a shooter!  I haven't turned in the warranty yet and it has all of the XDM manuals and gear.

I will trade either a higgins 12gauge pump action 7+1 shotgun .  It is a clean shotgun, has been modified but remains with in the legal perameters of the law with excess. It is a great home defense shotgun, smooth stainless steel action and a 7 round magazine tube make this a good solid choice for defense. and im figuring a price or trade value of about $250 is a fair and moderate price. Cheaper than any mossberg out there and is a solid firearm.

The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

We know Bills have been deleted &/or changed in the White House over the last few years, & we do not know what might become of this one, but this is the current law.
look it up. looks real to me. There are many links about this on the web.

Dick Act of 1902 - Gun Control FORBIDDEN!
Were you aware of this law?
DICK ACT of 1902 - CAN'T BE REPEALED (GUN CONTROL FORBIDDEN) -
Protection Against Tyrannical Government
It would appear that the administration is counting on the fact that the American Citizens don't know this, their rights and the constitution. Don't prove them right.
The Dick Act of 1902 also known as the Efficiency of Militia Bill H.R.11654, of June 28, 1902 invalidates all so-called gun-control laws.
** SPREAD THIS TO EVERYONE *
It also divides the militia into three distinct and separate entities.
The three classes H.R. 11654 provides for are the organized militia, henceforth known as the National Guard of the State, Territory and District of Columbia, the unorganized militia and the regular army.
The militia encompasses every able-bodied male between the ages of 18 and 45.
All members of the unorganized militia have the absolute personal right and 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms of any type, and as many as they can afford to buy.
The Dick Act of 1902 cannot be repealed; to do so would violate bills of attainder and ex post facto laws which would be yet another gross violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
The President of the United States has zero authority without violating the Constitution to call the National Guard to serve outside of their State borders.
The National Guard Militia can only be required by the National Government for limited purposes specified in the Constitution (to uphold the laws of the Union; to suppress insurrection and repel invasion).
These are the only purposes for which the General Government can call upon the National Guard.

A Hi-Point magazine that fits two pistols – the C-9 and the CF-380. What is really interesting is the fact that each pistol is chambered for a different cartridge. The C-9 is chambered for 9x19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger) while the CF-380 is, as its name suggest, chambered for .380 ACP. If you own either of these pistols, the multi-purpose Hi-Point 9mm/.380 magazine is a must.

The Hi-Point 9mm/.380 magazine is an original factory-produced magazine for the Hi-Point C-9 and the CF-380.

These single-stack magazines feature a steel construction and offer the quality you have come to expect from the Hi-Point name."

Originally purchased for my fiance, she doesn't have the same enthusiasm for shooting as I, and one loaded handgun in the house (mine) that we both know how to operate is sufficient for self defense.

If it sells, I'm buying her new shoes, something she will use far more often!  However, I'm willing to consider trading it for another firearm.

I'll also throw in about 70 rounds of ammo, 20 of which are nice Hornady JHP, the other 50 a mix of Federal factory ammo, since this is my only 38, about a $50 value."

This rifle is lightly used and still in perfect condition. I don't remember the exact round count but it has less than 1000 rounds fired, probably closer to 500-600. This is the MOE edition, so it came from the factory with Magpul sights, grip and stock. I also added rail covers, fore grip and the red dot sight. 6 factory S&W 25-round magazines are also included, these have become increasingly hard to find lately.

Top pic is just a stock photo. Bottom 2 pics are of the actual rifle for sale, mags, and case.

Payment needs to be cash or cashier's check, and a bill of sale will be included for both parties. I will also want to see your WA DL when we fill out the bill of sale.

Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item.

If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Description from Colt:
Be it prairie dog hunting in Texas, whitetail hunting in Maine or elk hunting in Colorado, the Colt LE901-16S™ is the rifle for the hunt. Chambered in the classic .308 Winchester cartridge, the LE901-16S is the perfect choice for medium to large sized game animals. Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel and one-piece monolithic upper receiver, suitable for mounting your optic of choice. Keeping the varmint hunter in mind, the .308 Winchester upper receiver group can be easily swapped out for any Mil-Spec Colt upper receiver chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. The fact that all operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release, bolt catch and safety selector, makes for versatility and ease of use. You can depend on the new Colt LE901-16S to take the shot of your lifetime!

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at info@freerepublicfirearms or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at info@freerepublicfirearms or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

853,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1162853,"For Sale:  My letter, my actions do you agree?","spread the word, Colorado, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, February 28, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have been following the press for stronger rules and regulations regarding gun laws, gun bans and bans on high cap magazines and I am disgusted with you all! I have worked Security and Executive Protection for most of my adult life and have been an upstanding member of any community I live in or pass through. I share my disgust with you today in hopes that someone may take notice of problems far more relevant than re-instating a list of bans that didn't work in the first place and perhaps look at your own broken house for the answers. ""You say it is up to the Gun Owners to be responsible for their actions and the actions of others"". BULLSHIT!

With that I want to tell you a short story,

    About a year ago I posted a small pistol and several other guns for sale on a site called armslist.com, a free site linking LAW ABIDING citizens and gun owners to each other across the nation with classified sales. To make short I am going to cut to it.

        I received a late night phone call from a young man in the Denver area requesting to buy the gun I had listed, I asked: What gun are you interested in buying? He says: I don't know, the small one, the cheapest one I can get... ""ALARM"". I felt something was wrong and I ended the phone call by referring that he go to a pawn shop for a cheap gun. About half hour later the sick feeling in my gut was enough that I decided to ""Make a call"" and report this, and this is where it gets sickening!

My first call at 10:44pm was to Denver Metro Police, where I was not able to file a report with anyone, in fact I was refused the time of day to report a ""Child looking for a Gun"", and told that it was ""probably a prank call"" and that they did not have the time or resources to investigate. ""Note"" A drive by and a knock takes maybe 10mins, they do this for accidental 911 calls! My Second Call was to the Sheriff's Department where I got a similar ""We can not help you""... Frustrating, so I decide to take it up a notch and call the Denver Field Office for BATF&E, no answer, no nothing. On to WASHINGTON!!! When I connected with the woman at the BATF&E switchboard I was black-walled, she told me that it was not her job nor was it the job of the BATF&E ""F is for Fire-Arms by the way"", to look into this and I should contact my own local police department... Im thinking to myself at this point, ""Who the hell are these people, Im trying to stop what I know in my gut is a disturbed young man from getting a hold of a gun... Columbine anyone?""

    It is now 2:00am and I am forcing my eyes and brain to remain open... I called the local Delta County Sheriff and finally someone who gives a shit! I will omit his/her name because it seems like people who work for this state who do good thing for the right reasons always end up getting hurt! The Deputy Immediately shared my concern that a young man who sounded very disturbed was searching for a small cheap handgun late at night.... And guess what, When the Delta County Sheriff's Deputy did the ten minuets of leg work and made the call he found that the Kid 14YEARS OLD, who has a history of VIOLENCE and MENTAL ILLNESS who was staying with his Grand Father and was stated to be in a ROUGH PATCH AT SCHOOL!!!

Let me break this down.  A Deputy from across the state and a Private Security Operator have to do the work, because the local Police, Sheriff and Federal Government Wont lift a finger.

See here is where I get a little disappointed in you, our trusted representatives. You have created such a system that doesn't work, doesn't care and will not do THEIR JOBS, and you seem to be perfectly fine with this. Stop going in circles and wasting our time, taxes and the lives of our fellow citizens trying to violate our 2nd amendment rights, stop trying to blame us ""the people"" for these unfortunate events that all could have been stopped before they happened or before the body counts grow so high by a ""white hat with a gun""! Furthermore the result of a well trained Citizen with a Concealed Carry Permit being in the schools would most likely end up with a surrender situation rather than a suicide, maybe not always but Ive seen this happen more than once with my own eyes. The 2nd amendment is not just a part of legislation to be toyed with but a sacred part of our country's foundation, honor and heritage and was put in place for more reasons than you will ever admit.

Police rarely ever get to the scene of a crime before the crime has happened, rarely to they get there while it is happening.... Police are there to Serve and Protect... more like file a report well after the event has ended.

A Citizen with a gun can easily prevent a crime from ever happening EVEN WITHOUT BLOODSHED!

My request, if you choose to live here in the United States of America abide by its laws and beliefs, including all amendments! if you do not like living in a place where people are allowed to have and carry guns then please by all means... GTFO and go somewhere else!

From the website:
The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.
Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.
The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. The estimated retail price for the 416 rifle is $559.
Operation

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

To meet this need, we have set up a process for CO residents to purchase limited quantities of magazines from our website.

The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."
