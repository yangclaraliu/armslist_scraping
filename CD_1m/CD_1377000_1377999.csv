LE6920 M4 AR15 Carbine 5.56/223. The Gold Standard of AR15's
This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. 
- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Cleaning kit, sling, and 1 magazine are standard.
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 6.95 lb - ideal for tactical use."

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.

Gun was purchased in December of 2012 and was bought for CCW.  I would still be carrying it but I came across a deal on a higher end weapon, so I simply just don't need it any longer.  Trade or sell, makes no difference to me.  If you want this gun and want to trade, I would really like to have a decent .17hmr.  If you are wanting to buy, make a SERIOUS offer and we can talk about it.
I will ship this pistol but it will only be to an FFL holder and will be done so at your expense.  If you live in the Belton/Raymore area, I would prefer that we meet at an FFL that does transfers at a reasonable rate and I will split the cost.

As you can see, it has a nice quad rail with covers, an Eotech 552.A65 Holographic sight, an adjustable stock, a very smooth, light trigger job (not sure on specs, but very nice), sweet ergonomic foregrip, magpul flip up front and rear sights, a Magpul 30 round mag, a black recoil pad and a nice tactical sling...I'll also throw in this plastic carrying case and 300 rounds of Federal .223
NO, I don't want to sale the ammo by itself
I'm not desperate, so don't waste our time with silly offers, I have alot invested in this gun and will just keep it if no one wants it....but it is a quality gun....If you want or need to pay less we can start taking add-ons off if you'd like to make it more affordable
THANKS

I have a nearly perfect Mossberg 800A in 308 Winchester with a Mossberg 3x9 scope mounted on it. This has very few rounds through it, has sat in my gun safe and is cleaned and oiled yearly... even though it has not been shot.  I am now simply out of room and and really don't hunt any more.  So, I figure that someone else would make much better use out of it. 

If you don't have a hunting licence or pistol permit, don't bother.  Also, I do not need to sell it, so please no low-ball offers.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market.
