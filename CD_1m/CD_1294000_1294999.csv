For sale is a ""used as new"" condition Colt 1911 WW1 reproduction pistol. This is the 01918 Black Army Oxide edition of the WW1 reproduction. This is a late model of the production run of this series, in the 3,7xx range of just over 4,000 pistols made. While there was a recall on the safety catch of the early versions, this one was not recalled, and has the correct metallurgy used in all parts. The gun is blued with the black oxide finish typical of the US Army issued 1911s during the First World War. Bluing is of high order, typical of Colt outstanding 1911 pistols. Compare to the very nice but less pretty parkerized WW2 reproduction pistol.  

It has the early notch GI-style front and rear sights. 

I have put just under 150 rounds of .45 ACP through the gun. The cosmetic condition is 99%, with only some slight finish marks on the hammer face and the barrel, both of which are similarly blued with the black oxide. The gun came this way when I got it, the result of the slide being wracked for the purpose of demonstration and safety checks. 

A really great 1911. Over the years since these repro's finished production (around 2010), their value has enhanced slightly, and like most Colt 1911s it holds value significantly even after use. It feeds flawlessly, is amazingly accurate, and the WW1 guns are especially valued as utterly faithful tributes to the original guns, the very first 1911 warhorses. A very beautiful shooter. 

Included is the new Colt manual, a reprint of the original 1911 manual, the original individual pistol box in 100% condition, Colt screwdriver / takedown punch tool, 2 blued Colt magazines, brown oiled wrapping paper for the gun and mags, and a large blue Colt custom shop box, with the the Colt emblem embossed on it. 

If you want a solid shooting, stylish and top-quality 1911, this Colt may be it. Price is $1100 USD. This will be a licensed FFL transaction. The price includes the fee for the background check / FFL transfer. I have a Milwaukee FFL picked out- If there are issues regarding FFL preferences, I am happy to work with individual buyers. Please email me with any questions. Thank you!"

I bought this about half a year ago, I don't know how many rounds went through it but I know I only put around 80 rounds through it. The firearm is cleaned ritually even if it has not been shot. I've took really good care of it while I had it! I don't have time to go out shooting anymore so I would like to try to get rid of it. 

The Smith & Wesson SW99 is a modern, polymer frame pistol that is nearly identical to the Walther P99. The SW99 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. It is chambered in .40 S&W. The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This mechanism differs with each variation of the action, which will be explained below. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety. As with the P99, the cocking indicator does not protrude from the slide of the QA variant unless the weapon is fired, as it is in a constant partially cocked state. The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol, should the casing head rupture.

It works and looks flawless but he just chews through to much ammo with it. It comes with the original box and dust cover and as you can see it looks brand new. It's only a month old anyways. Asking $80 odo. First one with the money can have it. If you feel like druving to my farm your welcome to try it out yourself. It's a great idea and works great but its not child friendly because it eats ammo like it does.

Assault Weapons Ban Dropped From Senate Gun Control Bill

The leader of the Democrat-controlled Senate on Tuesday dropped a proposed ""assault weapons"" ban from the chamber’s gun-control package — dealing a blow to supporters, though it could still come up for a vote.

just Don't know the Laws. We have Bought and Sold Guns most of my life, and it is such a pain now to make a deal, because people just don't know what the laws really are...

http://smartgunlaws.org/private-sales-policy-summary/

The Gun Control Act of 1968 provides that persons “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms must be licensed.3 Although Congress did not originally define the term “engaged in the business,” it did so in 1986 as part of the McClure-Volkmer Act (also known as the “Firearms Owners’ Protection Act”). That Act defined the term “engaged in the business,” as applied to a firearms dealer, as “a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms.”4
Significantly, however, the term was defined to exclude a person who “makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.”

5.
Consequently, unlicensed sellers may sell firearms without conducting background checks or documenting the transaction in any way. In addition, because federal law does not require private sellers to inspect a buyer’s driver’s license or any other identification, there is no obligation for such sellers to confirm that a buyer is of legal age to purchase a firearm. 
As a result, convicted felons, minors and other prohibited purchasers can easily buy guns from unlicensed sellers."

This gun was purchased 1 year ago.  It has been carried a lot, but shot relatively little.  It is the HD model with rosewood grips and night sights.  This gun is reliable super concealable and very accurate for its size.  I have no problem putting an entire magazine worth of shots on an 8.5 x 11 target at 25 yards.  The only reason I am getting rid of this gun is that it is not the cheapest gun to shoot.  I would like to get something small and easily concealable and something a little more fun to put a lot of rounds through.  

My gun will come with the following:  

Sig p238 HD w/ night sights $650 with box paper work and original sig holster and 6rd mag
1 extra sig 7rd mag $50
1 extra 7rd colt mag (works fine with gun) $35
1 pro mag 6rd mag $25
1 desantis leather iwb holster $36
1 custom owb pancake style leather holster $50
3 boxes of buffalo bore +p defensive ammo (plus 2 mags worth of extra) $99
6 boxes of winchester 100 rd white box fmj $216
6 boxes of federal 50 rd fmj$120
1 box of remington umc 50rd fmj $18
That adds up to an original package value of $1300 plus tax.  I would want your trade to be worth the same (in original retail value) or make up for it in cash.  I know what some people are asking for right now and I refuse to play those games.   Your xd is not worth $700.  If your trade includes a .380 I would keep some of my ammo and adjust trade value accordingly.

This trade will be a package deal and to be clear, I am not interested in trading for any weapon that does not come with at least some ammo.  Ideally I would like something like a keltec .380 or lcp or pocket sized 9mm and a fullsize 9mm.  I may also be interested in a single stack 9mm like a shield 9 or kahr 9mm.  I would also be interested in a trade for a weapon plus cash on either your end or my end.  I am most interested in the following larger 9mm handguns: Springfield xd9 or xd9sc, m&p 9 or compact version, glock 26 or 19, sig 226, sig sp2022.  If your trade involves a single stack 9mm or dependable .380 I would be interested in that plus a big game hunting rifle.

 Location: Clayton NC (East of Raleigh)

Looking for: New model Vaqueros or Blackhawks in .357 magnum. Stainless or blued.

I have a 66 no dash that I would consider a shooter. I haven't had it long but, the single action bug has bit me so this has to go. I got it 2 weeks ago and shot 300 rounds through it last saturday flawlessly. 

Condition: It has scuffs and marks but, those can be massaged out (Stainless is great!). It does have a scratch on the left side by the cylinder release that will need to be sanded if you wanna make it pretty.

Grips: It does not include the original grips but, it has Pachmyers on it.

Cylinder Release: Is missing. I have no idea why but, it's $18 shipped off Brownells.

Trigger: The owner told me that he had a buddy years ago work the trigger over. I have no way of verifying this but, it embarrases my GP100. Its light and smooth but, it set off 300 handloads so I'd say it's good to go.

I will have pictures later.

Overall if you want a shooter or something to practice your polishing skills on this is it. Come on its 66 no dash, pinned and recessed, with stainless rear sights.

All NC laws apply and the trader must show me a ccw or permit.

All I really see coming out of all this mess is possibly (and that's a BIG ""possibly) a national law pertaining to the private sales of all firearms. Background check required, etc. I honestly think private sales of firearms should require a background check, but if they pass this type of bill then they need to streamline the process. I really don't want to have to go to an FFL holder any time I want to buy or sell a firearm privately.

I've put 500 rounds through this pistol using 5 different brands and grains of ammunition. I've had no stove pipes, no miss feeds, no suibs, no issues at all other than ammunition prices.

The Colt Cobra is a snubnose revolver, and is a lighter version of the Colt Detective Special. The Colt Cobra was preferred by detectives and policeman over the competing Smith & Wesson revolvers at the time.

The Colt Cobra is also known to be the revolver used by Jack Ruby to shoot and kill Lee Harvey Oswald, President Kennedy's alleged assassin on November 24, 1963, after the President had been shot 2 days prior. The revolver is seen in the iconic photograph that captured the moment Oswald was shot. Ruby's revolver was equipped with a hammer shroud, meaning he likely did not cock the hammer before shooting Oswald.

This precision rifle requires open tip match ammunition. If your looking to shoot the cheap stuff this rifle is not for you. Whats cool about this rifle is that it can be easily converted into a 338, 300, 243, and 270 in under a minute. It just requires you to have the conversion kit in the caliber you desire. Same chasis just different barrel and bolt. Pretty cool stuff. I have it set up for a 308 and I think this is a great all around caliber wether shooting 100 yards or 1000 yards plus this rifle will do it. I bought because I shot my buddies and had to have one. In the course of waiting 5 months to get one some things came up.. However, I am not even close to desperate to sell. I could keep this rifle and shoot it when time is available again. I just thought maybe someone could enjoy it but it isnt going to be cheap. Good thing is, its already setup and ready to go. No waiting, no transfer fees or the 9.4 percent washington taxes.
