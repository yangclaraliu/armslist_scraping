0,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1765000,For Sale:  LMT Complete Upper AR-15 w/ Colt XM177 Barrel:,"Arlington, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 450,"Listed On: Saturday, June 22, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Greetings. I'm selling a flattop LMT complete upper with original Colt XM177 barrel assembly.

I picked this up from an elderly military veteran at a Virginia gun show a few months back to complete my Stag AR-15 build, but I ended up buying a complete Stag upper not long after that and have decided to let this LMT/Colt upper go.

The flattop AR-15 upper assembly is LMT with T-markings, trapdoor and forward assist, M16/M4 grade bolt carrier group, and standard charging handle. The upper has some wear marks, which can be seen in the pictures below, but cycles fine.

After doing some research, the 12.5"" barrel assembly appears to be from a military-issued Colt XM177E2, otherwise known as a CAR-15 Commando, which saw use during Vietnam. It is chambered for 5.56 NATO, although .233 will work. It has dual 6-hole heat-shield hand guards. The unique flash hider was designed to help counter-balance the weight of the firearm. Please note that it is non-pinned and non-welded.

All NFA rules apply and it is your obligation to know your State's gun laws.

I will accept cash, USPS money order or discrete Paypal + 3% fee to final total.

I can meet anywhere in Northern Virginia or I can ship it to you. Shipping will be a flat $15 via USPS direct to you. No FFL required.

AK & HI Residents: Please contact me for shipping quote.

PLEASE NOTE: I have tried to detail as much as I know about this build as I am not the original owner. As such, this complete upper is being sold AS-IS with no refunds or warranties expressed or implied.

Please feel free to ask me any questions and I will do my best to answer them.

Thanks for looking!"

It has around 300 rounds through, very well kept and cared for.

I started with a stripped Yankee Hills Machine lower, installed a Spikes Enhanced LPK with KNS anti-rotation pins and a Nickel Boron trigger group.
http://tinyurl.com/lhzowe2

The stock is an Ergo P93, with optional butt-pad and strike plate, and a standard ATI buffer and spring.

The upper is an Adams Arms mid-length piston upper, with a 16"" threaded 1:7 twist barrel.  The piston system runs much cooler and cleaner for longer life and lower maintenance. 
http://tinyurl.com/bt745wb

The sights are YHM Quick Deploy spring-loaded folding sights.  Also installed is a BCM gunfighter Mod 4 charging handle and a POF roller cam for smooth operation.  I also installed an extended front sight post in so I could set up either a 50/200 or 100 yard zero, rather than the standard 25/300 zero.

I have run around 300 rounds through this gun, and it works great.

$1200 for the rifle, and that will include 1 20 round PMAG

I also have available 6 30-round magazines, 5 PMAGS and one Troy Battle mag.
Also I have a Midway single point sling, Midway 36"" Tactical Rifle case, GunVault magwell lock, 2 snap caps, sight tool, castle nut wrench, and chamber brush. Also included are the original charging handle, cam, and front sight post. 

$200 additional gets all this included.  I won't separate it though, as I don't have another AR to use the gear with.

And last, I have  1740 rounds of steel cased Wolf 62 GR FMJ and TulAmmo 62 GR HP, about half of each.  

$.35/round

I have the magazines loaded, and the rest boxed.

Buy the whole kit, and I'll throw in the accessories and ammo in the magazines. Also I have a Stanley toolbox I'll include to transport the ammo.

$1750 for everything. Cash only, prefer to deal local.

Separate would be $2010.

I'm not opposed to trades, but I'm not in need of much at this time.
I would consider as a partial trade something in a bitone .45 XDM 4.5 or 5.25, or some flavor of double stack .45 ACP plus cash."

Before I got the safe, it was purchased new in 1995 and used at a jewelry store since. The jewelry store closed down and auctioned off a lot of their inventory. The safe originally had an electronic lock. I have a friend who is a professional locksmith, he is in the process of converting it to a dial safe. I am in the process of giving it a new paint job.. The safe will look brand new when everything is done. I am looking to sell or trade the safe, I am moving and do not wish to take it with.. Winchester safes this size go for $3500-$6000 brand new. I am asking $1500 cash or trade. I am interested in a number of things; however I am looking for a real nice tactical .308. I also like anything Springfield, saiga, or S&W Ar-15 and revolver related. I am pretty open to things and would be willing to add cash if your trade is worth more. I would also be interested in some ammo..

system for a custom fit. It has a manual safety and an ambidextrous slide
stop lever. The Bruniton non-reflective black coating is offer superior

The previous owner laid it down at low speed but there was no serious damage because of the frame sliders on it. The plastics were cracked so I bought a genuine Yamaha kit to convert it to a ""naked"" bike. Everything on it is original yamaha parts besides the mirror, the mirror mounts, and the speedo mount. The stator cover is scratched but it doesn't effect function or anything, I just never cared to put a new one on. I have put a few thousand miles on it in the past year and a half and it's a great bike. It has a more relaxed riding position that a super sport but it still plenty quick. It's geared more for the commuter/weekend warrior so there is more usable torque but less top end HP. (which means fewer speeding tickets). Everything on it functions perfect. The oil was changed about 1200 miles ago, so it shouldn't need changed for a while. This bike has not been abused, as I take pride in my toys I have taken great care of it and put a bit of money in to getting it to where it is now. I will not do test rides unless you bring $3400 cash for me to hold until you get back. $3400 OBO, I'm willing to negotiate a little bit but please don't bother contacting me with low ball offers.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

It also has a Magpul MOE trigger guard plus a MOE plus GRIP grip.  The original trigger was replaced with a Spikes single stage as I found the original Geiselle 3G trigger to be too light.

I originally purchased the rifle from Stag with the intent to enter the 3 Gun world, but I now realize family life does not harmonize at this time.  This rifle has only 50 rounds through as I tested 3 kinds of ammo.  This rifle is sub moa with Fiocchi 69 grain Exacta Match ammo.  It also shot well with Black Hills 77 grain 5.56 ammo. 

This rifle has sights and a vertical fore grip in the picture, but those items are not included.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

I am a college student spending the summer in the twin cities working, and my friend and I are having a tough time finding a good place to shoot rifles. I normally spend my spend my summers in northern mn, and can shoot whenever I want. Shooting is a hobby of mine, as well as deer hunting. We are both very responsible, respectful, and safety conscious. If you have a piece of land where we can safely and legally shoot up to 100 Yards within 40 minutes or so of the southwest metro, we would be very grateful if you allowed us to use it to shoot. We can give some compensation, but since we are in college we don't have much cash to spare.

The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver).


The M1895 revolver was used extensively by the Russian Imperial Army and later by the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution. In Russian service, it was known for its extreme sturdiness and ability to withstand abuse.
It was widely employed by the Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka, as well as its Soviet successor agencies, the OGPU and NKVD. In the police role, it was frequently seen with a cut-down barrel to aid in concealment by plainclothes agents. Despite the advent of the more modern Soviet TT pistol, the M1895 remained in production and use throughout World War II.

The Nagant's sealed firing system meant that the Nagant revolver, unlike most other revolvers, could make effective use of a sound suppressor, and suppressors were sometimes fitted to it.
 During World War II, a small number of Nagant revolvers used by Russian reconnaissance and scout troops were outfitted with a variety of sound suppressors.
 Like many other suppressed foreign weapons (including the Sten Mk VIS), captured Nagants were used in limited numbers by Nazi Germany. Suppressed M1895 Nagant revolvers, modified in clandestine workshops, also turned up in the hands of Viet Cong guerrillas during the Vietnam War as assassination weapons.

This is a nice example with dark blueing and good wood. 2 small blemished areas on the blueing.
Marked on the left side is an arrow inside a star, 1940, and BA445
Marked on the right side is; 1895 Russia 7.62x38R and 189532343- CAI Georgia, UT.

Included are an appropriate holster dated 1950, tools and 28 rounds of period ammo.

They go for about $3500 brand new. This one is new but since I don't have the box, I cant ask for the new price. I am in no need to keep. So that is way I willing to part with it. Below is the actual description from the B.E. Meyers website.

The IZLID®100P is a compact, lightweight IR laser pointer for military forces.  It is ideal as a command pointer, for target marking, and for visual communication with aircraft.  A simple adjustment turns the laser into an IR illuminator for rapid identification with night vision goggles (NVGs) or IR sensors.  When used by police and law enforcement, the IZLID 100P is a powerful IR illuminator for nighttime surveillance applications.  This 100 mW IR laser is small enough to use handheld or mounted on personal weapons, yet powerful enough to call in airstrikes or aim weapons over 30 km. Combined with the six degree field of view IR illuminator capability, the IZLID 100P provides the perfect solution for an M4 or M16 as well as an M2 .50 cal HBMG or minigun. The IZLID 100P laser is routinely used by ground forces to point out targets to airborne support."

Has origional box, and has had roughly 40 rounds through it with no malfunctions (even though Kahr says there is a 200 round brake in period, still no problems even in the brake in period). For deep conceal CCW its unbeatable in my opinion, you get full power 9mm in a tiny package (I sometimes forgot I had it on me, no joke).

Up for your consideration is a very nice Custom Pepsi Pop Machine Gun Safe. Rest assured your guns and ammo sit in your man cave fully secured and hiding in plain sight. 

This safe is custom built, fully carpeted with grey carpet, and has barrel rests for 7 long guns. Pistol area holds 4 pistols. Inside dimensions = 13"" Deep x 14.5"" Wide x 44"" Tall.  
Ammo compartment dimensions = 15"" Deep x 26"" Wide x 9"" Tall. 
Outside dimensions of machine = 20"" Sides x 26.5"" Wide (front & back) x 59"" Tall


The safe is very well built, incredibly sturdy with lock and key.  It is equipped with one - 5 LED light strip that really lights up and shows off the quality inside. The outside and inside has been cleaned, old paint removed, and repainted back to its original glory. I replaced all the labels with authentic new labels. The lower level can be used to store ammo. The lower level also can be filled with sand/concrete to add additional weight or the machine can be bolted down to your floor for security. This safe is strictly a theft deterrent. I did not install any fire, or flood proof protection. A lot of time, work and money went into this safe and it is very nice looking. I’m asking 800.00. Email with any questions. Thanks"

This is a great concealed carry weapon. The magnesium alloy frame makes it very lightweight (13.2 oz empty). The 856 is a 6 shot on a 5 shot frame, meaning it packs 20% more ammo without gaining hardly any size or weight. Shoots great. I purchased it new in March 2012 and I've shot about 250-300 rounds through it. No reloads or +P fired through it. Trigger pull is not too stiff, even when shooting double-action. It's pretty accurate for a 2"" snubnose. It out-shoots my dad's 2"" .357 Smith & Wesson. 

I'm throwing in 109 rounds of Remington UMC target ammo and 29 rounds of Winchester Super X Silvertip Jacketed Hollow Point self-defense ammo and a cheap nylon holster. Also comes with the hammer-lock key, I just forgot to include it in the photo.

 to make a long story short I built this set up to do some 600 yard shooting with my ex girlfriend. Needless to say I lost interest after the end of the relationship. I spent a large amount of cash on this set up, and If you know what your looking for you see that I have all the gear you need to be accurate on cold bore shots for a reasonable distance with some proper firing solutions and some practice. 

 I am at 2500 firm on this set up, just the rifle build alone is 2300, and it has been fired 30 times. 

 If your serious about shooting this is your gun, there are also some other random things I will throw in like new gloves and a strap and a graphing calculator. 

 No low balls, ffl transfer only, no exceptions so do not ask. If you are a new york resident I will still require a transfer at an ffl. No exceptions. I can not stress it enough, I will not respond to emails that mention anything not above board. 

I do not expect this to be listed very long, and thanks for looking."
