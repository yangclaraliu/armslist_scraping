149,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1240149,"For Sale:   Organized Civil Disobedience; July 02, 2013","Denver, Denver, Colorado","$ 9,999,999,999","Listed On: Saturday, June 15, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

On July 2, 2013, over 500 Colorado citizens will engage in an act of mass civil disobedience to demonstrate the foolish, arbitrary, capricious and unconstitutional nature of the HB 13-1224 which will have gone into effect on the day before.

These Colorado citizens will gather in a public park in Aurora, Colorado. Each of these citizens will bring a single unloaded regular capacity magazine of the type that has been in common use in Colorado and nation wide since the 1980s, and which each of them owned and possessed prior to the effective date of the statute. The United States Supreme Court has made CLEAR that law abiding citizens have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms that are in common use. There are millions of such magazines in Colorado, and they have been lawfully owned and used by Colorado citizens for defense, sport, target shooting, competition, and other lawful use for decades. Yet this property will have been transformed overnight into a form of contraband.

At exactly 12:00 noon, these citizens will begin to pass their magazines to each other, one to the other, again and again, in contravention of Colorado's new prohibition against transfer of existing regular capacity magazines.

The number of magazines will not change.

The nature of the people will not change, nor will their non-violent nature.

The fact these people are your friends, neighbors, co-workers, and fellow citizens will not change.

The ""lethality"" of the crowd will not change.

The danger ""on the streets"" will not change.

The number of magazines in circulation will not change.

The fact that the magazines have not been utilized to project violence or do any evil will not change.

At any given moment, each person will be holding one magazine that existed on the day the law came into effect, just as they did when they arrived.

But during the course of this organized civil disobedience, the crowd will be committing over 30,000 misdemeanors per minute. They will do so in direct and defiant challenge of a blatantly unconstitutional law, and will be prepared for arrest. In the event of arrests, each person will refuse to plea bargain and will insist on trial by jury. In conjunction, the gun rights organizations listed below will be assisting these individuals' legal defense, and bringing a constitutional challenge of the law both facially and as applied.

This protest will occur contemporaneously with similar protests in other states where politicians have determined to run roughshod over Constitutional rights in an attempt to make a showing of ""doing something"" about violence, but who lack the courage and political will to take a close look at the mental health system and the systemic failures that resulted from phasing out institutional care while greatly increasing the dispensing of dangerous psychotropic drugs."

161,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1240161,For Sale:  Night Optics M845 2.8x Gen2+ Night Vision Scope,"East of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio","$ 1,625","Listed On: Monday, March 11, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a Night Optics M845 2.8x fixed magnification Gen 2+ night vision scope. I originally purchased one of these from OpticsPlanet.com last May, however it had a faulty wiring issue and the battery connections looked poor so the unit was sent back to the manufacturer, Night Optics, shortly after for inspection and repair. They sent me a replacement unit with different SN, brand new, direct from the manufacturer (not even through Optics Planet). I should have ordered from them in the first place, as it appeared OP was selling ones that didn't pass inspection or something along those lines.

None the less, the unit for sale is the brand new unit, straight from Night Optics. I have proof of purchase of original unit as well as the conversation with Night Optics to show that the unit was brand new, direct from Night Optics. I have not used yet on a rifle, but messed around with it for about half an hour outside. For an expensive piece of equipment such as night vision I though the background of the unit would be of utmost importance, especially since night vision tubes have a limited life.

That said, the quality of these units is AMAZING. The tubes do rival the quality and clearness of a true Gen 3 tube, but without the full price tag of one of those units. This was one of the few Gen 2 units sold and recommended by Tactical Night Vision Company (TNVC), until they were discontinued by Night Optics recently. The batteries were not installed in the unit during the brief time I've had this in storage in the safe.

Two nice features of this device are the eyeguard and the lens cap. The eyeguard closes when not in use to prevent green backsplash onto your face. The lens cap has a pin hole in it for safe and easy zeroing during daylight.

The only reason I am selling it is to upgrade to a PVS-14 to work with my current optic set up.

The one beauty of the M845 though, is that if you don't have an optic already, it is a night vision sight and optic all in one. There is a setting for just night vision, and three different intensity red dots reticles. Very easy to focus this unit as well.

Included is Scope, carrying case, 2 original batteries, lens paper, and instruction card.

Can send more pics if needed.

Other than the 30 minutes I used this in my yard this unit is brand new."

Very few Smith & Wesson 442 revolvers were manufactured in 1993 in any finish, much less satin nickel. Model marking inside the frame has no engineering change suffix, either. As far as basic features, The Model 442 is full-time double action; since the hammer is completely enclosed inside the frame. For personal protection, many veteran law enforcement officers and firearms instructors recommend the Centennial it cannot be fired in single action mode, where a person cocks the hammer and then pulls the trigger. This configuration has long been very popular and, in my opinion, vastly less dangerous than many of its semi-automatic peers. This revolver was made in 1993 and looks and works as new.

For sale is a new in the box, 10/22 take down by Ruger. I have bore sighted and mounted a beautiful SS simmons 22 mag scope, 3x9x32. Included in the bundle is 200 rounds of CCI mini mag Hollow Points. This comes with the factory standard 10 round mag.

I'm selling it because my gun shop informed me that my Ruger 10/22 iTac SS finally arrived! I wasn't sure it would ever arrive, so I bought a take down- patience isn't easy for me.

I don't need both of them. This is a sweet set-up! Don't pay $560 for just the gun from some of the other guys on this sight.

I also have brand new butler creek steel lips, in clear color 25 rounds mags for sale. These slide together, so you can make a 50 round switch mag. I'm asking $75 per pair.

Do some research and look around. You will see that my bundle is better. 

First $550 gets it. And no I won't hold it."

It's one thing to get on here and bitch and moan about prices, but at least know what the hell you're talking about. Before you start posting about what a great deal you got at your ""farm store"" find a smart friend or barrow a calculator so you don't look like a complete idiot. 20 rounds that cost 6.99 plus tax is a lot closer to .37 a round, just a little proof reading or some basic math and you'd almost look like you knew what you were talking about.

You will also get this gun with a Maryland Arms gas system upgrade that will allow you to shoot ANY SIZE OR LOAD OF 12 guage ammo your heart desires. Cheap walmart lowbrass to big ol' deer slugs. 

Also, doing a face to face transaction here in Indy is just fine but I WILL ship this anywhere in the continental United States provided that a dealers FFL info is emailed to me. UPS will not even let you in the door without that FFL info so it is a must. I have no problems semding additional pics or doing anything you like to make you comfortable with the sale. I fully understand buying a gun online is a big deal and I dont take it lightly. Cashiers check or money order is a prefered method of payment if the gun is shipped.

Collapsable forward grip with built in storage compartment
Upgraded ergonomic Maryland Arms rear AK style pistol grip

I will also throw in the hard to find high capacity 12 shot magazine for an extra $50. 
The only reason I am charging extra is cuz I personally had to pay $95 to find one of these online. 


So, alright heres the deal. Anyone who is crazy enough to sell one of these right now has to have a pretty good reason so here is my deal so you understand. I have dreamed of owning one of these for years, but my wife would never let me have one in the house. In regards to the recent turn of events in congress I decided to just go ahead and buy one online. I then proceeded to begin fixing this thing up the way I wanted it,......then, my wife found out. So, now I have to take this big ol' bad hunk of gold (cuz when these get banned they will be worth 3x as much) and I have to pass it to the next lucky guy. I hope whoever gets it enjoys it as much as I wanted to. That is why I am not trying to jack the price way up there, I am only just charging what I paid for the gun and the extras add on parts.  I just want this to go to a good responsible home.

The rifling at the end of the ""barrel"" is approximately .280"" - I tried to measure it from the raised edges of the rifling and not the inside of the grooves, so I think it is 7mm. I have not done any work on the gun - this is the condition in which I received it. It is rusty, and the parts seem to be seized. I was thinking about soaking it in penetrating oil and taking it apart, but I decided to wait.

I cannot make out any names or markings on the gun.
I do not know what the gun is worth - reasonable and educated offers are welcome. 

I AM OPEN TO A TRADE, including a gun that needs refinishing."
