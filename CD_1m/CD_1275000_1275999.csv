I have two stock magazines as well as two extended magazines, a Kahr Infinity Holster, Over 300 rounds of ammunition and the original palstic box, manual, trigger lock and receipt! It has Meprolight Night Sights installed by Kahr. I love this gun but have decided that the 9mm Luger is my round. I also recently switched to the Weaver Stance for shooting. As soon as I started doing this, about one in ten shells would eject into my forehead. I have carried this gun concealed for two years now, and have put about 1200 rounds down range. I took the first column of checkering off the front of the handle, smoothed the shape of the beaver-tail area just above the backstrap, as well as the slide release, as all of these areas were causing pain after extended firing sessions. I also polished the plane of the slide where the engraving is. I have always cleaned it after each session at the range and taken great care of it. 

So if you have a Kahr PM9 or CM9, or maybe a Berretta Nano in 9mm, and you're looking to step up to the 45ACP, lets talk trade!

I bought it new about 5 years ago and took it to the range 3 times total with less than 400 rounds down the barrel. I always used non-corrosive ammo and cleaned the weapon with Remington's Bore-Brite and Rem-Oil. The rifle is in an excellent condition and shows virtually no signs of wear. It is an awesome piece of hardware and shoots dead center (only took 5 rounds to sight in).

The rifle is in the AK-102 configuration with the front sight part of the glass block.  It has a side-folding wire stock and a 4 inch muzzle break secured by two spot welds.  Muzzle break is awesome at controlling recoil, but can be easily removed to be replaced with another one or for an SBR project. I made a few useful upgrades:

- Four-rail aluminum forend
- Tapco shorty front grip with storage (does not interfere with magazine change)
- CAA pistol grip with interchangeable finger gloves and palm swells and storage space
- Recoil buffer 
- Single point sling
- Added a paracord braid on the buttstock to improve the grip and to soften recoil a tad (standard bridge braid, adds about 1/2 padding and is surprisingly effective)

The AK comes with three 30 round mags, one 40 round mag, one 5 round mag, single point sling, soft case, additional finger grooves and palm swells for the pistol grip, and 120 rounds of ammo. Original grip and for end are also included. Selling the AK because I have too many toys and don't need an arsenal at home.

These awesome handguns are jam-packed with all the features you need and want in a modern handgun. Grand Power pistols are all made on 4140 steel reinforced polymer frames with a significant design emphasis on ergonomics and ease of function. Each pistol has an integral Picatinny rail in the frame and comes with four interchangeable backstraps, so it is like having a handgun that is custom made for you! Attention southpaws! Each pistol is fully ambidextrous, the slide lock, mag. release and safety are fully functional on both sides of the frame - right out of the box - no modifications required! All of the barrels are high quality stainless steel and use a patented rotating lock, rather than tilting, during cycling for super smooth work at the range. The trigger has a very short reset, so accurate and fast follow-up shots are a breeze. The slide and the steel reinforcing in the frame is finished by nitrocarburizing. This creates a deep, matte non-reflective finish that is actually as hard as tool steel, for unsurpassed ruggedness. Used by the Slovakia military = where there is no shortage of quality locally made sidearms from the former Czechoslovakia - Grand Power pistols were put through, and passed with flying colors, incredible torture tests that other internationally famous brands failed miserably. Such as 100,000 rounds without any changes in critical dimensions. 20,000 consecutive rounds without any feeding failures. And a silicone dust, wind chamber test (think desert sandstorm) that ground the competition to a halt - literally. Attractive, tough, comfortable to use and light weight to carry, Grand Power makes a pistol that you will be proud to own for years to come. Made in the Slovak Republic by Grand Power, the K100 Mk7 is a modern, fully ambidextrous 9mm semi automatic pistol that features an external hammer and interchangeable grip panels. The frame is made from steel reinforced GF-30 polymer which reduces the overall weight of the gun without compromising strength, function or reliability. The SA/DA Mk7 comes with four easily interchangeable grip backstraps that ensure a comfortable ergonomic grip for almost any user! Comes with two 16 rd. mags. and plastic case. Barrel: 4.25"", Overall: 7.97"", Weight: 1.8 lbs. Not available for sale in CA; DC; HI; MA; Cook County, IL or where prohibited by law.  Condition: New.

I put a brand new truglo red dot scope on it and a turkey choke. Both barrel and gun are ported! I also have a imp cyl for the 24in barrel so when turkey season is out you can shoot slugs or use it for home defense. I have 15 rounds of Remington express high brass #5 to go with it. The only thing wrong with the gun is the butt stock has a crack. Doesnt affect the way it shoots. Have a new forearm too. Turkey season is just around the corner. Lot of extras.

Call or text with any questions... not really looking for trades. But may consider trade or partial trade if you have something i cant turn down HIGH END hand guns and Tactical weapons only.

These awesome handguns are jam-packed with all the features you need and want in a modern handgun. Grand Power pistols are all made on 4140 steel reinforced polymer frames with a significant design emphasis on ergonomics and ease of function. Each pistol has an integral Picatinny rail in the frame and comes with four interchangeable backstraps, so it is like having a handgun that is custom made for you! Attention southpaws! Each pistol is fully ambidextrous, the slide lock, mag. release and safety are fully functional on both sides of the frame - right out of the box - no modifications required! All of the barrels are high quality stainless steel and use a patented rotating lock, rather than tilting, during cycling for super smooth work at the range. The trigger has a very short reset, so accurate and fast follow-up shots are a breeze. The slide and the steel reinforcing in the frame is finished by nitrocarburizing. This creates a deep, matte non-reflective finish that is actually as hard as tool steel, for unsurpassed ruggedness. Used by the Slovakia military = where there is no shortage of quality locally made sidearms from the former Czechoslovakia - Grand Power pistols were put through, and passed with flying colors, incredible torture tests that other internationally famous brands failed miserably. Such as 100,000 rounds without any changes in critical dimensions. 20,000 consecutive rounds without any feeding failures. And a silicone dust, wind chamber test (think desert sandstorm) that ground the competition to a halt - literally. Attractive, tough, comfortable to use and light weight to carry, Grand Power makes a pistol that you will be proud to own for years to come. The P1 Mk7 is a shorter, compact version of the K100 using the same Mk7 frame and also made in the Slovak Republic by Grand Power. The P1 has a shorter slide and barrel making it the perfect choice for concealed carry. Like its full size brother, the P1 also comes with four easily interchangeable grip backstraps that ensure a comfortable ergonomic grip for almost any user! Comes with two 16 rd. mags. and plastic case. Barrel: 3.66"", Overall: 7.38"", Weight: 1.71 lbs. Not available for sale in CA; DC; HI; MA; Cook County, IL or where prohibited by law. Condition: New.

 I just fired 10 rounds, and all 10 fired very accuratly and consistantly. I think these are about 8 months old, but Im not sure... in the dry box my ammo seems to last forever. 

I counted 144 rounds of federal.

I was just at ATP and I was amazed at the lack of ammo and high prices! Im only trading this off because I have a feeling someone needs/wants it more than I do... I have plenty... no squirrel is safe...

I also have some CCI standard velocity, but I was planning on saving that for myself. I would be willing to trade off 2 of my new unopened 50rd boxes for the right deal/person.

You'll have to meet me in person between charleston-hollywood area... its 22lr so you shouldnt be driving that far to get it.

Not perfect, but very nice, just the same. Sorry for the crummy phone pic, because it really doesn't do this gun justice. This is said to be a pretty special item, according to some knowledgeable folks over at RFC. Here is a snippet of what they posted:

Info from the web about the rarety of my Ruger MKII - Note, mine is a shooter and not worth as much as a new in box.

From Chad's reference:

KMK514 special distributor model. Features a regular production KMK514 with Desert Camo laminated thumbrest grips. Known s/n range 216-42263 to 216-43553. About 1,500 produced for Outdoor Sports (OH) in 1990.

I might also add that a Ruger Mark II KMK 514 NIB at the current going prices for MK II's on GB will most likely top $600.00 at auction. The only MK II selling for more than them right now are the Government Target versions in stainless and I saw one of those go for $750.00 which would have been unheard of a few short years ago. Gun prices for the Ruger variations have really started to climb in the last few years!
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

They also say this model with this barrel is one of the best balanced Marks ever made. Don't know about that, but it sure feels good in your hand. Anyways, I hate to let it go, but I just don't use it much and with ammo so scarce, it just isn't filling my needs. Comes with 2 mags and holster. Might be interested in working a trade on a compact 9mm of some sort other than Keltek. Asking $425 FTF in the Jackson area only. Call 769-218-1108"

Like New 1991 manufactured Ruger SP101 .38 Special (not 38/357 and not DAO). I'm not original owner so no idea on ""round count"", but it's tight, looks new, and I'm picky. 2"" barrel, standard hammer. Revolver only, no case, etc. The photos are stock of the same model, only with another serial number. $500 trade value. The list of candidates is long (Beretta 92FS, CZ75, Steyr M9A1, Sig SP2022, etc) so feel free to make suggestions, semi-autos or revolvers. I love revolvers as long as the barrel is less than 6"". No long guns, and I'm not a fan of Taurus or Bersa. Just my opinion. Also,  FYI I'm also considering this instead of trading it: 

""Hello, I have an SP101 "".38spl only"" and would like a 357. The revolver was manufactured in 1991, so I'm not sure if the cylinder length had grown that early in production. What kind of money am I looking at for either parts and fitting a new cylinder or simply re-chambering the original? Also, would it be returned to me or require an FFL transfer? Thanks""

""We can re chamber the cylinder in your gun. You will be able to use federal 125 grain .357 mag rounds only, other than any 38 special loads of course. Other brand 357 ammunition may be too long, or some move forward during live fire and lock up the gun. The federal 125 mag works with no problem. We just need the cylinder and if you send us the cylinder, no FFL is needed, we can do the work and return the cylinder to you. Cost is $75.00 plus $9.95 return S&H. One week turn around time for that work. Thank you, Rick"""
