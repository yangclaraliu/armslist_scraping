Nice example of a High Standard Dura-Matic M-101 semi-auto pistol in a .22LR. Shoots very nice with the correct ammo as hollow point ammo tends to jam when feeding. Very well built and heavy duty. Cycles well and has a very nice feel to it. Only cosmetics issue is the clip base came loose, to which I peened over the bottom as seen in the pic. Has the smaller 4"" barrel, however it is interchangeable with the 6.5"" if you can find one. This pistol shoots very well and is very accurate. Cleaning is very simple as this gun breaks down in 30 sseconds as seen in the pic.

The receiver is machined from an 11 pound block of 4140 ordnance quality steel and has a proprietary V shaped Chevron Compensator, designed exclusively by Century. 

This unparalleled compensator design directs gases upward, which reduces recoil and makes the rifle more controllable. Instead of adjusting for windage from the front sight like other similar rifles, the rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. Other features include a high visibility front sight post and a buttstock that is 1 inch longer, for better comfort and handling. The forend and handguard have Picatinny rails. 

These rails can be used to accessorize the Centurion 39 with red dot sights, scopes, lights, lasers and a fore grip. Twist rate: 1:10. Barrel length: 16.25” without muzzle break, Overall Length: 37.25”, Weight: 8.2 lbs. Comes with two (2) U.S. made 30 round mags."

I have a ONCE MOUNTED but UNFIRED complete set of Trijicon HD Hard Duty GL101Y Glock 3-Dot Iron Green Lamp night sights for sale that were manufactured in 2012. Front sight has a yellow outline that glows for easy on target acquirement. Fits Glock Models: 17, 17L, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, & 39.

The HD Night Sights were specifically created to address the needs of tactical shooters. The three dot green tritium night sight set’s front sight features a taller blade and an aiming point ringed in photoluminescent paint while the rear sight is outlined in black and features a wider U-shaped notch. This unique configuration increases visibility and quickens front sight acquisition—even in transitional lighting. 

Additionally, the front surface of the rear sight is steeply hooked to assist in emergency one-handed slide operation. The Hard Duty Night Sights are designed to shine—even in the most demanding conditions. Professional installation recommended. These retail for $154.00 plus tax brand new. Price is $125.00 cash OBO or Best Offer.

 I am willing to entertain offers and partial trades, but please keep in mind that it is an 8 shot, not a standard Mossberg 500.  I have had a couple of people try to tell me that they can buy a Mossberg ""for $200 all day long"".  I did research and did not find anything but 5 shot Mossbergs in that price range anywhere in the country.  Even if you can find one out of state, please keep in mind that the seller will charge shipping, then you'll have to pay your local FFL to run a NICS check on you and by the time you take the gun home, you've added nearly $100 to the price.  

My price is flexible, open to negotiation and I'm willing to do some trading that you just won't get elsewhere like partial or complete trades, depending on quantity:
.45acp ammo
.40 S&W ammo
#7 1/2 & #8 shot, chilled or Magnum, new or reclaimed
Lead ingots, Linotype, lead pipe, lead sheathing, etc
Red Dot Powder
Promo Powder
I will even knock money off the price for good info leading to the opportunity to purchase the aforementioned reloading powders at reasonable prices. (powder in 8lb kegs for less than $100 for Promo.  Less than $125 for Red Dot)
Lead is also hard to come by.  As such, information on places to buy scrap lead is also looked upon favorably when discussing price.

I will add cash toward

WTS -  my AKS-74SU in 5.45x39. Won't be able to own this gun here in NY for too much longer... plus the extra coin would come in handy. No sales where prohibited, FFL to FFL only. No FTF allowed here in NY anymore; King Andy is saving all of our children for us.

Gun runs really well... only had about 200rds through it.  It is stamped ""AKS 74 SU""... not sure why ""SU"" but there it is.  Built by Greg Wells from WellCo Arms in Ohio.  Gun was built to be 922r compliant and OK for NYS at the time.  I believe the gun has a short barrel but the extension being soldered on keeps it from being a SBR?  The stock sort of folds... It was modified so that it will come off when the button is pressed and folding is attempted.  All of the proper folding hardware and attachments are there, you would only need to purchase a new stock as the current one has been modified according to the photo below.  Rifle also has the optics attachment rail as pictured.  The magazines are all 30rd, 3 being German manufacture and I don't know where the other one is from but it is OD plastic.

Asking $1200/OBO - will try to answer any and all questions you may have. No trades unless they are too good to turn down.  Also listed on another forum classified section."

First is a Stag 16"" carbine. I assembled this for my wife to shoot. Ever since the arrival of our 3rd child though, she has put shooting to rest for a while. I have 3 other carbines with one of them being a Stag and pretty much identical to this one so it's time to move it on.

The upper is a factory built  M4 Stag upper with 5.56 16"" govt. profile barrel. It is chrome lined with 1/9 twist. It has a drop in quad rail with a railed gas block.
The lower is a factory ""blem"" Stag forged lower. While it is designated as such, I never saw any discerning marks or issues to qualify it as a ""blem"". It has a Barnes Precision Machine (BPM) LPK. It is wearing Magpul MOE grip and buttstock.
The upper was bought as new and unfired and I have put zero rounds through it. The lower also has exactly zero rounds on it as well.
Sights are Magpul MBUS
Rifle will come with one 30rd Pmag or 2 GI mags, buyers choice.
*I can also swap out the quad rail to a MOE if buyer would rather have that instead.

$800 cash or trade as is
$750 cash or trade without Magpul grip and buttstock (will include standard M4 stock and grip)
Will also take off $50 if you don't want the sights


Next up is a Armalite upper on a Barnes Precision Lower.

The upper consists of an Armalite M4 upper receiver with a 5.56 20"" stainless steel barrel, also Armalite. The barrel is 416R SS with a 1/8 twist. It has a Model 1 free float tube with a matching stainless railed gas block.
The lower is a BPM forged lower with BPM LPK. It has a standard grip and a full size ACE Skeleton buttstock
Upper has a couple hundred rounds and the lower has zero.
BUIS are MI HK style front and KRISS marked MI rear.
Rifle will come with one 30rd Pmag or 2 GI mags, buyers choice.
**And I'm sure someone will be nice enough to point out that my front sight is on backwards. I am aware of this and it is for a reason. When in the lowered position, it lays on the tube. Not wanting to mar the tube, I flipped it around in case I decided to take the tube off.

$1050 cash or trade
Will take off $80 if you don't want the sights


FTF in the RDU or Apex area or will ship on your dime. All laws followed. I would like to SEE valid ID and a CHP or purchase permit. Also be willing to sign a bill of sale

Company History:

In 2005, EOTech was acquired by L-3 Communications. L-3 Communications has grown very quickly into the sixth largest defense company in the United States and is a leader and prime defense contractor in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), secure communications, government services, training and simulation and aircraft modernization and maintenance. The company also is a leading merchant supplier of guidance and navigation products and systems, sensors, scanners, fuzes, data links, propulsion systems, avionics, electro optics, satellite communications, electrical power equipment, encryption products, signal intelligence, antennas and microwave products.L-3 EOTech designs, manufactures, and markets electro-optics products and systems. It uses advanced laser and holographic technology to enhance optical devices in target acquisition systems, recreational sport optics, and sighted automation environments. L-3 EOTech invented, designed, and manufactures the Holographic Weapon Sight (HWS) - the world's first holographic sighting system for small and medium-sized weapon platforms.In 1996, EOTech debuted its holographic sighting technology to be used in sport shooting and hunting applications to increase target accuracy and speed of target acquisition. The HWS uses patented technology to provide the user a parallax free sighting device that is nearly indestructible. The HWS removes some of the complexities from targeting and allows the aiming process to become almost instinctive and reflexive.After winning the ""Optic of the Year Award"" from the Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence, EOTech later introduced their military and law enforcement HWS in 2001. Since then, the HWS has been standardized by US Special Operations Command (SOCOM), FBI, DEA, State Department, US Border Patrol, Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), NYPD, LAPD, Texas State Police, and many international special operations forces, just to name a few.Since 2001, L-3 EOTech has seen sales grow over 600% and appears to be continuing along the same trend in 2007. With this incredible growth comes the need for larger capacity and production capability. To supplement this need, L-3 EOTech has recently moved to a newly renovated, independent, larger facility on the south side of Ann Arbor, MI located at 1201 E. Ellsworth Rd.L-3 EOTech is the exclusive manufacturer and world leader of holographic sighting systems for small arms, and is dedicated to continually producing high quality, battle tested products for our servicemen and women."

 - Brand New 150 lb draw Crossbow with Adjustable Sights

 - String

 - Cocking Device / Stringer for cocking bow

 - Detachable Quiver

 - 4) 16"" 2219 Aluminum Bolts / Arrows with half moon nocks that are tipped with standard threaded 125 gr Field Points. Naturally you can use whatever weight field point or broadhead you prefer.

 My 5 shot average velocity with this model bow is 213.04 fps. The weight of the arrow with field points is 425 gr and 300 grains without. Only about 30 ft lbs KE is needed to blow through both sides of the chest cavity of a deer. This bow will generate over 40 ft lbs, more than enough Kinetic Energy to successfully and humanely harvest game. To learn more go here: http://bowsite.com/bowsite/features/practical_bowhunter/penetration/

 I recommend heavily waxing the string and portion of the bow where the arrow rests. Do not dry fire the bow because it could damage the limbs. Bow will only cock if initially in ""fire"" position. You'll hear two clicks when it's fully cocked. It automatically reverts to ""safe"" at that point. In the field I use a 20 yd zero and adjust the point of aim (hold under or over) according to the distance from the target. The manufacturer states the max. effective range is 60 yds. Only shoot bolts into game or designated archery target.

 Real Killer Deal: Don't let the snobs make you buy a xbow that's too expensive; this one kills deer just as dead!
 Whether you're putting down the Walking Dead or putting meat on the table these crossbows are an excellent tool and an outstanding value. They work, and the proof is in the freezer!

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient.
The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock.

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire pistol. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers and a machined rail interface system."

Ruger- 
Classic Lines, Classic Feel, Modern Features. The Ruger® New Model Blackhawk® is the most advanced single-action revolver ever made. While retaining the solid frame, feel and comfortable grip of the classic single-actions, they feature Ruger’s patented transfer bar ignition system with loading gate interlock, an all-coil spring mechanism, adjustable sights, and frame-mounted firing pin. New Model Blackhawk revolvers have earned a reputation as the best value on the market due to their durability and affordability. 

Convertible models come equipped with an extra cylinder and are popular with shooters who appreciate the classic single-action revolver but opt for the versatility of being able to use more than one caliber in their handgun. With its interchangeable cylinder, Convertible models can be easily converted from one caliber to another without the use of tools. This versatility allows avid shooters of autoloading pistols to enjoy shooting a classic American single-action sidearm with their favorite pistol cartridge."

If you know what it is you're interested. If you don't and you want an AK be sure to read below. These don't come available very often. It is in like new condition. 

I am selling an as new Bulgarian made Arsenal SLR-101S AK rifle, caliber 7.62x39mm. The SLR101 is made in Bulgaria and imported as a complete rifle. This means both the receiver and barrel are original Arsenal BG milspec. Rifle comes with 1 Bulgarian made 40rd magazine. The original Soviet Russian AK47 utilized a milled receiver from the late 1940s until the adoption of the less expensive and lighter AKM in 1959. Most other Warsaw Pact nations followed suit and switched from the milled AK47 to the stamped AKM. While Arsenal in Bulgaria did manufacture stamped rifles starting in the 1960s, it never abandoned the milled design and continued to update and modernize it. The Bulgarian military has been using these weapons for decades, in various configurations.
Back in 2001, Arsenal Inc. of NV in the USA imported a milled rifle from Arsenal of Bulgaria called the SLR101. This rifle had an original Bulgarian made milled receiver, as well as an original Bulgarian barrel. This line was discontinued 10 years ago and only in 2012 has Arsenal once again imported a batch of SLR101s. Arsenal has done the SA M7 line with a milled receiver, but with one key difference; the SA M series used a US made milled receiver and other US parts. The SLR101 is wholly made in Bulgaria and is imported into the US as a complete weapon. It is brought in without a bayonet lug and with a thumbhole stock, to get around import restrictions. Once in the country, Arsenal Inc. installs a proper butt stock, pistol grip, and muzzle brake. They also insure the rifle is capable of accepting any standard AK double stack, high capacity magazines. All parts are Bulgarian made, except for the required 922(r) ones. These parts are made in the USA by Arsenal, but to original Bulgarian specifications and include: the furniture set, trigger group, and muzzle brake.
Comparing the 2012 SLR101-13 to the 2001 SLR101s, the same manufacturing quality and fit and finish can be found. Since the 2001 rifles were sold during the 1994 Clinton AWB, they were not allowed to have either the removable muzzle device, threaded barrel, or bayonet lug. These modern SLR101 rifles though have all of these features as the AWB sunset in 2004.
This rifle features: original Arsenal of Bulgaria AK47 style milled receiver, original 16"" long Cold Hammer Forged barrel with a chrome lined bore, standard 14mm threads on the end of the barrel, side-mount on the receiver for optics, a smooth double hook trigger, intermediate length polymer butt stock, milspec polymer hand guards with steel heat shield, standard military pistol grip, and the ability to accept any standard AK47/AKM magazines and drums. These milled Arsenals are known for their reliability and trouble-free service; but if it does have any problems, it is fully covered under Arsenal's warranty. It has been a decade since any milled receiver rifles have come in from Bulgaria and I don't think I am out of line in saying they are some of the finest AK pattern rifles ever produced. All moving parts work smoothly; the rifle is very accurate, durable, and great looking. 
Asking $1,200 O.B.O. Need to sell but won't just give it away, so no low ballers please. 
Pictures can be send by request. 
Thanks for looking and God Bless."

I used this scope on My AR-10 (308 version of the AR-15) with my 20 inch stainless bull barrel. I normally shot out to 1000 yards in competition with this rifle and always did very well. The scope was mounted on the scope for 8 years and stored in my climate controlled safe room (yea I have an entire vaulted room that stores my firearms – there are a lot of them) The room is kept at 15% humidity and 70 degrees at all times, which is perfect for gun storage. The gun was and scope were never in the rain, and both were cleaned and put away promptly after each use. This scope has never seen hunting nor has it ever been exposed to any harsh elements. It has never been dropped and it has only been mounted and dismounted one time each. The rings are extremely heavy duty Millett (came with the scope) 30MM and they were matched and mounted at the Millett factory. They are designed to fit any picatinny rail or standard dove tail base or picatinny rail. The scope when brand new was $469.00 8 years ago. There is no damage nor is there any fungus or scratches. You will be very impressed when you see the scope. It is best suited for long range or “sniper” type rifles but will be great on anything such as a .223 or 22-250 varmint rifle (which is what I was going to put it on). The scope comes with flip up lens protectors (aftermarket) You can call with any questions… leave a message and I will get back to you. I am currently selling a lot of gun related stuff as I am moving overseas and can’t take it all with me. I will return your call with a short period if you do not get me directly. I am asking $200.00. REDACTED David"
