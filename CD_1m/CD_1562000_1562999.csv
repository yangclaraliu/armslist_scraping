No dings or scratches, probably one of the better examples of a Gen 3 Smith you will find. Shoots well, I have put 300 rounds through it without any type of failure.

I changed out the bobbed hammer for a spured one from a 5906, the original will be included if you want to change back (take about 15 mins). Sporting Hogue wrap around grips, the originals are in prefect shape and will be included as well. I have a De Santis scabbard style holster that came with it when I bought it, it appears unused. It came in an old S&W 3913 box not numbered to the gun. I also have 4 extra S&W factory mags all with pinky extensions.

I am mostly intersted in trading for a Beretta 9mm PX4 Sub-Compact in like new condition with a like number of magazines and or extras.

I would ask $500.00 for the gun in the box with 1 magazine, the extra grips, hammer and holster. If you want the whole package I will include the 4 extra mags for an additional $25.00 each.

I already have a cash offer for the gun. The prospective buyer was nice enough to let me leave this posted for a while to see if I could find a trade. I will continue to note cash offers but be aware that there is already someone ahead of you.

I will sell any extra magazines for $25.00 each after the gun has been sold.

I would like to keep this FTF in South Florida between WPB Gander Mt and Dania Beach Bass Pro. No shipping at this time.

Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability.

Comes with a mounted scope (a pretty decent one for a cheap scope), a 10 round mag, and I'll include a 325 round brick of Federal .22lr to get you started. This is a really nice gun for the money, and I'd love to keep it, but I just bought an RCBS rockchucker setup that I now need to finance by selling a gun...

autoloaders. The Model PT145 features a 10 round magazine capacity for 10+1
firepower, but the most central feature of the gun is its rugged recoil
operated action instead of the simple blowback mechanisms found on many
other pocket size pistols.

The Vz.82 pistol is a standard sidearm of the Czech army since 1982. Vz.82 was manufactured from 1983 to 1992, when it was merged with similar commercial design CZ-83 (originally offered in 7.65 Browning and 9mm Browning Short). Since 1992 and until now, only CZ-83 is manufactured in all three chamberings, to save the costs. Vz.82 was developed to replace the obsolete 7.62mm Vz.52 pistols then in service with Czechoslovak army. During early 1980s Czechoslovak army, under pressure from USSR, replaced the older 7.62x25mm ammunition with Soviet 9x18mm Makarov ammunition, which also required a new pistol. Instead of simply taking the Soviet design (Makarov PM) along with its cartridge, Czechs developed their own pistol, which, in some respects, is superior to the ""gun of the big brother"" (Makarov PM). They also produced their own 9x18 ammunition as ""pistolovy naboj Vz.82"", which they claimed to be 20% more powerful than standard Soviet 9x18 PM ammunition. The Vz.82 pistol, developed at the CZ factory in Uhersky Brod, has greater magazine capacity (12 rounds vs. 8), better fit and finish, and much better ergonomics. On the other hands, Vz.82 is more complicated and, thus, is more expensive to make. Still, it is an excellent and reliable pistol, one of the best defensive pistols on the market today. It is somewhat heavy by modern standards, but the all-steel construction makes it almost indestructible, and additional weigh helps to control pistol in rapid fire.
Seeing the commercial potential of this pistol, Czechs brought it to the international market under the designation of CZ-83. It is now available in its original chambering, 9x18mm Makarov, as well as in 9x17mm Browning Short (.380ACP) and 7.65x17mm Browning (.32ACP).
The CZ-83 is a blowback-operated pistol with fixed barrel. Return spring is located around the barrel. Double action trigger with exposed hammer has a very smooth pull in both SA and DA modes. Ambidextrous frame-mounted safety locks the slide and sear when engaged, allowing for ""cocked and locked"" carry. Frame and slide are made of high grade steel. Magazine capacity is 12 rounds, sights are of fixed type and dovetailed into the slide.

The 42 grain lead round nose bullet is heavier than traditionally available rounds, but isn't so heavy as to cause instability. A designed velocity of 1020 feet per second ensures the heavier projectile remains subsonic speed in most all firearms without resorting to anemic velocities.""

This rifle was just purchased this year and has not even seen 100 rounds through it yet. The rifle has the accu stock, A life saver! As well as the accu trigger for complete adjustability. It has a composite stock and is very light. It has a two piece rail set up with an incredible Leupold VX-II with advanced optics. This scope is scary clear, everyone who has had the opportunity to use my gun has been astounded at the quality. Right out of the box this rifle was dead on. After only doing slight MOA adjustments I can overlap shots at a 100 yards all day. It also has a Champion bi-pod, which can tilt left and right. The bi-pod also adjusts from 6 to 9 inches and folds up for convenience. I will also toss in the BlackHawk case that I have as well as some 150 and 165 grain bullets.

The Nagant M1895 Revolver is a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver).[

1) Glock 30sf, Gen 3 with 2 10 round mags (1 with the pierce grip) and a flush fitting 9 round mag that makes it just a bit larger than baby glocks (no longer made by Glock; makes the gun very easy to conceal). Only 200 rounds of Remington white box through it (two range trips, 100 each) and 5 rounds of Horniday Critical Defense. Literally zero inside wear, some outside minor finish wear from kydex carry holder. This glock also comes with the Kydex holster mentioned (DeadEyeLuke). Also has Talon Grips.

I am looking for 500OBO for this glock; I am not really interested in many trades I need the money to use towards other projects. I am in the Harrisburg area and will travel (within 30 or so min) to meet and sell/trade. I WILL NOT SHIP! Face to face only please. I am in no real rush to sell this so please don’t give very lowball offers…they can continue to sit in my safe, I’m in no rush! I consider these very fair prices for these guns; and I am willing to negotiate within reason.

Trades I will consider: 1911s (Springfield, Colt, etc) Yes I can add cash. ONLY 9mm or 45ACP please, I am vested in these calibers. Although, I may be interested in a S&W 686+…

Please text REDACTED for fast response; I have pictures on my phone I can send.
