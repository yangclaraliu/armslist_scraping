makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

CFE 223 INFO
The technology developed for the U.S. Military that greatly deters copper fouling is now available in CFE 223 for your reloads!

Introduced in January 2012, this versatile spherical rifle propellant incorporates in its formula CFE, Copper Fouling Eraser. This ingredient, originally used in military propellant, greatly deters copper fouling. It contributes to longer periods of top accuracy with less barrel cleaning time. Being a spherical powder, metering is superbly accurate. CFE 223 yields top velocities in many cartridges such as the 204 Ruger, 223 Remington/5.56mm NATO, 22-250 Remington and the 308 Winchester/7.62mm NATO, plus many, many more. Match, Varmint and AR shooters will love this one!

I am selling this because I no longer need it and this would work wonderfully for a prepper/survivalist or out of state hunter where it is allowed to use crossbow. I have upgraded this thing where the effective range with the scope went from 30 yards to 65 yards. The price is set at $550 and it is a firm price for everything you get. The crossbow also has a lifetime warranty on it. I have shot maybe 10 times total just to check the upgraded parts efficiency and to sight the BDC scope. Here is what you get:

4 carbon arrows
6 aluminum arrows
3 broad heads

Dissipator bars

I do NOT limit how much you can buy!!!  As everyone knows this ammo is almost impossible to find and when you do, the store usually limits you to 1 box.  Now is your chance to get as much ammo as you want!  Remember there is no sales tax or shipping charges on top of the prices above.

I live in the far west suburbs of Chicago in a town called Geneva, but am willing to meet up with buyers. Will not ship ammo and buyer will need a FOID card to buy ammo. Cash at time of transaction!

I'm selling off some of my stored ammo so I can buy a shotgun. Please look at my other listings to see if you want to bundle anything together.

When contacting me please let me know exactly what ammo you want in what quantity. Let me know you are willing to pay and have a FOID card so I can set the ammo aside for you while we discuss where and when to meet up. Please give some suggestions on where and when to meet, you know where I live, but I don't know where you live till you tell me. I prefer to meet during the days if at all possible.
