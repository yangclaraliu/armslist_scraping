Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM barrels are made right here in the USA! (Just like all the BCM products.)

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today's infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its' superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its' additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960's was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

This particular piece served with the Springfield Massachusetts Police Department, so it helped provide security for the Smith & Wesson factory itself. The Springfield Home Boys and Girls on the PD liked the SW99QA’s unique sear system that allows a short, Quick-Action trigger pull that gauges in the 10 pound neighborhood. Frame assembly, manufactured by Walther, is high impact polymer with sure-gripping serrations and textured contours. Frame has integral Picatinny / Weaver slots for light accessory use. Sights are readily visible three-dot, low profile Night Sights with windage adjustable rear. Slide is black stainless with XSE type serrations fore and aft. Mechanism is locked breech type with internal firing pin block to guard against accidental discharge if the weapon is dropped. Manufactured by Smith & Wesson, the stainless barrel is 4 inch Service Size; extreme overall length is 7 inches; maximum height is 5 1/2 inches; maximum thickness is 1.15 inches at the disassembly bar, but the grip part of the frame is only 1 inch thick. Note that the mainspring housings / backstrap parts can be easily replaced to allow shooters to adjust the contour of the grip frame. This is an amazingly good feeling, well balanced .40 S&W pistol. It is furnished with two original Law Enforcement issue blue steel bodied 12 shot magazines.

It all depends on which PPK you are looking for. Over the years, they have been manufactured by several firms under the Walther name. I'll break it down for you.

Originally, the Walther PPK was used before WWII as a police pistol. In fact, the name PPK stands for Polizeipistole Kriminalmodell, or police pistol detective's model. They were manufactured during the war and used by German officers, pilots, and high-ranking party officials. In fact, Hitler had a PPK and it was with this pistol that he shot himself. After the war, the town where the pistols were made was overrun by the Russians so what was left was packed up and moved to the beautiful city of Ulm, where they were made up until the late 1960's or early 1970's. Those are the original PPK's. Another version of the PPK is the PPK/S, which is essentially the same pistol except the grip is a bit wider and the magazine has room for one more round. The original German-made Walther PPK line of pistols are considered to be the finest examples of the model, and can be worth anything from $550 to $1500 or more depending on age, condition, and the availability of them in the market.

During the late 1970's and all the way into the early 1990's, a company called Interarms began to manufacture the PPK here in the United Stated under the original Walther patent. They were actually made (sub-contracted) by a company called Ranger Armaments in Georgia, who built the pistol under the meticulous German specifications, some out of blued steel and many others out of beautiful brushed stainless steel. These Interarms PPK's are every bit the equal of the German-made ones as Interarms closely inspected, test-fired, and overpressure tested the pistols before they went to dealers. These wonderful pistols can range anywhere from $450 to $950 and up, again depending on the condition, model, and local availability. Get one of these if you can.

In the late 1990's, the founder of Interarms died and so too did his wonderful company. The manufacturing rights went to Smith & Wesson, who currently produces the pistol. However, this is where the ""good times"" come to an end. In their ""wisdom"", Smith & Wesson changed the original design by adding an extended rear tang in a failed attempt to eliminate ""slide bite"", and altered the inner workings somewhat as well. There have been major recalls, safety failings (flipping the safety off could cause the gun to fire!) and other quality issues. In fact, many of the ones sent in for recall work have been returned to their owners many months later in worse shape! One of the ""fixes"" they do to the recalled PPK's is to grind out the chamber area with a Dremel! And yet, many Smith & Wesson PPK owners report fantastic pistols that never fail. Basically you've got a 50/50 shot with a Smith & Wesson PPK. You've either got a decent pistol (albeit an altered handgun far from the original design) or you've got a paperweight. I don't know the running value of these models because I will not look twice at one in the gun store. They're not ""real"" PPK's.

Go with either an original Walther or the Interarms model. They're both fantastic, comfortable, and more accurate than I am. This is a ""tack driver"" of a pistol and it will not fail you. They're beautiful, too.

I cannot recommend the Smith & Wesson copy. You can easily identify this model at once from the original design. The serial number is crudely burnt into the frame with a laser and it looks like there's a big duck-bill sticking out from under the hammer. Basically, if the words, ""Smith & Wesson"" is on the PPK or PPK/S, put it back on the shelf.

The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms*. The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar. The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed.

The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.

People have been asking for a cash price. I prefer to trade, it seems more fair. But here is the breakdown
MSRP 400.
Quad rail 115 plus shipping each way to KT.
Stock extender piece 30 plus shipping.
Carry case 20.
So with all the extras, tax and shipping costs I probably have close to $600 in it.

I have an 89 ford bronco that has been taking up space in my driveway for way too long, meant to use it to teach my little brother how to fix up a car but never got around to it

Tank has been pulled and is sitting in the back seat, I think before it was left to sit the truck had fuel pump issues and thats why the tank was pulled and such, I dont have much to tell you about it. The bumper is messed up and it has a dent on the side but no frame damage or anything happened to the bronco

Due to tremendous demand, High-Capacity Magazine orders will be delayed. 

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

The following text is taken straight from the CZ USA website:
http://www.cz-usa.com/products/view/dan-wesson-eco/

There has never been a higher demand for self defense handguns than there is today. The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you can’t hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well. We wanted to give our customers the smallest, lightest gun that we could without sacrificing accuracy, dependability and stopping power.

Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.

The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern.

If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed."

When I say VERY RARE, I mean Ruger doesn't even make this model as I am aware.

This sixgun is a stainless steel New Vaquero model in 45 colt that has never had a live round fired through it (only blanks!). It comes with everything as new (plastic box, paperwork, fired shell casing etc.).

The original Vaquero was refitted with a stainless steel Bisley grip frame and trigger. The Hammer in and of itself is Rare as it is the Montado Hammer which was designed specifically for mounted shooting.
The Bisley trigger has been lightened and the Laminate Rosewood grips have been hand stained and sealed. This truly is a RARE piece and you will not find another one like it!
The 4 5/8 in. barrel is the perfect length for SUPERB balance Especially in the NEW MODEL VAQUERO!

Eastern Arms was one of the Sears-Roebuck brands.  The damaged grip panels bear the Meridan Arms monogram.  Workmanship reflects the style of the times, particularly the ornately shaped front sight and the hand engraved top release buttons.  Although not marked as to caliber, the gun accepted and fired .38 S&W cartridges.  Based on that experience, shooting this thing is a marginally safe novelty requiring eye protection and a glove.  No rust.  Insignificant pitting.  This is a mechanically sound, functional collector's piece.  

From dealer's personal collection.  Will transfer to Montana resident or ship to FFL, adding $15 for postage and insurance.  Certified check or money order accepted.  No trades.  Price is firm."

The functionality of the enhanced side ballistic inserts, which provide coverage under the arms and down the sides of the torso, is built-in to the IOTV.
---The IOTV provides the ability to don the vest in two ways. The first is to simply place the vest over the head and pull down, and the second is to remove fasteners on the wearer's left shoulder, sliding into the vest to the right. To complete the procedure for both methods the wearer then lifts up the front panel of the vest and fastens the waistband, which takes the weight of the vest off the shoulders somewhat, and then fastens the side protection modules.
---A key design feature for the IOTV is that the entire armor system is able to be released with the pull of a hidden lanyard. The armor then falls apart into its component pieces, providing a means for escape in case the wearer falls into water or becomes trapped in a hazardous environment. The hidden release lanyard also allows medical personnel easier access to the casualty, which was one concern that was not addressed with the old Interceptor armor.
---It also features a grid of PALS webbing on the front, back, and sides for the attachment of modular pouches and accessories.

^*^*^*^*^ Features ^*^*^*^*^
The IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear plates (SAPI NIJ standard III), however, the new E-SAPI plates will increase protection to armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified. This is a huge improvement over the PASGT vest, and the Vietnam era fragmentation vest (which was made of nylon). Both only offered protection against fragmentation."

This is an awesome caliber and this setup is lethal. I originally bought two and have shot my other one exclusively and I am tired of seeing this one in the gun safe so I am going to let it go to someone who will use it. It has a free float heavy barrel. It comes with 3 30 round mags. This gun is BRAND NEW and has NEVER been shot. I have an identical one to this one that I have 250 to 300 rounds through it and these things shoot awesome. You can convert these from shooting the 300 blackout/whisper bullets to be able to shoot .223 bullet by simply changing the barrel. The receiver is already set up for the .223 bullets since the 300 blackout/whisper has the .223 casing. I have a buddy who changes his barrel to the 300 for deer and .223 for coyote hunting. It is a single gun that does it all. I will ship to your FFL for $40 Contact me through this site or call me at three19-360-2286.  Thanks.

Slightly used but in box with soft case. Mint condition. I'm the original owner; ordered it a few years ago to eradicate a few starlings, but they disappeared prior receiving the rifle. It sat new in box until last month. I installed the scope and have put about 100 pellets thru it. Nothing wrong with it, still needs sighting-in. Shoots 1000 fps with lead, and up to 1250 fps with PBA ammo. It actually breaks the sound barrier on PBA ammo. The scope is a Center Point designed for spring air rifles, and has an illuminated Red/Green MIL DOT reticle. Also comes with owner's manual, .177 pellets, bright tactical light, bi-pod, and red dot laser. If interested, send me a reply with your phone number so that I can contact you.
