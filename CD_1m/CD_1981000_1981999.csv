To the right, Lee and Jackson are shown on horseback in ""...They Were Soldiers Indeed.""   To the far left is one of Künstler's earliest Civil War paintings titled, ""War Between the States,"" as a Union soldier drinks from his canteen.  The Künstler images are framed by a 24-karat gold decorated background with elegant scrollwork.  Craftsmen commissioned specifically for this Tribute by America Remembers capture Mr. Künstler's original artwork in minute detail, with a nickel background serving as the canvas for the artwork.

For many, this historic moment represents a turning point for the Confederate forces.

LWRCI REPR with 20 inch barrel in the box with a 20 round PMAG, which came with it, plus box and instruction manual. 

The LWRCI REPR is noted for having the best gas piston system available on the market, worldwide.  It has long range capability with superb ""tested"" accuracy according to the detailed rifle report in Shotgun News where the shooter/tester got 0.3 MOA using Hornady Match ammo and a Nightforce 5.5-22x56mm scope.   You can't get much better than that. 0.3 MOA is about the size of your pinky fingernail. Putting 5 shots in a group like that is precision indeed, hence what REPR stands for: Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle. 

The rifle is also of the highest quality billet construction, and it comes standard with a fully adjustable 2 Stage Gesseille National Match Trigger to suit your needs, and has the infamous Left Side Charging handle that is non-reciprocating: that means when the bolt opens the charging handle stays put, so there is no way it can come back and slam your hand/break your finger such as the SCAR does. Also featured is the Magpul PRS fully adjustable buttstock for comb height and length of pull. Notice in the pictures of the rifle below that I have it extended back some. There is room for more adjustment if you desire. Mount it and see.  It's a great feature to have because you can  hand adjust the length of pull according to how much clothing you have one. For example, in cold weather you will be wearing more clothing so you can shorten the length of pull in seconds to fit you perfectly. In warm weather you would adjust it out to a longer length of pull because you might be wearing just a thin Tshirt.  

The rifle comes with the highest quality back up iron sights, which are made by LWRCI.  LWRCI's are known for their reliability and feeding/ejecting without jamming in very bad conditions, such as dunking the rifle in water (UTube this) then shooting a full clip, again and again. This is  a top tier quality tactical rifle in all regards and has the accuracy to get to you 1,000 yds and beyond. And you'll get the velocity with the 20 inch barrel. 
I bought the rifle about 5 months ago, and am moving so I am looking to sell."

I made this one completely perfect. 2012 version with the extended beavertail. I replaced the stiff factory 20 lb spring with a Precision Gunsprings 15 lb reduced power hammer spring to smooth out trigger pull, a wolf 15 lb variable recoil spring that greatly reduces felt recoil, a Bedair stainless steel guide rod to replace the factory plastic one. It adds center balance weight, and helps reduce lift, Hogue Extreme hex screws, Hogue finger grooved rubber grips, and Meprolight Tritium Night Sights. They are larger than the factory sights, and are awesome in daylight or low light situations. Comes with the CZ case and owner's manual, two sixteen round clips, and a Pro Tech Italian leather holster. I have put around 500 high quality rounds through it with no issues. This is best feeling, and best shooting pistol I have ever owned. Dead accurate and 100% reliable. CIA agents carry these. The CZ75B is the most widely carried sidearm by military and law enforcement in the world. It has been called the world's perfect pistol. Do some research. These are getting very difficult to find. CZ has stopped exporting from the Czech Republic to the U.S. to meet government and military contracts. No trades. Firm on price. I have almost $1100.00 invested. All factory parts go with the gun.

I have owned this rifle for a few years and it is in excellent operating condition. I've done the math and stopped at $1600.00, so there is much more than that wrapped up in this rifle and accessories. 

I'm wanting to go a different direction with an AR build and need to fund that project so my loss is your gain. This literally *everything* you need to out to the range and have some fun.

Don't ask my bottom dollar because that it is it. I'm not trying to make a profit off of this rifle since I bought *before* all of the craziness and am not selling at panic prices. I'm not desperate for money either so if I get to spend some more trigger time with her my feelings aren't hurt.

Please note that there are some blemishes on this gun which is why I am letting go at this price.  There were a few surface rust spots that I had to remove. These blemishes include the bluing on the top of the receiver, some of which was from from the importer and some added by hitting the rust spot with steel wool. (see pic).  There was also a spot of rust on the top of the bolt which was removed (this is also visible on the gun).  The sides and internal workings of the bolt and receiver of the gun do NOT have any rust.

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

Red-X Arms A3 upper is built from 7075-T6 Aluminum Forgings and hardcoated black anodizing with teflon coating.

Rainier Arms barrel is 14.5"" made of 416R Stainless with a matte stainless finish, has a 1:8 twist and M4 feed ramps and hole drilled for a carbine gas system.

Rainier Arms XTC compensator is 2.2 inches and is designed to reduce felt recoil and muzzle rise with a relatively low muzzle flash. As previously stated, has been permanently attached to bring the barrel length up to the legal 16"" minimum.

Rainier Arms low profile gas block was made .005 bigger to have a better fit on match grade barrels.

Gas tube is a gas tube, what more do you want? Carbine length.

UTG Handguard is a mid-length to cover the gas block. Constructed with solid aircraft grade aluminum, has four standard picatinny rails with 20 slots.

New Frontier Armory is a polymer lower. I liked the polymer lower that I'm keeping so much that I purchased another one for this to build and sell as a rifle. Bought as a stripped lower and installed the parts kit. Both are brand new, never fired.

UTG Carbine commericial buffer tube has 4 position adjustable stock, includes buffer and spring.

DSA ZM4 bolt was finally received after a 6 1/2 month wait. Got it today, and it is brand new, never fired.

I put this together at the beginning of the year just to have something to plink around with and decided to go another route with my build. It is a 14.5"" barrel with the XTC compensator blind pinned (work done by L&R Armory) to bring the overall length above the legal 16"". I've shot probably 500 rounds through the barrel and it shoots really well. I had this posted just as an upper before, but thought I would have a better chance if it was a full rifle. Purchased a stripped lower, LPK and got a bolt in, which are all brand new. Just add sights and you're ready to go! Please contact me for more pictures or any questions/offers. CWP preferred. Will also ship to your FFL. Thanks!"

Beretta Nano 9mm

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

Features:
The slide and barrel are finished with black nitride, while the internal chassis is stainless steel and major springs are zinc plated.
Like most Beretta pistols, the Nano has a reversible magazine release button. All you need is a small punch and you can easy change it for right or left-handed use.
The Nano’s 3-dot low profile sights are extremely user friendly. All you need is a 1.3 mm hex wrench and you can adjust, remove, and replace the Nano’s sights in seconds.
The stainless steel chassis of the Nano is the part that carries the serial number. The technopolymer grip frame can be easily removed for cleaning or to be replaced by a different grip frame.
Easy to clean, easy to use. All you need to do is press the Striker Deactivator, turn the Disassembly Cam ¼ turn counterclockwise, and the slide pops right off. The recoil spring is captured so it won’t fly away.
The Nano primary mission is concealed carry. It’s smooth, snag free profile makes it easy to holster, easy to carry and easy to draw. No awkward levers or switches to get caught or hung up on.
Designed for the rigors of concealed carry, the Nano's magazine and follower are constructed entirely of polished stainless steel. The polymer floorplate completely covers the bottom of the Nano's gripframe to reduce the introduction of foreign contaminants and create a uniform grip.
Don’t like pulling the trigger to disassemble your handgun? Neither do we. Simply press the Striker Deactivator with a small punch or ball point pen and you can safely deactivate the striker system. It works a lot like the decocker on our military’s M9 pistol.

This was one of H&R's ""economy models"", so the cylinder does not swing out, instead reloading and changing of cylinders is accomplished by sliding the cylinder pin forward out of the frame and fully removing the cylinder - so not very quick to reload.  I do not have pictures available at the moment but will attempt to if I get time this weekend, but mine is in fair condition, includes both cylinders and a camouflage belt holster.  The cylinders feel looser than normal which was concerning for me when I originally purchased it a couple years ago, but it has proven to be a none issue for me, this little revolver is surprisingly accurate."

In sub-zero temperatures or searing desert heat (-50 degrees to +130 degrees Fahrenheit, and altitudes of 30,000 feet to depths of 15 feet in salt water) the waterproof, shockproof, fogproof SS performs. Whatever the weapon, from .223 to .50 BMG, the SS handles the recoil. Whatever the target, the SS gives you the best advantage. Made of lightweight aluminum but strong as steel, it has superior multicoated optics for maximum light transmission. Built to NATO specs.
