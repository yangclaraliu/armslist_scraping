If an offer is made this evening and we complete transaction by Tuesday, I will include 100 rounds of brass ammo and Hardcase.  THERE IS A HUGE AMMO SHORTAGE.  I will also include a Magpul MOE Rifle length handguard and forgrip (60.00).  You will need to purchase Delta ring, Snap ring, Weld spring and Handguard cap (approx $25.00) to install.  It would look nice on this.

I have not fired it because I just bought it, but the previous owner said he recently put 30rds thru it without a single issue. 

Round count is unknown.

Has some wear at the front end and on the levers. Serial number ends with ""Z"".

This gun will come with the blue plastic Beretta case and two 15 round mags.

The other is an unknown aftermarket mag.

Alexander Arms® is the originator of the large-caliber, .50 Beowulf®, AR-15 style weapon concept. As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. We have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead. The .50 Beowulf® was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf® to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results. Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf® has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf® cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf® can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry. The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf® rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal."

I can include (for free) weaver bases and one-inch rings. I will include (for free) a Simmons ProSport 4-12X - 40mm scope w/ duplex-reticle.  I'll also include a NIB Winchester-brand Limbsaver Recoil-Pad (Highly recommended).

The scope is NOT mounted.  Most folks prefer mount/sight-in to their personal specs.

TECHNICAL DETAILS ON THIS BOLT-ACTION:
 1992 to 2006 Winchester Model 70
 Starting in 1992, Winchester re-introduced many features of the pre-'64 rifles. The Post-'92 Model 70 is an extensive rifle line that boasts nearly all of the features of the original line, but with some updated equipment, such as the Controlled Round action and synthetic stocks. Popular variants feature black resin stocks, which hold up better than wood stocks over time. 

BALLISTICS DATA:
 Many ballistics scholars consider the 7mm Rem-Mag ""the Most Ballistically Efficient Round"" with flattest trajectory available under a .338 Lapua or heavier.
 This rifle will send a 175-grain Rem. PSP Core-Lokt out the barrel at 2,860 feet/per-second with a muzzle energy of 3,178 foot-pounds.  Easily a 1,000 meter++ rifle.

Selling as my interests have shifted to competition pistols."

This gun has a 3"" chamber, so it will take just about every size of 12ga shell made (except the 3-1/2""s, but who even has those?!)

I have only fired it about 100 times since bought new, so the bore is still shiny like a mirror.  The most fun thing about this gun is using the ejector to fling the empty shells at your friends when they criticise your shooting skills.  They can fly about 10 feet, so be careful.  Haha.

No scratches, no dings, no rust.  Basically a bran-new gun.  I am selling so I can upgrade to a pump-action."

read up.


there is no reason to buy ammo from joe asshole of the streets now. If your buying ammo from joe dirt on the streets YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH. 

same thing with AR-15 or modern sporting rifles and stop paying stupid ass money for them. The ban is not coming anytime soon in Minnesota. just universal background checks. Sure there might be some day that congress might try and push something through, but you probably have months or years before that happens. the stupid bastards can't agree on anything anyways. 

Samething goes for high capacity magazines. 

so take your time, be patient, and stop feeding thes jackles your hard earned money. Reeds sporting goods, fleet farm, sheels, gander mountain, dunhams have plenty of ammo in stock and have plenty of Modern Sporting rifles showing up weekly. just be patient."

649,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1100649,For Sale/Trade:  Surefire U60A Incandescent Lamp Module with  FM63 Infrared Filter,"Ft. Benning, Columbus, GA, Georgia",$ 50,"Listed On: Monday, April 1, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Looking to sell or trade Surefire U60A Incandescent Lamp Module with FM63 Infrared Filter for 1.47"" Diameter Bezels worth $188 retail! The 1st photograph is with it attached to my Scoutlight just to show it works (The light it's self is not for sale)

The LU60A is an incandescent lamp module for the SureFire Scout Light®. It is interchangeable with this WeaponLight's KX2C LED head, allowing the Scout Light, when also outfitted with a SureFire FM63 infrared filter, to be used in stealth operations involving night vision devices (NVDs).Constructed of hard-anodized aerospace-grade aluminum, a tempered Pyrex® window, and O-ring sealed to keep out moisture, dust, and dirt, the LU60A is built to endure the elements and withstand the rigors of combat. Its shock-isolated P60 xenon incandescent lamp assembly and precision reflector create a smooth, 65-lumen, tactical-level beam with extended reach for longer-range applications yet enough surround beam for close-quarter work. Attaches to the Scout Light in seconds; simply unscrew the LED head and screw on the LU60A. 

The FM63 is an infrared (IR) filter for flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.47"" diameter bezel. Cancels out the non-infrared portion of the light spectrum to produce a smooth beam of infrared light for use with night vision devices and infrared-capable video cameras. For military or law enforcement infrared applications, SureFire also recommends the M1 Illuminator, as its dedicated infrared design may be more appropriate for mission critical tasking. Applying thumb pressure to the locking tab releases the cover; a spring mechanism keeps the open cover out of the way by holding it flat against the flashlight. A cam-locking lever keeps the entire unit securely attached to the flashlight."

Takes any AR style magazine, and this gun also includes the top of the line eotech sight, metal front grip with a bright led light built into it, and a powerful green laser that can be seen during the day as well as night.

Brand New Mossberg 500 Tactical Persuader. I bought it, upgraded a few parts and it has just been sitting for a couple months. Just decided to go a different direction.

Parkerized/Matte Finish. These are listed as an 7+1 gun, but I reworked the spring just a bit and made it fit 8 in the tube. So, that means 8+1. Have not seen another one that will hold 8+1. Internals have been polished up a bit and seem to engage smoother and function flawlessly.

Has a Gen2 Blackhawk/Knoxx Adjustable Stock and Forend, Meprolight MH3 Night Sight Bead, and a set of Weaver mounts to mount a red-dot. Includes original stock and revised pistol grip.

I have about $550 in this shotgun, so I'm looking to get most of it back. I bought it BRAND NEW and it has been fired ONE TIME to test functionality after custom work. I have racked about 100 rounds through it with NO hiccups.

Price: $500 or best REASONABLE offer."
