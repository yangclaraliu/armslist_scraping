They are only sporadically made and are often totally unobtainable.
The box was fairly typical of Tanaka's other revolvers, except that the background to the photographic artwork on the lid was bright red, rather than the usual dark background.

The silver finish on this gun is nothing like the stainless finish on the S&W 629s, being a bright, highly polished chrome finish....The weight and balance of the gun is good and there is nothing visible on the gun that one could describe as a fault or blemish.
The hammer cocks to two positions, half cock to permit rotation of the cylinder for loading and full cock, for firing. Of course, being a Single Action revolver, the SAA needs manually cocking before each shot, like a springer. This is achieved simply by pulling back the hammer.

On the barrel's left side is the legend ""COLT SINGLE ACTION ARMY .45"", with ""COLT'S PTFA MFG. CO. HARTFORD CT. U.S.A."" on the top of the barrel. There are a couple of small proofing marks on the left side of the trigger guard.
There are Colt logos on the grips in the form of a rampant horse in an oval raised section and there's a small Colt horse logo next to the patent marks. If you turn the gun upside down, you will find the only Tanaka mark right on the front of the frame, where it reads ""ASGK""/""MFG.TANAKA"".
The foresight is tall and clear, but the rear sight is a simple groove in the top of the frame, making the sights rudimentary at best.
The overall finish is excellent. I could not find anything that looked like a brush mark or pitting and the consistency of the mirror finish chrome effect across the various parts and materials appears 100%, even under varying light conditions, which are often expose even very minor flaws.

o load extra BBs, over the standard six cylinder openings, you need to remove the magazine stored in the extractor rod, which is done by depressing the 'screw' at the front (on the underside) of it. You can then fill the magazine with BBs and replace the extractor rod.

The grips are black plastic, replicating hard rubber, The hammer certainly is metal, as is the trigger and cylinder.



As I have come to expect of Tanaka revolvers, the SAA seems to have all the main features of the real revolver accurately replicated, with the exception of removable shells.

The BBs can be pushed into open cylinder mouths and extra ones can be stored in the extractor rod (more on that later), whilst the gas is put into the cylinder (as on all other Tanaka revolvers I have seen) by opening the moving piece of the frame and using the, provided, gas can extension. You need to half cock the hammer to get the cylinder to rotate, as with the real thing and there is an evocative click each time the cylinder moves on a notch.

Product description, 17 Round magazine for the Smith & Wesson M&P 9MM.  Constructed from heat-treated blued-steel, with a follower, lock-plate, and base-plate molded from a proprietary DuPont® Zytel™ based black polymer; and using a spring wound from Chrome-silicon wire and heat-treated for strength and reliability.

The original magazines you simply can't find anywhere and when you find them, they cost over a $100 each. Buy this Promag magazine for only $59.00 and don't be without an extra magazine for your gun. It works just as well and is made of good quality materials. I couldn't find anything different between the original S&W factory made mag and the Promag magazine and the Promag has a lifetime warranty.

Pictures shown have the original S&W magazine next to the Promag magazine for illustration and comparison purposes only. Factory made S&W mag pictured is not for sale. I personally keep and use the Promags myself.

History - Motor was completely rebuilt 5 years ago.  All new power packs, honed cylinders, etc.  It was used for 3 seasons on my Party Barge, which it pushed around like a champ.  

December 2011, I pulled the boat out of the marina slip, brought it home and replaced the carpet, built all new furniture, installed a new top cover, rewired the whole thing, installed new fuel tanks, new lights, etc... So, I missed out on the season last year.  Early this spring, it was compression checked, all the fuel hoses were replaced, carbs were rebuilt, plugs replaced, lower end lube replaced, new impeller, new fuel pump diaphragm, tilt/trim hoses tested, etc...  There are a couple wires near the flywheel that need to be wrapped or replaced due to insulation cracking.  It still runs, but these wires could be an issue, so I planned on replacing the easy to replace ones, and putting gooping the others.

Just before I started that final project, I  found a screaming deal on a newer V4 that had just been rebuilt.  I swapped the new V4 onto the boat, and took the Mercury to our shop to be tinkered with over time, then stored for future needs.  After some thinking, I've decided it's silly to keep the thing stored indefinitely, so my good fortune in getting the new motor can be your good fortune in getting my ""old"" one.

It comes complete with tilt/trim pump, hoses, control set, steering bar (no cables though), mount, ignition switch and a newly rebuilt prop."

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).


 The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. 

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. 

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. 

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs. I have a perfect condition bushmaster M4A3 with only 10 premium Gold Dot rounds through it and me being in the military, it was well cleaned after those rounds. Comes with a quad rail that Is also brand new, the original hand guards are on it. Comes with original box, and 30rnd mag."

I'm in no rush to move it so I'm going to wait for the right deal! Here are the answers to some common questions!

Are they any major scratches or imperfections?
Nope just normal wear on a firearm, looks brand new. It only has fired 70 rounds!
Is there a lot of re-coil?
Yes and no. If you go to the range with 300-350 grain loads, it feels less than a short barrel .44 magnum. The muzzle ""break"" on the end really keeps the nose from flipping. I would not recommend throwing 500grain lead balls in it unless you're really familiar with big caliber firearms.
How much is ammo?
Finding ammo can be tricky. You can generally find name brand ammo for $49.99 for a box of 20 (sounds expensive but you will not want to shoot it more than 20 times in 1 range visit I promise). If you are a less frugal shopper, mega sports always has it in stock for about $64.99 per box of 20.
Where can I shoot it?
I obviously have not asked everywhere, but you can shoot at at Article II and GAT guns any time, Mega Sports on weekdays only and never at Rinks. Any outdoor range should also let you shoot it."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer

Rifle has a 30 inch barrel and weighs just over 9 lbs. It is very hard to date these rifles due to the lack of manufactures records, so the only estimate of a manufacture date that I can put on this is 1927 to the early 1940's, I located an ad on the net for the empire model dated 1939. The last info that I could find for one at auction in the U.S was 2009. Research shows that Vickers merged with Armstrong in 1927 and a short time later target rifle production ceased for the war effort, it is likely that only a few thousand of these rifles were made. If interested I encourage the bidder to do some research prior to bidding. You will find during your query that the Empire model is the more rare model. This rifle is equipped with the factory Parker and Hale front and rear sights. Rifle has the correct British proof and test marks, and 22.62'NP mark, bluing 75%, wood is very good and it shoots great they are very accurate and as you will find they won most of the comp matches during their era. Check out the photos and contact me if you have any questions. It is the bidders responsibility to check your state and local laws prior to bidding. I will accept postal money order or cashier check only. Winner will add $50 for insured USPS shipping. I will only ship to a FFL holder."

Somchem, now Rheinmetall Denel Munitions (www.rheinmetall-defence.de/en/rheinmetall_defence/company/divisions_and_subsidiaries/rheinmetall_denel_munition/index.php) is located in the Republic of South Africa. RDM specializes in the development, design and manufacture of large- and medium-caliber ammunition families and is a world leader in the field of artillery, mortar and infantry systems as well as plant engineering. This S321 Rifle powder, while currently no longer in production is an excellent, fast, double base, ball powder that meters extremely well and is quite popular in Africa and Europe. There is a lot of info about it on the internet and all of it speaks to it’s superior performance and excellence for loading 308, 222, 223 and suitability for the M1A rifle. It is sorely missed by those that used it religiously. Performance wise it is slightly slower than IMR 4198 and VV N120, equal to Accurate 2230 and slightly faster than Hodgdon’s H322.

Great condition -- Saiga Semi-Automatic 12 Gauge Shotgun.

200 rounds of Federal high brass buck and bird shot thru it.  i bought it about 1.5yrs ago from Top Gun Supply in Chesterland, OH -- 	8555 Mayfield Rd.     I still have the factory buttstock and 5 round magazine so you could put it back to completely stock if desired.

I have added enough U.S. parts that it no longer needs to be 922r compliant; because its now considered a U.S. made weapon with fewer than 10 foreign parts.

10 + 1 Magazine -- counts as 3 U.S. parts

KickLite Pistol Grip and Collapsable stock with spring loaded recoil reduction -- counts as 2 U.S. parts and is easy on the shoulder!!  :)

Door breaching choke -- counts as 1 U.S. part

Tac-47 Gas Auto-plug (fully adjustable via flathead screwdriver for different types of ammo high brass/low brass).

Sidemount Picatinny rail that has over-top extension as well. Perfect for a Red-dot site.

Spare 5-round holder attached to the collapsable stock
(the red dot site pictured is NOT INCLUDED IN SALE)

Also will include Carolina soft spring --- you can easily swap this spring into the action for low recoil types of ammo to help with the semi-auto function.

Saiga 12 comes imported with 14 foreign parts.   14 - 6 = 8 foreign parts left on this firearm.

Thus the gun no longer needs to be 922r compliant because its considered a U.S. firearm having 10 or fewer foreign parts.

Also comes with a picatinny rail on the barrel with a XENON flashlight and integrated laser light mounted and all dialed in nice for about 20yrds.  VERY bright flashlight i must say.  The laser is pressure switch activated.

MY ONLY TRADE preference --  Lever Action Rifles in SERIOUS calibers - .45-70, 45 Long Colt, 44magnum, etc -- prefer Stainless steel.   Love the Rossi/Taurus copies that are out lately.   NO OTHER TRADES!

I have a Rossi Rio Grande 410 bore  lever action shotgun also that i'd be willing to sell or trade for Lever Rifle.  Its all stainless steel and in perfect condition - brazilian hardwood.  $425.   Third photo at bottom is the Rossi .410 Level Action shotgun. Holds 6+1."

Drive it home today!  4x4 with power everything. Truck has 177k+ miles.  The 5.2l V-8 engine runs strong, the transmission shifts perfectly, and the 4x4 is fully operational.  The ac blows cold when the system is fully charged, but the freon leaks out after a few days. The heat works great.  The body has some rust from up north, and the brakes are due for service.  The interior is in great shape.  The Jeep also has a tow package installed.  The tags and inspection are expired, but I am willing to have the inspection done if the deal is right.  The truck would make a great deer lease vehicle as it sits now, but would also make a decent daily driver for just a few more dollars.

I'm assuming it's because I'm not doing a Cook County sale with this one. Sorry, I'm not selling a high capacity magazine in your county or risking going down for conspiracy to commit firearm trafficking.... End of story. Those are your laws...not mine.
You can flag this again if you like, or do something real about it and write your lawmakers. I suggest option 2, cause there's other armslisters outside of Cook County that may want this pistol and wouldn't see the add because you're pouting about your laws in the wrong direction. I don't need to sell it. You're not taking anything away from me by flagging it. Just others who may want a sweet package deal at a good price/trade.

I have fired it only 25 times they were hollow points and it ate all 25 with out any malfunction of any kind. If a 1911 can eat up hollow points right out of the box then I say that's a good sign its a good 1911. Budsgunshop.com is selling them for $400, since I shot mine I will sell mine for $375!! FIRM. The same gun is going for $500 and up here in the Chicago Land Area. You must be a Illinois resident with VALID Illinois foid card, sign bill of sale and wait the BS 72hr wait period. If your foid card has a Chicago address on it but your drivers license has a non Chicago address on it, then I WILL SELL IT TO YOU. But if you are a Chicago resident via both foid and drivers license THEN I WILL NOT SELL IT TO YOU.

The Gun Tool is loaded with 18 of the most frequently used long gun tools, including five Torx and Allen wrenches and four magnetic hex drive bits, in a compact and ergonomic folding frame.

Manufactured by Pietta, called the Buffalo (or buntline) model with target (adjustable) sights.  This gun has never been loaded or fired.  It has been a safe queen, and I'm clearing out what I don't use.  I picked up the shoulder stock in England from a fellow black powder enthusiast that used it on a Remington revolver.  Fits perfectly on this gun, and will also fit perfectly on Pietta or Uberti reproduction Colt 1851 Army or Navy revolvers.  This is a great looking carbine rig, and will be an accurate shooter!

It does not have to be hard to buy a rifle. I enjoy being a gun owner and the AR15 is an awesome weapon system that more people should have access to. It's no wonder it is the most popular rifle in America. 

When I bought my first AR through a dealer, it was a tedious and unnecessary process. I thought the background check was ""instant"", what a joke, the FBI said my application would require ""further review"", and that would take 5 more days. So, I had to leave the dealer without my rifle, which was already paid for! For 5 days I  waited and researched about the NICS system and wondered how much longer it would take for the process to finish. Finally the FFL sent me email to say that he could ""proceed"". Great, why couldn't this be done 5 days ago? And to add to that, I had to pay a transfer fee for the ""service"" provided! And who knows what they're going to do with form I had to fill out, with my Social Security number on it as well!  

After this distinctively ""non-instant"" background check, I will do everything I can to avoid the hassle of going through dealers and the Government for by firearms purchases, and that’s why I am making it easy for you to get your new AR15 M4. 

To buy this rifle: 
1.You must be over 18 years old. If you look young, I will ask to look at your ID and confirm. I will NOT record your name or any personally identifiable information. 

2.You must be legally allowed to own a rifle. I will ask you, ""Are you legally allowed to own a rifle, right here right now?"" you will say ""yes"". Your word is your bond.  

No further questions, no paperwork. It really should not be a long stressful process! 

Let's meet face to face locally in Factoria, and get you your new rifle! 

pics of the rifle here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/97616003@N05/sets/REDACTED5399589/


Now, let's run through the features of your new AR15 M4: 


The Barrel:  

•
Chambered in 5.56 nato,  

•
you can shoot both .223 caliber and  5.56 mm ammunition. 

•
in a .223 barrel you cannot safely shoot 5.56 ammunition. 

•
Nitride treated barrel, 

•
 shown by the ""N"" roll mark on the barrel itself. Nitride treating is an upgrade from the common chrome lining process. Nitride treatment makes the barrel last longer and increases accuracy by reducing the friction in the bore between the bullet and barrel. 

•
16 inch length. 

•
 This is the most popular barrel length for AR's. It is a great balance between barrel length for close quarters maneuverability, and barrel length for accuracy. 

•
1 x 9 Barrel twist 

•
This allows a wide range of bullet weights to be used from 50 - 75 grain. This allows flexibility in the use of different .223 and 5.56 ammo, and flexibility in the range of those rounds. 

•
With the right ammo you can reach out to 300 yards, with optics make that 500 yards 

•
Barrel Material is Chrome Moly Steel.  

•
This is a common steel alloy used for rifle barrels. The chromium allows the alloy to resist oxidation and corrosion, and the Molybdenum adds higher temperature resistance and overall strength to the barrel. 

•
Flash Hider,  

•
A2 design flash hider and muzzle rise compensator. The flash hider is threaded on the end of the barrel with a 1/2 x 28 thread. This allows you to customize the muzzle with an alternate compensator if you wish. 

•
Front sight,  

•
Iron sight with adjustable sight post. The front sight triangle is ""F"" marked. This is a desirable feature to make the sight usable with the flat top M4 receiver. F marked sights are taller than the standard sights on non-M4 AR15's. The F actually stands for ""Flat"". 

•
Front sight also has bayonet Lug. This lug works with M6 and M9 bayonets. 

•
Also comes with front sling mount 

•
Hand guards,  

•
Hand guards are heat resistant polymer with a metal heat shield mounted inside. The hand guard length is the standard 7 inch Carbine length. This is very desirable, it makes it very easy to install aftermarket hand guards like a picatinny quad rail. 




Upper Receiver 
•
Aluminum Upper Manufactured by Anchor Harvey 

•
 Anchor Harvey is a well known manufacturer which supplies uppers to major AR manufacturers such as Colt and Bushmaster 

•
Upper is marked with M4 above the front gas port. 

•
This shows the upper is built to M4 specifications 

•
Upper has T Marked flat top  

•
The marks are part of the upper forging, and painted white. This allows you to replicate accessory placement if you take things like an optic off and on.  

•
M4 Feed Ramps  

•
The feed ramps are a highly desirable feature in M4's. it consists of two cuts along the bottom of the receiver and the barrel extension. This helps unfired rounds to enter the chamber quickly and allow the bolt to close faster after each shot. 

•
Forward Assist Button 

•
 The forward assist lets you push the bolt forward in emergency cases where it may be jammed and preventing the bolt face to fully seat in the breech. In emergency situations Forward assist can be used to load a round without a magazine, or broken charging handle, or faulty buffer spring.  The forward assist can also be used to silently load a round without having to release the bolt carrier group with the charging handle. 

•
Ejection port dust cover 

•
The dust cover helps to keep debris out of the breech, bolt carrier group, magazine well, and barrel. 

•
All Metal Rear Pop up sight 

•
Included with this rifle is the Rear sight mounted on the top rail.Sight has standard windage adjustments and two apertures. Small aperture is for normal daylight shooting, large aperture is for night time and low light 

•
 Just add ammo and a mag and you're ready to rock and roll. 



Bolt Carrier group 
•
Chrome lined carrier  

•
The bolt and firing pin move and rotate inside the bolt carrier. The chrome lining allows the bolt to move more reliably and makes the part easier to clean. 

•
Properly Staked Gas Key  


•
The gas key screws hold the gas key to the top of the bolt carrier. The screws are staked with a punch so that the screws can't work themselves loose during use. This is a highly desirable feature.  

•
Black insert on shell Extractor  

•
The black spring dampener is a desirable feature which increases the reliability of the shell extractor 

•
Fully Shrouded firing pin  

•
the shroud around the bottom of the bolt carrier group protects the firing pin and hammer during the rearward motion which cocks the hammer. The shroud smoothly cocks the hammer, instead of the firing pin. This is a highly desirable feature.    



Lower Receiver 
•
ATI Polymer TechComposite Lower 

•
 The non-metal receiver is strong and light. With this receiver the rifle is 6 pounds. Polymer is also NBC resistant, Nuclear, Biological and Chemical exposure will have minimal effect compared to machined aluminum. This lower will not show unsightly oil marks or scratch and dent like aluminum.  

•
Glock pioneered the use of polymer lowers and many other manufactures are producing polymer firearms such as Springfield, Colt, Bushmaster, H&K, ect 

•
Trigger group  

•
Standard all metal trigger group with full profile hammer. Full profile hammer is a desirable feature. The full profile hammer allows conversion to pistol caliber rounds without having to change the hammer. 

•
Low shelf internal pocket  

•
The lower is of the Low Shelf type. This is a very highly desireable feature that allows a full auto trigger group to be installed in the lower. Currently full auto is not allowed for law abiding citizens.  

•
Standard A2 pistol grip 



Rear stock 
•
Commercial buffer tube  

•
The commercial size buffer tube is compatible with a wide range of accessories such as adjustable stocks and cheek rests and storage compartments 

•
Six position sliding stock with metal sling mount.  

•
Sliding stock control screw also contains a set pin inside the large thumb nut.  

•
Removable Sliding stock 


•
Stock can be removed from buffer tube to allow lower to be converted to AR pistol use with only changing the upper receiver 



As you can see, there are a lot of features packed into this AR15 M4. 


Once you get it, you can load and start shooting right away. This rifle has never been shot, used, or abused by any previous owners. It is just waiting for you to use and customize as You see fit! 

Thank you for your time and consideration in buying this rifle. 

Thanks Again!"
