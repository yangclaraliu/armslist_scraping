This custom shotgun is a must see. With its single-digit serial number, it is from a limited production run of only ten made. It has 20"" barrels with 3-inch chambers and is made of 18-2 polished stainless steel - and so marked. It has a gorgeous, Grade 2 wood stock set with engravings. It's slim and nimble, and an absolute pleasure to handle. Please don't confuse this one with what passes as ""coach guns"" these days. This one is up to the quality guns of the past - with some added benefits from the modern age.  German-made quality, throughout. 

This is one of the most effective and history-proven personal defense firearms ever designed. It's also probably one of the very last types to ever be included in any new, mindless legislation. This firearm should last several lifetimes of serious use due to its superior craftsmanship and the material from which it is made.  Maybe the ultimate SHTF firearm . . . ? 

I cannot get any further (proper) photos of this one,  but will meet to show."

***FNS-9 9mm semi-auto pistol from FN Herstal*****
Introduction

The FNS™-9 is the latest handgun innovation by FN Herstal.

The FNS™-9 pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism and a manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety.

Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS™-9 results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate.
Benefits

    Fast and Accurate Shooting

The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.

The FNS™-9 has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.

The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy.

    Maximized Safety Systems 

In addition to the manual safety, the FNS™-9 features Four Major Safeties:

    Trigger Safety

The pistol comes with provenance on Texas Ranger Letterhead – a letter signed by William A. Bennie, Sergeant of Company “B”, Texas Rangers, Sherman Texas. The letter details the career of Sgt. Bennie, as well as that of his father, who also was a Sergeant in the Texas Rangers, and the letter confirms that this pistol was carried by both Father and Son during their tenure with the Rangers. The pistol itself is an earlier Colt Combat Commander, blue finish, with the desirable ring hammer, and custom, finely-grained wooden grips, the left grip has a silver miniature Texas Ranger Badge on it.

This is a 1974 Colt Detective Special 38 Special. It has been disrespected. It functions well and has beautiful wood grips, but has a lot of pitting on the cylinder and frame. Your personal inspection is welcome without obligation. These are expensive when in decent shape. I am only asking $200. Possibly someone can refinish this and make it nice. I would rather it be a face to face transaction at an FFL, but I will ship it if you wish for an additional $45 to cover the FFL and Shipping expenses. Postal money order only if shipped. NO TRADES!!

Mounted on a rifle and put 20 rounds through it.  Selling the rifle separately so now selling the scope, mount and rings.  It is an excellent scope system and this is .  It has the lowest rings available to have the scope as close to the barrel as possible.  The rings also have 6 bolts through each to prevent slippage of the scope.  The picatinny rail is a 20 moa to allow for looooong range shots.  The glass has excellent clarity and lets in significant amounts of light.  

About Mildots:    (many new shooters don't know...)  Fixed power is the way to go for mil-dot recticle. Mil-dots are only effective at one set power in a scope.  For example a 3x9 scope will have the mildots calibrated usually at power 9.  The shooter will have to remember to always put the power on 9 before using the mil dot. This is why fixed power scopes are the way to go when using true military mil dots. A 10x scope is about the gold standard for a fixed power because it allows for both long and close range shots.  Variable power scopes will compromise clarity for price.  A variable power scope with clarity like this one will cost over 1000.  

 This is a good scope for someone on a budget who doesn't want to compromise clarity and reliability. This scope is tough enough to mount on a 50 caliber rifle.  The 10x42 is a trusted scope used by many a military sniper.

Will also sell the scope separately for $250.  You can save yourself 50 dollars and shipping cost, get the scope today with no waiting, and see it before you buy.  If you want the rings and mount, you've got yourself 100 dollars worth of the best mount and rings for 50 dollars.

Obviously the original and the classic American ""assault rifle."" Receiver, Barrel, Muzzle crown, Front and Rear Sights, etc all metal appears to be in very good condition. The trigger is very smooth. Obviously it's a historic rifle so shows some wear, but no major dings. The wood is new and looks very cleanly finished. No marks on it. Serial number of the receiver is 5592xxx in case you want to look it up. I'm a gun guy but not a Garand guy -- I am disposing of this for a friend who apparently had this rifle in the family for a while -- so I haven't fired this rifle, but am glad to answer any questions I can about it.
The ammo is 250 rounds of FMJ per can, two cans. One can is quite rusty on the outside, but the the ammo is packed in plastic and is not touched.
The price is pretty firm. I've done enough reading to know what they're worth in this condition. If you are a Garand guy, and you want to check it with gauges and such, you are welcome to do so -- but I'm not interested in being talked down.
Thanks."

The Cold Hammer Forged Barrels offer distinct advantages over traditional barrel cutting.
The process reduces the outer diameter of the barrel without removing material, making the barrel stronger and more rigid, at the same time as forming the interior rifling. This leaves a much cleaner and smoother surface throughout the bore reducing projectile resistance and premature wear.

I have 30rd Troy battlemags for sale. These mags are outstanding quality. They are the same quality as magpul. You can read reviews on them from users on Midways link here. http://www.midwayusa.com/product/REDACTED/troy-industries-battlemag-magazine-ar-15-223-remington-30-round-polymer#ReviewHeader 

These come with an extra floorplate. You can either have a flat floorplate or have a pull knob floorplate. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch.
The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate. Made in the U.S.A. *Lifetime limited warranty, see www.troyind.com for details.

Price is $15 each. I am only interested in trades for a 10/22 takedown model or ruger bx-25 mags. You can email or text me at (920)four five six-9033. I will ship if you pay for shipping.

Third Generation models are distinguished from 1st & 2nd gen Glocks by the addition of a thumb rest on either side of the frame, finger grooves on the strap & a loaded chamber indicator on the extractor. Unlike Gen4 models, Gen3 Glocks feature a standard (vs. rough) texture frame. Perfection. The GLOCK 26 is ideal for home defense, concealed carry, duty or as a hunting sidearm. The Glock 26 is a sub- compact, 10- shot capacity, 9mm, polymer frame, double action only handgun. It uses a locked breech design in what is called a ""Safe Action"". The pistol does not have a hammer. Rather, the Glock 26 uses a spring-loaded striker that is partially retracted when a round is chambered. Pressing the trigger fully retracts and releases the striker, allowing the handgun to fire.

The GLOCK 26 ""Safe Action"" system has revolutionized the handgun industry and has been widely adopted by law enforcement and other official users as well as commercial and countless others due to its simple, fast, safe and reliable design. The main advantage of the GLOCK 26 ""Safe Action"" system is that is has no external safeties. Because of this, the user can concentrate on a stress situation, eliminating the need to think about any safeties to be deactivated. The Safe Action trigger system offers you several very distinct benefits over conventional trigger systems. It makes training much easier because each and every shot feels exactly the same. The combination of the trigger safety, firing pin safety and drop safety make the GLOCK 26 safe when dropped.
GLOCKs have about 50% fewer components than conventional handguns of these calibers. No screws. So there are fewer parts to break. And you can break down and reassemble any GLOCK pistol within a matter of seconds. The GLOCK 26 frame is made out of a synthetic that is actually stronger than steel, yet 86% lighter. It's virtually indestructible. A GLOCK pistol can withstand temperatures ranging from -40 F to +158 F and still come out firing. The metal components on a GLOCK are practically indestructable. That's because they're finished with a unique surface treatment called Tenifer that makes those parts virtually as hard as a diamond. It is even more corrosion resistant than stainless steel.

All GLOCK handguns are designed with a grip angle that's so comfortable & natural that it complements the shooter's hand. This ergonomic design features a superb bore axis and weight distribution to ensure a controlled shot, even under the most adverse conditions. Plus, the special polymer frame, of which the grip is an integral part, results in a much softer recoil than that of conventional guns, which only adds to your control. The unique GLOCK barrel features hammer-forged rifling for increased velocity and even greater accuracy.."

I hate jumping on the panic sale bandwagon but I've incurred a bit of debt since this has started and would like to offload some of it by getting rid of a few extra boxes of ammo that aren't needed.  I did a quick search on new mexico listings, and even though these prices are way above normal, they are still lower than what is listed on this site.

BTW if you want to pick up multiple calibers like say you want the 9mm and the 40 I can work out something with you.  Keep in mind that if you are in ABQ travel time will play a big factor into your purchase as I am only willing to travel into Espanola/Los Alamos for sales.
