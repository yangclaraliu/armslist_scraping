Made in 1889 it has a 30 inch #3 octagon barrel. The bore is excellent, the rifling is bright and sharp from muzzle to chamber with zero throat erosion. I rate the bore condition a strong 9++ on a 1 to 10 scale, it will be an excellent shooter! The barrel retains 60%+ blue with traces of dark plum. There is wear to sharp edges and carry wear forward of the receiver. The front sight is a Winchester #67A Globe with fine ""A"" bead insert. The rear is a Winchester #22B with serrated edges and correct elevator. The receiver retains 30 to 40% faded case colors and has a Winchester #38A Mid Range tang sight mounted. The tang sight is intact and operates smoothly with no wobble in firing position. The elevation graduations are sharp and clean. There are traces of blue but mostly a plum gray patina. Mechanically the receiver is excellent, cocks properly on closing, half and full cock hold properly. The trigger break is crisp at 3 pounds. The wood is excellent and stands proud above the metal in all mating areas of the forend, receiver and buttplate. It shows no evidence of ever being sanded or refinished and I believe the finish to be original factory varnish. There is one small chip at the toe of the buttplate. There are numerous light handling marks that were obviously made long ago but I see no cracks or chips other than the one at the toe of the buttstock. The nickel plating on the Swiss buttplate has either worn off or been removed. I see traces of plating but it's mostly brass finish. The buttstock has had weight added and apparently set up as an off hand rifle. Weight is 12.3 pounds. The Cody Museum letter lists the serial number date 8-21-1889, date shipped 8-2-1890 under order #15477. Caliber is 32-40 with #3 octagon barrel and plain trigger. This is a fine vintage Schuetzen style Winchester that is an antique and can be shipped direct. I'll be glad to provide additional photos, just send your email address and the specific views you would like to see."

However I have not been able to follow through with this particular hobby as much as I wanted to. I have shot less than 100 rounds through this beast. The upper is a YHM with a Midwest Industries lightweight floating rail. The barrel is a Satern 24 inch cut rifled half fluted heavy match barrel. The BCG and muzzle break are both made by Alexander Arms. The scope is a Bushnell Elite Tactical Mildot with 4.5 x 30 power. The lower is a Sharps Rifle Company with a Geissele SSA-E 2 stage trigger that has a pull weight of about 3.5 lbs. There is 2.3 lbs. on the 1st stage and 1.2 lbs. on the 2nd stage. It is an awesome trigger. An ergo pistol grip with palm shelf. The stock is a Magpul PRS with a monopod. This I quite a setup if reaching out to 1000 yards is something you are interested in. I have only shot this out to 300 yards and my best 5 shot group was .476 inches. This is one rifle that I wish I had more time for. This setup cost me over $3500. Asking $3000.

Pistol was cleaned immediately after the one range session it's been through. The slide still has the gold grease in it that Glock ships all of their brand new firearms with. Simply put, this gun placed side by side with an identical brand new, unfired one would not show a single sign of a difference, other than the upgrades that I've made to it. Those include a Glockmeister extended slide stop lever, a Pearce Grip frame insert, a Vicker's Tactical mag release, and most importantly a set of Ameriglo tritium night sights. The front sight is an Ameriglo Pro Glo with a green tritium vial and the rear sight is an Ameriglo Operator with yellow tritium vials. They are very bright in the dark (will email a pic of this if interested). I did extensive research on tritium night sights before I purchased these and in my opinion, these are the best night sights available on the market.

Comes with everything included from the Glock factory; two 10 round mags, speed loader, cleaning rod and brush, lock and Glock carrying case. Also included are all of the original parts that have been swapped out for upgrades. 

This is a 10mm fan's dream sidearm. I hate to get rid of it, but my body shape does not allow for ideal concealment, which was this gun's main purpose for me. 

For a local sale, I am willing to meet face to face for a cash transaction with verification of a permit to carry. 

For anything other than a local sale, I will only transfer from my FFL dealer to yours. Buyer assumes all shipping and handling charges. Cashiers check or money order are my only accepted forms of payment. Thanks for looking."

Has factory walnut target grips with Llama medallions on the side. Ventilated rib barrel, adjustable rear sight, spur hammer, & extra wide trigger (chromed). 

These were made in Spain and designed to mechanically function just like a Smith & Wesson Combat Magnum (model 19). Has pinned barrel, and recessed cylinder. Bluing looks good with just a small amount of wear at the muzzle. No rust. Has a clean shiny bore.

Now here's why I'm selling so low. I haven't shot the gun in months and this afternoon was cleaning it and dry firing and found out there is a major timing issue and causing the cylinder to not turn between fires. It never did this before. I'm going to take it to the gun shop this weekend and see if it's something they can repair, or you can get it for $60 and see if it's something you can fix yourself. I did take the sideplate off and looked inside to see if anything looked out of place. Didn't touch any of the internals, but if you know a good gunsmith maybe they can have a better look at it.

It's still a hand gun so according to law you must have a North Carolina CCW license or a pistol purchase permit. No exceptions. We'll both sign a bill of sale of which I will provide. If there are any questions, contact me. 

If ad is up it means it's still for sale. God bless!"

-Impact and Shock proof
-Designed for extended wear and comfort 
-Fully Adjustable 
-Single Hand Draw and Re-Holster 
-Lifetime Warranty 



Each holster is handmade using a combination of Kydex and leather for maximum retention, durability and dependability. The stout leather backer will mold itself to your exact shape, regardless of carry position providing superior comfort, all day, every day while the Kydex will keep your sidearm secure and retained through the most vigorous activities. 

The Storm Holster is designed to fit inside your waist band, for maximum concealment, while its strong, enamel coated, spring steel belt clips keep it securely in place. Your shirt can be tucked in behind the belt clips when the situation requires more formal clothing without sacrificing concealment. 

All options are included in the price, as well as shipping. We are determined to provide you the exact holster you desire. As such, each holster is fully customizable down to the shape of the leather backer and position of the kydex. 

If you'd like something changed or tweaked, please feel free to email us and we will gladly work with you on any designed changes or specific needs. 

These holsters may also be used cross-draw. Email us if you intend on using it in a cross-draw configuration as the kydex can be altered to better facility its function. 

PERSONALIZATION AND CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS Your Storm holster offers a variety of personalization and customization options, all included in the price. You will notice selectable fields for ""Leather Color"" ""Stamping"" and ""Inlay"" in the order menu above. 

-Leather Color: Refers to the color of the leather backing. If you do not see a color you want, email us! Some colors show better than others, and some take special dyes, so we will be more than happy to work with you and help you decide which is right for you. 

-Stamping: You may wish to have your name, a favorite phrase, quote or saying stamped into your holster. This is an embedded stamp, using 1/4"", bolt font letters and is a permanent addition to the holster. There is a 15 character limit. If you want something larger, email us and we will find a way to make it fit. 

-Inlay: This is in addition to the stamping. You may choose a color from the drop down menu and this will be used to ""fill in"" the stamping you have selected. This is also a permanent addition, using a specially blended leather dye, NOT A PAINT, and is then clear coated with the same protective coating your holster has, which seals it into the leather. Inlays are done by hand, one letter at a time and give that custom look and feel Storm Holsters are renowned for. 

If you do not see your model of gun here please email me at REDACTED Please allow 1-2 weeks for orders to be filled. These are custom made by hand and as such it takes time. Thank you for your patience."

Lock up is tight and this 38 special has very nice double action and one of the nicest single action pulls I have ever shot. I have only put 200 rounds through it for a total of 300. She is tight as new. Is definately a safe queen and I have never carried it. Looking for cash but may take partial trade or straight across for right gun or GUNS.  I would have no problem storing it for longer, just thought I would put it out there. This revolver is a jewel, Factory tack driver. Even though you could. I have never shot +P ammo through her.

The PredatAR 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.
The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).
The handguards on the PredatAR extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy.
XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls. Facilitates reliable extraction through a wide range of temperature / chamber pressure extremes. XTRAXN™ extends extractor life, while having no effect on the firearm's accuracy. All this, and it dovetails well with the OBR's world-famous accuracy.

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

Must have a carry conceal permit, or Cleet/peace officer, fire, or rescue, or active duty military. This is to insure I am not selling to a person of domestic violence or any other criminal record. I will drive to a public place to make the sale. Thanks."
