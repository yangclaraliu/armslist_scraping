The New LaserLyte® Rear Sight Laser for GLOCK® One Laser – All GLOCKS

LaserLyte® returns to basics with the patented RTB-GL rear sight laser that fits all GLOCK® firearms. The high performance laser built into a rear sight specifically designed for all GLOCK pistols features a simple, ambidextrous “press and go” activation.  The laser is easily programmable to either constant on or pulse mode.  Another great feature is the “auto-off” feature that displays a unique flash after 5-minutes of operation and automatically turns the unit off after 6-minutes.

Made from heavy-duty, high carbon steel for added durability, the LaserLyte® RTB-GL rear sight laser has a black chrome finish for corrosion prevention. A great benefit of the LaserLyte® RTB-GL rear sight laser, besides the single-laser-fits-all-GLOCKS, is that the customer will not have to replace grips, internal stock parts or holsters. The LaserLyte RTB-GL rear sight laser is compatible with all Level 1 and Level 2 holsters including the BLACKHAWK!® SERPA® holster system.

Receiver weight (complete) is 1 full pound lighter than a complete aluminum receiver with an A2 stock.

 Wider magazine well accepts unmodified, submachine gun magazines in pistol calibers. With caliber conversion upper receivers and magazine blocks, standard AR15 magazines can be used without modifications. As well, any M16 magazine can be used with easier reloading than aluminum receivers.
 It has a longer service life, as Nylon6 resists impacts and wear better than aluminum. The integrated buffer tube, pistol grip and fixed stock give this design its strength."

Its 6 boxes of 20 minus 2 rounds. I always check ammo when I buy it and 2 rounds were no good thats why its 118 rounds. 3 boxes are original and the 3 Federal boxes are still the Winchester/Olin ammo I just did not have the original boxes anymore so I am just putting the rounds in the Federal boxes. It is not Federal rounds I am just giving you it in the boxes instead of loose. I normally keep my ammo in MTM Case Gard boxes that is why I do not have all 6 original boxes anymore.

TRADE ONLY.

I HAVE -- a Bond Arms Derringer (Texas Defender) in polished Stainless steel w/ Rosewood grips and removable trigger guard. 3"" barrel chambered in .45 Long Colt & .410 2.5"" shot.  The gun is in excellent condition, with low round count, mostly used for carry in a pocket holster. . As part of Bond's modular system can be easily fitted with barrels in .38/.357, .45ACP, .22, etc.  These are widely considered to be the finest derringers in the world, and are stout heavy guns made in Texas entirely of stainless steel. The gun comes with original box, very nice form-fitted leather pocket holster, and for the right deal could include a variety of top grade defensive ammunition. 

I WANT -- a compact and lightweight revolver in .38+p or .357 Magnum .  I'd prefer a S&W with a short barrel and a bobbed but exposed hammer. I'm willing to consider shrouded hammer designs, and other makes but I'm big on quality. I'm not interested in plastic or polymer framed guns, and the only makes I'm looking for are S&W, Colt and Ruger. Also, I already have a S&W 66-5 w/ a 2.5"" barrel (which I love, BTW) -- I'm looking for something significantly smaller and lighter than this."

Additional Description: The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. This model is the SIG P226 Legacy with additional features!

Walmart, Big 5, Sportsmans Warehouse, and even on the net, Does get ammo in on a DAILY basis now! They usually sell out by noon each day; why? Because these reseller A**holes keep buying it up to sell to YOU for 1.5 to double the price!!! Each one of the stores I just listed usually unpacks their ammo between 7:30-8:00 AM...How do I know? Because I hit up my Walmart every morning at those times and have been able to get what ever they get in!! Winchester .45 ACP 100 round packs for $42, Tula .223 20 round boxes for $5.95 a box, Federal 375 round packs of .22LR for $13.95, Winchester 550 round packs of .22LR for $18.95 a box, Independence .223 20 round boxes for $8.97 a box, even Tula 500 round sealed spam can tins of 7.62x39 and .223 for $157 EACH!!! YES...it IS possible to get all of that!! Each day they DO get a different amount and kind of ammo shipment in!! DON'T BE STUPID AND PAY THESE SCAMMERS/RESELLERS PRICES!!! Its no mistake that they seem to always have it for sale!! Go get yours before they do and let's stop these over priced idiots from ripping you off!!! If they are getting it SO CAN YOU!!! The ONLY reason they are getting away with reselling ammo at these prices is because YOU keep buying from them!! Resellers show up with their friends and each buy the allotted ""3"" boxes to sell to YOU!!! I have seen it with my own eyes at Walmart!! This IS their racket!! Every time I go there, there is never a line at my Walmart...I just bought 3 100 round packs of 12ga Shotgun Shells YESTERDAY for $24 Each!! The day before that I bought 3 boxes of Winchester 100 round packs of .45 ACP for $42 EACH...No line, no hassle....Do the same thing these reseller A**holes are doing to get the ammo!

Stop these dirt-bags in their tracks...no buyers means no reseller A**holes on Armslist!!! If I can do it everyday so can YOU!!!! I am NOT in need of ammo or mags anymore...be smart like me!! I laugh every time I see these reseller Sh*tBags trying to sell this stuff on here! Notice how AR 15's have dropped in price yet they are still hard to get?? Same reason!

One of the finest AR-15 / M16 mags on the market today. Extremely reliable and durable and at a great price. By collecting input from military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters, TAPCO has designed a magazine that can be depended on from a trip to the firing range to deployment overseas. Molded of reinforced composite with aggressive horizontal ridges that provide increased gripping surface for insertion and extraction of the magazine in wet or muddy conditions. This also helps to eliminate feed lip separation. The anti tilt follower has been designed to allow more dirt and grime to pass than any other magazine on the market. This allows the magazine to keep feeding ammo, despite loose dirt or sand that may have entered the magazine. The spring is made using a 1770 Stainless steel wire, featuring a unique shape for smoother, quieter loading through all 30 rounds. It also reduces overall stress on the magazine body, preventing spine cracks. 30 Round capacity. Fits All AR15, M4, and M16 Variants. Made in the U.S.A. with a lifetime warranty from TAPCO."

The only reason I'm selling it is because there is something else I want more and since I just purchased a rifle, I can't justify another purchase to my wife yet. I bought this gun in May of last year and have been upgrading it ever since. It started out as a DPMS Recon, their top tier tactical rifle. Many upgrades have been installed. Here are the current specs:

Stainless steel 1/9 twist 556 barrel
AAC Blackout 51t flash hider
Midlength free float quad rail with lo pro gas block
M4 feed ramps
Nickel Boron (NiB-X) bolt carrier group, one month old

Yankee Hill Machine EZ-Pull takedown pins
KNS Anti Walk trigger/hammer pins
Short throw 60 degree ambidextrous safety selector
Magpul trigger guard
LaRue Tactical A-PEG rough grip in urban dark earth

This rifle looks, feels and shoots great. I've had it a year and put about 600 rounds through her. Not one single malfunction, not even during the break in period. The sights and red dot co-witness perfectly. My last trip to the range I was ringing the plate at 400 yards without the use of magnified optics, just MBUS and the red dot. The only reason I didn't go out farther is because my eyes couldn't see the 500 yard target. Very well maintained. Thoroughly cleaned after each range visit and oiled once a month even if I didn't get to shoot it.  

I'm looking for $1,600 or best offer on this, I've got more than that in it. I would trade... I'm looking for a comparable 9mm set up. A quality gun, preferably upgraded like mine, and with multiple magazines. Show me what you've got and maybe we can make a deal. Email or text REDACTED
