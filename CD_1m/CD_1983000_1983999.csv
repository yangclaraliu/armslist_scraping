Was fired less than 100 rounds and was cleaned thoroughly afterwards. Comes with original box and 2 magazines - 1 standard and 1 with a pinky extender. Will also come with a Remora IWB no clip holster. If you havent seen these holsters, you need to check them out, it will change the way you carry. I also installed rubberized talon grips onto it, but those can be easily removed and leave no residue if you don't like them. I really wish I didnt have to sell this as it's my favorite carry pistol, but I recently got married and need the cash. Ive got over $525 in this thing between the gun, grips, and holster but I'm only asking $475 OBO so lets work something out.

My wife would like to learn to shoot, so I am in need of a GOOD .22 rifle.  Doesn't need to be ""tacticool"", in fact I would prefer a basic model.  I am willing to consider an AR based .22, as I have the .308 version.

Please note, I am lookking for one at a REALISTIC price.  If the rifle you have sells for 200.00 new, than I am not going to give you 200.00 for a USED rifle.  This also means that if your rifle costs 180.00 new, I am not going to pay more than that for a used one.

However, there is a catch (isn't there always?).  I AM willing to meet face to face ONLY, and purchase your file with cash.  But the catch is, you MUST know what you are selling, and what it is REALLY worth.  

For example, if you have a Ruger 10/22 Tactical with collapsing and folding stock (model number 1113), know that if I REALLY wanted a NEW one, I could buy it for under four hundred.  This means that your USED one is NOT worth more than the cost of a new one.  It's that simple.  People come here to make deals on firearms, not pay more than retail.

If you have a Mossberg Tactical .22 (the AR clone), know that they can be purchased NEW for 243.00.   This means your USED one is NOT worth four hundred.

I am willing to pay a reasonable price, no questions asked.  HOWEVER, if I can buy a NEW one for less than you are asking for a USED one, it is not worth my time, because you clearly dont grasp that once a firearm is used, it looses value.  Whether you have fired twenty rounds, or two hundred rounds through it, it is still a used rifle.  I will give you more than a gun shop will, simply because I am an end user, and not out to resell any firearms.

For example, you crazy people charging FIVE HUNDRED for a ""tactical"" SKS.... you know you can pick them up at Shooters Outpost in Hooksett for under two hundred dollars, right?  I believe I paid $175.00 for my SKS there last week"

Used upper off of a Glock 24 40 cal s&w long slide pistol. Barrel is 6'' long. Has Glock factory adjustable rear sights. Upper is complete and fully functioning (I ran 250 rounds of reloads through it on 8/7/13 without any issues, shooting on my gen 3 G22 and G35 frames). 

I am not the original owner so I do not know round count. The slide is in used/ carried condition. There are scuffs and scratches. Upper would look great polished or plated.

Would be a great base for a project gun or a fun upper to slide on your full size standard frame Glock and have some fun at range. 

Will only ship to first 48. No international shipping.

I am willing to pay a reasonable price, no questions asked. HOWEVER, if I can buy a NEW one for less than you are asking for a USED one, it is not worth my time, because you clearly dont grasp that once a firearm is used, it losses value.  I WILL give you more than a gun shop would for it, because I am an end user, and not out to sell it to make money afterwards.

FFL Dealers.... I have two brand new Rock River Arms AR15's that I would like to trade for or sell to you at invoice to invoice prices. If you want to buy them I will provide you the cost with shipping price I paid for them as an FFL dealer. 

If you are not a dealer... I am willing trade retail to retail price or what we negotiate....

I am looking for the following: Would prefer NEW items... not junk....

Portable Generator.... something that can run a good amount of items during power outages.... 10,000 or above..... Looking for a good model.... dependable... Top end models not no name brands they made for one year... 

I am looking for the following ammo... .22 lr, .223, 5.56, 9mm, I know what this stuff costs a dealer so if you think your items are worth more than what I can pay for at Simmons, do not bother calling or emailing me.... trading apple to apple prices here.... 

I am looking for a Springfield XD/S in .45's and 9mm's and extra mags.... 

I will get pictures of these two models on here asap....

Thanks,

The DB380 comes with two 6 round magazines, hard carry case, lock, and manuals. 

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

It was made in West Germany.  Date code is 1990, and has the triple matching serial numbers.  I've put 100 rounds thru it.  I purchased it used so it has an unknown total amount of rounds thru it.  The rifling is still very strong.  The slide has some exterior holster wear on it, mainly near the muzzle, but the frame and frame rails have very little and are in great shape.  The sights are burnt out night sights.

Comes with original box & manual, one flush fit 13-rd mag, one non-flush fit 15-rd mag (think it was from a P226), and a Blackhawk Serpa holster.  And it is a real P228, not the M11-A1/P228 which is a rebadged P229.

This has been a great pistol with no failures of any kind. I love these pistols but have too many P228's and P225's.  

Price is $600 OBO. Not really interested in trades. Maybe a stainless 357 S&W revolver with 6-inch barrel, but a big maybe.

Both pistols have a snag-proof design that permits quick presentation to the target, a slide blade front sight for fast target acquisition, and a smooth, crisp trigger pull in double/single action.

QUALITY POCKET PISTOLS. 
The same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality control that make the 92FS, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity, safety and practical use are their best qualities. 
PRACTICAL AND SIMPLE.
The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas. 
Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy. Available in the Tritium version featuring the tritium luminous front sight in some countries. 
Comes with 1 magazine and some rounds, pocket holster and original plastic hard case. Less than 50 rds shot through it. Good backup gun and nice for pocket carry."

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

With the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places.

I've yet to experience any failures (to feed, eject or extract), and I've thoroughly cleaned the system after each firing. I've even taken the time to clean out the magazines recently.

The reason I'm selling the Px4 is because I'm finally realizing that, although this is a compact firearm, it's still a little too large for someone my size. With that said, I'm keeping my BU9 Nano as my primary carry firearm.

This firearm comes with a leather holster custom made by Gaunt Leather (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gaunt-Leather-Co/REDACTED17) if you so choose to purchase it with the firearm. This holster is an IWB holster and holds the Px4 perfectly and firmly.

What is in the pictures, is what is for sale. The holster is negotiable, and we can discuss the price of said item later.
---
---
The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, and two extra back-straps, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package.The 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready. 

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols."

The gun does have minor wear marks (on the slide - visible in picture) from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo. Other than that, it's a great little shooter; I have no complaints.

I would really like to sell this for $375.00 cash.

I bought this rifle new several months back and built it myself from the ground up, so I know its done right, and I know it opperates flawlessly. When I built it, I spared no expense. I've got almost $1800 invested in this rifle, (including the mags that run $45-50 a piece.)

This thing is FREAKIN' BAD-ASS!!! Its basically just a beefed up Russian made AK, chambered in .308,  that can effectively reach out and put the smack-down on anything out to 500-600 yards.

I thought I was gonna keep this bad boy, but I just recieved an offer on a National Match M1a I can't walk away from, so I'm gonna liquidate this thing to knock a chunk out of the M1.

I have an Arsenal of Bulgaria Sam7SF rifle chambered in 7.62x39.  This is a pretty rare rifle with only 400 being imported roughly 6-7 years ago.  Reason being it is a milled receiver with a factory Bulgarian side folding stock that is currently being used/produced by Bulgaria for it's military and other armed forces around the world.  The military platform designation is known as the AR-M9F.  Great condition with only a few hundred rounds fired through the rifle.  By far one of the smoothest and most accurate 7.62x39 AK platform rifles I have ever owned/fired.  Rifle also has a factory side optics rail, rear receiver mounted sling swivel, a threaded 24mm fsb, ambidextrous galil style safety and cleaning rod.  This rifle hasn't been nuteured for import like many of the sam7 series have been.  Great condition with only a few small light marks here and there from inserting mags, and removing/replacing the cleaning rod.  Need to sell to help pay tuition for grad school.  Asking $1500 OBO.  That is less than what I paid for it, and I have seen several in the past few weeks selling on gunbroker for between $2k and $2400.  Not really looking for too many trades.  Maybe a partial trade towards an  XDS9, XDS45, Ruger 1911, Mosin nagant+ammo, BCM upper, or possibly a square back vepr.  Willing to ship or meet ftf near College Station."

While the Wylde chamber allows for optimal seating depth of 80 grain bullets over .223 Remington and 5.56 NATO, it is capable of accepting both ammunition types.

As you might assume, I'm not interested in anything with a frame lock.  Older guns with top strap checkering and other period details are greatly preferred. As are guns with original grips, and other factory correct stuff (packaging, etc).

I have Cash in hand for a good specimen of a Model 27.  Looking to do a FTF transaction in the Portland Metro area.  I have a OR DL and CHL available for your inspection. And, no, I'm not interested in paying fantasy pricing ;)

p.s. I'm a revolver enthusiast, and I promise a good home for your classic Smith. But I'm also pretty picky, and I'm not interested in a beat up, abused gun. Thanks for understanding!"

I had intentions of selling the gun prior to having taken it apart, my intention now is to sell it as it is and essentially let the buyer ship it to Kel Tec for reassembly as I am not necessarily wanting to have to deal with the process and waiting.  I am asking $850 for it as it is, so as to leave room for the cost of shipping and the reassembly fee.  I have calculated this asking price based on what I initially paid for the gun, as well as what they are running for fully assembled outside of FFl dealers (you wont find them there).  Anyone interested feel free to email me any time!  I am not interested in trades."

If you are looking for the Great German Craftsmanship, you want these mags.   Note the picture with the “Made in Germany” imprinted 

These mags were made in 1996 based on the date code and therefore have the L/E Govt makings. They are LEGAL to buy and posses by ANYONE since the expiration of the Federal Hi cap mag ban in 2004.  Blue Steel and Stainless Steel Follower. These are the best H&K mags on the market. Not only do they function flawlessly, they have a Collector value with the L/E Govt imprint on them.  there were only a finite / limited number of these produced and they are no longer in production (1994-2004). They have not been produced with the inscription since 2004.  I have not seen another one of these for sale anywhere.

Coincidentally, it shoots the longer 80 gr bullets commonly used in the sport of Highpower Rifle Competition very well and is one of the preferred chambers for that use. While the Wylde chamber allows for optimal seating depth of 80 grain bullets over .223 Remington and 5.56 NATO, it is capable of accepting both ammunition types. The Wylde chamber is used by a few manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifle At this time we only accept checks and money orders"
