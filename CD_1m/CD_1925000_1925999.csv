Item description
Front Sight Flashlight Adapter

Since the widespread training and use of indoor CQB tactics by military units and law enforcement agencies, the ideal light placement has been sought on the contemporary carbine. Weapon lights placed on 3:00, 9:00 and even 6:00 rail positions are often blocked by interior features or cover, creating hazard to both operator and yet–to-be-identified occupant(s). Light mounting at the 12:00 position is optimum, but is obstructed by flip-up front sights. The TangoDown Inc FFA-01 was developed to solve this issue, and add several additional features: - Allows SureFire X300*, SureFire Mini Scout Light M300A, Inforce WML weapon light to mount at the 12:00 rail position, maximizing the sight radius of back-up iron sights. - Provides constant point of aim to the shooter, with or without optic. - Enables easy ambidextrous operation of the weapon light by the shooter. - Saves valuable rail space on short barreled carbines. - Solid CNC construction from 4130 steel with black manganese phosphate finish protects X300 weapon light (not included) from impact damage. - Integral front sight post is easily adjusted for proper zero. The FFA-01 is easily installed** in minutes with a 9/64” allen wrench (user supplied). Front sight can be adjusted using a 5/64” allen wrench (user supplied). * FFA-01 fits SureFire X300, Surefire M300A, M600C and Inforce WML models. ** FFA-01 is for use with flip-up front sights only, not for use with standard M4-style fixed front sights."

From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. It is set apart from the 92FS by distinctive military style markings on various components that closely replicate those of the U.S. Armed Forces M9 pistols, as well as a unique M9-prefixed serial number. It also features a design that virtually eliminates jamming, a safety system that combines de-cocking and a positive thumb safety, a combat muzzle crown, and the Bruniton anti-glare finish.

Seems like every AK add I see claims to be ""the best"" AK ever made, but talk is cheap. The SLR-95 actually is the most rare, & highly sought after AK47 ever produced.  Here's the history;
The SLR-95 was made in the original ARSENAL factory in Bulgaria. This factory is world renouned for producing the highest quality AKs ever produced. The 95 has a milled reciever, milled fire control group and Steyr barrel. The 95 was originally milled to accept double stack magazines and was the only AK imported with zero US made parts. It was only imported from 1995-1998. All other Arsenal SLRs were produced in the U.S. from a satalite arsenal factory in Nevada. The Arsenal factory in nevada uses the same specs as the Bulgarian factory, and they produce some of the best AKs on the market, but they simply cannot compare to the AKs produced in the original Bulgarian factory. Simply do a little research on the web, and you'll understand why the SLR-95 is in a class of its own. You rarely see these things on armslist, and if you do, they're expensive & they go fast....why... because THEY ARE FREAKIN' BAD-ASS!!!

I've replaced the original front & rear sight with mepro-light tritium night sights, but I still have the original sights for all you pure-ist out there. I've also added a tapco T6 adjustable stock, hogue grip & aluminum front quad-rail, but again for you pure-ist I've still got the original thumbhole arsenal stock & foregrip. I'm also going to throw in 10 steel mags & 1860 rounds of 7.62x39 wolf & tulla hp & fmj, and for the right price/trade I'll even cerakote it the color or camo pattern of your choice. (to see cerakote gallery check out www.cerakotepros.com)

I'm not really sure I wanna let this thing go, but I am curious to see whats out there. Please text me any cash or trade offers to REDACTED. the worst I can say is no thanks. Please keep in mind I know what this package is worth, and I'll only trade for something of equal value. Also, I'm willing to throw in cash for the right trade.

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights.

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semi-auto pistol designed for concealed carry and personal defense borrowing features from the M9 & 92, and is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for on and off duty law enforcement, private security forces, and responsible citizens. The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact, compact, and full frame versions. Like the M9 and 92, the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way-only fit for ease of mind. Ambidextrous de-cocking and a positive thumb safety prevents unintentional discharge if the gun is dropped and a non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty.

Willing to consider trades of any combination of cash, gold, silver, guns or straight trade. Trades must be of $1300 value since I prefer $1150 in cash.

Thanks for looking.

I usually order 5k small and 5k large pistol but this time they were out of large pistol so I just ordered 3k small rifle and 7k small pistol knowing that these are in pretty high demand and can trade locally. I dont use small rifle primers(well, I do, but I use them interchangeably in pistol calibers), I just bought 3k small rifle knowing that these are the hottest item on the market right now and they'd make someone happy. 

Id like to trade off 4k primers for large pistol primers. It doesnt matter if you want to get all 3k rifle primers and a thing of pistol primers or just 4k pistol primers. small rifle primers work just fine in all of my handguns. These are tula primers, Ive used 20k so far and they all go bang and do the same thing any other primer does, in fact many prefer tula rifle primers for their 223 loads. I dont care if you have tula, fiocci, cci benchrest whatever, one for one trade. Id prefer to trade all 4k at once and will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet. 

Trade only! Im really not in this to make money, just get what I need and help others locally get what they need. Besides if you ask to buy em, im just gonna tell you a stupid high price to shoo you off."

Consider the RUGER LC9 NRA is a Special Edition, double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull for your next concealed carry firearm. Slightly larger than the ever-popular LCP, the control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. For peace of mind, a loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication of a chambered round, as well as internal, manual, & magazine safeties. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing.  With its unique Natural Gear Camouflage frame, this Limited Edition LC9 totes a NRA prefixed serial number and provides a donation to the National Rifle Association with each purchase. It also comes with a lifetime repair or replacement warrantee as well as a custom Ruger carrying pouch to protect your “concealed” investment.

The LRP-07 was designed as a .308 platform to cure the shortcomings of existing rifles and still handle like an AR-15. Machined from billet with all the attention to cosmetic perfection that appears in JP's CTR/SCR design, this rifle utilizes a self-folding, left-side charging handle that affords additional leverage and makes it unnecessary to dismount the rifle to charge or clear it. The felt recoil impulse on the LRP-07 is also nothing short of amazing as it was designed from the magazine well up to use JP's Low Mass Operating System (LMOS). Equipped with the JP Modular Hand Guard System, the LRP utilizes their standard 2"" diameter tube (rather than the larger tubes common to .308 platforms) surrounding a JP Supermatch™ barrel available in lengths from 16"" to 22"". Once in your hands, you will find the LRP-07 to be the best rifle in its class—just what you’ve come to expect from JP.

This is exactly what the state wants you to do. They cannot imprison and felonize all holders of ""Assault Rifles"" - it's physically, financially, and legally impossible to do so.

Do not register them either - common sense and history will prove that this registry is for confiscation down the road. Irrefutably guaranteed.

You're going to let your state or government tell you that you can't defend yourself with 30+ rounds of continuous semi automatic fire in the event of an emergency or national/global disaster? That's just silly. It's your life, you should be able to adequately defend it.

Just remember, it will be DHS walking around with ""Assault Rifles"" in an event of a national disaster - do you want to be under-armed if they are not operating ethically towards you or your community?

The out of state FFL's are talking you guys for a ride by undermining the prices of these guns when they purchase them from you. They have to make money as a business, but they also understand your desperate to sell them because you don't want to be a ""felon"".

Stop the nonsense. Stop selling your ""Assault Rifles"". You might need them one day - you won't know when that day comes till it's at your doorstep."

AR-50 Bi-Pod
The APA Bi-Pod is the Bi-Pod of choice for use on the ArmaLite AR-50. It features a solid direct mount, with a wide 17"" wide stance; making for a solid low profile base for both prone and bench shooting.  Adjustable lockable cant, positive screw lock legs with ski feet.  The bipod is crafted from solid steel, and has a rich black oxide finish.
With the legs locked in the rear position, a solid muzzle down stance works perfect for bore cleaning. 

AR-50 Quick Adjust Mono-Pod
The QA Mono-Pod, designed for use on the ArmaLite AR-50 has changed the thinking of Mono-Pods.
A direct bolt on, utilizing the two check piece mounting holes, no modifications to the rifle are required. The QA button on the Mono-Pod body allows you to make a quick gross height adjustment. Then you simply rotate the hand wheel to make your final adjustment with ease from the shooter ready position. Our QA Mono-Pod, when coupled with our AR-50 Bi-Pod makes for an accurate three point contact shooting system.   Competition proven, unsurpassed quality.   

For use on all ArmaLite AR-50 rifles
Allied Precision Arms makes the task of adjusting the recoil pad easier than ever. No longer will you need to fumble with the hard to access Allen bolts. After a simple installation, requiring no modification to your rifle, you are able to adjust the recoil pad without any tools. Move it up to obtain a comfortable shooting position and slide it down for transport and bore cleaning. You just simply slide the recoil pad to the desired 

Cant Lock Extension   
This new accessory for our AR 50 Bi-Pod replaces the existing cant lock bolt. Installation is simple, with the Bi-Pod installed on the rifle just remove the cant lock bolt and replace it with the CLE assembly. Once installed, the rifle can be leveled (a must for long range accuracy) from the shooter ready position. The lever has splines that are easily disengaged to allow the lever to be rotated to a comfortable position for you to use while shooting, and out of the way for transport. Crafted from top quality US made components, finished in Bi-Pod matching black oxide."

“THE JUDGE – Public Defender”; What more needs to be said!?! The newest version of the Judge might just revolutionize small frame revolvers. The Model 4510 delivers the same devastating firepower in a new scaled-down size that can travel with you. The Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. This device is an integral part of the firearm and therefore, cannot be lost. This same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems alike (two keys come with each gun). Available in a carbon steel or stainless steel frame and with the option of a Titanium cylinder, the new Public Defender also features a reduced profile hammer that won't catch when it needs to come out quickly.

Would be great for any small bussiness that needs to wrap their product in a heat shrink plastic.  These sell for thousands of dollars new, look them up.  I am asking 1500 for both the 7121 heat tunnel and the 6301 sealer.  the following link is the specs for the 7121 heat tunnel http://www.weldotron.com/pdf_files/7121%20Series.pdf   and here is a link to the 6301 sealer specs, its not from weldotron as I couldnt get it to load. http://www.packnow.com/el/lseal/weldotron_6301.htm

They are not perfect, they are clean and nothing broke.  These are widely used and parts/supplies are easy to order.

The sealer uses a centraly folded plastic that when an item is inserted you draw it accross the press and it will seal it top and side, then you run the product through the conveyer belt heat tunnel to get that shrink wrapped seal like  they do on most products...that annoying seal you struggle with on DVDs etc.

$1000 is a steal for them together, wont last long, as I am going to list them elsewhere as well.

I will deliver for free in the springs and pueblo area.

DETAILS
Barrel: Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system.   The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested.  The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.
Each upper is assembled to order with care, and test fired. 

***Comes with BCG and Charging Handle***

It is the customer's responsibility to be aware of all applicable laws and regulations regarding purchase and ownership of uppers with a barrel length of less than 16""."
