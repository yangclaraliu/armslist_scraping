On July 2, 2013, over 500 Colorado citizens will engage in an act of mass civil disobedience to demonstrate the foolish, arbitrary, capricious and unconstitutional nature of the HB 13-1224 which will have gone into effect on the day before.

These Colorado citizens will gather in a public park in Aurora, Colorado. Each of these citizens will bring a single unloaded regular capacity magazine of the type that has been in common use in Colorado and nation wide since the 1980s, and which each of them owned and possessed prior to the effective date of the statute. The United States Supreme Court has made CLEAR that law abiding citizens have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms that are in common use. There are millions of such magazines in Colorado, and they have been lawfully owned and used by Colorado citizens for defense, sport, target shooting, competition, and other lawful use for decades. Yet this property will have been transformed overnight into a form of contraband.

At exactly 12:00 noon, these citizens will begin to pass their magazines to each other, one to the other, again and again, in contravention of Colorado's new prohibition against transfer of existing regular capacity magazines.

The number of magazines will not change.

The nature of the people will not change, nor will their non-violent nature.

The fact these people are your friends, neighbors, co-workers, and fellow citizens will not change.

The ""lethality"" of the crowd will not change.

The danger ""on the streets"" will not change.

The number of magazines in circulation will not change.

The fact that the magazines have not been utilized to project violence or do any evil will not change.

At any given moment, each person will be holding one magazine that existed on the day the law came into effect, just as they did when they arrived.

But during the course of this organized civil disobedience, the crowd will be committing over 30,000 misdemeanors per minute. They will do so in direct and defiant challenge of a blatantly unconstitutional law, and will be prepared for arrest. In the event of arrests, each person will refuse to plea bargain and will insist on trial by jury. In conjunction, the gun rights organizations listed below will be assisting these individuals' legal defense, and bringing a constitutional challenge of the law both facially and as applied.

This protest will occur contemporaneously with similar protests in other states where politicians have determined to run roughshod over Constitutional rights in an attempt to make a showing of ""doing something"" about violence, but who lack the courage and political will to take a close look at the mental health system and the systemic failures that resulted from phasing out institutional care while greatly increasing the dispensing of dangerous psychotropic drugs."

You have heard of DoubleStar, right?!
Maybe not. They don't spend as much on marketing as some of the more well known brands.

DoubleStar Corp’s Origin
Many people ask “where did DSC come from?” After 25 years of success with J&T Distributing selling black rifle parts and accessories, Teresa and Jesse Starnes(Double-Starnes’) decided to create a full line of complete weapons to satisfy the thousands of requests to build an AR-15. The J&T Distributing customer base demanded a rifle that incorporated the versatility and quality that J&T had been providing them for so long.

Manufactured in Winchester Kentucky, DSC has continued to supply not only the commercial market but military and law enforcement forces across the world with high quality firearms they can depend on. Every rifle built uses only US made parts, and is built with precision, care, and pride. Each rifle is built, test fired... not just some rifles... all of them.


Differences in AR-15 type rifles?
Some general info provided by an FFL that specializes in black guns...
USGI and/or mil-spec.: 
Commercial parts are made by casting and stamping, which requires weaker, softer steel to do. Parts wear out faster. USGI and mil-spec are forged and milled, much harder steel. And commercial parts don’t always work with mil-spec if you need a replacement, whereas all mil-spec works with all mil-spec. 

The DoubleStar costs more, but it is all USGI, all mil-spec. The DS-4 is a rifle with flattop. It does not come with a rear sight. They do that due to differences in personal preference. 
The DS-4 Comes with magazine and manual. 

The DS-4 bolt and carrier are be far superior to most commercial ARs. Many commercial AR vendors say they have a mil-spec bolt carrier... probably not completely. The DoubleStar is USGI, M16 blueprint (no others can say that), all parts x-rayed and particle tested. Carrier is internally lined for the bolt travel and typically has a chrome firing pin. 

Finish and machining on the DS is far superior to most all manufacturers, and they use a higher grade 7075 aluminum. Most commercial manufacturers use 6061 aluminum, substandard and not mil-spec. 

I can go on and on. Only the billet and really high dollar manufacturers can really even compare to DoubleStar… And if I was to stake my life on it, I would want it to be the DoubleStar…"

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

cfe223
Introduced in January 2012, this versatile spherical rifle propellant incorporates in its formula CFE, Copper Fouling Eraser. This ingredient, originally used in military propellant, greatly deters copper fouling. It contributes to longer periods of top accuracy with less barrel cleaning time. Being a spherical powder, metering is superbly accurate. CFE 223 yields top velocities in many cartridges such as the 204 Ruger, 223 Remington/5.56mm NATO, 22-250 Remington and the 308 Winchester/7.62mm NATO, plus many, many more.

===============
===============
This Adams Arms AR-15 A3 Base MOE Mid Length Gas Piston Upper Assembly is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and comes ready to fire right out of the box upon installation onto any standard AR-15 lower receiver. This Base Mid upper comes equipped with a 16"" melonite-finished barrel, A2 flash hider, bolt carrier group, charging handle, picatinny rail gas block, delta ring assembly and a set of black Magpul MOE polymer handguards. Additional features include a forged A3 flat-top configuration that's ready to accept the shooter's choice of optic and/or rear iron sight, M4 feed ramps to help ensure reliable feeding and functioning during rapid strings of fire, and a mid length gas system for a smoother recoil impulse and longer sight radius. 

The upper's barrel has been finished inside and out with Adams Arms' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered with it due to the uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel. 

All Adams Arms uppers feature a short stroke gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. To ensure that damage doesn't occur to the buffer tube from carrier tilt, the bolt carrier is equipped with enlarged ""skis"" to help guide it into the receiver extension. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to guarantee integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. All piston components are finished in QPQ Melonite for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning/maintenance."

I am basing my prices on cheaperthandirt.com which is a pretty standard website for good deals.   

In this package I am selling...

(4) C - Products Magazines.  These are the best you can buy.  Not cheap plastic or polymer.  All metal, STRONG, and super lightweight.  Great for a tactical rifle or home defense gun.  They have the orange anti-tilt followers.  Don't trust your life to mags with the green followers.  The green followers are known to ""tilt"" inside the magazine making it unable to feed new rounds into the chamber.  (Don't message me saying how you found some crappy magazines for 20 dollars each, expecting me to sell you these for the same price.  These magazines were sold from cheaperthandirt.com last week for $80 EACH and now they are sold out!  

Also included is a metal magazine clamp.  It clamps 2 mags together so that you will have two magazines side by side on your rifle.  When the first is empty, simply eject and shift the ""double mag"" over to the second (full) magazine.  A great way to equip a bedside rifle for home defense.  When you pick your rifle up, you know you have 60 rounds ready to go.  

AMMO included:  

1.) 57 Rounds of BRASS case 5.56 
2.) 30 Rounds of Green Tip 5.56 with steel core.  NATO.  Sold from cheaperthandirt.com for $40 dollars for only 20 Rounds.  (so $60 dollars worth of green tip here)

It holds most any pump action shotgun with at least 3"" between the receiver and the pump forend and can be opened with either a key (included) or it can be wired to a switch for electronic actuation.  
I think these were originally mounted to the shield separating the front seats from the passenger pokey- but the chassis is flat and could be mounted most anywhere with very minor fab. 
Cool piece- perfect for keeping your truck-gun handy-yet-secure. I'm asking $75 OBO or trade (which I think is pretty fair considering the police dept paid around $300 for it!). I've also got some .223/5.56 ammo listed for trade- could be combined with this for a larger value. Shoot me an email with whatever you propose. Thanks."

1964 Thunderbird with the Limited 390 cid engine. The overall condition is pretty good. There are a couple of small dents on each lower front fender (car dolly damage during transport). There is a small spot of rust on the driver side quarter panel near the door. Overall the body is remarkably straight! 
The car was being restored in 2002 until the original owner suffered a stroke and it sat in a Garage for the next Seven (7) years. The car was sold to a coworker who in turn sold it to a Deputy Sherriff in Lake George (This is where I step in). The Engine Compartment was detailed at that time with new AC Lines, Power Steering Lines, Vacuum Lines and Cans, Plug Wires, Power Steering Pump, Hoses, Battery, and lots more. . . The Front Brakes are new (Drums, Shoes, and Cylinders). The Front Wheel Bearings are also new.
When I purchased it, most of the Major Work on the Engine had been completed but it had not been driven much (if at all). I loaded it on a Flat-Bed for the trip from Lake George to Colorado Springs. 
The Interior is Black Leather and in pretty Great Condition for being Original. The motors and regulators on the Windows have been removed to be repaired and are in the trunk.
The Steering Gear Box and the Brake Booster have been rebuilt in Denver Recently. The Steering Flex Coupler has been replaced as Well.
The paint is fair except for a plate sized spot where the paint on the hood was removed. It appears to have been exposed to break fluid during the Brake Rebuild. 
The Car is Essentially Complete with No Missing Chrome or Other Parts. (Pretty Unbelievable in itself)
The Front Tires are BRAND NEW and the Rear Tires are Near New. 

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. . . 
Finally, the Gas in the Tank was Old and had fouled the Gas Tank and the Fuel Sending and Float Unit. I have Purchased New OEM Period Factory Parts (Tank, Sending Unit with Float and Reserve Fuel Light Indicator. These are mounted in the New Gas Tank but the Tank has NOT yet been installed."

This Hornady Custom pistol ammo is loaded with the famous Hornady XTP (Extreme Terminal Performance) bullet. All are supremely accurate, and deliver maximum knockdown power. Hornady produces most of the brass for Hornady Custom pistol ammo. All other brass is chosen to ensure it meets our unusually high standards for reliable feeding, corrosion resistance, proper hardness and the ability to withstand maximum chamber pressures. Each cartridge is loaded to ensure optimal pressure, velocity and consistency from lot to lot. Like the powder, each primer is carefully matched to individual loads, and specifically selected for their ability to quickly, completely, and reliably ignite the powder charge."
