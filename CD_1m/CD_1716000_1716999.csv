Introduction:

The Spike's Tactical LW BAR (2) 12” Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers).
The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR 2 also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling.

But wait, there’s more! The BAR 2 has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA and backed by our LIFETIME WARRANTY!

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Come check it out at The Arms Room in Fayetteville. If you have any questions about this or any of my other firearms please give me a call @ 479-445-six4eight0. Shipping is available to an FFL dealer near you. Thanks again for looking."

My Yugo is a CAI M70ab2 that wasn't built by Century, it was manufactured by Global Trade & Machine and sold by Century. It's well above and beyond in it's manufacture than what Century puts out. It's the version with the 1.6mm receiver, bulged trunions, heavier profile barrel and heavier underfolding stock. Very accurate for an AK47, it's straight as an arrow with no canting of the sights with a perfect barrel bore/chamber. It retains the Bayonet lug with an authentic Yugo Bayonet, and a threaded muzzle with a slant brake on it. Also, it comes with the Yugo sling and a nice single point sling. Original grip and a tapco SAW grip as well.

I saw a similar one sell for around $300, but it was not as old so I assume mine is worth around $350.

I have spoken to bow shop owners who have been in business for 30+ years and they all have told me that they have never seen a bow like this before.
It has the original paint, quiver attachment, sights and is from the late 1960's when compound bows were a brand new idea."

I traded for this rifle over a year ago and I've never shot it. I replaced the scope that was on it with the Nikon...mostly because it matched the rifle and it's a really good scope.

The rifle has Remington's 26"" heavy-contour varmint barrel. It's clean, the trigger is pretty darn good for a factory rifle and it has a Harris-type bi-pod attached. The included bi-pod works well and is solid and steady even though it's a Harris knock-off.

The scope is brand new. Obviously it's been mounted but it's never been used on the gun. I bought it new and mounted it...that's it. The scope will include the box and all manuals, etc... It's amazingly clear and has the 3-circle type reticle of the Coyote line of scopes. It's a BDC (bullet drop compensating) scope with an included ""kill flash"", side parallax adjustment and quick-focus eyepiece. The scope glass is really clear and I'd rank it up there with the Leupold VXII line of scopes for quality. It also has great eye relief at about 3.7"".

I never did get around to replacing the cheap scope mount/rings on the gun...that's the only downside to this package.

I've bore-sighted the scope but, as noted, I've never fired it to get it zeroed. It appears to have been used/fired very little and the gun looks new on the outside.

No trades, please.

I'm selling 200 rounds of .308 Marlin Express ammo new in the box.  I purchased this for my .308 Win and did not realize that I picked up the wrong ammo.  I am just trying to get what I paid out of the ammo.  I have 10 X 20 round boxes that I am asking $30.00 each.  Make me an offer if you want to buy them all.  Thanks

The latest addition to the Hornady LEVERevolution ammunition line is a whole new cartridge named the .308 Marlin Express. This new cartridge was designed for use in the Marlin 336 (.30-30 length) action and uses an improved version of the 160 grain Evolution boat-tail spitzer bullet introduced in 2005 in the .30-30 LEVERevolution load.

Hornady press information makes the following points about the .308 Marlin:

    The most advanced lever gun cartridge ever.
    Performance that rivals the .308 Winchester, but with less recoil.
    The Evolution bullet provides a dramatically higher ballistic coefficient and affords dramatic velocity increases over traditional flat point loads. It also delivers devastating terminal performance over a wide velocity range.
    Advanced jacket/core construction that provides exceptional expansion, deep penetration and weight retention.
    New propellants provide maximum muzzle velocity at conventional pressures for flatter trajectories and greater downrange energy.
    Highest quality cases and primers for consistent shooting in the field."

Also, it was a special model (forget the exact model number) but it was refered to as the GI Collector edition. Aside from USGI parts it came with a collector quality USGI walnut stock. The pictures don't do justice as the stock has a beautiful grain to it - and perfect Defense Acceptance Stamp and P cartouches.

They don't make them like this anymore. This gun was made in December 1995 - not strictly speaking a pre-ban but made before they stopped using USGI parts. Originally it did not have a USGI flash hider with bayonet lug - but it does now.

Also, it was a special model (forget the exact model number) but it was refered to as the GI Collector edition. Aside from USGI parts it came with a collector quality USGI walnut stock. The pictures don't do justice as the stock has a beautiful grain to it - and perfect Defense Acceptance Stamp and P cartouches.

I do pefer a local sale (I am in Fullerton). If it does not sell within a day or two I will ship. I need cash only at this time, no trades - sorry.

This M1A comes with the following for $1350:

This gun is 15 years old but has only had a couple of hundred rounds down the tube. It is mint. You won't find a better M1A for a better price - at least I did not.
