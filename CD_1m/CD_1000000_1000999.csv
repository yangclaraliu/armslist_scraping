Product Description
The Bushmaster C15 Carbines are a unique hybridization of traditional AR-15 type features with space-age Carbon 15 composite molded receivers for light weight and rugged durability. The Carbon 15's lightweight 14.5"" M4 profile barrel is made of chrome-lined chromemoly steel and includes an Izzy flash suppressor pinned and welded in place to achieve 16"" overall barrel length. The barrel and other critical steel parts are manganese-phosphate-finished for corrosion and rust protection. The Carbon 15's safety levers have color-coded markings on both sides of the receiver for quick visual check of firing condition. Package includes a 30-round .223 Remington magazine and a Red Dot Sight. One year Bushmaster warranty.

I have a Smith & Wesson M&P9C with the factory container, a couple of pinky extension mags, and a custom IWB holster for concealed carry. I will trade for either a Walther PPS or a Springfield XDS. I need something slimmer with smaller capacity for a special purpose. Have around 300 rounds through the M&P9C and would like something similar in yours. Could boot a little if I had to.

Free floated Troy 11"" Bravo rail, Troy mil-spec BattleAx stock Kit, not just a Troy stock, but tube, buffer and spring all Troy. Also has Troy Micro Flip Sights, Magpul XTM handstop kit, Mission First Tactical grip, Blackrain charging handle and Noveske K9 Barricade stop. Oh and also has anti-rotation trigger and hammer pin setup from KNS Precision. 

These are awesome rifles. There are 3 Tiers of AR manufacturers. Tier 3 is a commercial/civilian grade AR such as DPMS and CMMG. Tier 2 is a middle grade borderline military and operator specific guns like Bushmaster and Armalite. Blackrain is a Tier 1 manufacturer. Their Platforms an rifles are designed for operator and
Spec Ops use. Other companies like this would be Larue Tactical, Knights Armament & Noveske.

Prior too everything getting impossible to find and prices through the roof this rifle would've run for right around $2,000 after tax and transfer. Adding the extras that I have put on this would've pushed the gun up to if not over $3,000. I am including 2 Lancer Translucent mags with this, brand new in package. I can also throw in a brand new Pelican 1720 case at dealer cost if interested. 

I'm asking $3,000 based on market, prices on Gunbroker and what I've seen these sell for at shows in KC, Topeka, Wichita, St Louis, an Nashville. 

I will consider trades straight across of equal value, or lesser value + cash.

This is a Stainless Steel Semi-automatic pistol chambered in 10mm Auto. If you're not familiar with this caliber just imagine a .40 S&W Magnum; the thing packs a punch. The pistol is built like a tank, with typical S&W quality. It has a Sig style decocker rather than a slide mounted safety. Very good shape, a couple spots where you can see wear but since it's an all stainless gun they're tough to see.  Comes with a case and two magazines.
Update: I got a question about magazine capacity; they're nine round single stack magazines, giving it a grip size and and shape similar to a 1911."

It sports rifle contour and length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of HBar contour (.750 under the front sight base) The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights."

It has a 351 engine, C6 automatic transmission. It has power steering and power brakes(so it stops very good unlike ones without power brakes). 

THE GOOD:
Fully rebuilt Holley 4 barrel carb
Has an Edelbrock performer intake
All new gaskets/seals minus the head gaskets
All new freeze plugs on the engine
New timing chain 
New water pump
New oil pump
New fuel pump

New coolant temp sending unit
New oil sending unit

New alternator
New HEI distributer
The seat has been recovered recently, the carpet looks new and the inside of the truck is clean. 
The truck has a bedliner with a chrome toolbox and bed rails.
The truck also has Michelin LTX M/S tires with aluminum wheels. 
The truck has a tow hitch and is wired for trailer lights.
The exhaust has a nice rumble to it.
The truck has a CD Player

THE NOT SO PERFECT:
Exterior of the truck has some non-major dents and dings.
The paint is chipped in a few places.
It could probably use a paint job before too long.
The A/C is not charged but everything is there to make it work, it came with factory A/C.
The timing is not adjusted 100% right. Once the truck get hot it turns over slow to crank, but it still cranks.
The power steering pump has a slight whine sometime while turning. The previous owner said he ran it low one time when a hose busted.
The plastic door panels on the interior are cracked.
The odometer is broken.

Almost impossible to find this fine piece of history/art with the factory still crippled from hurricane Sandy.

Own one NOW! or wait for who knows how long.

The Henry Big Boy .45 Long Colt is, like all Henry products, ""Made in America, or Not Made at All"". It is a beautifully made weapon. 

The fit and finish of this rifle is second to none. With the brass receiver, barrel band and butt-stock plate, this riffle really is a piece of American art. 

The action is smooth, the trigger pull perfect and this gun shoots accurately right out of the box. 

I would recommend a Henry to any serious gun aficionado, and although it would look good on any wall, it's in the field and at the range where the Henry really excels. 

High praise for an American gun maker who does it right!!!! 

MSRP is 899.00 although they are none available and waiting listing a a mile long. NO gouging here I'll let it go for $775.00 cash local pick up or ground shipping to FFL (ffl only if shipped) is only 35.00 extra.

It is a 12 Guage O/U shotgun with 28"" Barrels and Fixed Chokes (full and mod). Gun is in great condition, it has been shot very little but nonetheless used. It stays locked in my safe when its not being used. ¾ down the barrels on the exterior, there are small light abrasions from fingerprints that were not wiped off years ago. There are a few small dings on the stock and fore grip that are consistent with normal handling. The lock lays slightly to the right as it should. With the Citori ""special steel"" barrels, this gun is safe to shoot steel shot even with the fixed chokes, however, none has been ran through it. The bores are bright and shiny.

This Citori model is stamped “J53” which should tell you what type it is but Browning failed to record this model during manufacturing. I’m not sure how many were stamped this way but there are a few blogs out there annotating the same misprint. This weapon opens, closes, ejects, and fires like a dream.

This is the 629-5 with the case hardened target trigger and hammer. You can see in the close up photo that the trigger and hammer show the darker coloring of case hardening which leaves a dark bluish & gray color to the metal.

Comes in the original box with original manual & lifetime warranty statement.  Stored in a tempurature and humidity controlled safe, not in the foam lined box.

Gun is near perfect, barely a mark on it.  Fired less than 100 rounds.

This gun is surprisingly accurate at 100 yards.  Groups close to 3"" on a benchrest, probably better in a proper vice.

Extras it comes with: (All in new condition) Nice quality cross draw field holster with weather flap, Leupold double dovetail mount, weaver mount & cable lock.  20 round box of Speer Gold Dot 240gr JHP hunting rounds & 35 round box of range rounds.

The 44 Magnum is perfect for deer, wild hogs and many other game animals.  It is VERY effective for a clean deer kill.  Much easier to carry in the woods than a rifle.

Thy have tighter tolerances and fitted better.  The Galil is kinda like an Israel AK. Please call or text REDACTED between 10am-6pm, or email. 

The Galil is hammer-fired and has a trigger mechanism patterned after the trigger used in the American M1 Garand.[2] 
The Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted sheet metal steel receiver, but due to the higher operating pressures of the 5.56x45mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Helsinki.[2] All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block and front sight tower).
The weapon is fitted with a high-impact plastic handguard and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel skeleton stock. The rifle can be used with a sound suppressor. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod. The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

Benelli presents the fastest-shooting, softest-kicking, most reliable lightweight 12-gauge shotgun in the world. The innovative design of this semi auto shotgun raises the standard in firearms technology. Driven by a passion for efficiency and simplicity, Benelli engineers have advanced the cutting edge. The superbly balanced Vinci embodies a new way of looking at shotgun design. The revolutionary new In-Line Inertia Driven operating system, with superior reliability and lightning fast speed, is the simplest semi-auto shotgun operating system ever devised.

Advanced ergonomics assure fluid gun movement. Combine that with the Plus recoil reduction system, and Benelli puts in your hands the world’s softest-kicking shotgun. In recent lab tests, the competition had up to 72-percent more felt recoil than the Vinci. And, its modular design makes Vinci the easiest shotgun on the planet to assemble and disassemble. No wonder it’s named for Leonardo da Vinci, the great Italian Renaissance inventor, artist, and thinker who shattered the technological boundaries of his world. Let the revolution begin.
