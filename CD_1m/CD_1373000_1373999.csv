Because the demand for rifles could not be met by their own industry, France contracted with Remington Arms to manufacture the Model 07/15. For unknown reasons the Berthier's magazine capacity was three rounds while German rifles held five rounds, and British 10 rounds. When World War I began the French quickly realized the problems with the Berthier. The Model 1907 was modified by adding a metal extension to the bottom of the rifle so a five round clip could be loaded. Thus the rifle Model 07/15. It became the primary rifle of the French army during World War I."

This is not a new gun, it has some scratches and dents on the stock and when you take it down you can see that the edges of the barrel are showing paint wear. It is good for a 63 year old gun.
This is a tube feed rifle that I have been told holds 16 shots. I thought it only held 10 so I have only shot 10 through it at a time. Out of 200-250 times I had one jam and that was due to a bent bullet. The sites are straight and it was pretty accurate considering I am not a great shot. 

This is a fun little gun. If you are interested please call or text me at REDACTED and I will call you back. 

I am selling it because I have another .22 that I like better, but there is nothing mechanically wrong with this gun. I am asking $125 or best offer for this rifle."

Serial number traces date mfg date of 1980.  A 33 year old full size government model .45 with the prettiest bluing I have seen short of a Colt or Kimber.  It literally shines.  No rust, clean bore.  I've owned it 5 years and have never fired it.  The man I bought it from claimed he never fired it.  Looking at the internals leads me to believe it is true.  I know these guns have a splotchy reputation, but I owned several of them in the 1970's that always worked good for me.  The picture does not do it justice.  Looks and fits better than any of the knockoff govt models out there right now.  Nice solid wood grips.  1 magazine.  Takes standard 1911 magazines, but my understanding is the internals are different, so no other 1911 parts would interchange.  The magazine with the gun is the original made in Spain that came with the gun new.
I know it's just a Llama, and not a Colt, but it sure is nice.  I don't think you would be disappointed, and it hurts my feelings to sell it.  New baby needs diapers, and doc bills are rolling in. $500 (the newer ones sell for $475 on gunbroker, plus tax, plus shipping, plus FFL fee, and don't look near as good, so no lowballers)

This holster is like new, awesome craftsmanship, here is a quote from their website that describes the holster and how they are constructed.

The Invisi-Tuck Extreme is an adaptation of the Invisi-Tuck (standard) IWB Holster. This holster is well suited for individuals that have difficulty drawing from or concealing with standard neutral or slight cant holster. The Invisi-Tuck Extreme Cant IWB Concealed Carry Holster is American Holster Company’s solution for deep concealment for individualizes that have shoulder problems. It is designed to be comfortable for all-day wear, concealable with a myriad of clothing styles and durable throughout a lifetime of dependable personal protection service. This holster has more cant (about 45 deg.) than a standard FBI cant of 15 to 20 degrees. This is not a SOB (small of the back) holster. This holster is best suited for single stack pistols. The pistols with double stack magazines tend to be too thick to draw properly from this style holster. Because of the way the pocket of this holster is molded to the gun if your Pistol dose not have at least 2″ in front of the trigger guard there will not be enough to keep the gun in the holster. The Back Plate, Pocket and Reinforcement Panel (Invisi-Tuck CCW Holster Parts Identification) of the Invisi-Tuck CCW Holster are all made-to-order and handcrafted specifically for your handgun. Each is made from hand chosen, high quality leather. You won’t find any cheap imitation leather or fancy-named plastic in any of our holster lines. We use top of the line Chicago Screws, not cheap rivets, hand made leather spacers and our belt clips are chosen for their strength and durability. Our 5 step finishing process for the holster edges (trim, sand, dye, burnish, wax & burnish again) is only one example of the craftsmanship and care that goes into each American Holster Company product.

These were German built guns imported by Browning before Sig was licensed and operating in America. This practice occurred in the late seventies into the first years of the 80's. The gun was built under the specifications of the German army contract which specified a bottom magazine release. The theory was the military didn't want their officers dropping clips to the ground and thereby loosing the magazine. The grip has Browning wording on both sides.  One side of the slide says Browning Arms Co Morgan Utah & Montreal P.Q. The other side of the slide has Sig Sauer System Made in W. Germany stamped on the other side. Very unique to have three countries on one piece. I have owned the gun for more than 20 years and have seldom fired it. I would estimate its condition with regards to the finish as 8 on a 10 scale. Mechanically it operates flawlessly. There is no safety rather it has a decock. Fires both single and double action. The gun comes with a fobus paddle holster, three single stack seven round magazines and a magazine pouch. $650 firm. Call or text two 5 six 7 six 2 4 seven 7 five. No paper work required but I request ID and pistol permit at time of sale."

Description: Brookside Memorial Park: Prefer Selling Two (2) adjacent plots near a beautiful Old Oak, in the highly desirable ""Lakeview"" of 680, Spaces 1 & 2. Space #1 is positioned towards the Lake, which is enjoyed by the Ducks and other birds. Brookside Memorial Park is one of Houston's largest and most beautiful cemeteries you will ever come across. It has some of the most beautiful landscape, which consists of enchanting 500+ year old Oak trees, a pond with a calm variety of Ducks, Geese and other birds swimming about. Shade from the trees allow you and your loved ones enjoyment, while visiting the loved ones who reside in this one of a kind cemetery. It is maintained by the staff at Brookside, which I must say they do a great job. It is located off Hwy 59 and Lauder Road. The Cemetery asking price for these beautiful plots (with easy access by the street, no getting out of your car and having to walk some distance to get to your loved ones) is normally over $5,000 each.

We are asking Buy price is $4,000 each, ($7,500 for Both). If you can't afford to pay cash for them, but need to set up some plots for the future, I will consider a trade or combo Trade + 1/2 cash of certain High end Rifles or combination of certain pistols (to be discussed, so let me know what you have to offer) or we will consider Land with utilities near Palestine, Texas. 

If traded, the Trade Value will be $5,000 each or $9,000 for Both . We have other burial places, so this is the reason we are selling. 

Thanks for looking! If trading for guns, Proof of residency required and if the buyer is out of state or needs shipping, then firearm must ship to a FFL dealer in your area and applicable shipping/handling charges will be covered at buyers expense. Be willing to show Texas DL or give DL # from other states and sign a BOS or BOT."

Serial number traces date mfg date of 1980. A 33 year old full size government model .45 with the prettiest bluing I have seen short of a Colt or Kimber. It literally shines. No rust, clean bore. I've owned it 5 years and have never fired it. The man I bought it from claimed he never fired it. Looking at the internals leads me to believe it is true. I know these guns have a splotchy reputation, but I owned several of them in the 1970's that always worked good for me. The picture does not do it justice. Looks and fits better than any of the knockoff govt models out there right now. Nice solid wood grips. 1 magazine. Takes standard 1911 magazines, but my understanding is the internals are different, so no other 1911 parts would interchange. The magazine with the gun is the original made in Spain that came with the gun new.
 I know it's just a Llama, and not a Colt, but it sure is nice. I don't think you would be disappointed, and it hurts my feelings to sell it. New baby needs diapers, and doc bills are rolling in. $500 (the newer ones sell for $475 on gunbroker, plus tax, plus shipping, plus FFL fee, and don't look near as good, so no lowballers)

I'm looking to sell/trade my Taurus Raging Bull .454. It will also shoot .45 Colt (a.k.a. Long Colt). It has a 6.5 inch barrel. This gun is in immaculate condition. Always kept clean and lubed. The factory ported barrel and the Raging Bull grips make this gun fun to shoot without too much felt recoil. This would be a great gun for a hunting sidearm or even your primary hunting firearm. Great shooter for hunting or just having some fun.

The gun comes with about 125 rounds of ammo (mixed .454 Casull and .45 Colt) plus some once fired brass, a briefcase-style locking case, holster, and original box and manual. That's at least $200 in ammo and accessories. 

I'm asking $850 for the whole package. I would also consider trading for the right gun.

Comes with the XD(M) Gear Package  
3.8"" match-grade barrel
Rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite finish
Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System
The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case.

I have a used (about 50 rounds of birdshot/00) shotgun, parked, barrel shroud, light mount under tube, 7 round mag +1 in chamber for 8 round capacity, 6 round side-saddle, GG&G side sling adapter, Knox SpecOps recoil-reduction adjustable stock.  

I know very little about shotguns and purchased this about 5 years ago.  It appears to have started out life as a standard Mossberg 500A (blued receiver), but the barrel was changed to a 20 inch one with a brass bead sight, a 7 round tube magazine was added, and a vented barrel shroud to keep your hands from getting burned on a hot barrel.  A Knox SpecOps recoil-reduction adjustable stock was added as well and this greatly reduces felt recoil when firing even heavy loads.  A TacStar side-saddle (6 rounds) was added as well, and a GG&G side-sling adapter tops it all off.


Now, this shotgun won't win any beauty awards - it is dull grey/parked in most places (though the receiver is a rich, beautiful, almost unblemished dark blue/black), has scuffs, scratches, etc. on the tube and barrel, but it operates flawlessly and goes BANG when you need it to.


Brand new for all of this you'd be looking at over $600.

I will consider a trade for the Chiappa Rhino 2 inch version.  Below is more info about his gun from the manufacture.  

The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic  that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

This came before the Intratec TEC-9 and was designed by Interdynamic AB of Sweden (The Perfered Model). 

Unfortunately as you can see it is damaged and should see a gunsmith before it's fired. The frame is cracked at the magazine well and trigger area but the frame does not feel fragile at all and stays together when disassembling. The action works, the magazines fit and the firing mechanism does strike but that's as far as I will take it.

I have never fired this gun. It will be sold to the highest bidder with the understanding that it is as-is. 

***THIS GUN IS BEING SOLD FOR REPAIR/PARTS ONLY DUE TO OBSERVED DAMAGE TO THE FRAME***

It could be a parts gun or rebuilt but it's up to the buyer to determine it's ability to be *safely* fired.

There are many rare parts that are worth a good amount on this gun & I have heard of people useing epoxy to fix hairline cracks in the tec lower - but I would see a gunsmith.

The difference between this and the Ultra Carry II is that this one has no ramp or firing pin safety.  A lot of 1911 purists love these because of not having the firing pin safety, and as we all know, ramps are just one more thing to cause FTL.  This is widely regarded as an EXTREMELY RELIABLE concealed carry weapon, it goes bang every time no matter what.  It is in great shape, no holster wear or rust/pitting/ect.  Looks just like it should for a weapon that has been meticulously cared for.  Lots of people will tell you they have a hard to find or uncommon weapon, but this particular one is actually hard to find!!!

The ONLY reason I'm selling this is because I started carrying a ""tiny niney"" (a thoughtful gift from my wife) and I have too many pistols to just leave this beauty in the safe. 

YES!!! I have all original items and case it came with.  Here is where all the money starts adding up.....included in the sale are the following:

2 - Kimber brand 7rd Officers SS Magazines
2 - Kim-Pro Tactical 7rd Officers SS Magazines with interchangable footplates
2 - Chip 8rd SS magazines (these stick out some, I kept the defense rounds in these)
1 - Unknown Brand 7rd Officers SS Magazine (was given to me)
1 - MTR Custom black leather OWB holster, perfect fit, only worn at the range twice
1 - box of PMC Bronze .45 to get you started.  This gun will fire absolutely anything but this ammo performs just a bit better than the others, accuracy is wonderful!!!

Everything you need to own this pretty lady is above for a cool $1,250 OBRO


Also, I have PMC Bronze .45ACP in great quantity, the best target ammo for this gun.  $25/box of 50 and if you buy more than 4 boxes I may cut a deal"

The following is from Beeman""The R7 air rifle is, without question, the finest intermediate sporting air rifle available anywhere. We guarantee that once you have one in your hands you will agree, and won't want to put the air rifle down. At just a shade over 6 pounds, the R7 is easy to pack around in the field, or for women and smaller shooters to handle with ease. The gun still packs plenty of punch with velocities reaching 700 fps in the .177 caliber version. The R7 is extremely accurate, and has a very pleasant, smooth firing action; in fact, the R7 is a favored rifle among the Beeman employees and our top dealers."""
