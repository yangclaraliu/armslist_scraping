REDUCED SALE PRICE AND ADD'L INFO:  
$420 for all listed above PLUS a box of 25 shells (00 buckshot) and a box of 5 shells (Remington slugs)!!!  I have $650 plus in this ONCE TEST FIRED gun!  As I consider this shotgun to be a home defense weapon (rather than a range firearm), I will be potentially putting my life and the life of my family in it's hands!  I make it a standard practice to test fire all home defense type weapons I purchase at least once to ensure I didn't purchase a ""lemon"".  I need to know that God forbid I ever have to use it, that I know it will properly rack a shell and fire it.  AGAIN, this firearm was purchased originally by me at Bass Pro Shops and has only had ONE SHELL fired through it!  In addition, I thoroughly cleaned the gun immediately after purchase and then again immediately after the test fire!  You will find a lot of guns listed here that say ""never fired"", however, I myself would rather pay for a firearm that has at least been test fired once and certified that all functions at 100%...especially when purchasing from a private party!  

This isn't my first Remington 870 and it will definitely not be my last!!!  Earlier this year I sold another 870 that I had owned for at least 20 years and it was just as sweet when I sold it tas it was on the day I purchased it.  I didn't want to sell that gun and hate selling this one at such a loss but with the economy and some major medical bills that have plagued our family this year, I need the money worse than the gun.  I hope someone will enjoy it, but never really need it.  If you have never owned a 870, you are sure missing out!  In my opinion (as well as the opinion of most local, state, and even federal law enforcement) the 870 is the best, most reliable, and quality made 12 gauge pump shotgun on the market today!  We have 3 police officers (all working for different police/sheriff's departments) that live on our street and they all carry this same shotgun in their squad cars.  3 streets over from us is a recently retired SWAT trained officer from Dallas Co. and he says 870's are the only shotgun he would ever carry and the only one he owns personally as well!"

1. Price is negotiable, within reason. (i.e. if you message me saying 800 dollars plus food stamps and/or any sort of derelict vehicle you will be 1. ignored 2. heckled)

2. I'm not looking to trade. I'm looking for cash.

3. I will not ship to places that I cannot ship to and I will only ship to an FFL.

Let's get to the nitty gritty:

I bought it from a gentleman in houston who took absolute pristine care of it and I made sure to do the same. The gun has around 500 rounds through it and fires like an absolute dream. I cannot believe how much I love the 5.45 bullets. No wonder spetsnaz uses them, very light recoil with incredible precision. I had 7.62x39s for a long time but I dont think I'll go back.

two advantages to this gun:
1. 5.45 Ammo is seriously cheap, and I'm throwing in some free rounds (not the bad kind either, the zinc Silver Bear ammo.
2. It is, saving all salesmanship, hard to find a Saiga with this color scheme and in this condition.
3. Comes with a ~370 dollar scope (Leupold 3x9)
4. These mags are very hard to come by and the gun comes with 3. 

Full Specs:


• Caliber: 5.45 x 39.5 mm 

• Total Length: 927 mm (36 1/2 in.) 

• Barrel Length: 415 mm (16.3 in.)

• Maximum Range: 1,350 m (1,480 yds)

For example lights, lasers, grips, or lots of other attachments. I also like it because itï¿½s a little different than every other standard A2 rail out there on the firing line.

It comes with 2 30 round magazines. One is a Windowed pmag, and the other is a Thermold, and is marked LEO and Govt use only.ï¿½ It will also come with a Blackhawk Tactical sling, and a carry padded carry case.

This gun  was purchased new by me And I have all the original paperwork, receipt, lock and box. This Gun came in a smith & wesson cardboard box so I went on the website and ordered a new S&W hard case for it which I will include along with 3 new crisp boxes of hornady critical defense ammo and a new speed loader(please view the three pictures that I have posted).  These guns are fast becoming  hard to find due to ccw demand. Remember you are not having to pay sales tax and transfer fees. 

I am not looking to trade, also I will not deliver the firearm to your home, it is not a pizza. You are welcome to pick it up at my place( I live in a nice quiet suburb) or I can meet you during the day at a public location if it is not too far out of my way, ( I am available to meet in the mornings.

Only serious inquires and please no low ball offers this is a new S&W not a cheap Rossi or Taurus revolver.

The GLARE® MOUT is a non-lethal visual disruption laser (dazzler, ocular interruption device [OID]) ideally suited for small-arms weapon integration as well as mobile crew-served applications. When a suspect individual approaches a restricted or controlled area, the GLARE MOUT is able to hail and warn that person before shots have to be fired. Its shockingly bright green dazzler beam sends an irrefutable, multi-lingual, cross-cultural message that “you mean business”. Reports confirm that the GLARE MOUT has saved numerous lives of both soldiers and non-combatants in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

The GLARE MOUT is compact and lightweight and is already approved for use by all branches of the U.S. Armed Services.

The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG's black Nitron finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit.

Higgins line and was called the Model 44 DLM .22 lever action rifle. This is a 1969 that was built for the 1970 100th anniversary of Marlin. It has a gold medallion inlaid into the butt stock. This is the Marlin 57M that was built from 1959 to 1969 in .22 magnum and features a 24"" microgroove barrel which is tube fed that holds 15 rounds with a very smooth action. The 57 (.22LR) was built from 1959 to 1965 but the 57M (.22magnum) was built for 4 more years. This rifle is in very good condition and in perfect working order. It has been completely taken down cleaned, polished, oiled and shot this weekend.  With a tube magazine holding 15 rounds and the lever that only moves 1.25"" to completely cycle the rifle, you can really put bullets on target in very short order.  (With practice you can make people think you're firing a semi-auto rifle).  A high quality Bushnell Sportview 3X9 power scope mounted on it The scope is zeroed for 150 yards. The scope is mounted high rings so you can use iron sights for targets at 25 to 50 yards. Marlin did not build any of the Model 57 rifles with a serial number so this rifle has no serial number.  This lever action rifle is in wonderful condition and is quite rare.  It marks the 100 years of Marlin in 1970.  

I am asking $625 for this rare rifle and will include 50 rounds of CCI Maxi-Mags at my asking price. Any price negations will result in the ammunition being taken out of the deal to start. This is a great varmint rifle with a 15 ROUND CAPACITY!!! Contact me through the contact seller's link with your name and phone number and I'll get back with you. I will also provide the latest target to prove it's accuracy. Thanks, for looking."

This model is primarily used for advertising, however, it is easily used as a tv and pc monitor.
It has HDMI inputs which is very typical for modern electronics.
I use one of these for my Xbox 360 and my Desktop(1 tv, 2 appliances)

The ONLY downside is that this particular model does not come with a stand in the box.

HOWEVER, this decision was made by Samsung to keep costs down to the consumer by allowing many mounting and setting options to be applied.

Im asking $500, it normally goes for $1000+(before shipping). With the money you save, you can buy a mount or a stand and apply it however you would like.

Its brand new, in-box, box was only opened to check for remote and cables, and it put back in box.
Also, have one entirely unopened. 

Half off MSRP is a ridiculous deal. You wont find many comparable HDTVs with the same build quality, features or specifications."

The phrase, “one of a kind” is vastly overused, but I am sorely tempted to use it here!! I was taught to be afraid of guns when I was young. As I grew older, I began to understand that guns are really a tool with a purpose like any other tool. However, this pistol transcends the definition of “tool” by a wide margin. You won’t know whether to hug it or shoot it! It is petite, beautiful and concealable with the awesome knockdown power of a .45. This is the first one I’ve seen in more than six months and I hate to let to from my inventory. I’m going to list it for a couple of days and if I can’t sell it to someone who appreciates it like I do, I’m just going to keep it!! This is a huge discount from MSRP for a gun of this quality/rarity. Here’s your chance!!!
