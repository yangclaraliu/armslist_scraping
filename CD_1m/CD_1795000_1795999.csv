 Ok I'm just throwing this out there to see what is offered.....,

 I know what I have and what the MINIMUM it will bring on any gun auction....

 Bottom end would be $2200.00 to $5k for first type gun explained in ad could go as high as $20k by what I read about the other 5 rare Randal's like this and what they sold for.... 

 I have a very rare Randal SS 1911 .45 ACP
 this was given to the Chief of police in Anchorage Alaska on loan to try out as a personal carry piece.
 I have ALL the paperwork on the gun and receipt showing this.
 is in 9/10 condition

 this is a round top, fixed sight, .45acp, NO RF in front of S# which also shows it is the 15th gun made if you read in the link

 this link helps anyone who wants to do more research, copy and paste in your address bar 

 PLEASE ASK FOR LINK< CAN NOT POST IT IN AD SORRY ""( ????

 Look in the rarities at the bottom of the page to understand more about what I'm talking about, #6 has the letter C behind the S#

 Now with the S# of this gun it can be one of 2 guns...........

 The First Is ...
 IT IS The 15th gun ever made by Randal...!!!!!
 I have 100% proof of this clear to what date is on the receipt given to the Chief....

 Second it could be 1 of the 5 guns give to off duty officers as a trial off duty carry piece....
 again receipt states this....

 I have a main person in the yearly blue book gun pricing guide looking into this one,
 in the link at the bottom it talks about Steve, I got ahold of him and he is looking into the gun to see if it was one of those 5 guns.... made for off duty carry pieces....
 if it turns out to also be the second type of gun I have mentioned then we are talking it is one of 5 guns in the world of only 3,400 guns ever made by Randal...

 there are collector/s out there looking for the missing 3 guns, it talks about the 2 known in the link.

 Randal was the first SS High-End 1911 gun ever made, and was the first to ever make a left handed 1911.

 as I said Randal only ever made 3,400 guns and that is in ALL of their models
 and being the 15th gun ever made by them, makes this a Top Shelf collectable piece...
in the shape and grade this gun is in.

 If you collect 1911's this is a once in a lifetime chance at owning this rare of a Randal.

 if it turns out to be the second type Randal, I will end up putting it on a major gun auction. It could reach up to $20k
 but right now I'm looking at offers, Steve is finishing up the blue book publication for this yr right now and will get back to me in the next couple weeks when he finds out more about if it is one of the 5 firearms....

 So lets talk....... NO LOWBALL OFFERS PLEASE..... I won't even write back
 this has a chance at being a very very very expensive collectors piece
 right now it is a expensive piece/collectors handgun
 just being the 15th gun made by the Randal company
 I know there are Randal collectors out there that look for just this type of handgun
 I hope I find one on here lol"

I had Colt research and purchased the cerificate from Colt authenticating it. It was shipped to New York, New York in Nov of 1883 and the serial number is in the 17,000's of 22,690. Exact details can be provided upon purchase. This gun is in pretty good condition considering it being well over 100 yrs old. I've included a link providing a detailed description and history on the gun. Just copy it and paste into your browser. My gun has every feature described by Larry Potterfield and has what the certificate says as $85 dollars of extra features including a dolls head rib extension and that's 1883 dollars.
Price is $2000. I can send more pictures at request. I will consider other offers just no trades or lowballs please.


The Colt Model 1878 double-barrel shotgun is chambered in 10 or 12 gauge with a 28, 30, or 32 inch barrel in a brown Damascus-type pattern. They have sidelock double-trigger hammers, and have case-colored locks and breeches. The walnut stock is checkered and can have either an oil or vanish finish. The barrel rib has Colt's Hartford address and the lock has Colt's name. A fully engraved gun can have a 300% increase in the values shown below.

This shotgun has been regarded as one of the finest made in America. However competition from cheaper European imports of the day hurt sales.

22,690 were made between 1878 and 1889.

Retail values for the Model 1878:

Very Good: $4,500
Good: $2,250
Fair: $750
Poor: $300

I hope this helps.

I TRASHED IT AS SOON AS I GOT HOME ). The rifle also have Picatinny rail i installed, and tactical rings. With the Tasco scope, I have no problem to shoot 1/4 of a dime size at 15 yards ( see the pics ). And I think I'm lucky to pull of the shelf the most accurate Gamo Silent Cat, because sometimes you'll get a lemon. This rifle shoots consistent groups with different type of pellet, as I tried so far with 
*Crossman's :Pointed, Hollow Point, and Destroyer  
*Gamo: PBA Raptor Gold & Titanium, Red Fire, Terminator Hollow Point, Rocket Superior.
And the results were excellent. Maybe the POI are different , but all the pellets went almost the same hole. All the targets in the pic were 3 shot group each. 
I've shot more than 7 squirrels so far, and uncountable amount of crows at my backyards. They were invaded my bird feeder and I had to take care of the business by my way. None of those animals was get away after I locked them in my crosshair. Please note that this Gamo has a legal silencer at the muzzle  which reduces up to 52% noise. And this gun is very very quiet, and city-limit friendly. So, you don't have to worry about disturb or attract attention your neighbors, and later the cops will show up at your door in moment as they thought you had just shot a .22 ( all the air guns out there are freaking loud as 22. This gun is not. And this gun is very powerful, absolutely not a toy. 1000fps with lead pellets and 1250 with PBA pellet. 
Now, all the squirrels and crows are gone. I don't know that I killed them all, or they're just moved to different locations because they didn't never see their buddies, or their family members come back home after they crossed over my property. So, I don't need this air rifle anymore as the mission is successfully accomplished. 
If you have a same problem as I had, and want to get rid of those bastards, for small game hunting or just looking for a rifle for your children, or yourself to plink around with cans and targets. This gun is definitely what you need. Plus, all the pellets I used are plentiful and affordable at Walmart
I spent almost $300 for the gun, scope, picatinny rail, rings. So, I'd like to get some of the money back. How about $150? Is it sound like a deal to you? Also, you will received all the pellets I have left over ( A LOT, WITH DIFFERENT BRANDS ) FOR FREE.
Call or text REDACTED if you're interested and have $150 cash for me. PRICE IS FIRM AND I WON'T TAKE LESS THAN A PENNY. YOU KNOW $150 IS A STEAL FOR A SHOOTER LIKE THIS.

This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years"

It has the short reset trigger so when firing in single action, the trigger pull is very crisp at about 3-4  pounds and resets after about an 1/8"".  It is a great gun and virtually in brand new condition.  It has a steel frame so it's not light like the aluminum alloy framed 229's and absorbs a great deal of recoil.  This gun is a great shooter and it has night sights installed.  Comes with a blackhawk Serpa holster (right hand), factory box and paperwork and original rosewood grips.  The aluminum grips pictured do not come with it unless of course you want to work something out.  I also have 4 extra mags that I can include for an additional charge, 2 meggar 15 round and 2 Sig 17 rounders.   This gun is impossible to find right now and sells for almost 1,300.00 new plus tax and background check.  Looking to get $1,100.00 obo for it and willing to negotiate on the other grips and mags as well which I have about 400.00  into or else I will sell them seperately.  The gun is in immaculate condition.  I keep records on rounds fired through all my guns and this one only has 300 rounds through it.   I've posted 2 stock photos from Sig...one shows the specs of the gun and the other one shows a picture of the gun with the rosewood grips and the other picture shows the actual gun as it's setup now with the aluminum grips."

This is possible due to the side-folding stock of shaft design that makes it more compact. The 12.6-inch barrel is also relatively short for the 7.62×39mm cartridge. The operating mechanism does not require a gas expansion chamber at the muzzle as in the AKS-74U to ensure reliable functioning, but does use a specially designed muzzle brake, which reduces muzzle flash, but makes the weapon louder.

All cases are once fired, cleaned and full length sized with RCBS Match dies on a single stage press. Each case undergoes trimming on a lathe with a 3 way carbide cutting head. Then the case is moved to the primer pocket cutting head where it flat bottoms the primer pocket and cuts the depth to recess the primer .003 to avoid slam fires. From there all cases go to the prep station for final inspection, debuuring the flash hole and internal brush cleaning. Cases are hand primed with Federal 205 match primers. Cases move to the powder fill station where each case is hand weighed with the exact powder load on a balance beam scale. Charged cases go back to the press to hand load each 75gr Match King to the exact length/ogive on a RCBS Match Seating die. Final quality control comes on the Case Master to correct runout between bullet and casing to center line the cartridge with the chamber and bore.

Includes the pistol, one factory 9 round mag, one factory 10 round mag, the factory speed loader, three back straps, cleaning kit, documentation and spent casing, factory plastic carry case, and the factory cardboard box.

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction)."

What a great vehicle! 112k miles, dual power sunroofs, seating for 7, multi-disc CD player, heated leather seats, digital compass in mirror, etc. This Rover is loaded. No problems whatsoever aside from the Check Engine Light always being on. I was told when I purchased this from a foreign car mechanic that the reason behind that is because he took out the air suspension and so that being said you have just regular suspension which should lead to less problems down the road anyhow. Sweet ride all together. I will hate to see her go but I need something a bit more fuel efficient.
