This is an all-black Beretta in good condition. There are four variants of the Beretta Model 92, the Model 92G (Grenadier) is the most difficult of the four versions to find for sale. This version was manufactured for a branch of the French military (Grenadiers, hence the name). The 92G has minor signs of wear with no major dings, dents, or scratches. The pistol itself functions flawlessly. I have never had a round jam or smoke-stack. It comes with one magazine and a holster as well as 50 rounds of 9mm ammo. (If you go online to gunbroker.com, gunsinternational.com, auctionarms.com you will find very few Model 92G's for sale with all of them ranging in price from $600-$1000, depending on condition).

I love this gun! This XD .45 is in Like-New condition. I have shot less than 500 rounds through it since the day I purchased it. There are almost no signs of wear, with absolutely zero dings, dents ,or scratches. The XD .45 gives the shooter the best of both worlds; knock-down power (.45 ACP) as well as fire-power with its high-capacity mags. When you hold the XD .45 it just feels right in your hands. Balanced with minimal recoil for a .45. It comes with 2 mags and holster.

So here you have it.... Like new Aimpoint CompM4 M68 CCO.  Includes killflash and flip up caps as well as the standard lens covers.  Also included is a UTG 3X Magnifier. Unlike the EOtech, the Aimpoint CompM4 is great not only for close quarters, but long distance as well!

Some info on the CompM4:

The CompM4 sight features an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring, and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of weapon systems. Can run continuously on a AA for 8 years. 

Designed for 3rd generation night vision technology
The CompM4 sight can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility.
The performance of CompM4 sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology.

The clearest, brightest image possible
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).

Ready for use around the clock
With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 sight is ready for round the clock use.

Unique features of the CompM4
High battery compartment

Unique features of the CompM4 and CompM4s
Compatible with every generation of NVD
ACET technology allows up to 80,000 hours (over 8 years) of daytime operation on one AA battery
Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery
7 NVD settings and 9 daylight settings
QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation and lower the risk of snagging on other gear
Mount base is keyed into to the body of the sight to absorb recoil
Mount base screws directly into the sight – no separate sight ring required.
500,000 hours of use on NVD setting
2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement
Matches perfectly with Aimpoint® 3XMag
Unequalled light transmission
Front lens opening is threaded for addition of killFlash® anti-reflective device
Submersible to 150 feet (45 meters)
Vertical spacer included
Type classified as the U.S. Army’s new M68CCO
Improved adjustment caps are easier to remove and protected against impact
Can be used with a carry handle adapter for use on all M16 rifles
Mechanical switch for speed and reliability

Smith recently raised their priced about 10% due to the firearm shortage, and goes for about $600 brand new. I'm asking $75 less than that and No sales tax of course, Uncle Sam gets enough of your money, save it here.

I am a firm believer in capitalism, but this goes beyond maximizing profit for me. All serious shooters should be working together against the people who are trying to repeal the 2nd amendment, not feeding off each other's circumstances. I am tired of hearing people say they would love to take their child or grandkid shooting, but can't afford or even find ammo. I was able to get by Palmetto State Armory today- they have it for $24.99 a box plus tax, which makes it $26.74 total per box. I'll mark it up a $5.26 to pay for time and gas and sell you a box for $32, or two boxes for an even $60. Sorry, trying to help all I can, so 2 box maximum. When I seel these I'll see what else is available and reasonable and offer the same or similar deal.

The FN FNS-9 is the latest handgun innovation by FN Herstal.

 The FNS pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism together with an optional manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety.

 Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate.
Fast and Accurate Shooting
The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.
The FNS has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.
The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy."

This is a P-64 9mm Makarov pistol, and is in excellent conditionm with near perfect bluing. (A little holster wear by the crown) This semi automatic pistol takes 6 round magazines, and is a double action/single action, with a manual safety which doubles as a decocker.

I've had the trigger polished by a gunsmith, and had the double action spring replaced with a lighter spring to facilitate the double action pull - the stock spring is really too stiff for double action. However, I still have the stock spring, which is included. 

The gun comes with the original holster, two ""pinky rest"" magazines, the original cleaning rod, and the stock hammer spring. I'll also fill up the magazines with hollowpoint defense rounds, so you can carry it right away. 

I carried this for 2.5 years, and its still the lightest, smallest pistol I've ever carried. I bought a $10 dollar fabric holster which I carried it in the entire time, and it worked great. It's also small enough for pocket carry - just decock it, and you are good to go."

I am the owner of Gormark LLC, a licensed dealer. They may be using my license - and they may provide you an email like ""REDACTED"" It's a scam! They are using my license to further their scheme.

This is quite possiby a Nigerian scam. The ATF is working on it, but really it's a mail fraud scheme and the USPS has the real jurisdiction. 

If you have had dealings with any of these people please email me at REDACTED (my real email address). I will add you to the case. Also, please contact your local Postal Inspector to open a mail fraud complaint (conspiracy to commit is a crime, too, so you need not have actually sent payment) and possibly your local FBI office. Paula Cruz is a real person in Long Island, NY (ATF has spoken with her) but she has a good ""innocent"" sob story so they likely will not be able to do much unless more evidence flows in. I believe Victor Antoine is a real person also, and is part of this conspiracy.

I know of at least two true victims who are out respectively over $700 for guns that didn't even exist.

Ads by these scammers have been flagged many, many times at Armslist and yet they continue. PROTECT yourself! Check all listings by the user. If they are listing items from multiple states it's a scam! Only send payment to a licensed dealer and contact the dealer first to make sure that this person is a known customer!

Screw these scammers! They are only making it harder for us gun owners (yes, gun enthusiasts and gun ""lovers"" to continue our tradition/sport/livelihood in these troubled times).

ARMSLIST IS DOING NOTHING TO STOP THESE SCAMS! IP ADDRESSES CAN BE TRACKED AND FLAGGED!

Be very careful on this site. Only deal locally is my advice, unless you can verify with the sender's FFL that the gun exists (and only send payment in care of the verified FFL).
