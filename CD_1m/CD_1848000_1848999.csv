Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SLR-101S. This 7.62×39 mm rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SLR-101S is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SLR-101S rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.
Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver:
Each SLR-101S receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.
Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.
SLR-101S Features:
100 percent new-production parts and components.
Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier and double-hook trigger.
Cold hammer-forged 16.3-inch barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology.
Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber.
Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14×1 mm left-hand threads.
AK scope rail.
Intermediate length US-made 10-inch trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4 inches.)
922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines.
Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.
Specifications::
Caliber: 7.62×39 mm
Weight: 8 pounds
Barrel: 16.3 inches chrome-lined, 4-groove rifling, 1:9.45-inch twist

This rifle has been very well taken care of and has had alot of work done. I personally would say it is on the higher end of the spectrum of converted saigas in terms of components used and work done(reliability). In the case of the saiga rifles, converted means it has been physically converted from its sporting rifle configuration(rifle stock, no pistol grip, standard trigger group) to the AK type configuration(AK configured stock, AK pistol grip, AK trigger group,). This is done by physically cutting the existing rifle stock tang and replacing it with an internal AK stock adapter as well as grinding/drilling(depending on your method) off existing pins/rivets.There are non conversion methods of attaching a pistol gripped stock, but in my opinion most tend to look and feel wonky due to the odd alignment of the stock to the receiver. There are many different ways to go about doing this conversion, not all of which are handled properly. This conversion was handled properly and its function attests to the work done. If you have any further questions or want to see more pictures please let me know.

Bolt carrier has had just a few touches to smooth out the action a bit, but most wearing in is still in the process as I've only had maybe 150 rounds max through it.

This rifle will cycle any ammunition you put through it given the proper gas setting. If you are unsure of how to operate the gas settings I can give very simple instructions as well as you can find them everywhere on the internet including MD Arms' website. The receiver does not have any deformitites from use and both front and rear trunions are in perfect shape. I have shot a wide mix of ammunition through this rifle with zero failures. I have run a few 3"" 00 buckshot on the proper gas setting to see how it would handle, but primarily have only run 2 3/4 low and medium brass 00 buckshot and mixed birdshot. For 2 3/4 buckshot and birdshot, only a single setting is needed without worry of damage to your receiver or trunion. You CAN use 3"" magnum loads, however it does put more stress on the receiver and the trunions so be aware of your gass settings for high powered ammunition.

It will come with original case, paperwork, lock, the two extra back straps and three 15rd glock factory mags. Also trigger guard has been professionally undercut to allow you to get a higher grip purchase. I am only looking to trade for a few things that I will list below all other offers will be ignored and I'm not interested in cash. The only reason I want to trade is that I carry this regularly and now that it is summer the gen4 grip is rubbing me the wrong way literally. I'm not looking to add any cash the gen 4 is about $100 to $150 more that the gen 3 and its worth it for the reduced recoil due to the double recoil spring.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military Colt M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30.5 in (77.5 cm) in length and weighs only 6.8 lb (3.08 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's Law Enforcement Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. LE6920 comes equipped with a Magpul MBUS backup sight.

Handgun is in ""Like New Straight from Box"" condition and has only had a total of 50 rounds fired through it.  Send me an email, text message, or call me at REDACTED.

This is a full size semiautomatic handgun which comes standard with a picatinny rail on the bottom which is perfect found mounting a light or laser straight out of the box.  

This is a remarkably well built handgun that is supposed to be the ""clone"" of the more expensive Beretta 92FS.  I've owned and shot the Beretta 92.  After buying this gun, I sold my Beretta 92FS the very next week because it did not compare to the balance and accuracy this Taurus has.  I purchased this handgun less than a few months ago and it came with a 17-round magazine.  I am throwing in the additional 2 magazines I purchased for this handgun.  I am also throwing in the high quality Bulldog brand tactical range bag that I have been storing it in.  

Handgun is in its originally packaging, comes with a total of three (3) magazines that consist of a 17-round magazine and two 15 round magazines, the original box, owner's manual and Taurus' special custom firearm lock.

Feel free to call me to set up a time to come see the firearm before you make a decision on making your purchase.  I have no doubt that you'll buy it on the spot. 

This is a great gun! It eats any ammo you throw at it and begs you for more.  

THIS IS ONE OF THE *EASIEST* HANDGUNS I'VE EVER HAD TO DISASSEMBLE AND CLEAN

A little history on this gun:
This is Taurus' copy of the Beretta M9/92 handgun. This is the same gun design used by the U.S. Military for over 30 years. Taurus purchased the Beretta factory and license to modify, upgrade, and manufacture the 92/99 handguns. The 99 has adjustable rear sights as well. Bought during the ""flurry"" of gun buy ups in Dec. 2012.  With their goal to take the well-made expensive Beretta 92 and just copy it, they ended up improving the design of the firearm and reducing the cost for everyone.  

An amazing gun, and beautiful in Stainless. E-mail me for pix.

Great gun, eats any ammo you throw at it. comes with a 17 round mag (Hi Cap). For those who know, it's essentially a beretta m9- Taurus bought the factory in Brazil (machines&all) from Beretta and only changed a few things (added rail, safety).

Product Details:
In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

Should you make the right decision and decide to purchase the last 9mm you'll ever own, with my asking price comes the opportunity for you to purchase, at ""off the shelf"" retail price, a total of two (2) Remington® UMC 115gr 9mm Pistol Ammunition Mega Packs. (2 packs of 250 rounds each for a total of 500 rounds)  You would just have to cover the cost of the ammunition and I have the receipts from Cabela's where I purchased them for $79.99 plus tax each.

Finally the best Military MOLLE Pack has arrived! This is the most complete, inventive pack we have ever seen, loaded with custom design features that meet and match all environments and applications.

This pack integrates Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE) designs. Every feature of this pack has been carefully engineer for both versatility and adaptability. 

Main Compartment is 20"" tall, 19"" wide and 12"" deep with four quick release straps to hold the load in place. Dual nylon mesh pockets with zippers, MOLLE webbing, dual covered vent holes on the top for radio antenna or bladder tube. Oversized, hook & loop fastened, covered center hole for antenna or pole. This main compartment is surrounded by four self-healing zippers providing the maximum in accessibility. Any zipper can be moved to allow access from the top or either side or split wide to facilitate initial pack loading. 

Outer Upper compartment opens with dual zippers and is 14"" tall, 12"" wide and 3"" deep. There is a key holder, three document pockets, pen and calculator pockets and dual bungee cords that tie down and adjust with hook-and-loop to provide the maximum load retention and stabilization. This pouch is covered with MOLLE straps and offset with dual gussets so the attached MOLLE accessories do not need to conform to the contour of the loaded pack. A hidden zippered compartment rests beneath the outer compartment and is perfect for maps, documents or charts.

Lower Outer Compartment is dressed with more MOLLE straps and continues with the same dual self-healing zippers. Inside mesh pouches will secure your small items. An auxiliary zippered mesh pouch secures your valued items and keeps them within quick reach. 12.5"" wide, 6"" tall and 3"" deep.

Dual Side Pouches with MOLLE webbing outers and dual self-healing zippers 9"" tall, 5"" wide and 2.5"" deep, perfect for ammo, magazines or water bottles.

Top carry handle, side balance carry handle and compression straps. The attention to detail is so fine that each piece of strap webbing has a hook-and-loop keeper to roll up excess straps and keep your pack and appearance in top form.

Fully Adjustable shoulder straps with quick release buckles and padded back rest with raised contour pads to prevent fatigue. Padded lumbar support with adjustable waist support for even load distribution. Clever design allows this waist belt support to be removed to cut weight and tighten the packs' profile for air or ground transport.

Rigid hidden pouch is beneath the padded back with access granted by a full length zipper, padded support and provides another perfect storage area for documents or your pressed dress shirts by providing both separation and support to the stored items."

This was manufactured prior to having the internal lock system placed on all guns therefore it's considered a ""prelock"" among collectors. Very light powder residue on the face of the cylinder and in the cone area and a very faint drag mark on the cylinder.

This particular model also has a recession so a star can be placed in the cylinder. I've found after researching there aren't many 642 prelocks out there that have this feature. The use of the star, however, is an option and not neccesary for operation.

Everything from the factory is included. Manual, stars, original grips, case,etc.

I have a rare S&W model 547 Revolver chambered in 9mm Luger. These revolvers are very scarce as they were never produced to be released stateside as they were made for the French Military but after S&W completed production and was about to ship them the contract was canceled thus they were then sold stateside to the civilian market. These have a very unique design in that the cylinder face has a spring loaded extraction system (see pics) so moon clips are not needed to fire the 9mm cartridge. This gun is close to perfect and is as new retaining 98% of it high polish blue finish. I have only fired one cylinder out of it and previous owner who bought it new in 1982 stated he shot no more than 20 rounds through it so its as close to new as you could possible get. It is currently wearing pacameyer grips but originals can be found online just about anywhere from $40-$100. These revolvers have been selling for between $1200-$1700 in gunbroker which is were this gun will be headed if it doesn't sell by Sunday. Will ship to FFL and accept discreet paypal as payment or face to face transaction at a local gun shop. E-mail, Call, or Text REDACTED"

It is loaded with everything you need to hit the water., 2009 Mercury 9.9 motor, as new, pump, oars, tank, everything. It is a BLAST !!! 
There’s a reason the Navy SEALS use Hypalon RIB’s as does the Coast Guard for rescue missions,,,,,they are TOUGH, they are nearly unsinkable and draft very little water. They can carry a ton of weight and go anywhere. This RIB is carried to the water in my Yukon, in it’s own bag, or on it’s trailer. The floor is rigid, just like a boat, so it’s very tough, easily beached without harm. I use this on local lakes and also down at the beach on the ICW and on nice days you can hit the open ocean !!! Fishing off the RIB is easy. You can go where no one else can, explore remote locations and beach at secluded beaches no one else can get to!
 This set up was  $5,520.00 new, WITHOUT the trailer and used less than 15 times. About $6,300.00 WITH the trailer !

 Again, look at the Navy SEAL and Rescue boats, they use RIB’s !!!

I bought a trailer to make transport even easier ! Then I customized it to also haul the Mercury 9.9 so as to avoid the hassle of putting it in the car trunk, the motor just mounts to the front of the trailer. 

Price is $4,500.00, no less, for everything. I’m looking for guns, ammo and a safe.
 I would also consider a street bike on trade.

If the RIB is so great, why am I selling it ???? I have a 22’ Stingray and I just inherited a mint 18” 1964 Chris Craft and a 16’ Bass boat. I only have so much room /time for boating."

This is a Firearms Training System that was used by the military.
It is used.
It has three training units.
I was going to use these units for training people for their Concealed Weapons Permits and provide supplemental training for police officers.
These have been in my possession for about six to seven months.  You are getting ALL three units, the two evaluation printers, the three training units, near 50 lbs. of wiring and about 20 optical scenario disks.  These disks are about the size of a 33 1/3 rpm song album.  I have talk to the company that put these out and they tell me they are still supporting these systems.  They also told me that they would provide support for these units.  The scenarios are various and include many different situations.  The units are PIONEER.

It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. Five 30 round DS magazines and one 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with Vortex Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. Folding iron sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including M9 Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle.

Buyer pays all shipping and fees via U.S. Postal Money Order only. NO PAYPAL. J.L.D.

And by that, I mean MAKE AN OFFER. Don't  e mail me asking what's the lowest I will go on the price. Tired of the dreamers and time wasters out here, it's worse than Craigslist. If you only want to spend 800 bucks on a gun, then go buy an AR 15. The only trades I would consider would be for a Colt M1991 A1 or similar .45 ACP by Colt and cash to make up the difference.

Otherwise identical to the P38, the weapon is robust, accurate and well balanced and field stripping and maintenance are simple and rapid. The P4 uses a double action trigger design similar to that of the earlier Walther PPKs, and a loaded chamber indicator is also incorporated. The fixed-barrel design mechanism operates by use of a wedge-shaped locking block underneath the breech. As a fill-in, the P4 was actually superior to the P-38, and was popular with users. The P4 was only made from 1975 to 1981, with few commercial models imported into the US.

Purchased both a good 20 years ago.
The reel is Martin's fast retrieve model with 3:1 gears and disc drag. The advantage is if the fish turns towards you it can get the hook out as you can no longer put tension on its mouth. With this type of reel you have a 3 times better chance of taking up the slack and landing the fish. Never been used and in original box with all the papers. One look and you can see it is solid and well crafted in USA of sound materials.
The rod is Martin's Classic MC96. Graphite, 9 foot, 6 weight and never used.
I learned on a Cabela pack rod and was given an Orvis Rocky Mountain, both 5wt so I never used this set up preferring the other two."

However, they are some of the best defensive sights on the market. I'm only selling this gun because my wife won't let me get anything else until I get rid of one...

Save yourself some money and time if your looking for a good CCW gun. I'll even through in the Remora holster. If you have never used a Remora I'd suggest looking it up online. They are a little different but one of the best CCW holster IMO.
