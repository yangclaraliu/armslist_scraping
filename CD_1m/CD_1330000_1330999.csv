Back when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn’t be improved, the Benelli Nova Pump proved otherwise. Completely original and innovative, the 12-gauge pump incorporates a polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics make the gun not only pleasing to look at, but a delight to hold and handle. Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forend in place of conventional checkering provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Pump.

With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova 12-gauge shotgun can handle anything from target loads to 3-1/2"" magnums. Black Synthetic, the Benelli Nova Pump is the most versatile pump action shotgun ever made"

You are never limited to flat nose bullets. Most lever-action rifles suffer from accuracy problems caused by the limitations of the flat-nosed ammunition for which they are chambered. Not the Browning BLR. The BLR utilizes a reliable box magazine that protects bullet tips and allows it to fire powerful game-dropping magnum cartridges. An extremely smooth rack and pinion-driven bolt locks tight to the barrel and gives the BLR the kind of superior accuracy that rivals many bolt-actions.

Hammer
The fold-down hammer has two positions at half-cock so the status of the rifle is readily seen. The folding hammer provides an added measure of safety when the hammer is at half-cock. The hammer has four basic positions: Full-cock, half-cock, folded hammer position and dropped, or fired position.

Action
Advanced, lightning fast, glass-smooth rack and pinion lever-action. Strong rotating head, multiple-lug breech bolt with a recessed bolt face and side ejection.

Receiver
Lightweight, sturdy machined aircraft-grade aluminum. Drilled and tapped to accept scope mounts.

Sights
Low profile, square notch, screw adjustable rear sight aligns easily with a highly visible gold bead on raised ramp front sight.

Barrel
Individually machined, precision button-rifled, heat-treated chromoly steel. Crowned muzzle. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity.

Trigger
Wide groove design trigger with short, smooth pull of approximately 4½ lbs. Trigger travels with lever.

Stock and Forearm
American walnut, straight '81-style with classic round forearm or pistol grip stock with Schnabel forearm. High-gloss finish. Checkered.

Magazine
The flush-mounted detachable box magazine has a capacity of three magnum or four standard rounds, plus one in the chamber.

Safety Lock
All Browning firearms are shipped with a free trigger lock, cable lock, padlock (shown) or chamber lock, depending on model, to assist in the safe storage of firearms.

The SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun that was manufactured by the Italian firearms company Franchi S.p.A. from 1979 to 2000. Only 1850 estimated SPAS-12 shotguns were imported into the U.S. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, meaning it can be set to cycle either semi-automatically or through pump-action. The SPAS-12 has sold well to military and police users around the world,[1] as well as to the civilian market, and has been featured in various movies and video games. The Franchi factory price in the last year of production 2000, listed for approx. USD. $1500.00 each shotgun for the worldwide market.- Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchi_SPAS-12

Legal Status in the United States
US firearm laws, in recent years, have universally blocked the importation of the SPAS-12 shotgun, because the shotgun fits under the profile of a military shotgun (which is defined as an illegal destructive device). Transfers and re-sales within the country are generally unobstructed, but few SPAS-12s are being imported from foreign countries. Additionally, in 2000 Franchi stopped production of the SPAS-12 altogether, and Franchi has since shifted its entire marketing focus towards the SPAS-15. Together, these drastic events have made the SPAS-12 a true collector's item both in the United States and abroad.

The Franchi SPAS-12 was a semi-automatic, 12-gauge shotgun noted for its variable-mode firing method in which the weapon could be fired via a gas-operated, semi-automatic mode (featuring self-loading) or a manually-actuated, pump-action / slide-action system. The SPAS-12 could, therefore, fire up to four rounds per second in the former mode, its dual-mode system managed by way of a two-position selector switch near the foregrip. The SPAS-12 was specifically designed as a combat shotgun and anti-riot measure but eventually marketed as a sporting system to civilians. Production of the series - handled by Luigi Franchi Development of Brescia, Italy (Franchi S.p.A), known for good quality shotguns - ran from 1979 to 2000 to which global operators became Austria, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and the United States. The Franchi firm was eventually sold to SOCIMI of Milan, which filed for bankruptcy in 1993, leaving Franchi to come under the experienced leadership of the famed Beretta concern. its imposing external characteristics made it a popular featured firearm in Hollywood films such as ""Terminator"", ""3,000 Miles to Graceland"", ""Underworld"" and ""Jurassic Park"".

Despite its futuristic appearance and dual-function fire mode, design of the SPAS-12 was somewhat conventional as a whole. The shoulder stock (detachable wooden, synthetic or folding metal) was appropriately set at the rear behind the pistol-type grip with the trigger system protected by an oblong ring. The receiver was mostly rectangular in shape with clean straight lines throughout and sported the cartridge ejection port along the right hand side. Perhaps the forend hand guard / slide of the SPAS-12 was its most identifiable design element, wrapping around the tube magazine fitted underneath the barrel. Shells were inserted into the tube magazine one behind the other. Sights were optional as were muzzle accessories, broadening the tactical scope of the weapon. General iron sighting was accomplished by a rear aperture and front blade arrangement. Beyond standard slug and spread rounds common to shotguns, the SPAS-12 could also ""fire less-than-lethal"" ammunition for the purposes of riot control - hence its interest by security parties. While fitted with an integrated lever safety, issues with the system resulted in a product recall.

There were few variations in the SPAS-12 production line and early forms were actually completed with a wooden fully detachable stock but this eventually gave way to the more common folding metal version. A synthetic stock was also later offered. The metal version could also be fitted with an optional folding underarm ""loop"" for improved single-handed firing - though this was always thought as impractical to most, considering the sheer weight and recoil of the weapon. The SPAS-12 family could subsequently be found sporting between 18- and 24-inch barrel systems and ammunition counts ranging from 5-, 6- and 8-rounds.

The SPAS-12 attempted to break the civilian sporting gun market but the system ultimately proved too unwieldy and generally complex for big game hunting or competition and the shotgun was eventually outlawed from import in the United States for its very ""militaristic"" features (high ammunition count, semi-automatic fire mode, heat shield for sustained firing, etc...). With the American gun market out of reach and global interest limited, Franchi ended production of their SPAS-12 in 2000. However, the lessons learned in its design and development went on to forge the later SPAS-15 series of automatic shotguns.

In the military market, the Franchi SPAS-12 found a home with Austria's EKO Cobra counter-terrorism units. Similarly, Indonesia fielded the SPAS-12 with their Komando Pasukan Katak and Komando Pasukan Khusus special warfare groups. Malaysia assigned the shotgun to their Special Operations Force and Bangladesh purchased the weapon in quantity for their Presidential Special Security Force. In the United States, SWAT teams were given access to the SPAS-12 for a time but the shotgun never found a permanent military home with the American military.

Incidentally, the acronym used to designate the SPAS-12 stood for ""Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun"", this being something of a psychological effort on the part of Franchi S.p.A. to help counter import bans and other restrictions arising within several countries by making the gun appear as more of a ""sporting"" system than the obvious. Regardless of its limitations and reach, the SPAS-12 went on to become one of the most recognizable shotguns in history.

I have a variety available to fit your needs and price range. They are all new and in the package. They all work in any AR-15 platform using the standard gas system.

Gas keys are attached with the proper Permatex sealant, Grade-8 screws torqued to 56 lb-in, and properly staked using the best staking tool (no hammers and punches).

Smith & Wesson M&P15 complete BCG:
	This bolt carrier group comes with a trusted name from the Military & Police line at Smith and Wesson. It features a MPI (magnetic particle inspected) bolt and upgraded Crane extractor spring and O-ring. $325

Leitner-Wise Advanced Impingement Carrier complete BCG:
	This group features a heavy duty anti-tilt carrier designed for demanding piston applications, making it more than up to the task for standard AR-15 gas systems. The carrier is precision-machined and hardened to 56 Rockwell. It is more than full-weight M-16 design. The tail is a larger diameter which prevents tilting and wear when the carrier is cycling back into the receiver extension. The firing pin is fully shrouded and the front of the carrier is tapered to prevent double-feed jams. Includes a Carpenter 158 bolt that is shot-peened and batch MPI-tested. $295

WMD Guns NiB-X complete BCG:
I've seen this bolt carrier group go for $450 lately due to the exotic coating and limited availability. The carrier is a full-weight M-16 design. Bolt is shot-peened Carpenter 158, MPI tested, with high-performance extractor and ejector springs. The carrier is 8620 hardened steel. The entire group is coated with a proprietary Nickel Boron coating that is harder than chrome, TiN, melonite, etc (hardness is 72 Rockwell). The coating provides exceptional lubricity and very easy cleaning. A NiB-coated hammer is included! Besides, it looks really cool if you're into that. $345

Stag standard BCG:
Stag is one of the biggest suppliers to this industry for these parts. The carrier is full M-16 weight and features a MPI-tested bolt with milspec hardware. $245

Please do not send me lowball offers or angry emails about my evil price gouging. After experiencing availability issues for BCGs as early as last summer I started stocking up on these parts. I paid retail or higher for parts that aren't available now and invested in expensive torque and staking tools. These prices are less than what I have been getting on Gunbroker, but I would prefer to deal locally and face to face if possible. Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Obama urges vote on assault weapons ban

Posted by
CNN's Ashley Killough

(CNN) - President Barack Obama called on the Senate to vote on a controversial ban on semiautomatic firearms modeled after military-style assault weapons, despite dim predictions from Senate leadership that such a ban will have any luck passing the upper chamber.

""These ideas shouldn't be controversial – they're common sense. They're supported by a majority of the American people. And I urge the Senate and the House to give each of them a vote,"" Obama said in his weekly address.

He said there is still ""genuine disagreement among well-meaning people"" on how to combat gun violence. But he, added, the American people ""have spoken.""

On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, introduced gun legislation targeted toward curbing gun deaths. However, it did not include the so-called assault weapons ban, nor another proposal backed by the Obama administration that would place limits on magazine capacities.

The bill instead included measures that expand the background check system, boost school safety and toughen laws for gun trafficking. The Senate will begin debating the bill once it returns from recess in two weeks.

Because of fierce opposition by the National Rifle Association, Republicans and some Democrats would get fewer than 40 votes on the assault weapons ban, Reid said, far below the threshold needed to defeat a filibuster or pass the Senate.

He added that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the main proponent behind the ban, can propose the legislation as an amendment and therefore get a vote on the Senate floor.

Shortly after the Connecticut elementary school shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead, a majority of Americans–52%–favored major restrictions on guns. However, that number has since dropped to 43%, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released earlier this week.

Very few of these were imported and even fewer in the condition mine is in as most were very rough and had pitted bores. Mine is like new with a bright shiny bore and zero pitting the wood and bluing are very nice as well. This rifle is extremely accurate as I can hit clay pigeons at 200 yards with the open sights but it is also a deveststing weapon with 30 rounds of 8mm on tap. Rifle will come with original 10 round mag, 2 25 round German MG 13 mags that function flawlessly and are nazi marked and dated 1938, one 25 round MG 13 mag that is partially converted but needs finished, one 30 round mag, and a MG 13 Magazine carrying can that holds 8 mags and is nazi marked BSW 1936. I have over $1200 invested in this rifle as the mags were over $100 a piece and the can was $75 so my price is firm.

The frame says revelation but the bolts and mechanisms is a mossberg 500. It was switched out by the prev. owner. I bought a new turkey gun for this year and dont need two. It has a Mossberg 24 in accu choke barrel. I have a 30 in full barrel that goes with the gun as well but the barrel needs to be re-blued but there is nothing wrong with it. I put a brand new truglo red dot scope on it and a turkey choke. Both barrel and gun are ported! I also have a imp cyl for the 24in barrel so when turkey season is out you can shoot slugs or use it for home defense. I have 15 rounds of Remington express high brass #5 to go with it. The only thing wrong with the gun is the butt stock has a crack. Doesnt affect the way it shoots. Have a new forearm too. Turkey season is just around the corner! Lot of extras. 300 OBO

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

Shipping is via Priority - I am offering a discounted flat rate of $5 for up to 4 magazines, and $10 for 5 or more.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

It looks like has been shot very little. I bought it and have never shot it. It is estimated that fewer than 400 HK41s were produced and even fewer imported into the U.S. for civilian consumption. Today, HK41s can sell for anywhere between $3,000 and $6,000 depending on the condition and the economy at the time. An original 1966 model with the push-pin hole in the receiver can sell for around $8,500. These are very scarce because most of them were used as hosts for full-auto conversions prior to the May 1986 Machinegun Ban. A 1962 semi-automatic HKG3 can sell for over $10,000.

The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there.
