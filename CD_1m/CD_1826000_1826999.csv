Description

This is the king of AK's, a brand new in box, unfired Vepr 308 made by Molot, sister company of Izhmash who manufactures the Saiga line of rifles and shotguns. The Vepr needs ***NO CONVERSION*** like a sporter Saiga, because these come from the factory with properly positioned trigger groups, ready to rock with no modifications to necessary to accept high capacity Vepr mags or 922r parts. Easily takes standard AK or RPK stocks, as well as AK grips, and Tapco/RSA trigger groups. Takes Hi-capacity Vepr mags like Csspec and Pro-Mag's, both of which work flawlessly. These integrated sights come standard on the new square-back standard AK models and are the fastest acquiring sights I have seen to date on an AK variant. The flip up for 100/300m.

I know your wife is gnawing on you about the credit card debt and all, but you need to face reality. You are NOT going to get any sane person to pay 33% or more over retail for your item. When you list that item for sale for that amount to ""get what i have in it"" back, realize that your are just prolonging your folly and anguish. 

Now, when your item does not sell for your price for weeks and you post ""must sell this week. make offers"", be prepared to get low end real value offers for a USED example of your gun. Also, please do not wring your hands and excoriate the guy making such an offer as a lowballer or tell him he needs to do more research on the product. He has. The market has decided the used dpms mk12 is not worth the $2000 you demand. Neither is your used Colt M4 worth $1800 to folks not panicked by legislation. 

In closing, learn to negotiate. Learn to not buy the panic. Learn to graciously say ""no, thanks"". Learn that a free market eventually sets a fair price, not ""what you have in it"".

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

In other words this thing was done right. Over $900 in parts new.

I understand its used. Sell price is $700. 

Two things I will consider trading for. Glock 17 or 19 pistol with aftermarket or factory Trijicon night sights, or quality plain-jane upper. That means Colt, BCM, or Daniel Defense. Would prefer a 14.5 or 14.7 barrel with a permanently attached A2, but may consider a 16"" barrel. Either way it will be your item + cash to make up for the difference.

I have a gorgeous and rare Smith & Wesson 610 (610-2) 10mm pre-lock revolver with a 3 3/4"" barrel. These also fire .40 if you are not familiar with the 610. It looks crazy polished in the pics, when I called Smith & Wesson support they informed me some of these were ""high bright"" finish so I anticipate that is what this one is but don't hold me to it, though I do know it is factory. I have owned many 610's and all have the more dull stainless finish. It is in excellent+ shape...a gorgeous firearm.  The previous owner messed up the front sight as pictured, there is an extra ping hole. It does not affect the function, it is tight and just cosmetic. This will come with 5 metal S&W moon clips. 

Selling for $1300 firm local plus the $35 shipping to your dealer.  I am not really interested in trades though I do collect the colt snake guns (a king cobra or blued diamondback will need cash added)."

 Due to the long-for-weight all copper bullet, the 357 does not have the case capacity to use a bulky flash retarded powder and thus there is a noticeable muzzle flash with this load in all the test revolvers, however the rifle shows no flash at all due to its longer barrel.

This load is the typical barn-burning, turbo charged, Buffalo Bore type HEAVY 357 Mag. load and as such, should only be used in revolvers made of all steel. It should not be fired in light weight, alloy framed or cylindered revolvers. Feel free to use it in ANY/ALL 357 mag. chambered rifles and all steel revolvers/handguns."

Front bore is loose and don't have the tool to tighten it so I put tape on it. You can take it to a gun store and they can tighten it for you. The CVA is actually newer. It comes with some extras. But it also has your years wear. It's been shot a lot but still shoots great. I have made some calls and these guns can be worth some money if you clean them up because collectors like them. They don't sell either one of these any more. I just have no time or interest in them. I don't hunt. But if you are interested message back or text me at REDACTED. I will take no less than 150 for both. It's a lot cheaper that way because I am not selling them separately for less than 110.
