brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new 

Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other 

accessory designed to fit a
standard picatinny rail.

The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS – which stands for 1911 Compact SAS – comes from the SIG SAUER® Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability"

The grip includes a flat checkered polymer mainspring housing configured to provide excellent retention. The controls are STI’s single sided blued thumb safety and STI’s bobbed high-rise, blued, knuckle relief beavertail grip safety. The barrel is a 3.0"" fully supported STI ramped bull barrel.

I have tried getting an idea of price on here and gunbroker, seen them listed everywhere from $300 to $900. Since it is used (though excellent working condition) and does have a custom duracoat camo finish, I am going to list it at $600 or shoot me a fair offer.

I have a KFS(Keng's) Import factory scoped Chinese SKS I would like to trade. This is more for the SKS collector than anything else and comes with the Chinese factory PU style scope base/mount and the correct Redstar 4x20 scope w/covers. These came both Pre-ban with the bayonet, etc. still attached and post-ban with everything removed and the lug ground off. This is obviously post-ban. Most all of these imports were refurbished non-match SN builds and this is no exception. This would fill a nice spot in someone's SKS collection. 

I also have another scope of the same type that has a broken cross hairs that I will send along with for spare scope parts.

Anyway, if you have an SKS and are interested in a trade call or text me at REDACTED.

factory bad ass rifle, new in box.


A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm
caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300
AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round
capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide
extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming
chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to
accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™
flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX
III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories.
The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high
hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also
a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme
corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a
single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened
steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement
in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind
even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium
ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible
life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower
strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with
Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a
Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by
MagPul Industries."

Description
This is absolutely the best upper receiver on the market and is perfect for your custom AR 15 build!

Product Description of the Vltor MUR-1A Upper Receiver
- The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

- Fits all AR-type lower receivers made to Milspec standards. Will fit all select-fire AR-15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. Will fit most of the semi-auto AR-type lower receivers (currently available).

- Height of rail (from the centerline of the bore): 1.215”. Weights (10 oz)

- The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

He didn't clean it after he last shot it and the barrel is rough. I've cleaned it the best I can. I've never fired it so it may still be accurate but I don't know.

What I wont to do or would like to do is trade one frame for one Thompson TCR 83/87 barrel and cal that I am looking for is 22-250 7mm08 or a smooth bore shotgun barrel but you would need the forend for it or maybe a custom shop barrel. Please take note that the Encore barrels will not fit the TCR rifles The only Encore barrel that would interist me is a 22-250 Blue 24 inch with sights plus you would need to add some cash. This is a face to face deal in or near Tulsa dont mind driving a few miles. If you have an interist in the other 2 grips shown just email me Might even work up a sale on frames but would rather trade might be Interested in a compleat TCR 87 but would think on a 83.
