Yes it is the highly sought after and even harder to find 4x.  Jimmy at trijicon just sent this to me. Jimmy went through the internals maticusially. He installed all new seals and repurged it with gas. He replaced all of the external fiber optics and internal leads. The glass is great. The optic has no signs of wear on the exterior either. Essencially it is a brand new scope except for the major interior components which when he had it in service were inspected and reported to be in new condition. Story behind it is that it had been sitting on a desk for a while and every one thought some one else knew why. Eventually some one brought it up and since no one knew where it was from they sent it to the shop.  Jimmy went through it and sent it to me.  Save your self $300 bucks with this one. Comes in it's origional tuff box with the origional unopened booklet.  Mount is also included as well as neoprene cover.  It lists for well over $1200.00 plus shipping and taxes.  I'm asking 950.00

If you bought these from the dealership they would cost you approx. $2,100 without installation.  You might be able to find them online for around $1,700.  Will fit any 2007 - Present: Avalanche, Tahoe, Silverado, Sierra, Suburban.    I have all center caps and lugnuts as well.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

As you know, on December 14, 2012, an individual in Newtown, Connecticut forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School and opened fire on teachers and staff in the building.  In total, the perpetrator murdered 20 students between the ages of six and seven years old, as well as six adults, many of whom heroically sought to stop the shooter and save the lives of children.  Like many Americans, I was deeply affected by the scope and brutality of this act.  My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.
 
The motives that led to this senseless massacre will likely never fully be comprehended. However, I believe that all public officials have a responsibility to work to prevent such an event from occurring again.  This incident reflects a complex problem that requires a comprehensive strategy, including funding for law enforcement officers and the mental health care system.  Too many individuals with mental illness are not receiving the services they need and tragically, sometimes a small number of these individuals turn violent.  I have supported access to affordable and accessible mental health services for all Americans and I will continue to review proposed solutions to improve our mental health system.  As lawmakers consider an appropriate response to this challenging issue, we should consider all of the factors that could prevent such heinous acts.  
 
As you may know, I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.  Pennsylvania has a fine hunting and sporting tradition, and I will defend the right to bear arms as it is enshrined in our Constitution.  I will continue to back the right to bear arms for purposes of self-defense, recreation, sporting and collection.  However, I also believe that the attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School highlights very serious dangers posed to public safety by the misuse of certain weapons and technology originally developed for warfare.  According to reports, the shooter was able to kill many children and adults very quickly because he possessed a military-style semiautomatic weapon.  He also allegedly used magazines containing up to 30 rounds of ammunition and carried hundreds of rounds more.  After much reflection and careful study of the issue, I have decided to support a federal assault weapons ban as well as legislation restricting high capacity magazines.  In light of what occurred at Sandy Hook, these are two measures that will lessen the chances that this will happen again.  Before supporting such a law, I would first and foremost ensure that it did not unduly abridge the right to bear arms as established by the Second Amendment.  
 
Our Nation has already begun a critical dialogue as we examine what steps must be taken to prevent this type of tragedy in the future.  On January 17, 2012, President Obama unveiled a package of proposals to reduce gun violence, which included strengthening the system of background checks, reinstating the assault weapon and high-capacity magazines ban, improving school safety and expanding access to mental health services.  I look forward to reviewing these proposals in detail and to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address this complex issue.  
 
On January 24, 2013, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California introduced S. 150, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013.  This legislation would explicitly permit the possession of affected firearms that were owned prior to the bill’s enactment; firearms that are manually operated; firearms used by military, law enforcement and retired law enforcement; and antique weapons.  Further, this legislation lists 2,258 hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns that are entirely exempt from the ban.  
 
This legislation would ban the sale, transfer, manufacturing and importation of all semiautomatic rifles that can accept a detachable magazine and have at least one of seven specified military features.  S. 150 would further ban semiautomatic pistols that can accept a detachable magazine and have at least one of certain listed military features, as well as ammunition magazines that can accept more than 10 rounds.  The Assault Weapons Ban would also regulate the transfer and storage of permitted, grandfathered weapons and allow local law enforcement to use certain federal funds for voluntary gun buyback programs.  The Assault Weapons Ban was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, of which I am not a member.  Please be assured that should this legislation come before the full Senate for consideration, I will have your views in mind.  
 
Again, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.  Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future about this or any other matter of importance to you.  
 
For more information on this or other issues, I encourage you to visit my website, http://casey.senate.gov.  I hope you will find this online office a comprehensive resource to stay up-to-date on my work in Washington, request assistance from my office or share with me your thoughts on the issues that matter most to you and to Pennsylvania.

Bob Casey

Demand way over supply to quickly causing a mad rush creating super high prices. Had people that never owned a gun running around buying them. Supply dried up so prices soared.
What happens now? Companys now getting supplys back in . People realizing they are never going to use the guns they just bought will go to sell but guess what , now the manufacturers are shipping back into the stores but their is nobody going to the store buying any because they already did. Stores start dropping prices because supply is now way over demand. Watch what happens just over the next week. 
Prices go below where they were before the rush started. Going to be some upset people realizing what they paid was a mirage and now theyre stuck selling for a huge loss.

So if ur gonna give triple prices i have 223 for thousand dollars per thousand round s and it will even come with a brass case. Too bad target shooters dont have a loyalty to each other  anymore  Flagg me fast  price gougers. Somebody might not make your 70000$ truck payment t for you. And for those who are holdin out for lower prices your good and wise

I have a Marlin Model 60 .22 for sale. The rifle is used with a few scuffs and it has a little very light surface rust in spots but it's a great shooter and if you wanted to clean it up, it would look new. I bought it new and have only put around 500-600 rds thru it.

In light of the current price-gouging going on I should probably be asking $2000 to $2500 but I suppose if someone only had $125 in cash I'd fell sorry for them and give them a deal.

Pick it up in Brownsburg or Avon. No trade offers please unless you have a 2011 or newer fully-loaded Ford F150 4X4 (with a full tank of gas) to offer in an even trade."

I also have a KIDD trigger group, bolt release and magazine release to go with the rifle should you want it.  This is an extra $125.  I've installed all of these parts (5 minute job) and can easily be converted back to stock configuration.

Various police forces use them due to their reliability and performance, and that is often the same reason civilians purchase them. They group well, perform well, and can handle being dirtied up some. They are compact and lightweight, so they would make for a great multi-purpose carbine. Just handling this one almost makes me want to buy one. If you are in the market for an AR-15 but do not feel as though you would trust yourself with getting the best quality parts to do a build-it-yourself, the Colt 6920MP-B is probably one of your best choices. They are more expensive than other AR-15s that are capable out-of-the-box, but the quality and fit of the Colt can't be matched. You can tell they come from the same factory as the military rifles; the left side of the magazine well is even stamped ""M4 CARBINE."" So, again, if you're wanting a good-to-go-out-of-the-box AR-15, I highly recommend the Colt SP 6920MP-B.

Like new, has been to the range once. Aside from that, it's new in the box. Great gun. 41 Mags are inherently very accurate due to such little wear on the machine tooling. This is a special edition Distributor Exclusive by Ruger for Davidson's Distributors. Davidson's sold out of these over a year ago. About 250 were made. You are buying from me, an individual. This powerful handgun has a 7 1/2 inch barrel, is all stainless steel, has a black/dark green laminated wood pistol grips, and comes with factory scope rings/bases which fit onto the flat rid on top of the barrel. The rib has the cutout for the rings, or you can just shoot iron sights. The rear sight is fully adjustable. Grizzly cartridge makes some strong ammo for it:  265 grains at 1450 fps through this gun (1400fps on a 6 inch gun). Hornady's FTX 210 grainer at 1550 fps (1500 on a 6 in barreled pistol), and Hodgon's Reloading chart online rates a 280 grain bullet at 1480 fps from a 7.5 inch barrel as a max load.  So you can have the standard load high stopping power of the Hornady FTX, or get more with Grizzly ammo, or look at Hornady's online reloading chart. I say all this because people don't realize the 41 Magnum is actually more powerful  (faster than the .44 mag) with the same bullet weight from bullets weighing 170-280 grains. YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU WANT WITH THIS. And the factory loads are just fine for almost all hunting, but more is available for the taking. And this is a gun that will last a lifetime, and it's a great looking gun to boot.  The only reason I am selling it is to help buy some AR lowers before this ban takes place. My dad has a US Senator in his church who thinks the Ban will not get passed in the Senate. So that is very comforting, but I am not one to take chances."
