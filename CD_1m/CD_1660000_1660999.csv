The Exposed Rebounding Hammers do NOT rest on the firing pins. Nice safety feature. This model has long been out of production.
This one has NEVER BEEN FIRED and was put together for the first time when I shot pictures. My Uncle used to see something he liked and would just buy it on a whim. He was in a wheelchair and rarely got out to shoot, never even put this one together. He passed some years ago and his sister (my Mom) ended up with most of his things. This was passed on to me to give to my little guy so he could start bird hunting with me but it's just TOO NICE to even think about taking it afield. 
Don't know how many others you'll find like it but the last one I saw on one of the gun auction sites brought over $600 and had been fired, was noted at ""98%"" and didn't include the box and paperwork. 
Would prefer to deal with someone local to avoid all the shipping and such but am open to interested parties as long as they're in the USA and NOT in CALIF, COLO, CONN or any other gun hating state. Of course if it goes out of NV it'll have to go the a FFL, etc. NV FTF will require you to provide a copy of a valid NV DL. I'll do the same if any trade + cash is involved.
Would consider partial trade of a Henry AR-7 + $300 CASH or something simiilar. Already have a .22/20 gauge lined up for the little guy but might consider something like that and some CASH too... Let me know what you might be thinking."

The Benelli Cordoba is a lightning-fast 12-gauge shotgun especially built for hunting. Inspired by the high volume of dove shooting found around Cordoba, Argentina, the designers of Benelli shotguns engineered this one with all the advanced features of a serious sporting clays model. Incorporated into the Cordoba is the 10-mm tapered sporting rib favored by competition shooters and porting to keep barrel climb to a minimum.

The ComforTech stock cushions the blow when ammo isn’t measured in boxes, but by cases in an afternoon. The ComforTech system also helps reduce barrel climb and puts the shooter back on target 69% faster, so that the Cordoba just may be the fastest field gun ever built. A Crio barrel and extended Crio choke tubes put more pellets on target. And the whole package is finished in matte black GripTight coating, so a reflected flash won’t give you away.

This shotgun ships in a fitted hard case.

I purchased the gun brand new in December 2012. The gun has been in my safe ever since I bought it except to take these pictures. This gun would be a great gun to teach your kids or grand kids with or just a Fun gun to shoot varmints with. I might have a bag of shells 22lr to throw in for the right price. I am in no hurry to sell the gun I bought it to teach my nephew to shoot but my brother inlaw does not want him to have anything to do with guns so that's why I have decided to sell. I know what I have in to this gun and yes you can try to find online but I'm sure they are all out of stock or on back order. If you find online cheaper than my asking price I may come down a little. I see one on here for a little more than my price but than you have a $10 background check and have to wait to get the gun. If interested in purchasing more than one of my guns I have listed we can most likely work out a package deal. Please no low ball offers they will be ignored. Text my cell if interested REDACTED"

That is not a scratch above the cylinder release thumb piece. It is a factory arrow on all 396s. These guns were made a very short time only due to the unpopularity of the caliber at the time due to the .44 magnum. Now they are popular and hard to find. The 396 I'm told was made for only 9 months. I called S&W and they have no plans to make more. Most people don't know that S&W made a .44 Spl on the L frame and as the word gets out these guns will become even more sought after and very rare. Try to find another one for sale even now. I like that the 396 NG .44 Spl. has a steel barrel and steel cylinder unlike the other S&W Night Guard models which have alloy cylinders. I have a 396 that I shoot and can verify they are fantastic weapons that I won't be without

The serial number on this M1 is 1647185, which places its date of manufacture in June 1943. The barrel is the original Springfield barrel that is also dated June of 1943. The bore is shiny and the muzzle gauges at less than 1! The throat erosion is also excellent at 1.0, so this rifle has been fired very sparingly and it will be an excellent shooter. The Barrel retains almost all of its original parkerized finish. The Rear Sight has a correct Type 1C Elevation Knob, which is knurled, with closed arrowheads, a Type 2B Lock Bar and Type 2 Rear Sight Cover. The Bolt is a correct -12 SA Springfield bolt with the majority of the original parkerized finish. The Operating Rod is a correct Type 5, 6SA un-cut op rod. The Follower Rod is a correct Type 4 ""short fork"" with the ribbed end riveted. The Operating Rod catch is a correct Type 2. The Follower Arm is a correct Type 4 with rounded shoulders. The Follower is a correct Type 2C with appropriate ""11"" mark. The Bullet Guide is a correct Type 3 with wide slot. The Trigger Housing is a correct Type 8, -12 SA marked. The Trigger Guard is the correct Type 1G that is milled. The Trigger is a correct Type 2 with no tooling hole. The Hammer is a correct Type 2C, -3SA marked hammer. The Hammer Spring Plunger is a correct Type 1 with no rim on the sides. The Hammer Spring Housing is a correct Type 2. The Safety is a correct Type 3B, -9SA marked. The Gas Cylinder is a correct Type 2B that is appropriately unmarked and which has the majority of its original black finish. The Gas Cylinder Lock is a correct Type 1 with chamfered front face with the majority of its original parkerized finish. The Gas Lock Screw is a correct Type 1 Single Slot. The receiver still has the majority of its original finish. The rifle sits in its original WWII Springfield Stock that has a crisp SA/EMcF Cartouche on the left side, which is the correct cartouche for this serial number, and a circle ""P"" firing proof on the bottom. The stock has a beautiful original finish and has no cracks noted and only has normal dings and small scratches, probably from storage as I do not think this rifle was ever used much, if at all. The Stock Ferrule is a correct Type 2, 3rd Variation with round shoulders and a large hole. The Lower Band is a correct Type 2 Stamped with arched profile. The butt trap compartment contains its original Type 2 Plastic Oiler with the pull through (and hole in the plastic cap) and lubricating oil section as well as original grease pot (still with grease) and original Type 2B Combination Tool. The rifle also comes with an original WWII steel claw Model 1907 Leather Sling that is dated 1943 although it is hard to make out the maker's name. The sling is still supple and solid. This is a beautiful WWII M1 Garand that is in exactly the same condition it was in 1943 when it was made.. Email me if you got any question, Thank you"

This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and re-installation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel."

I am selling my 5"" Kimber Warrior. I've had it for a few months and it's just collecting dust. I never have time to go to the range and I own 100 acres so whenever I have time, I just shoot my 22's (none of which are for sale). 

It's .45ACP, cleaned after every time I've finished firing it. They MSRP for $1,512 on Kimber's Site but I purchased mine from Vance's for $1,415 + Tax = $1,510.51. I've fired MAYBE 500 rounds through it. Kimber is an AMAZING handgun manufacturer and their Quality is unparalleled, if you can't afford a Wilson.

My asking Price is $1400 BECAUSE it comes with, in addition to all the stock items, 5 additional mags. Three 7+1's, One 10+1, and one 8+1. Not to mention it also comes with an open carry holster. The brand name of the holster escapes me, but it's VERY good. The grips are VZ Grips and are amazing, I put them on myself and I love them.

This is a package deal, so everything must be purchased. Seeing that each mag is roughly $25 and the Holster was $40, that brings my used Kimber's value at $1,235 which is actually a very good price for a Kimber Warrior in this condition.

Anyone who purchases this, can also purchase .45ACP target ammo from me. I have boxes of 50 and depends on how many boxes you want to buy, there are discounts involved. I have 950 rounds, so I have plenty upon request for sale.

Thank you."

This NXS retains a slim profile and is easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. Nightforce uses outstanding glass and coatings in all their scopes, and the 5.5-22x50 tactical gives you superb resolution at high magnifications. It is the ultimate long range scope. The 50mm objective lens gives you maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This Nightforce scope gives the shooter precision accuracy at the longest ranges, yet at 5.5 power remains highly effective for shots at close ranges. The MOAR reticle is an improved, more versatile version of the NP-R1 reticle. The MOAR has subtensions that are thicker than those of NF’s traditional reticles, which makes the reticle easier to see against dark backgrounds. The MOAR has 1 MOA spacing on the horizontal and vertical axis’, and this is a great tool for precise range-finding and hold offs. The first hash marks on the reticle are 2 MOA from center, and the crosshair is 1 MOA in length.

In pic it has a sightron red dot on it. I have a Nikon Monarch on it that I would like to keep. I am looking for a trade with a rifle of equal value or rifle and cash.

Story is---
This pistol may have been re-blued.
I'm certainly no expert; hard to tell. 
If so, shoot it and enjoy it!
If not, you Sir got an extremely good deal on a Gesichert Luger!!
The bore is excellent; the condition is excellent!
The Luger functions excellent! I've shot it; but very little.

Caliber: 9mm
One ""Mauser"" clip
All numbers appear to match
Serial Number: 38x Yep, 3 digits!  (no numbers on Mauser clip that I can find)

Price:  $1750  (You can't hardly purchase a Repro for this)
***Luger will be delivered in hard-case for you to keep.

New Gun Laws Took Effect July 1! 
Here's what I've learned that the news is not disclosing---

State law limits the amount the FFL Dealer can charge for Background Checks to only $10. It's basically a tax; the store must turn it over to the State.
The store must retain records for 20 years
The store must inspect the weapon; deeming it safe to operate.

I believe Corral Pawn on Main St. in Trinidad is doing the BGCs.
Artic Shooting Supply, on 6th St, in Pueblo is doing them for $20 which includes Transfer fees also. No limit on guns sold from Seller to Buyer. One fee! 
Or, paid in full first, I will agree to ship UPS OVER-NITE to your FFL Dealer for Transfer; at your expense of course.

Please: No Trades ""Except""---
Bulk ammunition!  LC-223  45acp  9mm
I may consider trades for gold/silver bullion (no collectibles please)
I prefer 1 Oz Eagles or Maples Leafs.

It was originally naked steel with the grips you see, partially constructed. I went through the gun with a fine-toothed comb, sanded/polished every surface until it gleamed, shot it a few dozen times, cleaned it an put it away.

As you can see from the photos, the gun gleams in the light. The overall polishing is not 100% consistent as I used a Dremel-like tool and did all of the work by hand, but she's a 10 at 3 feet. It's only when you look super close that you see some inconsistencies.

Shoots great, rotates perfectly, ZERO rust or pitting in the barrel, and I challenge you to find a spec of rust on any component :)."

 The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
 FACTS:
 You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
 We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
 The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
 The permit is valid for 5 years
 We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
 Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
 Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

It has been pressure checked for cracks and has been resurfaced. The guides and seats have been replaced and new Viton valve stem seals have been installed. It has also been given a three angle valve job and all valves have been vacuum checked to ensure proper sealing. This head is cast number 0630, which has to match the one you are replacing.

I bought this head to replace a blown one in my '98 XJ Cherokee and after I got it, found out that in addition to a blown head, my Jeep had a cracked block as well, so I ended up changing out the entire engine. It is in perfect condition. I know someone needs this and I just want to get my money back. Another great benefit to buying this head is that you do not have to have to another head for a core charge, which saves at least $100-$200 by itself. It also comes with a 12-month unlimited mileage guarantee from the company I bought it from. Which is down to closer to 10 months now.

I am asking $250 or nearest offer. I may also trade for shooting/hunting gear.
Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

 The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
 FACTS:
 You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
 We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
 The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
 The permit is valid for 5 years
 We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
 Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
 Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).
