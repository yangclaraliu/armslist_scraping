The j-pipe for the exhaust is 100% stainless and will not rust out. About 24k miles and 966 hours as it is still being driven, the truck was rebuilt in 1989. I have added spin-on oil filters and secondary fuel filters.   Both batteries have been replaced in April of last year. The cargo cover had a rip in it, was fixed and from the outside you can hardly tell. I bought the truck from Joe Czarnick in Appleton WI a little over 5 years ago. He had just sandblasted the truck and painted it with CARC paint and it looks as good today as it did the day that I bought it. The spare tire is a 11.00-20 Michelin XL, as is the extra mounted spare that is in the bed. When I bought this truck it was running singles. I did all of the work to return it to duals. The truck does have a cab heater and I recently replaced the in tank fuel pump with a 24 volt inline unit. Both front inner axle seals have been changed and the differential was drained and refilled. Over the last year I have had all the wheels off at one time or another and the brakes are in excellent shape yet. The front tires are G177’s as is one tire on the rear, the rest are G188’s. All of the rubber rope for the cargo cover has been replaced. I also built a 2"" receiver hitch for it.
I will sell just the truck with the cargo cover for $5900"

Like new Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 100rds fired total in 3 range sessions cleaned every time. It is perfect for concealment and will disappear on you after a few minutes of carry. I can feel and see my iPhone much more than this slim and sleek gun. This handgun is the only one in its class to offer double strike capability because it has an internal hammer not a striker that would need to be manually reset, that's the difference between life and death. I other words this gun was built to be you're personal BODYGUARD. It has great accuracy and 6+1 capacity comes with a Inside waist holster and Outside waist holster as well as a grip extension, carry case, original box, papers, two locks, and once fired case. The reason I'm selling is because I'm a big guy and can conceal/comfortably carry a larger .40 handgun well and I've been wanting a .22 to play with so this has little appeal compared a .22 fun gun or a full power .40 carry gun. $450 obo I'm negotiable, low ballers are welcome, but I'm not desperate to sell."

From Zastava Arms website:
 The Zastava EZ 40 is a modern weapon used as a service gun or a personal defense gun. Due to excellent design solutions, ergonomics, state-of-the art technology in production, this weapon stands out with its precision, accuracy and functionality. The design is a semi-automatic weapon, functioning on the short recoil of the barrel principle. Locking is achieved by vertical oscillation of the barrel, that comes into the hole on the slide. The pistol can function as a single action or double action gun, is fed from a double-stack detachable magazine and has ambidextrous controls - it can be operated with right or left hand. The design of the EZ 40 is such that the same controls have several functions. Loaded chamber indicator shows whether there is a cartridge in the chamber. Sights are square, with white dots and they facilitate aiming at low visibility conditions. 
The slide is made of high quality alloy steel. The frame is made of aluminium alloy. Handgrip covers are made of high impact polymer. Standard finish is phosphatizing and painting of aluminium parts, while the steel parts are blued. On the slide it has a connection for mounting of optical-electronic devices."

Built it to be a more ""lightweight"" rifle without giving up any durability or accuracy.  I used a Rainier Arms ""MedCon"" 5.56 chamber barrel which is slightly lighter then their normal profile but not a pencil barrel by any means. They guarantee Sub-MOA or better accuracty with match ammo, and this one will definitely do it. The total weight of the rifle WITH the MBUS sights, MOE+ grip and AFG2 is only 6lbs 9oz, pretty light for not using a pencil barrel.  Rifle only has 200 rounds down the pipe to get it sighted in and worked in.  Don't neccesarily want to sell it but, I have some other projects in mind so it will have to go.

Anyway, looking to get $1400, willing to hear offers so don't be afraid to offer me a number.  Can remove MBUS, MOE+ or AFG2 to lower the cost.  Willing to meet in Hampton Roads to make a deal.

Nothing fancy – but a rugged, solidly built side-cocker that works great for small game and pest control without alerting the neighbors.  The wood is finished nicely for a Chinese product, and the steel is good quality.  

Comes with a scope (came with the gun).  I’ve used the iron sites, which while a pain to adjust, did get me a good group.  I have not mounted or tried the scope.  It has a clear field of vision and looks surprisingly good.  

Included with the air gun is the original owner’s manual and a tin of pellets (not full, but enough to get you started).  

Guns of this quality usually sell for around 75.00-100.00 new (Tech Force imports similar Chinese guns).  

This gun was manufactured in 1998, my father bought it new during the summer of ’99, and I’d guess it never saw more than 100 rounds through it.  

I’m asking $50.00, which is more than fair, so I won’t dicker.  This is a very good gun for the money, and I’m sure you’ll be hard pressed to find a better quality gun for this money anywhere.

* My gunsmith told me these guns always need a tweaking at some point, but the mag lock was no big deal. He said the rest of the gun was perfect.

I highly recommend you keep the scope, though.

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose. 

The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select 
one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change 
everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.

Specs:
The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 7 rounds of 12 gauge 2.75"" shells each, for a total capacity of 7+7+1=15 rounds. The pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in.

This is the competition Glock 9mm with the 5.3 barrel. The reviews are fantastic and the 34 is supposed to be extremelly accurate.  I purchased this gun about a month ago and it has never been shot. It comes with the Glock factory adjustable rear sight. I replaced this with a Burris Fastfire II red dot. It is bore sighted and looks great on the gun. The red dot has an auto brightness adjustment so it shows up great in all conditions. It also comes with the light and laser combo. It comes in the factory box with two clips, glock loader, cleaning tools and all of the paperwork. I ended up getting a great deal on a 1911 so I decided to part with the Glock. I may consider trades for other 1911's. The price is firm and I actually have $875 into the gun.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Scope by itself retails for $200, so you're basically getting the binoculars for free (which retail for $115). Willing to ship for $15.00 extra.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

That is not a scratch above the cylinder release thumb piece. It is a factory arrow showing which way to turn the lock key and is on all 396s. I don't know anyone who locks a gun. Rare S&W 396 .44 spl. These guns were made a very short time only due to the unpopularity of the caliber at the time. Everyone wanted the .44 Mag. at the time. Now they are popular and hard to find. The 396 I'm told was made for only 9 months. I called S&W and they have no plans to make more. Most people don't know that S&W made a .44 Spl on the L frame and as the word gets out these guns will become even more sought after and very rare. Try to find another one for sale even now. Those who do have one like it too much to sell. You lucked out to find this one for sale. I like that the 396 NG .44 Spl. has a steel barrel and steel cylinder unlike the other S&W Night Guard models which have alloy cylinders. I have a 396 and a 696 that I shoot and can verify they are fantastic weapons that I won't be without.

I had the front end rebuilt with brand new ball joints and control arm bushings when the shocks were installed. The tires, shocks and front end was all done at the same time so they aren't even broken in yet. The truck drives great and will go anywhere. The odometer reads 200,000 but it still pulls strong. The interior is in great shape with fully adjustable electric seats, cruise, tilt wheel, and a nice CD player. The truck is also wired for subs if you're into that. It also has a matching fiberglass camper shell which is shown in the picture. The truck has a trailer hitch receiver as well as add-a-leaf springs in the back. I have title in hand, asking $5000 OBO.

BARRETT M107A1 !!

The Barrett M107A1 .50 BMG semi-automatic rifle is an exceptional firearm! Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail.

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet.

* It has a monopod as standard equipment instead of having to pay additional and add as an accessory; this is a big help so you do not have to support the weight of the rear of the rifle with your own strength. It also allows you to dial the elevation of where your aiming up or down with the monopod with even more accuracy so even if you don't want to upgrade you may want to ask about adding a monopod.

*The case it comes with from the factory is an upgrade from a Pelican case to a nicer Storm case. The Storm case is much easier to open and close, and you don’t bust your knuckles on it, and the case features padding inside instead of bare plastic.

*More potential investment value as it has the same rollmark as our military gets, with the M107A1 designation. We see with our Knights Armament Rifles, Schmidt & Bender scopes, Remington Defense rifles, etc. that military markings always drive up price further down the road when the rifles are no longer offered.

FROM BARRETT:

It may be related to the Model M82A1, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side. The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

Suppressor-ready muzzle brake. Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet. Accepts M1913 accessory rails. Thermal cheek guard. Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail. Model:M107A1 Caliber:.50 BMG Operation:Semi-Automatic Rifling Twist:1 turn in 15” (38.1 cm) Magazine Capacity:10 Rounds

NIGHTFORCE NXS 5.5-22X56 MOAR ILLUMINATED!!

The Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 tactical scope gives the shooter a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. This NXS retains a slim profile and is easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems.

Nightforce uses outstanding glass and coatings in all their scopes, and the 5.5-22x50 tactical gives you superb resolution at high magnifications. It is the ultimate long range scope. The 50mm objective lens gives you maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This Nightforce scope gives the shooter precision accuracy at the longest ranges, yet at 5.5 power remains highly effective for shots at close ranges.

The MOAR reticle is an improved, more versatile version of the NP-R1 reticle. The MOAR has subtensions that are thicker than those of NF’s traditional reticles, which makes the reticle easier to see against dark backgrounds. The MOAR has 1 MOA spacing on the horizontal and vertical axis’, and this is a great tool for precise range-finding and hold offs. The first hash marks on the reticle are 2 MOA from center, and the crosshair is 1 MOA in length.

The new MOAR reticle has a floating center crosshair, and it allows shooters to bracket the target by using the box created by the first MOA lines. Plus, the MOAR reticle’s simplicity enables the shooter to rely more on the reticle than on constant turret adjustments.

From Nightforce:

Originally developed for the U.S. military’s extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, both 5.5-22 Nightforce NXS models provide a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. These characteristics, combined with the extreme ruggedness and reliability of every Nightforce riflescope, make them ideal for even the largest calibers. The slim profile of the 5.5-22 x 56 NXS makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. Its superb resolution at high magnification opens an entirely new world of extended range shooting for the accomplished marksman; Nightforce shooters are now accurately reaching to 2000 yards and beyond."

Rare S&W 396 .44 spl. These guns were made a very short time only due to the unpopularity of the caliber at the time. Everyone wanted the .44 Mag. at the time. Now they are popular and hard to find. The 396 I'm told was made for only 9 months. I called S&W and they have no plans to make more. Most people don't know that S&W made a .44 Spl on the L frame and as the word gets out these guns will become even more sought after and very rare. Try to find another one for sale even now. Those who do have one like it too much to sell. You lucked out to find this one for sale. I like that the 396 NG .44 Spl. has a steel barrel and steel cylinder unlike the other S&W Night Guard models which have alloy cylinders. I have a 396 and a 696 that I shoot and can verify they are fantastic weapons that I won't be without.

It's a great gun but I've decided I'm just not a Glock guy.  I want a safety for how I intend to use it.

I also have a green Veridian laser that I bought out of the Cabelas bargain cave.  It was an open package but new.  I've shot with it once and it works great.  I'd be happy to sell the laser for $160 with or without the gun.  No ID is needed to buy laser.

To buy this gun you need to have cash, be at least 18 years old, show valid ID and a show PTP or CCW.  If you want a bill of sale I can do that.

I am also willing to trade for a high-power revolver (.44 mag, .454 Casull, .30 carbine, etc.), a Beretta 96 or a 1911."
