Russian SKS with an aftermarket Dragunov stock. The rifle action is very tight; no slop in the bolt or gas tube like you find with some sks from other countries. Cycles perfectly.

Russian SKS always sell for more than any other SKS.

Includes removable mag. Also has the Tapco extended mag release installed on it. Dust cover has an aftermarket scope rail on it. 

The stock does have scratches, wear, etc..., but is a tight, solid fit. The scope rail was on it when I bought it and the person switched the dust cover, so this does not have the original dust cover. Except for the dust cover, all other numbers match.

This is a used rifle and has bluing worn off in spots, so don't expect a safe-queen.

Must be US Citizen, able to legally buy and own a firearm and have a Valid Colorado Driver's License for Bill of Sale.

If you need to pay by credit card/Paypal, I'm willing to accept payment via paypal, but need to charge an extra $15 to cover their fee."

Fiocchi’s Exacta™ .22 LR Super Match ammunition has won more Olympic Gold , Silver and Bronze Medals than we can count… the last one being the Silver won by Ralph Schumann of Germany in Beijing , in the rapid fire pistol event. Fiocchi is proud to be among the few manufacturers left in the world who produce true .22 LR Super Match ammunition. Starting from our exclusive priming mixture and priming system ( the mixture is not “ spun “ in the rim but is pressed in the same ) , guaranteeing an even burning ratio and minimal standard deviation and delay of ignition , to the precision drawing of the case always gauged for the precise orthogonality , to the specially lubricated bullets , loaded using a unique process that prevents bullets from touching one another to ensure the loaded bullet integrity , all of these factors are contributing , together with exclusive powder mix , to the small “ miracle “ of an ammunition which has no peers in the arena.

Asking $ 125.00 for the 500 rounds. Don't like my price? What is yours (no low-balls)

It has 120,000 miles and has been taken care of. Its 4wd has cold air/cruise and tilt wheel, all the premiums. The vehicle was rolled over into a snow bank in 2007 but immediately towed to the dealer and gone through, this happened to the previous owner, he just never had the body panels replaced. Recently I had the rear end gone through installed new ball joints in the front end, and front track-bar. also freshly installed is a new heater core. It has 35"" tires with about 40% tread left. The truck hasn't had any problems for the 3 yrs I've had it, I just don't need a pickup any more. Also installed is a alpine stereo and Sony speakers all the way around. It has a tan leather interior with a small tear in the drivers seat but its not enough to make a difference while driving this beast. It has a remote starter and alarm from first tech professionally installed. The front bumper is from buckstop with piaa's installed into factory harness. It also has cat-back high flow exhaust and K&N cold air intake. I just recently replaced all the head lights to silverstars and serviced the transmission and axles, fuel pump and brakes last summer. It does have a black glass-tite topper now, just didn't have it on at that time. I know if you need to tow something or go offroad this can get the job done, I haven't towed with it and I know the previous owner didn't either. It has spent very little of its life in snow and salt the majority was spent in Florida. You can also text or call REDACTED WILL TRADE for a street bike"

When it's a private seller DON'T SEND MONEY.

Each case has one common denominator:
You sent money to a total stranger. It's 2013.
We're talking about guns & ammo. Don't trust
anyone to keep their word when it comes to sending
you what you expected AFTER they have your money.

.223 I have less than a dozen boxes of PMC Bronze (55gr Boat Tail) (their marksmanship/target rounds) - Same story as above, $19/box or $90/5 boxes - delivered.

.22lr is all gone

Check http://ammoseek.com to see the prices prople are actively paying for this ammo, when it's available. I know the prices seem high, but they've been high for months, and this is for people looking to shoot. The idea here is that I have the ammo in quantity, so you're not camping out in the gun store parking lot buying one box at a time. This is a lot like buying toilet paper from 7-11; if you need it, the price isn't the biggest concern.

The 5.56/.223 is all first-run factory production, and you get the quality brass that goes with it, NOT STEEL CASES.

**NOTE: .223 is USUALLY perfectly safe to fire in systems chambered for 5.56, but the inverse/opposite is NOT the case. We're talking 50,000 PSI a few inches from your peepers- better to ask questions and play it safe than blow pieces of your weapon (or yourself) into the guy standing next to you."

XTREME MFG. AT-47

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench. [It is currently priced at $899 MSRP from ATI]

    ANECDOTAL:
    Broker—While I liked the smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy – I thought the stock and grip too small and a bit awkward.

    Mac—The good news for my friend is that Xtreme is designing a completely USA crafted AK with an adjustable stock (that’s a story for another day).

    Deacon—The all American AK has been a long time coming. Since enactment of Bubba’s infamous assault weapons ban, perfectly good weapons have been mutilated overseas, stripped of the essentials and imported piecemeal to be rebuilt with selected U.S. components to make superior or inferior rifles depending on what side of the argument you choose to take. Having fired Soviet Bloc milled units in the past, I was pleased to see this rifle introduced by Xtreme Mfg.
    The inherent greatness of the AK has been its low cost of manufacture, the simplicity of the machines needed to stamp out the parts by the score and readily field a combat ready weapon. Tolerances are loose by design and while this built in “rattle” provides us with a weather proof rifle, it also leaves us wanting for accuracy. The 7.62 X 39mm round has been badly maligned as being inaccurate. It ain’t the round, it’s the marriage of receiver, bolt and chamber that seats the round, properly spaces the projectile and preps it for our hands to send on its way. I have a friend in the North East who has been hunting deer for years

    Broker: While I liked the Xtreme's smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy, I thought the stock and grip were too small and awkward.

    with what he calls “Russian rounds” from a Savage bolt action with a Douglas Barrel he had chambered for the 39mm. He takes a ribbing for using the stuff but everyone enjoys his venison stew and that’s where the laughter stops.
    It seems from all objective results that Xtreme has tightened tolerances and given us a solid receiver that will shoot on par with any AR upper chambered in the same round. If they pass on importing foreign furniture and sights and build entirely from U.S. components we’ll all benefit.
    Made in America. You have to love that. Sure there is room for improvement but the folks at Extreme are listening to the guys in the field and tweaking as I write.Gun Reports Home >> Special Reports

I bought this new about 8 years ago. It has had MAYBE 20 rounds put through it. 
Other than dispatching a couple of raccoons all I’ve fired it for was to pattern the round of the day. For me it was a home defense weapon but I’m really just not a shotgun guy. The gun does have a few scuffs and scrapes in the parkerized (?) finish. Although I usually put it in a sleeve if it was going in the truck I did not always do so. There is a little scuff on the magazine tube where I had a homemade sling mount. Functions perfectly. Bore is perfect. 

In addition to the gun as pictured you get:
1) the original heat shield – I took it off because it added some weight and I never envisioned firing this enough to heat up the barrel. 

2) Full tactical pistol grip type long stock and the CORRECT bolt for attachment (as opposed to the one they sent). I think I paid just over $50 for the stock. It also has a series of spacers and stuff for mounting on guns other than this Mossberg. 

I also have 77 Rounds of Fiocchi Low recoil 00 Buckshot. I fired 3 rounds for the pattern. Very nice. Like anything even remotely “tactical” – good luck finding any of this ammo right now. I saw an ammo can of 80 rounds of this same stuff for $150 at the Puyallup show. I was going to include this in the listing but I left the ammo at my cabin near Ellensburg. It will be about 2 weeks before I can go back there to get it but if you are interested please let me know and we'll figure something out. Add $75 for the ammo."

Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser 

LaserLyte® answers the growing demand for lasers specific to the increasingly popular conceal carry market with the new Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser (CK-AMF). At half the cost of a leading competitor, the CK-AMF fits on the side of the Ruger LCP and the Kel-Tec .380 and .32. Easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock pins with the new screws (included).  Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target. The CK-AMF design works also as a finger guide that allows for safe trigger control without blocking the laser beam. The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. The side mounted laser allows the pistol to fit in virtually any nylon pocket holster. The new LaserLyte Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser is compact and light, and foremost -- deadly

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. 

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, because people do not always follow through with purchases, and we can lose guaranteed sales if a firearm is not available because we’re holding it for someone.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

I magpulled everything out on it to include the extra thick butt pad. I changed the buffer tube to mil spec, and changed the slugs in the buffer from steel to tungsten to reduce the recoil. The way it is all set up now it shoots very straight with very little muzzle rise. It's very smooth. You also get a survival strap sling and 5 magazines that are fully loaded with brass .223 ammo (150 rounds). 3 of them are mag pul and 2 are standard steel.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. 

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, because people do not always follow through with purchases, and we can lose guaranteed sales if a firearm is not available because we’re holding it for someone.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."
