Designated with the “AM” (Anderson Manufacturing) moniker to set them apart from traditional “AR” (Armalite Rifle) models, Anderson Manufacturing rifles offer design and build quality that exceeds that of other firearms manufacturers around the world along with RF-85, a proprietary metal treatment.

Anderson Manufacturing employs a proprietary metal treatment for all its rifles that reduces friction on all the steel surfaces by 85%, resulting in a more efficient and reliable weapon. Known as RF-85 (reduce friction 85%), the treatment offers significant benefits such as faster cycle rates and cooler operating temperatures. This results in significantly less wear on the weapon, thereby increasing its life. In addition, an RF-85 treated weapon does not need any lubricants. As such, the weapon experiences fewer failures due to excess dirt and carbon fouling in the action, thereby increasing its reliability.

The rifles have a lifetime limited warranty

And they had a limit of one per person. So please don’t waste your time as well as mine by low-balling. I am pretty firm on the price.

Only 50 rounds of FMJ have been fired. Beretta catalog code J9A9F10. I love the way this gun shoots and how well it fits my hand. I've decided I don't need another full size pistols nor do I need a safe queen. I purchased this from a reputable Beretta dealer in May of 2012. I had them get me a new unopened box from back stock because I didn't want a display gun that's been over-handled or abused by someone ignorant. I hate watching people ""let the slide fly"" when the examine display guns. I took it to the range and shot 50 rounds of FMJ. I then cleaned it (correctly) and wiped it down with a TruRecoil synthetic oil gun wipe. Barrel is a mirror as you'd expect from a well cared-for pistol in a dry safe. I never did shoot rounds out of the 17 round factory mags. This is a great handgun with a hell of a reputation.

The Model 92A1 represent Beretta’s evolution of the world famous 92FS pistol.
 Combining the best elements of the 92FS and the 90-Two,these pistols feature:
 A. Higher capacity magazines: 17 rounds in 9mm.  Completely interchangeable with other 92 family magazines. THREE magazines included per pistol.
 B. Removable front sight: Allows the user to easily replace a damaged sight or replace it with an accessory sight.

C. Accessory rail: The frame of the A1’s have an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
 D. Internal recoil buffer: Increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver created by the more powerful .40 S&W caliber ammunition.
 E. Captive recoil spring assembly: The single-piece design simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss.
 F. Rounded trigger guard: Updated styling to conform with current pistol gripping practices.

92 FS. A LEGENDARY FIREARMS. 
The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
 The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.

this is the information i could find pertaining to the ""BLACKJACK"" edition.

2HBCT= 2nd Heavy Brigade Combat Team
1CD = 1st Calvary Division
11-12 = DEC 2011

Also on 15 Decenber, exactly eight months to the day they cased their colors, Soldiers with the 2nd ""Black Jack"" Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division assembled again on Cooper Field and uncased their colors, marking one of the last units to leave Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn and allowing Soldiers to be home just in time for the holidays. The Brigade had operated primarily in the Northern Iraqi Joint Operations area.

Being home for the holidays came as a surprise to the Black Jack Soldiers. They didn't know until a couple of weeks ago that they would be back before the Christmas holiday, and they were very fortunate everything worked out.

Many Black Jack Soldiers agreed that being one of the last units to leave their footprint in Iraq made their numerous deployment rotations, loss of comrades and countless holidays away from loved ones well worth it."

This is a unique single shot .22 produced in 1886. There are few different verisons of this gun.  This one is complete (even has the steel butt plate).  Nickel coating on the barrel is mostly gone, but there is still all little left.  Stock is in great shape.  Barrel bore is so-so.  It appears that the are of takedown bolt (attaches barel to ""reciever"") was broken at some some point and welded back together.  

Has pull-back ""bolt"", and pivoting breech design.  Bolt does not stay back very well when pulled back, but all the parts appear to be there and in good shape...just needs a little tinkering.  Its missing the rear sight.  

Take a look at this.  Very rare item.  Can be shipped w/o FFL due to its age.  I guess this could be fired, but I wouldn't recommend it due only to its age.

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. 

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.

The 500AB is the 500A Mossberg shotgun with some upgrades...specifically a Walnut stock VS the various hardwood stocks found on the regular 500A model. This 500AB also has some metal etchings ,as seen in 1 photo, that the 500A doesnt have ...and it has a 30"" barrel. (Every part on this 500AB is interchangeable with the regular 500A)
This is a fixed full choke 30"" barreled shotgun. 30 inches is a long range shotgun. Perfect for Deer and Water Fowl...and predators of any nature. You get the 75-100 yard reach of a rifle, with the spread pattern of a shotgun. Full choke means it keeps it's shot pattern tight over a long distance, so you get killing/stopping power at rifle like distances. It shoots bird and buck shot...and rifled slugs. It is chambered for 2 and 3/4"" and 3.00"" shells. It functions flawlessly and it looks good. The bore is beautiful inside...slick as a whistle. It also has a metal safety switch, not a plastic one like the newer Mossbergs. It has a Tasco Red Dot scope, a good one, that enables quick sholdering and accurate firing of shotgun. For those folks who don't know what a Red Dot scope is: You turn the switch on and the red dot is displayed in the scope lens...when you look thru the scope, wherever the dot is - is where the bullet goes. If you move your head, the red dot stays on the target your pointing at and you can still see the dot as you move your head around. It makes for very quick and accurate shooting). I love this shotgun, and the new owner will too. I will trade this gun for a firearm other than a 12 gauge shotgun....of equal value."

Works really well in 223 & 308. Also works well in most short cases - 22PPC, 6mm BR, etc. This is not the best powder for long cases, 30-06, 300 Magnums, 338, etc. but it will work for plinker loads.

Asking price is per jug. Buy them both and I'll reduce the price to $250.00. Local transfer only, I am not going through the nonsense of HAZMAT shipping. 

Buy it now while you still can. Most reloading suppliers are sold out until the craze ends."

So how does this biometric fingerprint security box work? The fingerprint system uses a single finger swipe as its locking mechanism. The safe can handle a maximum of nine fingerprint templates which can come from multiple fingers of a single user or from nine individual people. Additionally, it can utilize a key-lock on the unit which can be used as an additional or alternate security measure. As long as the CVJR-G89 has power and is programmed with a fingerprint then only a registered user can open the box. If there are no registered prints then it can be opened with the key. This a simple but secure way to store your valuables in your car or at home.

Now everyone can store their belongings easily in even the most restrictive of spaces.


Highlights... 
Stores multiple user(s) fingerprints 
Access control at the touch of a finger 
Security cable & backup key included 
Fingerprint recognition takes less than one second"

We all know CA has the strictest laws and what they are proposing is flat out ridiculous!
We all know the US and the internet is all completely out of AR Lower Receivers and back orders are 6-12 months long. Also, complete built new or used AR-15s are ridiculous in price so why not buy a lower and complete the rest when prices are normal.
The Reason why the price is at a premium: I've been looking for an AR Lower for a month and a half now, I've spent countless hours trying to locate one and I actually had to camp out 10+ hours to get it. I bought 2 (1 to keep and 1 to sell). I also know FFLs around the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 for the background check. This is also a real machined lower, not a polymer one.

_____________________________________________
State of Washington 63rd Legislature 2013 Regular Session
By Representatives Pedersen, Hope, Jinkins, Hansen, Freeman, Kagi,
Walsh, Carlyle, Hunter, Clibborn, Ormsby, Cody, Green, Stanford,
Orwall, Maxwell, Liias, Pettigrew, Tharinger, Springer, Hudgins,
Wylie, Moeller, Fitzgibbon, Ryu, Roberts, Goodman, Riccelli, Farrell,
Fey, Appleton, Pollet, Habib, Bergquist, Moscoso, Santos, Reykdal, and
Hunt
Read first time 01/31/13. Referred to Committee on Judiciary.
1 AN ACT Relating to requiring universal background checks for
2 firearms transfers; amending RCW 9.41.080; creating a new section; and
3 prescribing penalties.
4 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:
5 NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature finds that there is broad
6 consensus that certain people, such as felons, minors, and
7 involuntarily committed persons, should not be eligible to possess
8 firearms for public safety reasons. Background checks are an effective
9 and easy mechanism to ensure that firearms are not sold to those who
10 are prohibited from possessing them. However, because background check
11 requirements apply only to transfers by licensed firearms dealers, many
12 firearms are currently sold without a background check, allowing felons
13 and other ineligible persons to gain access to them. The legislature
14 intends by this act to strengthen our background check system by
15 broadening the requirement for a background check to apply to all
16 firearms sales in the state.
17 Sec. 2. RCW 9.41.080 and 1994 sp.s. c 7 s 409 are each amended to
18 read as follows:
p. 1 HB 1588
1 (1) No person may deliver a firearm to any person whom he or she
2 has reasonable cause to believe is ineligible under ((RCW 9.41.040))
3 state or federal law to possess a firearm. Any person violating this
4 ((section)) subsection is guilty of a class C felony, punishable under
5 chapter 9A.20 RCW.
6 (2)(a) No unlicensed person may sell a firearm to another
7 unlicensed person unless the purchaser has undergone a background check
8 in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (2) and the
9 purchaser is not ineligible to possess a firearm under state or federal
10 law.
11 (b) A seller of a firearm to an unlicensed person shall request a
12 background check of the purchaser or transferee from a dealer or from
13 the chief of police or the sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the
14 seller or the purchaser resides. The background check shall include a
15 check of the national criminal instant background check system.
16 (c) The purchaser must complete an application to transfer a
17 firearm. The application shall be provided to the dealer or the chief
18 of police or sheriff conducting the background check.
19 (d) The department of licensing shall create and make available an
20 application to transfer a firearm for use by unlicensed persons engaged
21 in the sale or purchase of a firearm. The application shall include
22 the information required under RCW 9.41.090 for an application to
23 purchase a pistol from a dealer, and any other information the
24 department of licensing determines is appropriate.
25 (e) A dealer or a chief of police or sheriff who conducts a
26 background check for an unlicensed person under this subsection (2)
27 must indicate on the application whether the purchaser is eligible or
28 ineligible to possess a firearm under state and federal law based on
29 the results of the background check. A dealer or a chief of police or
30 sheriff may charge a fee for conducting the background check in an
31 amount not to exceed twenty dollars, plus any charges imposed by the
32 federal bureau of investigation.
33 (f) A person who sells a firearm to an unlicensed person in
34 violation of this subsection (2) is guilty of a gross misdemeanor
35 punishable under chapter 9A.20 RCW.
36 (g) For the purposes of this subsection (2), ""unlicensed person""
37 means any person who is not licensed as a dealer under this chapter.
HB 1588 p. 2
1 (h) This subsection (2) does not apply to the sale of an antique
2 firearm.
3 (i) This subsection (2) does not apply to, and is not intended to
4 alter the requirements of this chapter that apply to, the sale of a
5 firearm by a dealer licensed under this chapter.

This rifle was built using original Yugo parts and the required 922r compliant US parts on the very desirable NDS mfg. 1.6mm thick, correct type heavy receiver. Furthermore, the receiver also has the top cover take down pin assembly in place; a feature lacking on later models and imports. The front trunnion is the correct bulged, reenforced style (similar to the RPK). The rifle grenade launching gas block is present and functional, as is the bayonet lug and flip up night sights (white as shown). It INCLUDES the correct, somewhat rare 30 round Yugoslavian magazine which holds the chrome plated bolt carrier group open on the last shot fired. It was hand picked back around 2006 from a lot that Centerfire had. The rifle was assembled by Century and was professionally checked for any signs of sight base/gas block misalignment. It is good to go. The bore is in near new shape with very strong rifling (this rifle was NOT built using the sewer pipe barrels and worn out kits that were coming in the last few years). Fire control group is G2. Parkerized finish, 95%+. Furniture is original, in fantastic shape.  Has correct sling swivel loop on receiver. Barrel is threaded 14X1LH with flash hider. Includes correct magazine, cleaning rod, and magazine pouch. Round count is low, maybe 200 rounds fired total. For in state residents, I can take cash, money order, CREDIT OR DEBIT +3% and will deliver anywhere between Lexington and Morehead on I64. I will ship to your FFL if you are a non KY resident, just need a copy of your FFL first. Drivers license required for proof of age and state of residence. Will trade towards an RPK74 parts kit but not interested in anything otherwise. Pictures follow. Thanks for looking.

Comes with tac case seen in pics, and factory har case with all paperwork and lock. For the right offer I have 420 rounds of ammo as follows: 120 XM green tip 5.56 ""penetrator"", 100 eagle brass.223, and 200rds of Tula .223
 $1600 or best offer, don't need to sell, offers close to asking price will get all the ammo with it. Possible trades, if they are in my favor, Im very picky on guns I like, but throw it out there, worst I can say is no.

The bolt on rear iron sight is made by Smith and Wesson for their M&P series rifles, and is only slightly used. The ATI quad rail is very solid, and includes a modest rail cover setup of 2 tan ladder rails and several rubberized ATI rail covers. The lower is a polymer lower from New Frontier Armory. It is extremely solid, fits very tight with the upper, and has a very crisp trigger pull.  I put a decent penny into this rifle, but am open to offers. Worst I can say is no.

This rifle was built using original Yugo parts and the required 922r compliant US parts on the very desirable NDS mfg. 1.6mm thick, correct type heavy receiver. Furthermore, the receiver also has the top cover take down pin assembly in place; a feature lacking on later models and imports. The front trunnion is the correct bulged, reenforced style (similar to the RPK). The rifle grenade launching gas block is present and functional, as is the bayonet lug and flip up night sights (white as shown). It INCLUDES the correct, somewhat rare 30 round Yugoslavian magazine which holds the chrome plated bolt carrier group open on the last shot fired. It was hand picked back around 2006 from a lot that Centerfire had. The rifle was assembled by Century and was professionally checked for any signs of sight base/gas block misalignment. It is good to go. The bore is in near new shape with very strong rifling (this rifle was NOT built using the sewer pipe barrels and worn out kits that were coming in the last few years). Fire control group is G2. Parkerized finish, 95%+. Furniture is original, in fantastic shape. Has correct sling swivel loop on receiver. Barrel is threaded 14X1LH with flash hider. Includes correct magazine, cleaning rod, and magazine pouch. Round count is low, maybe 200 rounds fired total. For in state residents, I can take cash, money order, CREDIT OR DEBIT +3% and will deliver anywhere between Lexington and Morehead on I64. I will ship to your FFL if you are a non KY resident, just need a copy of your FFL first. Drivers license required for proof of age and state of residence. We are an 07FFL but this rifle is a private sale by the owner and is from his personal collection. Will trade towards an RPK74 parts kit but not interested in anything otherwise. Pictures follow. Thanks for looking."
