For sell is a Hi point C9 in great shape has around 2000 rounds through it. The gun has had a trigger job and has a 3lb pull vs the stock 9lb pull. I think the stock grips are slippery so I put grip tape on the grips and gun but if that's not your thing is comes right off. Also comes with a pair of custom cherry grips that are showing some wear but still work great.

Gun also has a fully transferable warranty so if anything ever breaks or doesn't work the factory will fix it free of charge, no questions asked. The warranty is so good you could throw it off a hotel and they'll still fix it.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

Innovative Cam-Lock System Completely Removes Any Slop or Play Inherent with Collapsible Stocks
Will Fit Both a Mil-Spec or Commercial Sized Buffer Tube
Weighs Only 7.3 oz.
Rugged Enough to Pass a 36"", Fully Loaded Drop Test

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the ultimate refinement in AR/M4 stock technology. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. Our stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle.

This rifle has a picatinny rail on the gas block instead of the fixed front sight, so it is ready for the optic of your choice. The Sig M400's have a 1:7 twist mil-spec chrome-lined barrel, an ambidextrous magazine release, mil-spec tube, and ambidextrous quick disconnect sling mounts built into the lower receiver. 

For those looking for an optic-ready platform, the SIGM400 SRP removes the front sight tower and replaces it with an M1913 railed front gas block. This sight-ready platform allows the operator to mount any optic without worrying about the sight tower. The gas block accepts all iron sights designed to work on the Mil-Spec Picatinny rail.

THE SIGM400 SERIES TACTICAL RIFLE, designed for use in law enforcement, military operations, or the sporting field as well as competitive shooting. The SIG M400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle. Provides unparalleled accuracy, with a 16"" chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel that provides maximum durability and corrosion resistance. A 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability.

It is Russian made. If you look up the reviews this thing gets GREAT ratings (especially for the price). This thing is dang accurate for an AK! I was thoroughly impressed. It is about 2 months old and I've put about 150-200 rounds through it. The only reason I am selling is because I already have 2 other AK's and just don't really need this one. It hasn't been modified or upgraded in any way - it comes exactly how I got it from the store. It comes with #1 30-round mag and #1 10-round mag. I also have quite a bit of 7.62x39 ammo and I would be willing to sell some of that separate if you need. I'm not including the ammo with this sale because my other AK's also use it and so I would like to keep some of it. Let me know if you have any questions!

I purchased it about 2 months ago along with 2 other AK's and so I just don't have the need for all 3 of them. If you check out the reviews for Romanian AK's you'll see that they are top of the line. In fact, many people say they are the best AK's you can get. I've put about 150 rounds through it so far and it shoots perfectly. Hasn't jammed or mis-fired at all (the beauty of an AK - they NEVER jam or mis-fire haha). It's made with real wood (not composite). Some people prefer the composite but the ones that come with real wood tend to always cost more. None-the-less, it's a pretty classic looking AK. It also comes with #4 30-round mags. I'm alittle flexible on the price but these things have been going WAY up in price the past several months. Those prices may come down, who knows. But for now, I think what I have it listed for is pretty reasonable (especially with the mags included). Let me know if you have any questions!"

He died in July of 2012. He loved this gun and told me it was great for shooting things that were far away. He said you could use it for hunting animals even small rabbits from several hundred feet away. He also used it for skeet shooting. He had a piece that helps you steady it on the ground (but that was not kept in the gun case so I need to find it) it has a redfield 4-12 power variable scope I might consider including. The gun is in a 1960's heavy duty locking flight case that I will include for an extra 200. I brought it to a gun shop and they said it was in mint shape except for one area of wear under the trigger and that they valued it at 850-950. However, they said they do not sell guns chambered for 6mm as that is not popular with their clientel. E-mail me for pictures if you are truly interested. I can get close ups of the beautiful checkered wood. It is a gorgeous gun. Half of the money will go towards paying for my next college semester the rest will go to my living expenses.

Do not contact me unless interested in the gun for the asking price or w/ a trade.
I understand you can buy this gun cheaper at SOME gun shops when they have them in stock, but that only comes w/ 1 magazine and in a cardboard box.  This comes in original HARD case w/ 2 magazines and 2 sets of safety/adjustment keys, owners manual and LIFETIME WARRANTY CARD!

Just bought this a couple weeks ago from a local shop.  Put about 40 rounds through it so practically brand new.  Awesome CCW gun (comes w/ inside waist holster).  Comes with original hard case, owner manual, 2 magazines, and 2 sets of keys for safety/sights.  Only reason I'm selling is to get a revolver that I fell in love with.

Two 20 round PMAG magazines, cleaning kit and sling are included. Never fired and only been out the box to take the pictures. 

This Colt AR 6720 model is extremely rare hard to get. 

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor. 

The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability. 

The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones. 

The AR6720 is a hybrid of Colt’s Government Carbine model AR6520 and Colt’s Flagship M4 Carbine model LE6920. This Lightweight Law Enforcement Carbine has a roll mark of AR-15A4- recognizing Colt’s newest designation of an ORC (optics ready carbine). 

Caliber: 5.56mm (.223Rem) Method of Operation: Gas; Direct system; Locking bolt Magazine Capacity: 2-20rd (30rd optional) Weight w/o Magazine: 6.12 lbs Length (stock retracted): 32in Length (stock extended): 35in Barrel Length: 16.1in PENCIL Barrel Sight Radius: 14.5in Effective Range: 600m Front Sight: Adjustable Rear Sight: MATECH target sight adjustable for windage and elevation Handguards: Standard carbine with heat shield 

Payment terms are USPS Money Order or major bank certified check (Chase Bank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citibank, etc). 

Price is $2000.00 + $40 UPS Ground shipping CONUS to your FFL. AK/HI/PR etc may be additional. Insurance is additonal and at buyer's discretion. Buyer agrees to pay their FFL transfer fees.

If your willing to pay shipping I will gladly ship it after payment clears. Shipping quotes were around $75+ for both packages to the west coast. If you don't live that far from Illinois it would be less but not sure by how much.
Up for sale, I have a used FNH PS90 5.7x28 bulpup rifle carbine. I'm selling do to budget constraints and for no fault of the weapon. I love shooting this gun it is a blast to use and enjoy. I just have to sell something to pay off some bills. 
It has about 500 rounds through it and I'm including the empty once fired brass that I was saving. It has the Highly desirable Gen 2 trigger pack. You know the one (black hammer and gray body) I'm talking about. It comes with the original box and the owner’s manual.

I bought a  Condor brand 28"" tactical rifle case in digi camo for getting it to the range and back home safely, that will be included. It includes a Condor brand Misc. pouch and 2 double magazine holders. The magazine pouches are a generic. But they work with the bag very well.
I still have 4x50 round boxes of FN SS197SR and 2x50 round boxes of the American Eagle brand. 300 rounds total. It also comes with 105 rounds that were loaded in magazines that will be shipped loose (no boxes). I didn't think I could mail them loaded in the magazine so I took them out. It will come with 5-50round magazines and one 30rounder. Two of the 50rounders are original FNH brand and the rest are the ATI branded ones.  

The Factory optic is not included. Sorry I sold it when I thought I'd have this rifle forever with no intension of letting it go. I am including the Vortex Optics StrikeFire red dot system that I replaced the original sight with. It has the attached 2 power magnifier in a TROS USA Aimpoint Low Profile scope mount. The battery was original so I will put a new one in the box for you. The box and manual will be included as well.

Please know the law where you live. If it is not legal for you to own this firearm (magazine capacity, or any other restriction pertaining to this weapon) please don't place a bid. It must ship to an FFL, check that your FFL will except a shipment from a non-FFL. Some don't so please check. If I have to send it through an FFL the buyer will pay an additional $25.00 for my FFL to complete the transaction. Shipping will be through UPS and will be paid by the winning bidder. Shipping will be with insurance and Signature on delivery. If your FFL Cannot transfer the firearm to you for legal reasons your refund will be minus the cost of insured return shipping and a 10% fee for wasting time.

The ammo MUST be shipped separately due to Federal regulations. So factor that into the price of  shipping quote. I got this quote off UPS based on a few random zip codes. I don't want to overcharge for shipping so when I know the winning bidder's address I can get you a more concrete shipping total. I package very securely. I like to pack the way I'd want it to arrive if I had bought it. The rifle will ship in the Condor rifle bag to ensure safe delivery. I will also include a safe desiccant to provide a little safety against moisture. It can be reused over and over. Keep it in your ammo box or where ever you'd like. You must be 21 or over to place a bid. This ammo is considered by some to be pistol ammo (Five SeveN). By placing a bid you are stating that it is lawful for you to purchase/ possess the items in this auction.
I have pictures but none are less than the total limit they are allowing. I will gladly email pics upon request. I will try and add a link to the Photobucket page where they are hosted. Not sure if this will work or not.
I'm willing to negotiate the price. 
Just copy and paste the following to a new window for a slideshow of 44 pictures.

I have another rifle I want to buy from someone so I must let this go. I had it listed for 1800 but I've dropped the price down to 1500 so I can get my hands on this new gun while I can. This Smith has only had 30 rounds through it (1 mag) to test function which went fine. It's a smith and wesson m and p 15, it's not the cheap sport model.. it's all mil spec, optics ready. I've also replaced the handguard with a Daniel Defense omega 7.0 free float rail system. These rails are impossible to find right now and are cost $250-270 if you can find them. They are brand new and already installed on the gun. It's also got a magpul CTR stock ($100) and a houge grip ($30) installed on it.

The gun is in ""brand new"" like mint condition with only 1 mag through it and functions like a champ. Only reason I'm getting rid of it is because I desperatly need the money to buy another rifle.

Stoeger Model 2000 Semi-Auto Shotgun, 12 Gauge, 24"", 3"" Chmbr, APG Pistol Grip Stock, 31564
The Stoeger Model 2000 is licensed to use Benelli's Inertia Driven operating system �� the heart of the world's most prestigious and reliable autoloaders. The Stoeger Model 2000 is Inertia Driven with only two moving parts in the bolt: the bolt body and the rotating locking head. Simplicity ensures reliability and the Model 2000 is quickly gaining a reputation as the most reliable semi-automatic on the market in its price range.Unlike common gas-operated guns whose fore-ends conceal operating rods, pistons, O-rings, valves and other moving parts, the inertia recoil system is primarily contained inside the receiver. The results? A trimmer fore-end, better balance, more reliable operation and the ability to fire everything from light target ammunition to the heaviest waterfowl loads without adjustments. And because propellant gas isn't vented from the barrel into the operating system, Inertia Driven guns like the Model 2000 stay cleaner, even after hundreds of shots. Even under the toughest conditions, your new Model 2000 will keep on firing! Reliability, versatility and value are what you expect in a semi-automatic shotgun and no other semi-automatic in its price range even compares to the Model 2000.STANDARD FEATURESCHOKE TUBES: C, IC, M, IM, XF, and wrench.FINISHES: Realtree APG HD, Advantage Max-4 HD, Advantage Timber HD, Black synthetic or Satin walnut.SIGHTS: Red bar front sight.

I just bought a 2013 Chevy Silverado and had a lift kit and new wheels & tires installed.  The stock wheels & tires are now sitting in my garage collecting dust, so this is your oppertunity to get a great deal and not pay retail price!!!   The wheels & tires are stock Chevy 18"" 5 Spoke Machined Silver w/ Goodyear Wrangler P265/65R18 112T.  This package is brand new with only 18 miles on them!!!!  If you bought these from the dealership they would cost you approx. $2,100 without installation.  You might be able to find them online for around $1,700.  Will fit any 2007 - Present: Avalanche, Tahoe, Silverado, Sierra, Suburban.    I have all center caps and lugnuts as well.

THE WORLD’S FASTEST TACTICAL SHOTGUNS
 The SLP™ (Self-Loading Police) shotgun is the world’s fastest cycling tactical shotgun. The smooth gas-operated action offers exceptional reliability and substantially reduced felt recoil for the fastest possible follow-up shots; it makes the SLP™ ideal for 3-gun practical competition. The NRA American Rifleman Magazine named the SLP™ its Shotgun of the Year in 2009.

The SC 1™ Over/Under shotgun establishes a striking new standard in both performance and appearance that sets it apart from traditional over and under shotguns. This first generation of the SC 1™ was designed for a small number of competitors and die-hard FN owners, but with enormous amount of interest from customers there are already plans for producing a second generation of the shotgun."
