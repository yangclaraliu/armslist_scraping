These are BRAND NEW to the market. They are loaded loaded by Fiocchi using Fiocchi brass (and I would assume other components as well) and are branded for Tula (box is marked ""Made in Italy""). Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 2 boxes available (100 rounds total). Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

What you see is what you get. Ten used military issue M4 mags that will work for any STANAG (Mossberg MVP, AR-15, Bushmaster etc) style 556/223. These are all 30 rounders with the green follower. They are dirty and they have seen field use so of course they have the scratches etc to show for it. However one of them is even dated and marked which if you look online are being sold for $100 a pop now (the logic being if they are banned then this one is obviously 'pre-ban' due to the date etc). 

Terms are simple, $250 gets the lot, wont break it up, has to be FTF in Gulfport. Will also trade the entire lot for a working Ruger 10/22 as thats all im going to do with the $250 anyway."

FS/FT, my Savage .22lr target rifle.  This is my tack driver.  It shoots single-hole groups at 25 yards, dime-sized groups at 50 yards, and 2.5”-3.5” groups at 100 yards.  It’s a beautiful and comfortable rifle that is a blast for plinking.  The AccuTrigger feels like a two-stage match trigger, and has a very crisp break.  Comes with a case, two extra 10-round Savage magazines, and 640 rounds of ammunition.  I’m also willing to sell the scope and bipod if you’re looking for a complete and ready-to-go target rifle.  I’m only discounting them 20%, because I really like them and would be just as happy keeping them to use on a different rifle.  

Rather than go on and on about the details of the individual parts, I’ve provided some links below that I used as reference when I bought it.  I have all of the paperwork for the rifle, as well as the key to adjust the AccuTrigger.  I’ve also got the original box, packaging, and manual for the scope.  

•	Savage Mark II BTVS rifle (21” stainless-steel bull barrel, AccuTrigger adjustable as low as 1.25 pounds without sacrificing safety)
•	(1) Savage 5-round magazine, stainless-steel
•	(2) Savage 10-round magazines
•	Flambeau rifle case
•	(1) unopened 550-round brick of Federal .22lr
•	Approx. 90 rounds Federal Target Grade Performance .22lr
•	Intensity Optics 6.5-20x44 scope
•	Blackhawk Sportster bipod

The rifle has an MSRP of $495.  I bought it for $450 about three years ago.  I have seen it advertised online for as low as $417, but it is out of stock everywhere.  My local Sportsman’s Warehouse is selling it for $500.  In addition to the rifle, I’m including approximately $120 worth of extras: 
•	$40 for the magazines (savage.com)

•	$60 for the ammunition (which is going for about $50 per brick online right now).

I’m selling it all for $400.  I paid $150 for the scope and bipod, and will include them installed, zeroed, and ready to go for an additional $120 (20% off of what I paid).  I would consider trading for a .223, .308, or .260 rifle.

I’m located in Lone Tree.  I will require a copy of your Colorado ID and a completed bill of sale.  If you show me a valid concealed weapons permit, I’ll knock another $20 off.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions!  Thank you!

NOTE: I HAVE SEVERAL MORE PICTURES AVAILABLE, BUT WASN'T ABLE TO UPLOAD THEM.  PLEASE EMAIL ME, AND I WILL SEND YOU LINKS FOR THEM.

One of the world's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models, the Bushmaster M4 features the distinctive M4 barrel profile and a six-position telestock for ease of deployment. The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a ""birdcage"" type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9 right-handed twist. Shipped complete with 30-round magazine, a safety and operations manual, and a carrying sling.

Not advertising it as perfect, could use some restoration, and in the long run would preform better than the new Wingmasters (God forbid an express?) without having that ugly gold colored trigger they started adding to all of them.

- has scratches and fading on the bluing, no rust.
(I'll take an older fading and scratched Wingmaster over a new Express any day, ask around why, I've left the bluing as it is rather than strip the blue and redo it since factory bluing is irreplaceable in quality and durability, whether you DIY or professional)
- current extractor spring is broken, brownells has a replacement for $5.
(If I fix it myself I undoubtedly will end up keeping it)

*If you have an AR that has MILSPEC non-railed hand guards, I saw a rail attachment in Cabela's today that ran $20.00; good option if you want to mount a light and this foregrip/bipod set up on the cheap.

The second image is of a pretty nice Daniels Defense Sling mount.  It fastens on the buffer tube on a rifle with collapsible stock, and has a quick-detach sling swivel.  Sells or $41.00 new on their site, and everywhere else I've checked has them for $40-$50.  I've had it on a Mil Spec buffer tube, but *think* it will mount up just fine on a commercial tube as well.  Also comes with a pretty nice multi-point tactical sling with shoulder pad that cost $30.00 new.

Looking for $120.00 for the Accessory package (Mags, ammo can, etc), and $15.00 for the swivel sling mount with sling.  Will take $125.00 for both.  Also have additional mags for $15.00 each, if you buy the above items.

Note:  Will only ship if you pay actual shipping cost plus $10.00.  Preferred is FTF transaction in the Olympia area."

The Daniel Defense v7 Upper Receiver Group is built off the extremely popular v5 platform. We incorporated the new Modular Float Rail 12.0 to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rail sections is accomplished with little effort. This allows the shooter to customize the rail set up.

However, it was an impulse buy and my wife wants me to sell it.

It is brand new in a box. I am asking $175, which is couple of dollars less than what I paid for it. I am sorry I cannot accept lower. 

Background checks are over 1 week if you were to buy from a dealer. Buying online requires background check and fee for conducting the check which can cost $30+ and requires over 1 week waiting. If you are looking for immediate possession, here you go.

All I ask is that you sign my bill of sale and $175 cash. We can meet at a public place for the transaction. It really is a beautiful little pistol. It is made by same manufacturer as the old Jennings or Bryco. The company was bought out by the company foreman, Jimenez, therefore that is the name now stamped on the pistol.

Included is:

Original Box;
(1) J22 Chrome;
(2) six shot .22 LR magazines;
(1) specially designed trigger safety made for J22 only;
(1) warranty and instruction manual;
*Original factory lifetime warranty for all Jimenez....Made in USA....Las Vegas, NV.

Please do not contact me with any unreasonable offers, because I would rather keep it and deal with my wife. I have to get $175.
