The enhanced model comes with a folding stock, railed handguard, and AAC Blackout flash hider. Also included with this sale is the basic polymer handguard with small magpul rail segment attached, magpul MBUS flip up iron sights, and a magpul pmag 30 round magazine.

The ACR is operates with a piston system that is much cleaner and more reliable than a normal AR-15, and also allows for a folding stock.  The rifle also has a quick detach barrel system that allows the user to change calibers between .223, 300 blk, 6.8mm and 7.62x39 with the appropriate barrel assemblies without the need for any tools.

The rifle has around 2k rounds through it but is still in very good condition with only very small dings and scratches from use. There is wear on the moving parts such as the upper where the handguards slide on. The shell deflector also has a fair amount of wear as seen in the pics, but that is its purpose and can be replaced easily.

This rifle has been back to BM for the recall and has the titanium firing pin.

The rifle comes with everything shown in the pics, as well as the user manual. 

Only trade I would consider would be for a Sig 716 patrol newer model in black or a 16"" barrel POF P308 in either black or NP3 (16"" barrel, not the 14.5"" with pinned break)"

They have reduced the weight of the rifle by wrapping parts of the rifle in carbon fiber. I was amazed at how much lighter this CA-15 with bipod and scope was compared to other AR's that have no accessories added. If you wanted to shoot this rifle with a glove on, they have allotted plenty of space by the trigger to do so. The flash suppressor not only looks great, but is made of titanium, which is durable and light. My favorite part of this rifle is the fore end that has been contoured perfectly to fit your hand."

Wonderful gun but like I said I need to fund another project. The box, gun and two mags with finger plate will be included. Mine is the V1 configuration (DA/SA with decocker & safety) In 40c. It has standard sights as well. In addition I will include a kydex OWB holster (Fobus). Buyer will need a CCH or permit.

I really need the cash on this one so I would prefer not to trade. However, I will consider partial trades plus cash or maybe multiple trades.  Thanks for looking  $1,100 cash or $1,150 trade."

I have a few rare mosin nagant carbines. I am trying to free up space and afford a dragunov so these have to go. Since my asking price was not tempting, make me an offer.
FAIR OFFERS ONLY, im a collector I know what I have. Im willing to screw myself if it means me getting a dragunov sooner.. However if you send me an offer like $200 I will not reply.. You cannot even get an m44 for less than $220 ONLINE right now.. then add in shipping and ffl fee and you are paying $300+ for an UNKNOWN condition rifle.

What I have
1943 Izhevsk m44 (pretty uncommon as this was the first year of production and sent out to combat troops for testing)
1944 Tula m44 (again uncommon and only year of tula production of the m44)
1944 Tula m38, extremely rare tula produced m38.

All three rifles are refurbs, all three have excellent finish and very good bores. None have been altered in any way. Im a purist collector so I do not modify anything in my collection.
All are stamped matching but one of them has a floor plate line out and restamped to match.

Asking $40, which is less than I paid , plus shipping. Looking for a face to face sale, shipping ammunition is too difficult after looking into it locally. 

Here's a link to a sound comparison on YouTube, it's harder to hear the big difference on video, but it gives you an idea.

http://youtu.be/yamD1dlYC2o

Aguila Super Colibri Armmunition has no powder, relying on only the primer to propel the bullet down the bore. The result is an extremely quiet rimfire round, perfect for close-range pest control or quiet plinking. 
Will not cycle the slide of semi-automatic firearms.
Aguila packages these as Long Rifle ammunition, but they are in fact slightly shorter than a 22 Long cartridge

It began as a Palmetto State Armory premium 16"" M4. The barrel is chrome lined and.has a 1/7 twist rate, perfect for match grade and heavier 5.56 loads. The bolt and carrier group are also chrome lined and dry film coated for smooth operation and easy cleaning. Both upper and lower receiver are forged from 7075 Aluminum and the upper is equipped with a flat top for optics mounting.

The rifle and all components (except for the bolt carrier group which already had a dry film) were degreased, media blasted with aluminum oxide, and gassed out to remove all contaminants before having a high temperature ceramic Cerakote applied in Tungsten or Graphite Black. This is the absolute best finish you can put on a firearm to resist corrosion and scratches.

The ordinary rifle components of the pistol grip, handguard, and stock were upgraded and coated to match in Graphite Black. The handguard is a Troy Industries Alpha with a Troy low profile gas block. The stock is a Vltor E-Mod with waterproof compartments. The pistol grip is a CAA Mako 6-piece configurable for any hand size. The front grip is a Magpul AFG-2 angled foregrip.

Finally, a genuine new Eotech 512.A65 red dot reflex sight was added for close range optics.

The tiger stripe pattern is unique and 1 of a kind, and created by the folks at Coyote Rifleworks (www.coyoterifleworks.com), and has never been fired.
