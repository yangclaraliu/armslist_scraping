-For those of you who know about high quality parts you would have already figured out that this thing has $3500.00 into it. I will sell it for $2700.00 with optic or $2200.00 without.  Gun only has 200 rounds rounds down the barrel and functions flawlessly.  I have had many different variations on this rifle thoughout the years (since 2004) and rebuilt the entire thing with new parts about 6 months ago with parts that work!  The lower was refinished as well and does not show any signs of wear on the exterior.  This rifle has served as my law enforcement duty rifle and has never malfunctioned. The H buffer and heavy spring set-up are a perfect match for the carbine length gas system with 16"" barrel and will shoot anything from light-load .223 to heavier grain 5.56 loads.  Gun is in excellent condition and has no scratches!! You will not find a higher quality or better functioning rifle at this pricepoint.

STG 44 in 22 lr with 25 round magazine. It is all metal and wood made in Germany by GSG (Only thing Poly is the mag on this gun). The StG 44 is a full weight, almost exact replica of the original 8×33 Kurz rifle that is said to be the predecessor to the Kalashnikov AK47, as well as all of the other assault rifles spanning the decades after WWII. It comes in the Amish handmade wooden crate you see here in the pictures. As a collector’s item, the original StG 44 is out of the reach of most American collectors, in part because the original was select fire and therefore banned from import by the 1986 machinegun law. In semi-auto .22LR rimfire, not only can you own a gun with the original look and feel of the real StG 44, you will be able to shoot it cheaply, and it will itself be a big collector’s item as we go down the road.

Readily separated into two subassemblies, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger® 10/22®. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves which hold the subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

The 4.67-pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37″ long when assembled; each subassembly is less than 20 1/4″ long when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action and ten round rotary magazine (one magazine is provided), the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a compact and portable package."

With all the extras this would be 800+ dollars. I am obviously not going to charge someone that amount like some are asking for on here. ANY Glock mags are currently very hard to find and cost upwards of $45+ apiece new. I am looking to get around $700 for everything. This includes the gun, upgrades, ammo, case, and all factory parts. I am willing to entertain offers but please do not ask me to sell it for $500 as people have in the past with other weapons I have sold! 

**Would consider a trade for AR-15 only. I am not really in the market for handguns at the moment. I do realize what I am asking and I do realize that a lot of people prior to November made these guns for a LOT less than 800 bucks. Cheap lowers/uppers are starting to flood the market as well so please do not think I am out of my mind haha!"

Readily separated into two subassemblies, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger® 10/22®. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves which hold the subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

The 4.67-pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37″ long when assembled; each subassembly is less than 20 1/4″ long when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action and ten round rotary magazine (one magazine is provided), the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a compact and portable package."

This rifle was manufactured in 1894 so it is an antique with no FFL requirements.  The rifle is all original and has never been refinished or otherwise molested.  

The reciever is in very good overall condition with faint signs of case hardening remaining and little discoloration from rust.  The action is in excellent condition and functions flawlessly.  About 90% of the orignal bluing on the action.

The barrel shows about 80% of the original bluing with the magazine tube around 50%.  It has some tiny discoloration spots but no pits or other significant damage.  A couple little nicks from being carried in the field makes it in good original condition.  The chamber and bore of the barrel are in excellent condition.  Strong sharp riflings with no pitting.  This rifle is in perfect shooting condition, is accurate, and functions flawlessly.

The stock shows a few minor nicks and scratches from field use.  It's overflush everywhere, so it's never been refinished, and has no cracks or serious blemishes making it in excellent original condition.  It shows a bit of age darkening from 120 years of oil.

I purchased this rifle 15 years ago after looking for almost a year trying to find an all original, unmolested, and good shooting condition rifle.  These rifles are very hard to find or cost the U.S. mint.  

I've shared and shot the rifle with the few friends I can trust with it.  Now the rifle just sits locked up in the closet not getting any appreciation.  I don't dare display it as some of the people I know, know people, that would love to steal it.

It's time to let this old rifle go to someone who can appreciate it like I used to.  I've spent the last month searching the internet looking at all the 1886 rifles I could find trying to decide on a good selling price for this rifle.  The price tags on these rifles have just about doubled in the last 15 years!  Old Winchesters are great investments.

I found half a dozen rifles in similar condition, good shooters, all of them running in the $3000 to $4000 price range.  So that's the range that this rifle is worth.  I'd rather sell it than sit on it though.

I can make a nice profit off this rifle selling it at $2600 and that's a very good deal for the buyer.

The rigidly simple threaded mounting design provides reliable precision accuracy with minimal and repeatable zero-shift. Extraordinary sound and recoil reduction are two of the instant benefits of the CYCLONE silencer. Durability is maximized by fully CNC automated fusion welding of every high-temperature aerospace alloy component used in its construction- making 100% suppressed fire possible. The back-pressure lowering design of the silencer aids in shooter comfort, reduces weapon fouling, and minimizes cyclic rate increase. EDM technology is utilized as a final step to ensure precise bore alignment and enhance accuracy. The elimination of approximately 95% of the muzzle report nullifies the need for ear protection, facilitates field communications, and masks the location of the user.

This second receiver cover tightens up with factory set screws and lock down nuts so that it doesan't move once it's installed. Scope stays zeroed. It used to be that -older style receiver mounts, for this kind of scope, walked around a bit with rifle use, because of vibration, not this one, It stays put....ALSO,  You can see the iron sites with this 4x32 scope installed. The scope clears the sites. You can alternate from iron sites rimmediately to the 4x32.
Also comes with:
(1) shell deflector installed, to keep ejecting shells from hitting your 4x32 scope
Another scope (included) **see 3rd picture, this illustrates removal of first scope and installation of 2nd**is a quality projection Red-Dot scope. If you want to go ""Red-dot"" for quick shouldering and aiming (red-dot's faster than iron sites), you can loosen the 4 set screws and pull the pin on the scope mount receiver cover, and put on the original; then install the red dot in the scout position and your ready to go. I'll show you how to work it...it's simple and good quality.
It's a great sks. ONLY selling because I need the money. I will throw in a box of WOLF ammo, 20 rounds, with it. I have a bunch of ammo for sale too... fifty cents a round, as many as you want. I won't need it if the rifle is sold...and I can use that money too. fifty cents a round is what I paid for it so I'm just selling it at cost."

Reduces Reciprocating Mass To Soften Recoil


Lightweight, stainless steel bolt carrier has significantly lower reciprocating mass than a standard mil-spec carrier for softer recoil impulse on competition rifles. Helps limit felt recoil to get you back on target for fast follow-up shots. Lightening cuts reduce weight without sacrificing strength, and the forward assist serrations have been omitted for competition use. Extra-wide carrier rails have extra bearing surface to improve bolt alignment and reduce wear. Comes with carrier key installed and staked, and features a dust cover notch. For best performance and to minimize impact wear, use only in rifles with J.P. Low-Mass Recoil Buffer, Speed Hammer, and Reduced-Power Spring Kit, all available separately"

It is a glock 26 with night sights, the front is a XS big dot sight and I believe the rear is a warren tactical sight, the gun also has a polished feed ramp.
the gun comes with one factory mag with factory glock +2 extension so its a 12 rounder and one 10 round glock 19 mag with a grip sleave.
the down sides to the package are.
1) the condition of the gun is deacent not great its not beat up but does show some wear and the rear sight is kind of marred up on the sides (it does not affect the sights)
2) the 10 round glock 19 mag has a chipped follower so the slide wont lock back (it makes for a good drop mag at the range though)

Im asking 560 for the gun, I do not want to sell but could use the cash so please dont offer me lower. I figured if I could get what I need out of the gun i will let it go

 I also have 15 black talon sd rounds (google them) i will sell for 40. these were going for $75 for 20 with the box at the last gun show.

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. Comes in factory hard case as pictured with 2-13rd Mags, cleaning rod/brush & a speed loader!"

Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.

The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.
