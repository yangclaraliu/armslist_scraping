Winchester® Supreme® Centerfire Rifle Ammunition stands as the most technologically advanced line of centerfire rifle ammunition in history - a history 127 years in the making. In 1873, less than a decade after the Civil War and when Westward expansion was in full gallop, Winchester introduced the first successful centerfire cartridge: the .44 WCF (.44-40). Designed for double duty in both rifles and handguns, this is the cartridge that won the west. And to hunters and sportsmen wanting the ultimate ammunition for any big-game need, Winchester has been delivering ever since.

The brick price for 500 rounds is $45 but if you and some buddies get together then the case of 10 bricks is $400 you save $5 a brick. This ammo is worth the price it is standard volocity and shots very well. Google it and see what people say. It is the entry level Eley but it is still Eley. Thanks for looking

This shotgun is a blast to shoot! Capacity is 8+1 and the firearm's operation can switch from manual (pump) mode to automatic mode i bought if for $1600 but i am ready to sell for $1300 OBO. This shotgun is in fantastic condition and has been a safe queen it's entire life. Also, this shotgun as had the receiver buffer upgraded so that there is no concern of damaging the shotgun when firing in auto mode. For those that don't know, when the manufacturer originally made this gun back in the day, they made the receiver buffer (the part that keeps the bolt carrier from slamming into the aluminum receiver when fired in auto) out of a material that decays over time. Most spas-12 shotgun owners would be surprised to find if they opened their receiver on a shotgun that hasn't been upgraded, that their original buffer is probably totally gone. This shotgun has had that part replaced with a buffer made from modern material that will not decay. This firearm is so big it was hard for me to capture the whole thing in one frame so if there are other pictures you would like to see, or if you have any questions, please email me at dellbarnes206@yahoo.com. Please include $40 for shipping and thanks for looking!"

""For sale is a 1959 Chinese SKS from Factory 26. This is not a stamped made for export receiver made in the 80’s/90’s. This is an original military issue made with a milled receiver on Russian machines provided to China. 

What’s included and cost break down of each item:

1959 Factory 26 type 55 SKS- $499+ tax purchased in Oct 12’
Tapco Stock installed - $119+tax – Installed in Jan 13’
Tapco extended mag release ($4.99)
2- Tacpo 20 round magazines new in package- Purchased in Fed 13’ –never had a round put in them $55 with shipping (total for both magazines)
1 – ProMag 30 round magazine $39 + tax purchased in March 13’
1 ProMag 10 round magazine $29 + tax- used has about 40 rounds through it purchased in Jan 13’
1 ProMag 5 round magazine $29+tax used- has about 20 rounds through it, purchased in Jan 13’
Barska Scope and SKS mount kit $129 with shipping – Installed /function tested on the gun, but needs sighted in, purchased in Feb 13’ 
Other than the gun everything was purchased in the last 3 months and is still new in the box or has VERY little signs of wear, as I have only put about 60 rounds through it since it has been converted.

All of the OEM parts are included with it also; the OEM stock was in bad shape and got a quick camo paint job.

All said and done to build this gun, I have $950.46 in it, and that does not include the time spent to clean the layers of cosmoline out of it. I am not interested in selling any of the items alone and this is a package deal. 

I do have ammo that I would be willing to sell along with the package (you must buy the package to get the ammo) and I can sell 100 rounds of 7.62x39 for $30 ( 5 boxes of 20 for $6 each- I have Tula, Wolf, Wolf Mil-Classic HP, and Golden Tiger to choose from)

The second image is a pic of the SN with the last 3 removed, but you can look up the SN based on the first 4 to know what year it was built. Also shown is the original 26 Factory marking"""

Open Overall Length 7.63 inches 
 Intelligent design advocate Michael Behe coined the term ""irreducible complexity,"" which means ""a single system composed of several well matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function of the system, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning."" 

 It certainly describes this new folder by Glenn Klecker, award-winning knife and tool designer from Silverton, Oregon. He has named it after his son: Nathan's IRreducible complexity Knife, or NIRK™. There are just two well-thought out pieces, plus a blade pivot screw. 

 The innovation is Glenn's use of a single sheet of stamped and folded stainless steel to serve as the folder frame, back spacer, spring and lock, resulting in a solid lockback folder. The geometry of the cutout areas is critical, carefully calculated to provide just the right spring action when the rear of the spine is pressed. 

 At the front of the frame, the lock tab mates with a notch in the blade to provide safe lockup. The tighter the grip on the handle, the tighter the lockup, making this an exceptionally safe design. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to accidentally release the lock, and it is very, very strong. 

 When the blade is closed, the same lock tab ramps over a rounded detent to hold the blade in the closed position. 

 The high-carbon stainless steel blade is a utilitarian drop point shape with a deep belly, high hollow ground for easy cutting, and with a swedged top edge to aid penetration. It is a hefty 0.131"" thick. The blade can be opened with either hand using the oval thumb hole. 

 The 5185 tactical model receives a black oxide non-reflective coating, and has a Combined Razor-Sharp & Triple-Point™ Serrated edge. 

 The NIRK also comes with a stainless steel pocket/gear clip. 

 There you have it: a simple, flat, almost indestructible folder. All you need to do is oil and sharpen it occasionally and you have a friend for life. It is priced so you can afford several: one for the toolbox, one for the backpack, one for the truck, one for the boat, one for the survival kit. 

 In the knife world, it is a fine example of intelligent design.

Technical Specifications
•2-Step Serration
Serrations assist in cutting through particularly tough or fibrous material, such as rope or cord. The Kershaw 2-step serration is a more aggressive style of serration.

•Flipper
May be used on either manual or assisted opening knives. The “flipper” is a protrusion on the back of the blade that the user can pull back on, or flip, in order to move the blade easily out of the handle.

•SpeedSafe®
Assists you to open any SpeedSafe® knife quickly and easily with a manual push on the thumbstud or pull back on the flipper; built into many Kershaw best sellers.

•Liner Lock
Locks the blade open during use; one side of the knife’s steel “liner,” the steel plate to which the handle scales are attached, moves into position behind the blade to securely lock it open.

•Reversible
Pre-drilled holes in the handle enable the user to change either the tip position or the side on which the knife carries.

Additional Features
•SpeedSafe® assisted opening
