We have a litter, with one exceptional boy we are offering for sale.  His pedigree is as pristine as it gets.  Nearly every dog in his pedigree holds multiple champion titles. His grandsire was World Winner 2008 with many other titles. Please see for yourself, the website allows you to research there entire line: 

Grandsire http://ingrus.net/frbull/en/details.php?id=3393
Granddame: http://ingrus.net/frbull/en/details.php?id=6338

We are currently having professional photographs taken of this puppy.  However he is fawn with white markings and a black mask just like his father.  This puppy has potential to participate in any show around the world including Westminster.  We have taken this breeding very serious and will provide you any information you would like.

The puppy will be sold for a bargain price of $10,000 or we provide a $2,000 discount of $8,000 with agreement that he will be actively shown, as you can see this price is quite low for this quality of dog. We are doing this because we are confident in his abilities, and would like to request the second pick of the litter on his first breeding once he receives his champion title.  He is AKC and UKC registered for the reason of giving the buyer multiple opportunities to hopefully bring many purple ribbons to their home.   Opportunities like this only come once in a life time, this could be your chance to have something very special. 

The mother and father are very well mannered making perfect companions in for the home. You would be getting the best of both worlds. An easy going loving dog who also has potential to dominate the show ring.  
So you can say that by buying this puppy, you will not just have a pet but it’s like owning canine royalty.

We breed pups for show quality, health, beauty, and temperament.  Please email or text me at info@drjaredcooper.com/     801-674-9504 if you are interested in owning a truly outstanding French bulldog puppy.  The puppy is located in Utah, special travel arrangements can be made if needed.

An amazing gift for a younger shooter who likes cowboy guns...guaranteed you'll be their favorite parent/uncle/aunt/brother/sister/etc.  

-Thanks for looking...contact with questions or to set up a viewing...if the ad is still up the gun is still for sale!

-I'll need to see a valid Oregon drivers license and/or an Oregon concealed handgun license or NO SALE...no exceptions."

""The Target Grey stainless Ruger GP100 was one of our most popular double action special make up revolvers.

The GP100 has been the workhorse in Ruger's revolver line for years. When they started putting the Target Grey finish on some of their other stainless guns, several of the Lipsey's employees commented on how good it would look on a GP100. The Target Grey finish was applied by taking the stainless parts and putting them in a tumbler. This gave the stainless that darker almost titianium look. The guns came out very nice and now that Ruger doesn't do that finish anymore, it will be a great addition to any collection. ""

Our Price: 74.99

This case is designed to hold one or two of the M-4 carbines with a collapsible stock and a 16 inch barrel. It will also hold similar carbines with a collapsible stock, a folding stock rifle, or any other weapon that is under 35 inches in overall length. This 36-inch Voodoo Tactical brand padded rifle carrying case will help protect your rifle from the hard knocks of transportation, whether in your vehicle or in the field. It can also be used if you break down your gun or to carry different uppers. 

Inside are two sets of adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case that has foam only on two sizes or the flimsy egg-crate foam of some hard-shell cases. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement. 

Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories. 

This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six standard size magazines and the center pouch is even larger. 

This Voodoo Tactical gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

At is size, this is not an all-day range gun, but with the quality of construction and fit, fit and finish, it is also not a pocket toy. With the 8-round mag, I am as accurate with this as my G19...the slight weight increase over other compacts really shines when this baby is put into action. And the night sight are second to none.

It only shoots 2 3/4"" shells and it has no choke so you can shoot very heavy buckshot for home defense. This shotgun is decked out. Currently equipped on it is a pistol grip, a fold over top stock, a heat shield over the barrel and a long green fiber optic font sight. In it I include the original butt stock, a pistol grip only if you want to take off the fold over stock, a tactical sling, a side saddle shell holder and a pistol grip pump with the tools necessary for assembly. I am also throwing in around 30 rounds of regular steel shot game loads as well as my last three 00 Buckshot shells plus a neoprene holder the holds 5 shells. I have fired this self defense shotgun many times and it preforms flawlessly. Very compact little shotgun for home defense! There is only one flaw to this shotgun. Where the side shell saddle use to sit there is a round scratch where the previous owner did not install it correctly. But if you install the side saddle shell holder you cannot see the scratch at all! I am looking to sell this shotgun because I already have a Browning I use for hunting and after getting my CCL I prefer pistols for home defense over a shotgun. I live out in Coweta but can meet anywhere in the Tulsa or Broken Arrow area. I am asking $500 because it is already decked out with every attachment you can get! And they are not cheap attachments either. I spent the money to get the best and had is priced at $600. If your interested you can call or text me anytime day or night at my cell phone at REDACTED. Cash only please, price may be negotiable a little and all I would require is a signature for my records showing I sold the shotgun. On a side note the picture I have posted of it is an old pic when I had a light attached to it and a laser sight. But those are no longer on it and will not be included in the deal. If you personally feel $500 is too high shoot me an offer and we can work from there. Thanks for looking!"

From Lenta.ru (translated by Google) on Friday:

U.S. private companies purchased from Russian producers 900 million rounds of ammunition for rifles and pistols. This is with reference to sources in the military-industrial circles reported April 26 the newspaper “Izvestia”.

The subject of the contract with the Russian factories, steel machine-gun cartridges of 7.62 x 39 millimeters and a pistol – caliber 9×19 mm. It is reported that customers were five U.S. companies, including Intrac Arms International LLC and Wolf Perfomance Ammunition.

Negotiations on the supply began in 2011 with the participation of “Rosoboronexport”. The first batch of cartridges were sent to American buyers in early 2013. Amount of the contract is not a source told the publication.

For information about the availability of the agreement “News” confirmed at the Ulyanovsk cartridge plant. Representative of the plant said that the U.S. has guaranteed the U.S. Defense Department, according to which the cartridges are intended only for private buyers, but not for the army units, or exports.

In an interview with the editor of Maxim world.guns.ru Popenker reported that demand for ammunition in the United States by a massive government contracts to the needs of the army and security forces. “Therefore, there is a shortage of cartridges that private companies-sellers compensated for by imports” – added Popenker. Ammunition, according to the expert, U.S. citizens can also buy for the future, fear of restrictions on weapons by the government."

From Vigilance Rifles:
408 Cheytac. The Holy Grail of rifle cartridges, especially when being shot by the VR1 rifles. Quick follow up shots and easy impact reading from the low recoil of the VR1 Rifles is one of the key advantages of stepping down to a 408 Cheytac cartridge from the much bigger 416 Barrett or 50 BMG rifles. Not to mention VR1 rifles only weigh 18 lb. which means you can actually take it some where. It is the cartridge that I designed the VR1 rifles to shoot, all other calibers that we offer just happen to fit in the VR1 Rifles.

Rocky Mountain Bullets has developed real 420 gn. RBBT bullets for the 408 Cheytac, it certainly has taken the 408 Cheytac to a new level in performance. With the new bullets shooters are able to achieve long periods of sustained fire before accuracy deteriorates due to fouling, compared to shooting solid monolithics.

Distinctive from all others the VR1 is the only Semi-Auto Autoloader on the market chambered in the 408 Cheytac or 505 Gibbs. It is also available in 338 Lapua. The 408 Cheytac cartridge is a highbred, with confirmed kills out to 1 mile from trained hands. The VR1 holds five cartridges in 408 Cheytac - 505 Gibbs and 338 Lapua. The 338 Lapua is NATO and ammo is in military armaments, RAUFUS-AP-API are available, the cartridge proves well out to 1500 yards. VR1 shoots 1 MOA accuracy with 338 Lapua or 408 Cheytac in trained hands. The VR1 is not your typical M16 type conversion sniper rifle. We take great pride in the fact we completely manufacture it from the ground up. Our true 2-stage trigger with oil-lite bearings for a consistent reliable trigger pull. There are four sizes of bi pods and a mono pod available for different shooting requirements they change out in seconds. Our sling is attached to the internal frame of the rifle so an accidental dropping of the rifle due to sling pull is eliminated. The sling design also enables it to double as a turnacate. The Mill-Spec scope rail is mounted with (TORX-FHCS) this precision aligns the scope with the barrel eliminating bullet shift at different distances. Our safety is ambidextrous push type ( Fail Proof) with easy visual identification. We use a rotary screw bolt system that screws the bolt shut; this feature virtually eliminates the required force for opening and shutting the bolt. This is one of the key reasons that we are the only manufacturer able to make the 408 Cheytac cartridges shoot flawlessly in a Semi-Auto Autoloader. Rotary lock rifles usually use a spring loaded ejector, which can cause jams with high rate fire, the VR1 uses a Rotary screw bolt and fixed ejector for sure ejection and no jams. It is unusual to find a large caliber Semi-Auto Autoloader rifle that shoots as accurately and reliably as the VR1.

BENEFITS - A Long-range PRECISION SNIPER RIFLE (PSR) with quick follow up shots due to low recoil of Semi-Auto operation and Auto loading. Quick detachable magazines for instant load selection and increased firepower. Robust sturdy design that easily assembles and breaks down with no tools in under a minute with no loss of bullet impact. Easily concealable, no assembly being longer than 33 inches. Variable caliber interchangeable barrels. A gas forward design allowing for longer periods before cleaning due to gases not entering the receiver area. Our list is long and all the innovations in this new rifle certainly cannot be described on a concise white paper. The technology and engineering in this rifle are instantly noticeable.

Features:
Designed and developed to be light and mobile and inspired by several of the finest autoloading rifles in the world, we have taken the best features and incorporated them into a larger than life autoloading rifle.

Chambered in four exciting large calibers, the 338 Lapua, 375 Cheytac, 408 Cheytac and 505 Gibbs. The 338 Lapua for NATO, 375 and 408 Cheytac for long range engagement and the legendary 505 Gibbs made famous by Earnest Hemingway for unbeatable knockdown Power.

With five shots in the quick detachable magazine you’re sure to have plenty of firepower for the largest or most dangerous game.

Reliability of the VR1 is due to the gas port being optimally located to the chamber. The gases are cleaner and hotter up front and result in more reliable cycling and less fowling, the best autoloading rifles in the world use this system.

Our upper receiver is made from 17-4 PH Stainless Steel and certified Heat Treatment for high-pressure operation with such large calibers. The upper receiver-barrel locks securely into a lightweight hard-anodized lower receiver. The rifle uses a three-lugged rotary screw bolt for sure lockup, and a fixed ejector for high rate fire.

Using a 11/4 Bull Barrel for extreme accuracy and incorporating a proven Titanium Muzzle Brake for taming the Beast, makes the VR1 easy to shoot in any of our four calibers. The VR1 Rifles come standard with our exclusive M1A style Glass Filled Nylon Stocks for all weather conditions and come standard with Coyote M1A CHEEKPAD. Optionally High Comb Stocks machined from (RUTPLY) premium wood are available in several colors.

Our exclusive Pendulum Two Stage Trigger (PTST) at the heart of the gun supplies crisp reliable trigger pull. First stage is 2-½ lb and second stage releases at 3-½ lb respectively, the predictability of the trigger improves shooter accuracy and confidence. Incorporated within the trigger system is a heavy engagement (FAIL PROOF) traditional push safety.


Shipping/handling for this rifle will be $75 due to size and weight. Insurance will be added, unless you request it not to be, and will cost 1.75% of the price of the gun to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping.

From Vigilance Rifles:
408 Cheytac. The Holy Grail of rifle cartridges, especially when being shot by the VR1 rifles. Quick follow up shots and easy impact reading from the low recoil of the VR1 Rifles is one of the key advantages of stepping down to a 408 Cheytac cartridge from the much bigger 416 Barrett or 50 BMG rifles. Not to mention VR1 rifles only weigh 18 lb. which means you can actually take it some where. It is the cartridge that I designed the VR1 rifles to shoot, all other calibers that we offer just happen to fit in the VR1 Rifles.

Rocky Mountain Bullets has developed real 420 gn. RBBT bullets for the 408 Cheytac, it certainly has taken the 408 Cheytac to a new level in performance. With the new bullets shooters are able to achieve long periods of sustained fire before accuracy deteriorates due to fouling, compared to shooting solid monolithics.

Distinctive from all others the VR1 is the only Semi-Auto Autoloader on the market chambered in the 408 Cheytac or 505 Gibbs. It is also available in 338 Lapua. The 408 Cheytac cartridge is a highbred, with confirmed kills out to 1 mile from trained hands. The VR1 holds five cartridges in 408 Cheytac - 505 Gibbs and 338 Lapua. The 338 Lapua is NATO and ammo is in military armaments, RAUFUS-AP-API are available, the cartridge proves well out to 1500 yards. VR1 shoots 1 MOA accuracy with 338 Lapua or 408 Cheytac in trained hands. The VR1 is not your typical M16 type conversion sniper rifle. We take great pride in the fact we completely manufacture it from the ground up. Our true 2-stage trigger with oil-lite bearings for a consistent reliable trigger pull. There are four sizes of bi pods and a mono pod available for different shooting requirements they change out in seconds. Our sling is attached to the internal frame of the rifle so an accidental dropping of the rifle due to sling pull is eliminated. The sling design also enables it to double as a turnacate. The Mill-Spec scope rail is mounted with (TORX-FHCS) this precision aligns the scope with the barrel eliminating bullet shift at different distances. Our safety is ambidextrous push type ( Fail Proof) with easy visual identification. We use a rotary screw bolt system that screws the bolt shut; this feature virtually eliminates the required force for opening and shutting the bolt. This is one of the key reasons that we are the only manufacturer able to make the 408 Cheytac cartridges shoot flawlessly in a Semi-Auto Autoloader. Rotary lock rifles usually use a spring loaded ejector, which can cause jams with high rate fire, the VR1 uses a Rotary screw bolt and fixed ejector for sure ejection and no jams. It is unusual to find a large caliber Semi-Auto Autoloader rifle that shoots as accurately and reliably as the VR1.

BENEFITS - A Long-range PRECISION SNIPER RIFLE (PSR) with quick follow up shots due to low recoil of Semi-Auto operation and Auto loading. Quick detachable magazines for instant load selection and increased firepower. Robust sturdy design that easily assembles and breaks down with no tools in under a minute with no loss of bullet impact. Easily concealable, no assembly being longer than 33 inches. Variable caliber interchangeable barrels. A gas forward design allowing for longer periods before cleaning due to gases not entering the receiver area. Our list is long and all the innovations in this new rifle certainly cannot be described on a concise white paper. The technology and engineering in this rifle are instantly noticeable.

Features:
Designed and developed to be light and mobile and inspired by several of the finest autoloading rifles in the world, we have taken the best features and incorporated them into a larger than life autoloading rifle.

Chambered in four exciting large calibers, the 338 Lapua, 375 Cheytac, 408 Cheytac and 505 Gibbs. The 338 Lapua for NATO, 375 and 408 Cheytac for long range engagement and the legendary 505 Gibbs made famous by Earnest Hemingway for unbeatable knockdown Power.

With five shots in the quick detachable magazine you’re sure to have plenty of firepower for the largest or most dangerous game.

Reliability of the VR1 is due to the gas port being optimally located to the chamber. The gases are cleaner and hotter up front and result in more reliable cycling and less fowling, the best autoloading rifles in the world use this system.

Our upper receiver is made from 17-4 PH Stainless Steel and certified Heat Treatment for high-pressure operation with such large calibers. The upper receiver-barrel locks securely into a lightweight hard-anodized lower receiver. The rifle uses a three-lugged rotary screw bolt for sure lockup, and a fixed ejector for high rate fire.

Using a 11/4 Bull Barrel for extreme accuracy and incorporating a proven Titanium Muzzle Brake for taming the Beast, makes the VR1 easy to shoot in any of our four calibers. The VR1 Rifles come standard with our exclusive M1A style Glass Filled Nylon Stocks for all weather conditions and come standard with Coyote M1A CHEEKPAD. Optionally High Comb Stocks machined from (RUTPLY) premium wood are available in several colors.

Our exclusive Pendulum Two Stage Trigger (PTST) at the heart of the gun supplies crisp reliable trigger pull. First stage is 2-½ lb and second stage releases at 3-½ lb respectively, the predictability of the trigger improves shooter accuracy and confidence. Incorporated within the trigger system is a heavy engagement (FAIL PROOF) traditional push safety.

My USP was purchased from the original owner with less than 200 rounds through it. In the past year, I've put around 400 through it. Comes with original box, manual, 3 magazines that have the upgraded floor plate (stock floor plates included), and a Fobus paddle holster. I'll also throw in the ammo I have (15 rounds of 147g JHP and ~50 124g NATO). The gun is in 9.5/10 condition and has never failed on me. She is my baby, but it's time to move on to something with a larger aftermarket.

I will gladly e-mail pictures of the USP + accy's.

What I would like in a trade is a new or used 1911 in .45 and full size. My preferred trades would be a new Rock Island Tactical, a used Remington or a used Springfield. I'm open to other brands as well, but please no beat up Norincos."

I am selling one of my rifles.  I can consistently hits at 500yds at the COSSA range.  I built this for hunting and some competition.  Round count is at 88.  Weatherby guarantees .99 MOA, best I have done is .89MOA.  The gun shoots 165/168gr Nosler Accubonds amazingly and loves the 155gr even more.  I bought the gun new, it has and EGW base, Warne rings, Vortex Diamondback 4x12 with BDC reticle scope (lifetime warranty), two stage adjustable trigger, Butler Creek flip up scope covers, bipod, sling, action has been worked (smoother and tighter), plastic follower replaced with metal one. Custom paint job, butt of stock has been filled to make more rigid, and it has two sling swivel studs in the forend (for bipod and sling).   Also will come with an almost full box of Nosler Accubond Trophy Grade custom ammunition (17 New rounds).  Selling because it just sits in the safe, I tend to take on of my other rifle hunting and shoot 3 gun matches and don’t need a precision rifle.  Selling for $1100 OBO, no trades.  I am in Bend and am in Portland every week.  Cash only, FTF, must have valid Oregon DL and be legal to own a firearm, will provide bill of sale.

Thus they worked with Magpul to design a rigid +17 round extension to an OEM Glock magazine, to hold a full 30 rounds!  Your Glock (or any other device that uses G21 mags) will interface with an OEM Glock magazine, and it will hold 30 rounds of 45 auto!  This is not a Korean magazine (no offense to my Korean friends, but this is way better than the 27 round KCI mags I own).

One left: nearly new (used once and worked great on my G21).  Once I discovered what it would take to make these work for 10mm (Glock 20), I changed my mind and thus this is yours to have.

Note these are not just the extensions, as the Glock 21 magazine is included (with the extension attached to net 30 rounds each).  Also, Kriss calls these MagEx 25+ or MagEX G30, but do note they hold 30 rounds for the Glock 21 or Glock 30 (kinda crazy on the G30).
