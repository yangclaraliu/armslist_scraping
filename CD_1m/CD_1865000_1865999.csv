that comes to 1857.68(probably more after shipping) 
I have fired exactly 40 rounds through this gun. you also have to factor in installation of parts and even being able to find all the parts. so 1600 is a VERY fair price. I appreciate you reading my add!

 TFO gun sights use the same proven technology as our TFO archery pins. These sights are the most revolutionary innovation since TRUGLO, Inc. introduced fiber optics. TFO refers to our patented combination of Tritium and Fiber Optic technologies. The Tritium maintains the brightness level of the sight in low-light (or NO light) conditions. That means you can see your sight even in complete darkness‚Äîwith perfect transition through all lighting conditions. Tritium does not need batteries and does not need to be charged with light‚Äîit simply glows!

TFO gun sights use the same proven technology as our TFO archery pins. These sights are the most revolutionary innovation since TRUGLO, Inc. introduced fiber optics. TFO refers to our patented combination of Tritium and Fiber Optic technologies. The Tritium maintains the brightness level of the sight in low-light (or NO light) conditions. That means you can see your sight even in complete darkness‚Äîwith perfect transition through all lighting conditions. Tritium does not need batteries and does not need to be charged with light‚Äîit simply glows!
Tritium / Fiber Optic Technology ‚Äî The Best of Both Worlds!

I am open to barter trade for A-Tacs gear & Multicam gear...which means rifle cases, Plate carriers, Modern Military Surplus and G.I. Issued surplus. Ammo, Coyote Tan rifle parts and accessories, Military Tan Boots, If you want just the 2 plates that is $200.00 without the vest.

The available color options for the vests are ""Black""
If you are interested please contact Cody at REDACTED Thank you! NOTE: If you buy 2 or more sets I will be offering a discount. (Please no Text messages, as this phone is not a cell phone) 

The material grade of these plates are Mil-A-46100 steel 1/4"" thick, also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better in my opinion. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. If you do try to buy ar500, ask them if it stops a .30cal AP M2. I used a .308 rifle and shot 8 times at this Silhouette target from 45 feet. Totally different stuff. ar500 flattened and dimpled up penetrated 2 places but the mil-spec target kept its curve and did not dimple as much also zero penetration. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 hangdun...still no penetration. As displayed and shown in the photographs you will see the test shot target and the ones never before shot at. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. If you should decide to purchase one plate just for the purpose of using it as Target practice, I offer each plate for $100.00 if you do not want the vest. With the vest and 2 plates it is $240.00 I would suggest to lean this up against something out in the (Shooting Range or Desert Etc.) If you decide to purchase these Plates for Target practice. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 10 pounds. I've personally shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches and ETC to this"

This is the more sought after DC(decocker only) model which doesn't have a safety plus decocker like the new p95s have and this model isnt made anymore. Most people think a safety on top of a decocker(on the same lever too) is overkill and I agree .Most people dont realize how much simpler the DC is in operation with not having the safety which disconnects the trigger. In my opinion its just a better gun than the standard p95 , less parts means less to go wrong. A regular p95 is also confusing to use for woman or first time gun owners being that the lever can be in 3 different positions, off safety, on safety and decock. This one you just flick down to decock and thats it. Nice gun in box, slight finish wear on one side of the slide(only two small spots) but these things are built like tanks and last and last.The stuff on the grip is just small pieces of skateboard grip tape since these have a rather slick grip, it can be removed very easily as its just peel and stick. Thanks for looking .  Must have va Id and sign bill of sale . Price is $295 firm. Please no lowballers as the DC brings more money than a normal p95."

The ACOGs are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with
tritium-illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night.
Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using
fiber optics which collect ambient light. The ACOG combines traditional,
precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. The ACOG has many
features which are very advantageous for military use. Designed for use
with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was
chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all
lighting conditions, without failure prone batteries."

THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semiautomatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. 

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT‚Äôs sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16‚Äô‚Äô button rifled barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. 

The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m.

I recently bought a Glock 17 and i seem to me a much bigger fan of 9mm, mainly because i go to the range 2-3 days a week because i love to shoot, and its much cheaper to shoot 9mm. Therefore, i have almost abandoned my Glock 21, even though its such a fantastic gun.

I've only put around 500 rounds through it and it has functioned flawlessly every time. I have a few extras on the gun such as TruGlo Tritium night sights, a Ghost Rocket connector and spring which brings the trigger pull down to around 3.5#, a Hogue slip over grip, and a pachmayar grip plug. I have the original case and everything that came with it when purchased. I will also throw in a box of 20 PMC Starfire Defensive rounds. That's over $200 dollars worth of extras.

You can make me an offer if you wish, but i am more interested in just a straight up trade for a nice Glock 19. I live in Daytona Beach, but am willing to travel as far as Orlando to meet up. Thank you."

will sell lot of ammo for $220 or trade for magazines for my 45's listed, or the .40 listed.. or a gun

Here is a list of things I am interested in trading depending on what is out there. 


KelTec p11, in good shape, belt clip installed, one 10 round mec gar magazine.  This is an excellent, accurate and reliable subcompact 9mm, and I love it outside of the fact that it is configured for a right handed shooter.  I am left handed and need something with either ambidextrous controls or reversible mag release

Ruger mark 2 bolt action rifle.  This includes one 10  round magazine ( These magazines are widely available and cheap if you want more)  The iron sights are dead on to any distance you can hold an effective sight picture, but a small rimfire scope will be included anyway.

Rossi ""princess"" pocket sized stainless 7 shot 22lr revolver.  Beautiful bore, as accurate as a small pocket sized revolver could ever be.  A nice purse gun , varmint gun, or backup for any situation that requires small calibre
. 
Very nice all stainless taurus pt-100.  This is a very very nice pistol  as far as .40 calibres are concerned.  Many people do not know or understand that these pistols are made on the exact same machinery in the exact same plant in Brazil where baretta manufactured the 92 and 96, but taurus improved the design of the safety, added a rail, and priced it right.  Anybody who calls these a ""nockoff"" is completely uneducated about the history of these guns.  You cannot jam these things, magazines are widely available (even 20 round extended mags), and I love this gun,  Just putting out there to see whats available.  This gun also comes with 9mm threaded barrel which functions perfectly, and frame saver recoil spring system.  The extras alone retailed for $400

Taurus model 845 - This .45 has been well kept, and is modeled after Taurus' OSS tactical model still in use by central american special forces. This version is hammer fired and very accurate. 12+1 capacity makes it a full sized tool of self preservation.

Taurus pt 145 Millennium pro 45 A.C.P.

This H&K comes with a hard carry case, 2 eight round magazines, extra backstrap, lock, and manuals. This HK45C has the single/double action trigger with control lever. 

Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45.

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK‚Äôs unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.

Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter‚Äôs hand.

Both the HK45 Compact and full-size HK45 use an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever. The control lever is frame mounted and is quickly accessible; it has a positive stop and returns to the ‚Äúfire‚Äù position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 and HK45C can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45C is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system, providing an enhanced double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK‚Äôs American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics::
Integral MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
ERGO (HK45 full-size) and slim-line (HK45 Compact) grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
8-round metal magazine is standard for the HK45C, common high-capacity (10 rounds) that fit both the HK45 and HK45C also available
Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system
O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and better accuracy
Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and increased accuracy
Improved ergonomic control levers (safety and/or decocking)
Low profile drift adjustable 3-dot sights
Contoured and radiused slide with forward slide (grasping) grooves and anti-glare longitudinal ribs

INCOG is a joint development project between Haley Strategic Partners and G-Code Holsters.

The INCOG is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, deep concealment holster. Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw. Inherent are adjustments in the depth of carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users: body type, deployment tactics and personal preferences. The holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements.

The mounting clip Incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the conceal-ability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt."

It appears to be all here with the exception of the bayonet, cleaning rod, screws that attach the Buffington rear sight to the gun ( I have the sight, just need the correct screws to attach it to the barrel - available on internet) and rear sling loop. The barrel is OK  but does show some dings.  The stock is OK but does have a chip missing on the left side of the gun.  Neither of these defects effect the guns operation.  The bore is decent but does show some pitting and a little bit of rust but this gun is fully operational.  Located just north of Kokomo, Indiana.

I have no need for it, and certaintly nothing this nice, I don't live in Iraq. like I said, if you are reading this you most likely know what it is, but just to put it in perspective here is a link stating it was the only vest approved by the F.B.I., this is stated in the last sentence of paragraph 4 of this web site:

I am interested in nice firearms, and other stuff, but mostly firearm related. negotiable, but please be realistic, this is not an airsoft toy, this is the REAL DEAL MILITARY GRADE PLATE CARRIER.  thanks update:  unfortunately I will not ship this, I appreciate the offers, but this is ftf only.  UPDATE: due to the level of questions and my not being specific, this vest includes three levels of protection. it will come with front and back level iiia soft armor inserts, stand alone hard plates, and trauma plates, 6 panels in all, as I have front and back panels for all three types. sorry for not being clear and thanks for your interest and questions"

With the Infrared Illuminator, the user can illuminate the target without the prey detecting it. The Sightmark IR Illuminator is great for indoor and outdoor use, where there is low ambient light, such as during a SWAT raid in a dark warehouse or varmint hunting out on a moonless night.

Operable with two AAA batteries, the Sightmark Infrared Illuminator offers two power options, a low output at 70 miliwatts and a high output at 100 miliwatts for a more powerful and brighter experience. Featuring a battery life of 20 hours, the Infrared Illuminator also has an adjustable beam focus to widen or narrow the stream of light.

The adjustable beam focus is perfect for not only user preference, but for adapting to long and short ranges and indoor/outdoor use. For closer ranges or indoor use, where target acquisition is important, the wider beam will cover a wider field of view. The design of the IR flashlight is great for handheld use and the location of the on/off switch makes it easy to operate with the thumb. As long as the enemy does not have night vision, the IR flashlight can be used for covert signaling at night. The Infrared Illuminator comes with a standard one inch weaver mount that fits most AR15s and average rifles and also comes with nylon carrying case for easy carry and storage.
