Product Info
The Plinker Tactical M&P 15-22 magazine is a 22 long rifle, polymer, 35-Round magazine. This magazine is specifically designed for the Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22. The magazines have the look and feel of real 5.56x45mm Nato magazines. The Plinker Tactical magazines function just the same as factory magazines, but give you an increased capacity for longer shooting sessions. These mags are specifically designed to work with the Plinker Tactical magazine loader. The magazines are constructed of impact and solvent resistant polymer and are sonically welded for long term durability. The solid mag body, without exposed springs or loading tabs keeps dirt and debris out, increasing reliability and long term durability. Available in Black, Flat Earth, and Olive Drab.

It being the hoped up version, it has a larger motor allowing further and more accurate shots at semi and full auto shooting. The velocity is 300 fps and is 39.3 inches long. These are some of the extra items I had to purchase that go with the airsoft, sling, 1500 amp battery, 2 extra standard magazine, 1 extra hi cap magazine, speed loader, and around 5000 plastic rounds. This airsoft is a blast to shoot. Good thing the rounds are cheep. You do get carried away when on full auto and it is accurate on full or semi settings. Everything here cost me around $500.00. Everything is in excellent condition and is a little over a year old. You can go to the sportsmansdepot.com to check the airsoft and accessories prices out. I want $400.00 OR BEST OFFER for all of this stuff may trade for a shotgun or bolt action rifle. This is the best manufacture of this type of airsoft.

Motor runs great, transmission shifts perfectly. Has no vibrations at highway speeds, tires are inspectable, interior is clean, headliner is good, glass is good, shocks and springs are good, CV shafts good, misfires occasionally up hill. Ive replaced all kinds of ignition components only to find out its the control module. Part is about $120. Car needs, sway bar bushings, rocker panel work, ignition controller, rear brakes, and window motors. Only drivers window works, I think that's all you need for inspection. This car has been owned by my mom for the past 8 years and has been driven reeeeal easy. Has 203K but motor runs good and it shifts great. I just picked up a new SUV for the family so Im not putting the money into it for inspection. Get a good deal on it and drive it til it dies!"

I just bought the Sig this month and have only put exactly a 100 rounds through it.  Absolutely nothing wrong with it, I have just had some Springfield XD's in the past and I would really like to get another one as they have all the features I like.
If you do not know much about the SP2022 they are basically a polymer framed version of the Sig p226 and they have been adopted in huge numbers by the French military.

My Sig has the box, lock, manual, and extra grip.  This is the ""basic"" package so it only came with one 12 round magazine, but unlike some other guns they are readily available online if you feel the need for more.  Sig made quite  a few different configurations of this gun, this one does not have a loaded chamber indicator and it has an internal extractor.

I'd like to trade straight across for an equally low round count .40 caliber Springfield XD, preferably the 4inch barrel Service model, but I'd also be fine with a sub compact.  I have a CCL and would be fine signing a bill of sale if you so wish.
The only other trades I would consider would be for a gen 3 or 4 Glock 22 or 23, not interested in S&W M&P's.  Would also consider a nice .45 1911. Not interested in 9mm's.

816,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1754816,For Sale:  4.5 million volt concealed stun gun tactical light,"Kent, Seattle, Washington",$ 100,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 18, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Looking for a new toy? Here's a fun one... it's a functional 160 lumen rechargeable LED tactical flashlight complete with carry case that houses a neat little secret. It's actually a covert 4.5 million volt (4,500,000 V) stun gun. You wouldn't know it by looking at it. There are no visible prongs or anything that would suggest its secondary function. The electrical current actually arcs across the strike bezel on the forward end which is really quite ingenious. The arc is very visible and crackles loud as heck. The sound of the arc alone is enough to make most people think twice, not to mention how visible it is and that's not even counting the 160 lumen tactical light sufficient to temporarily blind someone and devastate their night vision. I for one, would not want to get zapped with it. 

In my opinion, the best use for this thing is as a supplement to your carry gun. If you carry you should have a tactical light on you anyway and this device serves that purpose as well as (depending on the situation) giving you one last practical option beyond a verbal command to potentially deter a would-be-attacker before you have to draw and fire. In my experience most people will turn and run when they see and hear that arc unless they are hell-bent on doing you harm (in which case, don't wait for them to get close enough to use it, go for your gun!)

$100 cash or would trade for a .22, hunting rifle or 12 GA shotgun. Other firearm offers considered. I have a CPL, and I would prefer you to have one as well."

I bought the gun new about 8 years from a local shop here in Tucson.
It still fires just fine, although a round will occasionally jam when loading into the chamber.
I suspect that a proper cleaning & oiling (which it is long overdue for) will make a noticeable difference.
The rifle has had very light use over the years, which is why I'm selling it, and I'd guess that it's had less than 500 rounds put through it.

It was assembled at the RRA factory.  Fit and finish is superb.  These are in an extremely short supply.  I picked it up awhile back expecting to build it out, but I decided to go .300 blackout instead (due to their silencer performance).  This lower receiver is about $455 through RRA, so that is where I am starting on the price.  I also have 5 RRA polymer 20 round mags, and 4 steel 20 round mags, and 1 30 round mag.  All these mags retail over $25 if you are lucky enough to find them, but I will sell them for $20 each.  Whole Package price (Lower Receiver and all mags) = $600.  I also have 500 rounds of premium brass nato grade ammo that we might be able to find a price on.

I am not an FFL, and I don't believe in price gouging my fellow law abiding gun owner.  Please no left field low ball offers.  Face to face in a public place.  I am more than willing to meet anyone from the Bend, Portland, Olympia, Salem areas half way.

Trades? More looking for cash to fund my .300 Blackout project but I would consider Handguns like a Sig, baretta, H&K variety.  I would trade for a .300Blackout upper, but no other AR or AK parts.  I would also consider savage .17hmr+optics or cash trade.  Might be willing to consider a long gun too.  All I ask is that you be fair, and the least I will do is say ""No thank you.""  Feel free to call or text five four one nine eight zero zero five five five."

Just bought this gun 2 months ago, 50 down the pipe no issues (duh), has been carried for 6 weeks and there are 1 or 2 very minor scuffs on the slide, which may be able to be buffed out as I have not tried. Switching my ccw, but I don't need to get rid of this gun necessarily, and will not entertain a cash sale unless it is high ($600, in which case I could throw in 50 JHP's and a Galco Stow-N-Go IWB). Comes with everything from the factory, case, x2 mags, etc. All in all, basically just looking for above said Glocks in green or brown.  (I will be taking off the XS Big Dots and replacing them with the factory sights, unless your gun comes with them or other comparable night sights.) Would also consider an XDs in either 9mm or 45.

Obviously im not giving this revolver the attention it really needs. Afterwards i went and bought a conversion cylinder in the hopes that i would want to shoot it. But even then i have not found the time to go to the range. To maka long story short i have a box of 45 colt and a holster for this revolver for sale. The timing on the conversion cylinder is off so in order to fire the gun you need to yank the hammer back. So this guy needs a good home. Its the new revolver and a holster and a box of ammo for 450 or a better offer. If you want pictures send me a email.
