All are 100% galvanized.  Measuring 3/8"" thick and attached with grade 8 bolts, the face plate is pitched at a 27 degree angle to direct bullet splatter down into the ground.  We have specifically engineered this target this way to minimize ricochet and improve safety for close shooting situations. Swings back on impact to show the shooter some movement, and because it is steel, it gives an nice audible when hit as well.  

This set breaks down easily for great portability.  Can withstand 1000's of rounds.

By doubling as a paper/cardboard stand, this system has added benefits that others dont.  If the main target and 2*4 are removed, you can then insert (2) 2*4's into the two outside slots of the base, and its now a perfect paper/cardboard target stand.  Simply staple up your paper and carbboard targets and you are set.

Recently, I talked to some of these folks and asked them about the ongoing ammo shortage that’s still keeping avid shooters and weekend plinkers alike from doing what they love: sending lead down-range. I learned that though there are a number of different factors contributing to the current ammo shortage, the main reason there’s a shortage is because there’s a shortage. In other words, we’re in the midst of an old-fashioned panic. Some shooters locate the blame for the current state of affairs in DC, and conspiracy theories abound about the government buying up all the ammo for one shady reason or another. But those theories are wrong, according to the ammo makers I’ve talked to. Sure, the post-Newtown rush to “Do Something!” may have created the climate of fear and uncertainty that initially sparked the current panic, but that panic has now taken on a life of its own and is feeding back into itself. At this point, everybody is panic buying because everybody is panic buying, which means that the shortage won’t stop until the panic subsides. Ammo makers: won’t get fooled again You might think that the ammo makers are having a field day with the panic buying, but surges like this aren’t quite the windfall that you might think they are for the ammo industry. The ammo makers are turning out ammo as fast as they can, some of the big name ammo makers I’ve talked to are literally running 24/7. They’re also adding more machines and training more personnel to try and meet the demand. But in ramping up capacity, they’re taking on more risk. When the panic dies down, demand could tank, and then the layoffs will start and all that new capacity will go idle. If this happens, then the ammo makers will have wasted millions in buying machinery and training people to use it. The only way to recover that investment will be to raise the prices on ammunition — something we don’t want to see, nor do they want to do. Some smaller ammo makers have already fallen by the wayside because they can’t get enough raw materials and components to keep up with demand. The biggest shortages we are seeing right now is .22 LR and 9mm, and many makers can’t come up with the brass, primers, bullets, and powder to make any more of these popular ammo types. And the shortages are getting worse with each passing day. Many ammo makers have been forced to raise their prices because the cost of components have risen, especially copper for making bullets. Some other ammo makers that I know have gone above and beyond to seek out components, and because they were forced to pay more they in turn had to raise prices. But they only raised their prices by the amounts they are having to pay to get the needed components. My sources tell me that if things stay the way they are, that it will be between 18 months and 2 years before they can catch-up on back orders. And this is assuming that things don’t take a turn for the worse. All we need is another mass shooting or terrorist attack and there will be more talk of gun and ammo controls, which will bring on another round of panic buying, longer waits, higher prices and more shortages. While local gun shops have been enjoying a brisk run on guns and ammo, they don’t like the shortages any more than you and I do. My local gun shop was down to a dozen handguns not too long ago, and couldn’t find any from any of their distributors. Luckily, the supply lines have started filling up again, but only for some guns. (I understand that Ruger has a backlog of 2 million guns, and I heard that GLOCK has about a million guns on back-order — it will take them a while to get caught-up, as some guns are in more demand than others.) The ammo shortage is hurting gun shop owners, because when a gun shop does have some guns to sell, people aren’t buying them because there isn’t any ammo to available for them. I mean, really? Why purchase a gun if you can’t find any ammo for it? Not a good situation at all. There are some on-line and mail-order companies who have taken advantage of the shortages, especially in regards to ammo, and are charging outrageous prices. I won’t mention names, but one is getting a very bad reputation on the Internet, and a lot of people, myself included, will no longer do business with them. Sure, they have ammo, because they had the money to stock-up on hundreds of millions of rounds. But who in their right mind is willing to pay more than a buck a round for 9mm low-grade ammo these days? Well, that’s what one place is charging, and as much as $3.00 per round for common (not premium) JHP 9mm ammo. When you find a place like this, don’t do business with them. You can find ammo if you spend the time looking, and, needless to say, you will be paying more, but there’s no sense in getting ripped off by a greedy on-line or mail-order company taking advantage of the situation. The solution: stop hoarding ammo I took my crystal ball out, and most of the time it is working properly, and my prediction is that I honestly don’t know if things will ever go back to being normal in the ammo world if we don’t change our buying habits. Look, if you don’t absolutely need ammo, then don’t buy it right now. Give the ammo makers a chance to make some kind of attempt at catching-up with the demand. I have absolutely cut back on the number or rounds I use in my gun test articles. I used to burn through 500 rounds or more in my tests, but these days, I’m cutting back to around 200 rounds for a gun test. And, if your local gun shop or big box store has a limit on the number of boxes of ammo you can purchase at one time, then only buy that much – don’t send your wife, husband or friends in to buy more ammo for you, because that’s only hurting us all. Gun shops don’t like rationing ammo, either — it’s something they have to do these days, so they will have ammo for all their customers. Yes, I understand, no one wants to get caught with their pants down, and not have enough ammo. But then again, can you define what “enough” ammo is? Let’s see if we can’t turn the tide, and start buying ammo the way we used to: slow down, and don’t hoard it. - See more at: http://www.alloutdoor.com/2013/06/12/ammo-shortage-2013/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=2013-06-17&utm_campaign=Weekly+Newsletter#sthash.qYicf3a3.dpuf"

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Precision-made, easy to handle and just as easy on the eyes, the Reserve Series provides an outstanding over-and-under at an outstanding price. These Shotguns share the same classic lines, craftsmanship and reliability associated with so-called ""high end"" over-and-unders without the high-end price tag. At the heart of every Reserve Series Over and Under is an underlock design, box lock action for superior strength and low profile. Precision machining keeps the action completely closed - dirt and debris doesn't get into the receiver, reducing wear and maintenance, while manual extractors provide a smooth, effortless operation of the action. This 12 gauge Silver Reserve Series shotgun is equipped with three interchangeable choke tubes and wrench, providing the ultimate in versatility with lead, steel and other non-toxic loads.

bottom end would be $2200.00 to $5k
I have a very rare Randal SS 1911
this was given to the Chief  in Anchorage Alaska as a personal carry piece
I have ALL the paperwork on the gun and receipt showing this.

this is a round top, fixed sight, .45acp, NO RF in front of S#
this link helps anyone who wants to do more research
http://www.m1911.org/mod_randall.htm
look in the rarities at the bottom of the page to understand more about what I'm talking about, has the letter C behind the S#
now with the S# of this gun it can be one of 2 guns
the first is it was the 15th gun made by Randal...
second it could be 1 of the 5 guns give to authority's as a trial off duty carry piece
I have a main person in the yearly blue book gun pricing guide looking into this one, if it turns out to also be the second type of gun I have mentioned then we are talking it is one of 5 guns in the world of only 3,400 guns ever made by Randal...
Randal was the first SS high end gun ever made, and was the first to ever make a left handed gun.
as I said they only ever made 3,400 guns and that is all their models
and being the 15th gun ever made by them, makes this a top shelf collectable piece
and if you collect 1911's this is a once in a lifetime chance at owning this rare of a Randal
if it turns out to be the second type Randal I will end up putting it on a major gun auction
but right now I'm looking at offers, Steve is finishing up the publication for this yr right now and will get back to me in the next couple weeks when he finds out more about if it is one of the 5 firearms....

so lets talk  NO LOWBALL OFFERS PLEASE I won't even write back
this has a chance at being a very very very expensive collectors piece
right now it is a expensive piece
just being the 15th gun
I know there are Randal collectors out there that look for just this type of handgun
I hope I find one on here lol"

The XD-S™model features a slim, single stack frame though it still has the firepower of a .45 caliber. This slim design makes it perfect for those looking for a concealed carry pistol. 

Like the whole XD® line of pistols, the XD-S™ offers an ergonomic design that makes it easier to point and shoot. The design offers a single-position Picatinny rail, making this one of the only pistols of its size that can be accessorized with lights and lasers. The low profile sight also makes this firearm more holster-friendly. 

The XD-S™ has many of the safety features found in other XD® models, such as ultra safety assurance trigger system™, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. The XD-S™ also has an enhanced secure grip texture. At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition. 

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice. 

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

Has a tikka made barrel, on top of reciever has AZF which was a capture mark for the original rifle made on reciever and the AZF means it was captured by the Austrians during WWI and sole later on and one bought by the Finns. Also the reciever still retains the russian imperial eagle marking as well. Lot of history in the reciever alone. 

Has the 3600 pressure proof mark side of barrel, other markings as well throughout. 

Has the boxed SA finnish military issue marking. Bore is very nice and wood is as well. The stock is a war time stock with the round finger splices, not the later post war squared ones. Has its cleaning rod as well. 

A very nice overall M39 with some history to it as well. The tikkas are very hard to find and fetch a hefty price tag when you do. Its ssaid they made 5000 of these and that was it.  And hard to find one in a war time stock as well.

Like some full-size Kimber pistols, both Pro Carry RL models have an integral Picatinny rail for light mounting. Along with TLE and designated night sight models, they also have Meprolight® night sights.
All Kimber pistols have slide serrations with beveled edges that will not snag clothing or holsters. Serrations are deep and wide to ensure positive grip even with wet or cold hands.
Chambered in .45 ACP, 9mm and 38 Super, Kimber mid-size pistols are an ideal compromise of size and weight. With a variety of options and features, they cover every need from duty and concealed carry to home defense. More importantly, these pistols do not compromise quality or dependability. The Tacoma, Washington, P.D. extensively tested Pro Carry models, finding them to be the most dependable firearm put through the paces in over 20 years. They checked the records, comparing Kimber not only with other pistols, but rifles and shotguns as well. When you carry a Kimber, you carry with absolute confidence.

The barrel is 11.5"" with the 5"" flash hider and a 1-9 twist. I have owned this rifle for over 10yrs and have put around 2-3 hundred rounds through it. I don't rapid fire my guns so the barrel is in great condition. This has been a great little rifle and I like it quite a bit but I don't need it at this time. The rifle sold new in 03 for 699.00, the trigger job cost 250 and the additional parts ran nearly 150. The ammo is selling on here for more than 150 right now. The scopes value is unknown but I did check it out at the range years ago. With the scope on the rifle it held sub minute of angle groups. The action has been smoothed with copper impregnated grease and cleaned repeatedly to take out that rough feel. It is smooth. It rode around with me a great deal of the time but I just don't use it enough now that I have a carbine light flat top. This is a good deal. You can find AR-15's easy enough now but what you will pay to dress one out and get a decent trigger will hurt alot more than a grand."

It has excellent tritium night sights and rosewood grips.  If you know anything about pocket pistols, I don't have to tell you how awesome the p238 is.

Remora thigh/ankle holster ($35)
2 DeSantis pocket magazine carriers ($24 each)
*50 rounds of target ammo
*20 rounds of Speer Gold Dot defense ammo

Considering the absolute cheapest I've ever seen these in stores for is $600 (usually much higher, msrp is $750), plus all the extras, and how hard .380 ammo is to find right now, $750 is a KILLER deal.  At the very least, all these items together would cost over $900 and that's being very conservative.  That said, no offers or trades please.

Please only contact me if you are serious about buying, and have your Oregon DL and preferably CHL present.  Thanks, and have a great day."

This is a great pistol, works flawlessly, excellent bore. I am winnowing down my collection to a few calibers and this is the only 40 I have. If I didn't need cash I'd not be parting with it. It's a joy to shoot and a superb reliable defensive weapon.

I will meet you at an FFL in the Philly area for a cash only transaction, someplace safe and convenient for both of us. I will not haggle, as it's a great gun at a great price. When we meet I will want a $40 cash deposit to hold at the counter beside you while you do the FFL check. If you fail, I will keep the deposit for my waste of time. Otherwise, it will be applied to the purchase price and we will complete the transaction. You will be responsible for your transfer fee, as is normal.

I will also throw in whatever .40 ammo I have left. Probably half a box, more or less.

Plus  I threw on some Hogue Grips out of preference over the stock rosewood grips (included.

After I got these upgrades in it, it shoots far better than I can, the trigger breaks like glass.

It has probably 200 rounds fired.

So, the package includes the Mark III, Volquartsen upgrades (installed), hogue grips, original grips, and box (rail, lock).  Plus the original parts if you want them.

I am selling it locally for $550.  Not looking for trades.  If needed I can provide some .22 for a reasonable price (only with sale)."

That’s right. The first production model of any Colt was the No.1 Ring Lever Rifle. The carbine breech (attachable shoulder stocks for handguns) and America’s first slide action rifle were also part of Colt’s on-and-off ventures into longarms. Then in 1963 the AR-15 and M16 .223 automatic rifles “made Colt’s the small-arms sensation of modern warfare”. Their unmatched accuracy, performance and durability are available in their direct descendent, the Colt semiautomatic-only, sporting rifles.

554,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1781554,For Sale:  NEW H&K MR762A1 (DVMR762-A1),"ANACORTES, Washington, United States","$ 3,999","Listed On: Monday, August 12, 2013",Rifles,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"THE MR762A1
Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons.

Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.

The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components.

The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled.

Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417; a 5-round magazine is also under development. MR762A1 rifles are well-suited for a variety of applications including law enforcement tactical, police patrol, general sporting, and hunting (a 5-round magazine is under development)."

The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

766,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1781766,"For Sale:  VEPR 7.62x54R, scope, custom case, and ammo","Reynoldsburg, Columbus, Ohio","$ 1,500","Listed On: Wednesday, June 19, 2013",Rifles,no type,7.62x54R                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a hardly used VEPR in 7.62x54R, 20"" barrel, with a genuine POSP 6x42 scope and a custom case. I'll also throw in approximately 3/4 of a case of Bulgarian surplus light ball (1 sealed tin and one partial tin, and the wood crate if you want it).

If you've done your research, you know that the VEPR is as close to a real SVD as you can get nowadays for less than a whole bunch of money. With the PSLs long dried up, there are no decent semiautos in 54r anywhere anymore from which to start a conversion build.

The VEPRs are actually based on a thicker receiver than standard AK-pattern rifles, and has been certified by the factory to be safe for use with any 7.62x54r ammunition, INCLUDING HEAVY BALL. PSLs and most of their variants are unsafe to use with heavy ball, but this VEPR will eat any surplus or commercial loads on Earth.

There has only been a single modification to the rifle: The factory rear sling swivel, which is prone to breakage, has been replaced professionally with a standard Uncle Mike's sling swivel. If you look around, you'll notice that despite the incredibly quality of the VEPR rifles regardless of caliber, the 54r variants are hit or miss on the sling swivels; some have the cheap bent wire ones, some have Uncle Mike's clones.

The VEPR family comes out of the MOLOT factory in Russia, and they are the Cadillacs of AK-pattern rifles. The 54r variants are no exception.

If you're interested in doing an SVD conversion, Ironwood Designs offers an excellent USA-made, 100% accurate reproduction of SVD furniture, right down to the correct shade of red varnish. That was my intention before another project fell into my lap. Even if you don't buy this gun from me, you should check out Ironwood's products and support a small American business if you can.

The glass is a POSP, with a genuine commblock 1000m military reticule specifically calibrated for the 7.62x54R and a 20"" barrel (this rifle). It is mounted on the correct side-mount arm.

The rifle has, according to my logbooks, 125 rounds through. You get 2x 5 round mags with the rifle, as supplied by the importer to me. 10 round and larger magazines are available as aftermarket from various sellers if you want them.

It will also come with a foam lined Pelican rifle case cut to fit the rifle, glass, and magazines.

It comes with an 18"" 1/10 twist 5R rifled barrel with an Enhance flash suppressor. It has a mid length gas system which will give it a soft shooting recoil. The gas block is the railed type which allows for mounting of flip up sights or going without any for a better view with a scope. The upper is a T marked flat top. The lower comes in ambidextrous form. Meaning the safety is on both sides of the firearm, as well is the bolt release, and magazine release. That makes this firearm left or right hand compatible. It includes a 6 position buttstock. This rifle uses Magpul mags which are some of the best in the business and are not only easier to find but are cheaper also. This a super nice firearm from one of the top tier gun manufacturers in the country. Also included is a gun case to protect the rifle, manual, warranty, and 1 20rd magpul magazine. These are hard to find and going fast so don't miss your oppurtunity to own one, I have no problem shipping and i will ship immediately payment is confirmed"

Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons.

Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.

The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components.

The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled.

Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417; a 5-round magazine is also under development. MR762A1 rifles are well-suited for a variety of applications including law enforcement tactical, police patrol, general sporting, and hunting (a 5-round magazine is under development)."
