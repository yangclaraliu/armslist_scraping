I have also added a tactical extendable bipod, and 500 rounds of Remington Law Enforcement 62 grain ETSP. It is a milspec weapon; the semi-automatic version of one of the newest rifles used by U.S. Special Operations personnel as well as numerous law enforcement agency tactical teams. You will not be disappointed. The 16 has a huge advantage over the 17, due to the availability and cost of .223/5.56 NATO vs the significantly more expensive and allusive .308/7.62 NATO. The value of this weapon is far better than a Colt 6920. It is gas-piston operated - a pricy upgrade for a regular AR-15 style assault rifle. It has four quad rails for accessory mounting (at 12, 3, 6, and 9). Additionally it has ambidextrous safety and magazine releases, as well as the ability to mount the charging handle on either side.Don't do FTF.Rifle is going to shipped to a Lincensed FFL holder only.Thanks"

One unused AR Five-Seven complete upper receiver. 1st Gen. Picked up before the mayhem. The specs can be found at the links below.

Link to the newer model, for comparison's sake: (basically it's lighter; no functional changes though and none of the extras included with this one):

The new edition runs an extra $100 more than this one, base price, even at Midway (notably more at the OEM site) and that one doesn't include either the $100 of extra magazines or $50 of ammo being thrown in with this sale. Thus the total price of the next gen is another $250 and this one is still sealed in the original box, unopened and brand new - but with ammo running the price it is now, that's close to $300 less for this, and all of the items I've listed are brand new.


Description:

May look at other rifles in odd/heavier calibers. 6.8, .308, .300.

I am willing to throw in mags or ammo to one of my rifles to trade up to an Scout or Bush. My carbines are 16"" barreled carbines with BCM barrels. They are lightweight profile, chome-lined, hammer forged, mid-length gas systems. All are MPI tested. I have Daniel's Defense M16 carriers in them- full mil-spec. Most of my carbines have Geisselle triggers. Magpul and Vltor furniture and Ma-tech rear sights. I estimate my values around $1300 depending on model. BCM barrels and Mil-Spec BCGs are impossible to find and I am looking to trade at pre-panic price. I expect the same offer in return. I will deal ammo/mags to bring up the trade value.

The South Carolina Concealed Weapons Permit Course qualifies you to obtain your SC CWP and meet the minimum training requirements of the South Carolina law pertaining to carrying a Concealed Weapon.  The difference between our basic course and some of the others you will find is that we ensure that you are comfortable with your abilities before sending you on your way 
We cover the content required by the State of South Carolina to obtain your Concealed Weapons Permit.  The SC CWP course is 8 hours long and includes classroom instruction and a portion on the range.
You will participate in a live fire range exercise in which you will become more confident in your abilities to hit a target at ranges from 3 yards to 15 yards. The live fire exercise is a standard course of fire outlined by SLED and is 50 rounds.  Upon successful completion of the range firing, you will have met all the requirements for the training required to obtain your South Carolina Concealed Weapons permit. 
You are encouraged to bring the firearm you wish to carry to the class, but if you have not yet obtained one, you may use our firearms to become familiar with the makes and models often used. This will allow you to make better decisions on what handgun will best fit your physical size and method of carry for your CWP.  You will need to bring 50 rounds of ammunition for your weapon if are going to shoot it for the course of fire, and if you desire to use one of our guns we will have the appropriate ammunition for the gun.
We will perform the administrative tasks of completing your fingerprint card and assist you in filling out the application forms to be submitted to SLED to obtain your SC CWP.  Additionally we will take care of printing the required picture you will need to submit with your application to SLED along with notarizing the copy of your drivers license.a

You will be required to submit all the documents required to SLED after the completion of this class with the $50 fee to obtain your South Carolina Concealed Weapons Permit.

The South Carolina Concealed Weapons Permit Course qualifies you to obtain your SC CWP and meet the minimum training requirements of the South Carolina law pertaining to carrying a Concealed Weapon. The difference between our basic course and some of the others you will find is that we ensure that you are comfortable with your abilities before sending you on your way 
We cover the content required by the State of South Carolina to obtain your Concealed Weapons Permit. The SC CWP course is 8 hours long and includes classroom instruction and a portion on the range.
You will participate in a live fire range exercise in which you will become more confident in your abilities to hit a target at ranges from 3 yards to 15 yards. The live fire exercise is a standard course of fire outlined by SLED and is 50 rounds. Upon successful completion of the range firing, you will have met all the requirements for the training required to obtain your South Carolina Concealed Weapons permit. 
You are encouraged to bring the firearm you wish to carry to the class, but if you have not yet obtained one, you may use our firearms to become familiar with the makes and models often used. This will allow you to make better decisions on what handgun will best fit your physical size and method of carry for your CWP. You will need to bring 50 rounds of ammunition for your weapon if are going to shoot it for the course of fire, and if you desire to use one of our guns we will have the appropriate ammunition for the gun.
We will perform the administrative tasks of completing your fingerprint card and assist you in filling out the application forms to be submitted to SLED to obtain your SC CWP. Additionally we will take care of printing the required picture you will need to submit with your application to SLED along with notarizing the copy of your drivers license.a

N.I.B. (Unfired/New/Old Stock). This weapon is in perfect condition and unfired. It comes standard with a 30 round magazine, flip-up sights, box, manual, rails, etc (listed below). I have also added a tactical extendable bipod, and 500 rounds of Remington Law Enforcement 62 grain ETSP. It is a milspec weapon; the semi-automatic version of one of the newest rifles used by U.S. Special Operations personnel as well as numerous law enforcement agency tactical teams. You will not be disappointed. The 16 has a huge advantage over the 17, due to the availability and cost of .223/5.56 NATO vs the significantly more expensive and allusive .308/7.62 NATO. The value of this weapon is far better than a Colt 6920. It is gas-piston operated - a pricy upgrade for a regular AR-15 style assault rifle. It has four quad rails for accessory mounting (at 12, 3, 6, and 9). Additionally it has ambidextrous safety and magazine releases, as well as the ability to mount the charging handle on either side. The weapon DOES NOT come with the (new) ATN MK350 Guardian Night Vision Scope pictured in the photos, but I would be happy to include it for an upcharge of $400.00 (I will list the details below).

I got it about 8 years ago with the intention of going Elk hunting with my brother, but that never happened, and I really don't need a large caliber rifle anymore.

The gun has less than 100 rounds through it (probably closer to 60), it is in great shape, and well maintained. The only defect or problem with it is the front sling screw seems to be stripped, but a little glue or something can fix that right up.

In addition to the gun, I have a metal case, bi-pod, barrel cleaning kit, and a Richards Microft Thumbhole stock (Blue Coral Laminate Color, 1"" Decelerator-The Ultimate in recoil reduction, installed, and Rosewood Tip & Cap). the stock is ""96-98%"" complete, needs to be inlet, finished, and have a floor plate installed.Overall the second stock itself is valued around $250 new. - http://www.rifle-stocks.com/straightlinethumbhole.htm

I had a roommate who was a gunsmith. He was supposed to finish he stock for me, but never got around to it before he moved out of state, and i do not have the time, talent, or desire to finish it myself.

I would be willing to sell the Rifle and all accessories for $600.

Derived from the HK UMP, the USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge. Matched with the simple and ultra-reliable blowback operating system, the HK USC is a radical departure from traditional firearms designs. Extensive use of the same durable, reinforced polymers used on HKs line of military and police arms ensures lightweight and durability. And the highest grade of weapons steel is used where it matters in the cold hammer forged target barrel and the solidly constructed bolt mechanism. User ergonomics are not sacrificed. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. The web of the pistol grip is open for a comfortable shooting handhold. Hard points located on the top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails easy, allowing almost any kind of sighting system or accessory to be mounted.(5) Genuine HK USC 10 round magazine included"

Cleaning out my safe and not trying to gouge or profit from any of this, just not willing to take less than I paid with tax unless otherwise marked lower.  I know the rifle rounds are available therefore I need to get rid of them so I am requiring that anyone that buys any ammo must buy at least 1 box of rifle rounds or I wont sell you any.  
Example: If you want a box of 10mm, you must buy a box of rifle rounds as well. If you want 4 boxes of various handgun rounds, you must buy 2 boxes of rifle rounds.
I WILL NOT SELL JUST THE 45ACP, 9MM, 10MM & .357 MAGS, RIFLE ROUNDS WILL HAVE TO BE PURCHASED TO GET THESE!

Absolutely NO DISCOUNTS!  I am not gouging like so many on here so all my prices are absolutely firm unless otherwise stated.
Please do not bother trying to lowball me on anything, ACTUALLY NO NEED TO EVEN MAKE ANY OFFERS BECAUSE ALL PRICES ARE FIRM, I do not “need” to sell any of this but I always get a few people who don’t know how to read!  The price is the price or I will just stick it back in the safe and keep it.

All ammo is mostly new within last few months, but all is definitely new within the year.  This is not real old ammo that has been sitting around a long time.  All has been stored in humidity controlled safe. FYI

      local Gun Store here.  Paid $17 a bag plus tax but I bought just recently when
      prices were too high.  So I will Sell each bag for $16.00 each

  I will only sell handgun rounds if 1 Box of rifle rounds 
  are bought for every 2 boxes of Handgun rounds.

I owned a Browning White Gold Medallion .270 about 8 months ago but I sold it new/unfired and never used any of the ammo.  The 7mm-08 is from my dad.  He bought 7mm Rem Mag and didn't realize there was a difference and he bought the wrong ammo and as you may know, ammo cannot be returned to the store. So that is how I ended up with these 3 boxes of rifle rounds.

      No tag but have receipt, paid $25.99 plus tax,  Sell for $25.00

VARIOUS GUN RELATED ITEMS FOR SALE:

11) Brand New in Package Factory 9mm Glock 33 Round Extended Magazine.  Fits Glock 17, 18, 19, 26 and I think 34. I paid $55.00 for this.  
Will Sell for $50 FIRM or $45 if you buy a box of rifle rounds. 
12) Set of used Weaver Pivot Flip-to-side integrated bases & 1” rings for a Ruger 44 Magnum Carbine Rifle.  The front base is thicker since it is mounted to the barrel
which is slightly lower on the Ruger 44 Carbine.  I don’t believe these are being made any longer.  These are great if your scope breaks or fogs up, you can pivot the scope to side & still use your iron sights.  Sell for $18.00 
Picture of these bases/rings mounted on the gun at this link:
http://24hourcampfire.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php/topics/6951810/4
13) Tasco Pro Point Red Dot 1x30 Sight.  I just put a brand new battery in it today.  The Tasco RedDot Scope will allow you to shoot with precision aiming. This Tasco scope features a built-on dovetail rail that will fit standard center-fire, weaver-style bases. The illuminated red dot with 5 Red & 5 Green brightness settings will help you achieve accurate shots. Extra-bright to provide higher clarity. The 5 M.O.A. Tasco RedDot Scope will fit shotguns using up to 3"" shells and handguns up to a .357 magnum, making it a versatile accessory for avid shooters. I had this on my Ruger 10/22 for a very short time, maybe 100 rds with it on and then I bought a high quality Nikon scope for the gun so this has been sitting.  in the safe.  New battery so reticle is bright like brand new! I believe I paid about $45 to $55 for this.  So I will sell it for $20 or $15 if purchased with a box of rifle rounds.
14) Brand New in Box UTG Tactical OP-1 Bipod Model TL-BP78.  Mounting Feature: Picatinny, Swivel Stud, Extendable legs.  Stand Type: Rubber   Open Angle: 50 degrees   
Center Height: Min. 6.1”   Max. 7.9”  Leg Length: Min. 5.5”   Max. 7.4”
I mounted on an AR I had, but sold the AR unfired therefore this is still new!
For Info here is link where I bought at Optics planet:     http://www.opticsplanet.com/leapers-utg-tactical-op-bipod-w-picatinny-and-swivel-stud-mount.html      I paid about $30.00    Sell for $20.00 or $15.00 with a box of Rifle Rounds.
15) Fobus GL-2 ND Paddle Holster, used maybe 5 times to walk around the woods up north, never used as all day carry.  It has an adjustment retention screw to make it easier or harder to your liking to draw the gun.  I used for my Glock 19 which I sold so I have no use for this.  I believe it also fits many other glocks as well including 17, 18, 19, 26, possibly 34, etc.  I believe it also fits the S&W 99 & Sigma but please check the model number online to see for sure.  I paid about $50 for this but I know the price has gone done so I will sell for $20 or $15 with a box of rifle rounds.
16) Brand New Never Used Hogue Handall Universal Grip Sleeve with finger grooves for most semi-auto pistols.  Fits most Glocks.  Recoil absorbing rubber.  Please check fit guide on Hogue’s website because there was at least 50 different guns that this fits. 
I paid $7.99 plus tax, I will sell for $5.00 or free if you buy $200 worth of any combination of items from me.

I am located in Allen Park (48101) near Southfield (39) and Allen Roads.  I am home almost all day everyday, so give me a call and come on by get it while it’s available.

New Gun Laws Took Effect July 1! 
Here's what I've learned that the news is not disclosing---

State law limits the amount the FFL Dealer can charge for Background Checks to only $10. It's basically a tax; the store must turn it over to the State.
The store must retain records for 20 years
The store must inspect the weapon; deeming it safe to operate.

I believe Corral Pawn on Main St. in Trinidad is doing the BGCs.
Artic Shooting Supply, on 6th St, in Pueblo is doing them for $20 which includes Transfer fees also. No limit on guns sold from Seller to Buyer. One fee! 
Or, paid in full first, I will agree to ship UPS OVER-NITE to your FFL Dealer for Transfer; at your expense of course.

Please: No Trades ""Except""---
I may consider trades for gold/silver bullion (no collectibles please)
I will allow Spot plus $1 per Oz.

On Tuesday, June 18th, our Secretary of State certified the sufficiency of our recall signatures. Of the 16,000 that were submitted, 10,000 were approved - about a 35% rejection rate, higher than average but slightly below our worst-case expectation. If we had not had the funds from you guys allowing us to hire more signature gatherers, we would NOT have made the cut. So before anything else, thank you.

Unfortunately, though, it's not over. In fact, it's looking like we're just getting started. Within minutes of the SecState's announcement, Morse's people declared that they were filing a legal challenge to the petition. Their argument is about as lame as you can get while remaining legal - literally, that we failed to ""expressly include a demand for the election of a successor"" in our verbiage, even though the successor election is part and parcel of a recall. But it doesn't have to have much merit. It’s a disposable vehicle, designed to be just good enough to get us into court, where they can drag things on for another month before sending it to the Governor to set an election date even later in the year. And, because we will have to address it no matter how weak it is, it's also designed to bleed us further financially and sow doubt in the minds of our allies.

It's ironic that a man who has shown so little consideration for the Constitutional rights of Coloradans is suddenly so fixated on Constitutional verbiage but this is what they do. They play games and piss away other people's lives and money to drive their agenda a little further down the road. They don't give a shit about Constitutional rights but they'll gladly play the ""letter of the law"" game when it suits them, making a complete mockery of the beliefs we cherish, knowing that we're honor-bound to obey the rules we've set while they slink around them. ""Everyone has a seat at the table"" until you disagree and then they desperately scramble for fifteen different ways to pretend they don't hear you.

They held hearings to ""let the public be heard"" on the matter of gun laws - and then ignored the overwhelming chorus of ""NO!"" They couldn't get people to stop signing the recall petition so now they're trying to throw the whole thing out, again silencing the voices of over ten thousand citizens. If these laws were truly what Coloradans wanted, why not put them on the public ballot instead of ramming them down our throats despite our protests? If you truly believe that you did the right thing, why not face your constituency in a recall? Much like the argument for the bullshit background checks you forced on us, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear - right?

I'm trying to be rational and clear in my writing but I have to tell you I am so blindingly pissed right now, it's not even funny. Who are they to ignore the very people they are supposed to represent?!? We need to stop them right here, right now. I don't care if it's one man, we need to show that it can be done, that citizens hold the power to push back. We are a test case in almost every aspect of this recall process and are shaping legal precedent for taking power back from legislators who choose hubris over honor.

The help and support we’ve gotten from this community has been instrumental so far and the last thing I want to do is come across like a mooch but I’m swallowing my pride and doing my beggar routine again (Striker-approved). We don’t know how much we’re going to need this time but we are going to need funds to survive the stall tactics and attrition in the courts. Several of you IMed me over the past week to see if we still needed donations. At the time, I said we were waiting to see if we were still in the fight before accepting any more generosity but now I know – we are, we do and we’ll be reaching out to see if you’re still willing and able to contribute. For everyone else, whether you’ve donated before or are just hearing about this, we can use the help. If you can, please donate here. If you can’t, please spread the word about what’s happening – send people to this thread, to our website or to our Facebook page.

I just won this, and completed all necessary paperwork via my FFL. I already have a Governor, so I am selling this one.

MSRP is $769.00, and the cheapest place online that I have found one for sale new is $699.00.  Ad shipping and your transfer fee, you are probablly at $750.00.  The included ammo cost me around $57.00.  This would bring the total to $807.00.  Lastly, a Smith and Wesson Leather Molded Holster for the Governor is included.  It is valued at $70.00.  The overall total is around $875.00.  $750.00 for everything is very reasonable.  I will consider breaking it up if you do not want everything

  There are several advantages of owning the Governor over the Taurus Judge.  Some are 6rd capacity as opposed to 5rd capacity, the ability to shoot .45ACP out of the Governor, beefier barrel on the Governor, and Tritium Front Sight on the Governor.  Call 843-4four2-20onenine for inquiries."

 Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

 The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
 The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

The Px4 Storm Sub-Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system.  A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant, perfectly suited for concealment close to active, perspiring bodies.  The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable backstraps (included). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters.  A reversible magazine release button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a smaller or larger size button (optional).  An interchangeable slide catch can also be replaced with an optional low-profile configuration.  A standard Picatinny Rail allows for an array of aftermarket accessories.

This is a very nice subcompact pistol that is both engineered and built to exceptional standards.  The fit and finish of everything is flawless.  It has less than 150 rounds through it and still looks new.  It comes with two 13 rounds magazines, interchangeable backstraps for various hand sizes, lock, case, and all original paperwork.  I bought this about a month ago and have since decided that I prefer other carry options.

Carry Model
SAS treatment
Single Action Only
Night Sights
2-8 round factory magazines
Short Trigger
Short Reset Trigger System?
Original Box and Manual
Excellent Condition
Here's the deal:
I traded for this a couple of days ago, everything is accurate above accept possibly the short reset trigger.  Once I got it home, I noticed the trigger reset is longer than the SRT P226 I have, so I called Mark at Sig Sauer and he looked up the serial number for me.  He verified it does have the Short Reset Trigger system according to their records, but upon further investigation, he stated that unless it was a special program run, that they don't put the SRT System in Single Action Only. I then asked if possibly somebody converted it, he stated no as the serial number does verify it came from the factory as such.  So it may have been that, or a mistake in the input of their system.  
The gentleman I traded this for said he would trade me back (nice to deal with a stand up person) but he really wanted to keep his trade.  So I'm posting this today to sell or trade so he can keep the trade.  This will only be posted until tomorrow, then I'm going to trade it back.
Super nice firearm and I do love the SAS treatment
I was told it had only 30 rounds fired through it, and I believe it as there is no wear on this.
Will accept trade offers, but please be reasonable

To the JACK @ZZ THAT POSTED HIS COMMENT ABOUT PRICE, I BASED IT ON THE ""AUCTION SITE"" AND OF COURSE HIS LINK TAKES YOU TO A SIGHT THAT IS 7 MONTHS OLD AND OF COURSE OUT OF STOCK!!  COME ON MORON!!

I DID IT FOR YOU:  IT'S DISCONTINUED IN THIS CONFIGURATION, DO A GOOGLE SEARCH USING THE ADVANCED TAB AND TYPE IN THE MODEL AND FILTER WEB RESULTS THAT HAVE BEEN UPDATED IN THE LAST MONTH, THEN COMPARE PRICES.

Slide Fire Solutions' provide individuals the ability to fire their AR-15 at an incredible rate.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvLt8-Wf7r0

Normal price $359.00 + $18.00 for sling adapter

“Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.”

Included is a Spade sling plate. Many aftermarket single point sling adaptors do not have dimensions compatible with the SSAR-15, the SPADE sling attachment is designed specifically for use with the Slide Fire Stock.
