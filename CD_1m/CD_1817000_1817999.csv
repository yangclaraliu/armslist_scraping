Long-range tactical rifle designed with the shooter in mind, the ultimate
in big-bore, long-range power the SIG50 bolt-action tactical rifle. The
SIG50 offers a match grade trigger that breaks cleanly at 3.5 pounds. Fully
user-customizable ergonomics include an adjustable cheek rest and ergonomic
pistol grip stock with a butt plate adjustable for length of pull.
Additionally, the stock also detaches for ease of transport, yet locks up
firmly to provide optimal support and strength. A 29'  heavy fluted barrel
features a recoil-reducing muzzle break that minimizes wear and fatigue on
the shooter. Weighing in at only 23.5 pounds, Sig Sauer has created the
perfect blend between lightweight portability and manageable recoil. The
full length machined M1913 rails allow for rock solid, repeatable mounting
of optics, night vision, bipods and laser designators. Designed with input
from former military snipers, the SIG50 is a durable, accurate tactical
rifle that delivers robust down range energy.

Transfer to you will be done through Quiet Riot unless you would like another class 3 dealer to handle it. If that is the case it would need to be transferred on a Form 3 first."

Read this to learn about the firearm:  http://www.chiappafirearms.com/product/725

And it is BRAND NEW; never been fired.  (Unless they did one round at the factory.)

$895 gets you a hard case, leather holster, owner's manual, cute little cleaning brush, and a very cool firearm.

By the way, Sunday June 30th is the last day this gun is for sale.  If you are serious about owning this I will be available to sell it Friday morning, all day Saturday, and Sunday morning.

Also if you want to buy this from me you must be willing to sign a bill of sale.  You can't have this if you are under 21, so I will need to see your ID.  I'm not kidding, I have no problem keeping this gun, it is awesome.

I live around South Denver.  I am not opposed to meeting you half way.  If you are interested call or text REDACTED."

Along with the HP22 five inch barrel model is an extra three inch barrel, three extended ten round magazines, one standard ten round magazine, pistol lock, locking gun transport case, cleaning kit and oil, holster, and several extra replacement parts including 5 new recoil springs.

This pistol has 500 rounds down the pipe of the 3"" barrel, and only 50 rounds down the 5"" barrel. It has had two repairs in the past week. The magazine catch has been replaced (regular wear and tear) and the magazine well at a thin portion of the metal had a hairline crack that was repaired with steel epoxy. This gun has been cleaned every range visit using standard velocity ammunition. It is still functional. Prior to these repairs, the gun has always been reliable, and has been a fun range toy / plinker, and still is. This entire kit is a bargain with the parts, barrels, magazine, and ammunition included. I am selling it to make room in the collection for something else.

This gun is being sold as is, with 100 rounds of Remington Thunderbolt ammunition (in the Blazer boxes) to sweeten the deal. The whole package is $100, $90 for the pistol and 10 for the NY SAFE mandated background check/transfer fee at the FFL I would like to use here in Syracuse (Elite Guns).

Although CIA AK's aren't my favorite this one has been incredibly reliable for me and has never had a FTF or FTE. It functions flawlessly. As for the finish: it has two complete coats of primer of durable outdoor metal finish onto a prepped surface, followed by two coats of durable outdoor gold finish. I have a lot of experience with Duracoat and I much prefer this in both texture and appearance. The barrel on this rifle is also ready to be tapped if you'd like to add a suppressor or muzzle brake.

It's a model 10/63. It has a wood stock and fore grip with a Dragunov style rear. These could be replaced with a standard or folding stock and pistol grip as it has the slot required to install a pistol grip. Although CIA AK's aren't my favorite this one has been incredibly reliable for me and has never had a FTF or FTE. It functions flawlessly. As for the finish: it has two complete coats of primer of durable outdoor metal finish onto a prepped surface, followed by two coats of durable outdoor gold finish. I have a lot of experience with Duracoat and I much prefer this in both texture and appearance. The barrel on this rifle is also ready to be tapped if you'd like to add a suppressor or muzzle brake. The rifle will come with one gold magazine with more available upon request. If you have any issues with the finish down the road I can refinish it for you.

That has caused more than a few airlines pilots to sell their HKs. 

Most people know my mantra: ""You can buy a better pistol than a Glock, but you're going to have to pay a GREAT amount of money."" Well, here's your chance to get better than a Glock for a LITTLE more money! It's a very well cared-for HK USP .40c (""Compact"").
This USP .40c was carried in a pilots leather flight bag with his charts and books, so it exhibits some mild, external wear on two high-points-- the edges of the TRITIUM NIGHT SIGHTS and the slide release lever.

The HK USP is the Mercedes Benz of the personal protection/tactical league. They are dependable, durable, fine machines--both ergonomically and mechanically. This pistol fits one's hand and possesses a natural point-of-aim like no other.

I completely stripped this pistol and it is 99% internally and 95% externally (as previously described). Here is your opportunity to own an HK USP Compact that has been correctly broken in at a fraction of the ""New Car"" cost.

USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

I read these even fit the Beretta 92, but don't quote me on that.  Please do your own research.

This magazine I'm selling is model# TAU-AI

Magazine was purchased at local store off the clearance rack for $20.00 less than 3 months ago.

Manager told me the magazine was on the clearance rack because some punk kid had tried to shoplift it earlier that day and sliced the box open it was in and took the magazine out and tried to run but the manager chased and caught him.

For the record... the manager also told me he hates running.  :)

Magazine has never been loaded.  Magazine has never been inside of a gun.  Magazine is brand new exactly like it's supposed to be and I even saved the sliced packaging it was in when I bought it.  I've decided I'm buying a new firearm and don't need this magazine anymore.

I bought it for $20.00 plus tax.   You can have it for $15.00 with no tax.

I'll even consider trades.

*** I have NO problem with you thoroughly inspecting the magazine before we conclude our transaction to make sure everything I said in this posting is 100% accurate and it is BRAND NEW.  It's very important to me that YOU are satisfied with what you buy."

Will fit virtually any rifle with a side rail like the AK or SVD/PSL has. 

This optic is amazing and it is by far the best sight I own. Hate to sell but I need the money. 

It features a tritium power retical that will change based on lighting conditions due to the light and my camera I could take a picture of the one retical but I assure you they work perfectly. They are extremely clear but do not interfere with acquiring targets rapidly and accurately. Some of the features include:
It has a lever activated tinted lens filter that gives great reticle clarity in bright light condition.
It's fully coated prismatic lens system provides a remarkable, high contrast, wide angle field of view allowing for fast acquisition of moving and spaced targets. The advanced battery-free, illuminated white&green reticle allows the Obzor be used in ANY conditions. 

This is the optic you want on your AKM or AK74 style rifle, it's rock solid and won't shift or move during fire or even dropping your rifle. And the best part is you can remove the optic and still retain zero. This optic also sits perfectly centered over the bore unlike most other eastern bloc optics."

Do your research folks and check the going rate for all firearms. rifles and pistols that are listed on this website for half of what they should go for are most likely a scam.How ever good deals do exist. 

remember face to face transactions are the best way to go. Mailing checks to private address/persons for gun purchases is not wise. Use a FFL Dealer

when buying out of state transactions should be done VIA FFL to FFL and is the law.No  one person can just put a Firearm(registered receiver/chassis)  in the mail without first obtaining an FFL. 

Also most of these recent adds have been constructed using pictures and information off of other websites. Beware !

13.  Lastly I have some real cool Rifle 45 Degree Offset Micro Flip Up Rapid Transition Sight System BUIS ($40 for the set)

These sights (sight set Front & rear) are removable sight that sets on a 45 degree offset with push QD button flip up style sights. You can utilize the scope on your rifle and your sights without having to remove, fold or add any sights since the irons are at the offset.
Mounts to all picatinny rails. Dual apendature on the rear sight with sight adjustments for sighting. Front sight adjusts up and down for sighting. Front sight is used for rail height applications (not gas block height).
Spring-loaded sights deploy at the push of a button to provide instant backup sighting. Quick Deploy System locks securely and requires a firm, positive press of the button to deploy or retract the sight, so it won’t accidentally activate when bumped—these sights stay where you put them.

♦ Minimal profile when folded with radiused edges and a smoothly curved front surface to prevent snagging on foliage, gear, or clothing. Cross bolt and side bar provide solid attachment to MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style rail systems.

► T6 6061 Aircraft Aluminum Body
