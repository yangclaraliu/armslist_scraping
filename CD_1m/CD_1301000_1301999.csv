That being said, I've got a few cigars that I would like to sell. I had a Daniel Marshall humidor that I had stored them in but I sold it so these have been in a Tupperware with a small humidification pack from Boveda (72) that I have kept in there (swapped them out every 6 mos or so). They may be just a tad on the dry side...It's been a few months since I have swapped out the most recent Boveda pack... 

I could hang on to them but I just don't smoke anymore and don't see myself smoking anymore. Here is what I have:

100 rd pack Federal Champion .45ACP - $32.17
100 rd pack WWB 9mm - $24.47
50 rd Tula .45 - $14.95
50 rd Tula .380 - $14.95

Just missed 100 rd 9mm Federal Champion at $21 and change, and a friend bought 100 rd Federal .223 for somewhere around $32.  

.22LR prices there are virtually unchanged for the most part though none was in stock.

All of this ammo sat on the shelves for up to 2 days and more.  This was in multiple shipments, not all there at once.  You don't have to skip work to find ammo, it's put out throughout the day and evening.  Your LGS has ammo too.  If it's reasonably priced, then support them.  If it's not, let them know.

To the person wanting to start the Google group:  I have a feeling that will become moocher city.  There are too many that want to hoard or make a profit off of it.  I salute your idea though.

I have a UTG red/green dot sight on top. A decently bright led flashlight on the right rail. Forgot lumens but was bright  enough to light up my neighbors house across street. The left rail has a very powerful green laser with a custom touch pad mounted in the rail groove so while holding the forward grip, you can activate the laser or flashlight with that one hand. Have fired a couple hundred rounds in a day without any sights leaving their mark.  I have a pair of bonded magazines that work flawlessly and clears all when both loaded and used. I also have one more steel mag and 3 un used tapco magazines from GAT guns. I have about 250-300 rounds of ammunition included. I have a lot of time and money into this one so my price is higher .

From the website:
The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.
Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

Newly designed SPS Varmint stock with vented beavertail fore-end
Sling swivel studs included

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

 Selling the best AK pistol made. 
The first time you pick one up you know it is a superior AK to anything you have held. The attention to detail is excellent.  The reviews are everywhere and so much out there to back the claim. This pistol is like nothing out there in its class. Arsenal is by far the most elite AK manufacturer period. The Krinkov SLR-106 is the most accurate and dependible pistol made. They are not very common and only have one set back. The Arsenal Circle Ten mags are very hard to come by. I took care of that problem with a total of 20 magazines. I had three of these and this is my last one. The fire smooth and brutally accurate.  They will never jam regardles of the ammo you feed them. The internal parts are hand polished, acid washed. They came nearly flawless from Arsenal and are now perfect. Reinforced springs and perfect rivits with a flawless bulletproof black finish. I will include approx 500 rounds of which 200 are high end Penetration Green tip 3020 FPS and a Magpul sling, custom grip, 14, of the 30 round mags, 5 of the 20 round and one 5 round.  Drago custom tactical case/pack. She is flawless and everything is NIB. Several Mags, Arsenal Circle 10, 30 rounders not in photos.

1900 or Best Offer
Text Only - REDACTED

Price Breakdown, it's a bargain.
Rifle at this time = $1200+
Ammo = $200+
Optics and mounts = $300+
Mags = $100+
22 Conversion kit = $150+
Misc Accessories = $150+
Total = $2100+
I'm asking 1900 or best offer, won't be able to buy any of this new, possibly for the next year due to shortages and huge backlogs of orders. So prices will remain high on the used guns. My price is very fair considering, it's practically what I paid when the items were available.

Rifle price 7 months back when I bought it was $900, so, either way, it's a bargain considering current prices and shortages.

Fully serviced and shooting like the Veteran it is. It has been stripped of cosmoline and given a light sanding. I have not yet replaced a finish on the rifle so it is still 'raw' Chu wood ready for your own personal touch. This is without question the finest Type 53 I have encountered. Like 99.99% of these encountered, there is no cleaning rod but any 30/30 cleaning kit will work just fine. 

if you know anything about the T-53's you'll know finding one in good shape is tough to do, add all matching numbers to that and it's a pretty uncommon piece to say the least.

Face to face trades only in Camdenton/Linn Creek. I live in a rural area so you will have the opportunity to shoot it a few times & see what you think. I truly hate to sell it, but there is something else i want pretty bad for the collection...lol. You know how it is.

Great little American made side by side. To my knowledge there is no other sxs in this price range that can compete with it. 

I purchased this gun from a friend of the original owner.  Next is what he told me,

""I purchased the shotgun from a friend of mine who purchased it new some years ago..He was in the Marine Corps during the Korean War and was a machine gunner..He wounded 3 times and won countless medals for valor.. Once he was out of the Military, he joined the Pennsylvania State Police and retired as a Captain.  He was a hunter and this was his bird gun..""


Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale, show MN DL and have either a Permit to carry or Permit to purchase to prove you are legal to own a firearm.

This is the lower Adcor makes for their fancy piston rifles (they are in Phase II for the Army's Individual Carbine Competition to replace the M4).
These guys were making 1000 upper receivers a day for Colt for five years before they began selling under their own label.
If you're interested: http://www.adcorindustries.com/wordpress//images/Adcor_Shotgun_News.pdf

They also make a fancy (and expensive) billet lower, which this is not.
It is, however, a pretty high quality forged lower.

I bought three receivers (a Yankee Hill Machine, Palmetto State, and Adcor).
I'm keeping the YHM because of the build I am working on, but overall the machining and finish on this Adcor are better/smoother than either the YHM or the PSA.

This rifle was made by Rossi (barrel with ""Amadaeo Rossi"" stamp) for the USA market imported by Interarms. This is a very fine specimen of the rare model with the Puma on the left side of the receiver. This rifle has seen VERY little use and maybe unfired. This is a saddle ring model but as you can see from the photos a previous owner removed the ring to avoid scratching the receiver and to keep it from rattling. The saddle rings are available very cheaply if you want to replace it. If you know Rossi 92 lever guns the actions are very, very stiff out of the box and need the action worked over and over again and/or shot a lot to loosen up at which point they are some of the finest versions of the famous Winchester model 1892 lever action rifle. This action was VERY stiff when I got it. I have worked it some and have gotten it somewhat loosenend up but still needs more. This stiffness, the bore being spotless and the gun having virtually no wear except for the action working I did lead me to believe this gun is in near new condition, maybe unfired. but I'm selling as ""used"". I have not shot the gun. The wood and metal are gorgeous. I am refining my collection to Winchester lever actions and maybe a few Marlin so I'm going to let this go. I will sell outright or will trade:"

May trade for a tactical 12 gauge shotgun in like new condition.

Mossberg tactical shotguns are fine, but know I will expect you to add cash on your end.

The gun originally carried a lifetime warranty to the original owner, so it’s a dependable, although inexpensive, gun.  I have carried an identical gun under the Jiminez name for several years and have never had a problem with it. This gun looks good and shoots good.  My daughter wanted a 9mm and I told her that most auto actions were too strong for a woman, that they need a revolver, but she insisted, so I bought it for her.  Sure enough, the action was too strong for her, I bought her a revolver, and the gun is now for sale.  I have shot several boxes of ammo thru it with no problems.  Cash only, no trades, price is FIRM.  Price includes the gun and 1 mag, nothing more.  Face to face only.  I have a paper trail on this gun, so ID is required and buyer must sign a receipt acknowledging purchase.  You must be 21 years old or older.  I can demonstrate the gun near my house (daylight hours only), or I will be willing to travel in a 25 mile radius from the Mobile, AL airport to meet with you for the sale, in a public parking lot.
