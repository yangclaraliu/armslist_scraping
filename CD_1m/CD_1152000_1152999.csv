This allows super quick target acquisition from long range to in very close. These setups are currently being utilized in the military with some of our most elite units.  This thing is freaking TOUGH!  It's built to withstand it all.  I have had it mounted on a LaRue Tactical Quick Detach mount that returns to Zero EVERYTIME without fail. That is great because it allows you to use this on multiple weapons easily.  I also bought a nice Scopecoat for it to protect it while not in use.   This optic was 2,000 bucks plus tax then I spent another 225 on the mount and protector.

This is from my advanced collection which I have reluctantly decided to let a few items go from. Will consider trades on a correct WW1 Era Colt 1911, or partial cash/trades on other firearms.

Product Information

One look and you know Xtreme Tactical Rings are all about point-of-aim security and durability. The super-strong yet surprisingly lightweight, six-screw aluminum rings anchor scopes in place on any Picatinny rail or Weaver-style base to deliver unfailing return-to-zero. Available in 1"" and 30mm sizes, a choice of four ring heights accommodates the installation of any sight from red-dots to large objective target scopes. The 1"" height is perfect for all scopes on AR15/M16 flattop receivers, providing proper cheek weld. Designed and built for the rigors of tactical shooting and massive recoil, Xtreme Tactical Rings are not out of place on varmint rifles or big game rifles that may be exposed to the abuses of hard hunting and magnum recoils.

The Aimpoint CompM4 sight is part of the company's highest-end series of sights, and features improved energy efficiency, a high battery compartment, and an internal voltage regulator that allows the sight to operate on any AA size battery. Ideal for use with Aimpoint's 3X magnifier scope module, the CompM4 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices. The sight boasts a rugged, easy-to-use 16-position manual switch with seven night vision compatible settings and nine daylight settings. Its body is designed to protect both the optics and adjustment components against hard use, and is waterproof to 150 feet. An improved QRP2 Picatinny rail mount eliminates the need for a separate mounting ring.
Next Generation Design Improvements
Ready-to-mount: The CompM4 sight is shipped complete with a QRP2 mount and standard AR15 spacer, as well as a killFlash anti-reflection device and MILSPEC rubber lens covers.
Integral Mount: An integral mount eliminates the need for a separate ring, and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of weapon systems.
Designed for Third-generation Night Vision: The CompM4 sight can be used with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is optimized for third generation night vision technology.
Clear, Bright Image: Unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot's selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction.

Hornady XTP bullets were designed for hunting, self-defense, and law enforcement. One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities. 

Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition."

""We are proud to announce that within a matter of days we will be going live with a new program. Due to a bill currently moving through the Colorado legislature, there is the possibility that Colorado residents' ability to purchase standard capacity magazines will soon be infringed. Before that happens, and Magpul is forced to leave the state in order to keep to our principles, we will be doing our best to get standard capacity PMAGs into the hands of any Colorado resident that wants them.

Verified Colorado residents will be able to purchase up to ten (10) standard capacity AR/M4 magazines directly from Magpul, and will be given immediate flat-rate $5 shipping, bypassing our current order queue.

Our customers outside of Colorado, please know that our PMAG production will continue at an ever-increasing rate until we do relocate, shipments to our distributors in other states will continue, and that we do not expect relocation to significantly impact PMAG production. We are also aware that Colorado is not the only state with existing or pending magazine capacity restrictions; we are working on programs for other affected states as well.

Full details and instructions will be announced when we are able to go live; please watch here for the coming announcement."""

The CAMMENGA MODEL EM3-556 EASYMAG is a heat-treated steel magazine, with tip-proof steel follower, chamfered feed lips, and a stainless steel main spring, which improves upon the reliability and feeding performance expectations for M16 and AR-15 type weapons.

Slide-open design allows for rapid loading, unloading, cleaning, maintenance, and inspection without disassembly.

Semi-auto shotgun,"East Louisville, Oldham County, Louisville, Kentucky","$ 1,000","Listed On: Tuesday, March 5, 2013",Shotguns,no type,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Shotgun,"We only have one of these! It is new in hard shell case and includes 2-5 round mags and 3 internal chokes. 
The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms*. The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar. The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed.
The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer. 
The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes. The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location.

Factory packaged, unopened, untampered with 9mm brass ammunition. I'm interested in respectable brands like Federal, Winchester, Remington, and PMC - just to name a few. 

What I'm not looking for: No reloads/home made ammo. No steel or aluminum case ammo. And no garbage brands such as TulAmmo (I like my firearms to work). 

I'm also not going to pay an outrageous amount for simple handgun ammo. It disgusts me to see so many sellers out there trying to off load their 9mm ammunition for $.45, $.50, $.60 or more per round. That is absolutely RIDICULOUS! There is no reason for those kinds of asking prices. And those that ARE paying those prices are only making the ammo shortage situation WORSE! 

So, if you want to do a little business and sell off some of your surplus 9mm ammunition, let's talk. If you're trying to get rich by selling your ammo for 200%-300% more than what its worth, maybe you can go ask your fellow Obama lovers to buy it. Because you're NOT getting rich off of me!"

692,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1152692,For Sale/Trade:  PC Security Surveillance System w/cameras!,"OKC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 500,"Listed On: Friday, March 15, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a Desktop PC Computer specially designed to work as a 4 camera DVR video security surveillance system. Comprehensive motion sensitive software (already installed and working...original disks included) can be remotely monitored and networked. Has 10/100 built in network and Windows XP operating system. You can set up many different sections within one camera for motion activation and exclude others, so if you have something like a bush or tree that moves with the wind, it will not set off the recording. Monitoring is constant. You can go back and search by time or events, fast or slow. You would be amazed at the complexity of what you can do with this system.

Since the DVR software is already installed and working. all you have to do is hook up the cameras to it and you can be watching your home or business immediately. You can use this system to burn CD's or browse the Internet if you like, as it is a fully functioning Windows computer. Hook a USB device to it to do backups or just burn backup info to CD. Being a Windows based computer gives you many advantages over a proprietary DVR system.

5 individual cooling fans. 2 cooling fans inside the case, 1 cooling fan in a PCI card slot, 1 additional fan built into the power supply and 1 other fan directly on the processor. 

Just upgraded to 1 TB Serial ATA hard drive (from the original 160 GB), and 1 GB of RAM (from the original 256 MB). the original Celeron processor was upgraded to Pentium 4 (2.8 MHz), and the system has a CD ReWritable drive and front USB and audio ports. 

The system worked great before all of the upgrades, but the original 160 GB storage capacity was on the small side and the overall system works even better, with a much greater capacity to keep data for a very long time without rewriting over the drive and losing historical information. My goal was to upgrade so the system would hold a lot more video recording, and last a long time.

My needs have changed, so I went with another similar system built for 8 cameras. This is perfect for a standard sized home or small business.

Private party, I am not a business, and I only have one sytem to sell. The ""One Size Fits All"" systems advertised on Craigslist will cost you a little less, but will generally not meet your needs, and you will end up spending a lot more later. 

Complete system comes with 4 cameras, (2 brand new, color cameras, never used, made for bright or low light [2 each: New in the boxes], 2 very expensive, high quality, high resolution cameras with 6 interchangable lenses for each camera to get any kind of sight picture you want [2 each: Black bullet camera as shown]) all necessary wiring, keyboard and mouse, any computer monitor can be used, but is the only thing not included.

Pre-panic prices on this ammo were about .34/round of .223, and .24/round of 9mm, and that's what I value it at.

Magpul's website lists standard Pmags at $14.95 each and has announced they will ship in CO for a flat $5.

Is it really worth spending $30 or more for a used USGI aluminum mag?  OR just wait a week and get those Pmags for $15 instead of $50?  Sorry gougers, looks like the gravy train is slowing down.  Get those over priced used mags up quick...

""We are proud to announce that within a matter of days we will be going live with a new program. Due to a bill currently moving through the Colorado legislature, there is the possibility that Colorado residents' ability to purchase standard capacity magazines will soon be infringed. Before that happens, and Magpul is forced to leave the state in order to keep to our principles, we will be doing our best to get standard capacity PMAGs into the hands of any Colorado resident that wants them.

Verified Colorado residents will be able to purchase up to ten (10) standard capacity AR/M4 magazines directly from Magpul, and will be given immediate flat-rate $5 shipping, bypassing our current order queue.

Our customers outside of Colorado, please know that our PMAG production will continue at an ever-increasing rate until we do relocate, shipments to our distributors in other states will continue, and that we do not expect relocation to significantly impact PMAG production. We are also aware that Colorado is not the only state with existing or pending magazine capacity restrictions; we are working on programs for other affected states as well.

Full details and instructions will be announced when we are able to go live; please watch here for the coming announcement.""

Hornady XTP bullets were designed for hunting, self-defense, and law enforcement. One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities. 

Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition."

The two-piece modular construction of the 30 round magazine allows for maximum strength and integrity to be achieved while simultaneously allowing the magazine to drop free as well as solve feeding issues. The straight upper piece of the magazine allows the magazine to drop free while also presenting ammunition to the chamber in perfect form. The curved lower portion of the magazine allows the remaining rounds to stack naturally which breeds precise feeding. The functionality of the magazine is only half of the battle, this magazine is constructed from the latest aerospace polymers which are impervious to the detrimental effects of solvents and lubricants. The waffle style molding on the exterior of the magazine helps ensure a positive grip.

Hornady XTP bullets were designed for hunting, self-defense, and law enforcement. One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities. 

Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition."

Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
 Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.
 The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and
 interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
 1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
 2. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
 located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
 3. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop."
