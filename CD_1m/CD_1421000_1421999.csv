The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols

They are not going down anytime soon. Ammo is back ordered for months.
The big retailers are selling it for .20 cents around and up for .22 lr and it last online for 2 minutes if you are lucky.
Gunbroker prices are .13 cents a round and up plus shipping. Cases of 5000 are hitting $700 plus shipping on there.
Its like everything else no one wants it when its cheap but when it goes up everyone wants it. And you want to bitch about the people that planned ahead?
Take gold for an example in 2005 it was under 600 a oz then it went to 1000/oz then 2000/oz. So someone bought it in 2005 at 600 today its worth around 1600 so the people that invested in it should sell it for 600? I dont think anyone is that stupid. Same thing with stocks and other goods. Are you going to sell your house for less than its worth because someone wants it for half price?
Ammo is going to keep going up. Starting in january 2014 you will have to do a background check to purchase it and your purchase will be put in a state data base.
Do you think a dealer is going to spend time doing a check and not want extra for his time? Not gonna happen.
You wont be able to order online unless it gets shipped to a dealer for a background check. And at $3.80 a gallon for gas are you going to drive out of state to look for ammo? It will cost you more than most prices on here. Unless you live on the boarder and places in PA are already not selling ammo if you are from NY. And they dont have it in stock. The whole east coast is out of stock NY to Florida.
lets face the facts this country is going down the drain. We lose rights everyday by the people some of us voted in. It was all about ""CHANGE"" Yeah the change to a non free socialist country.
I dont like the prices either but Im buying when I can. For a little extra I know I have ammo to protect my family.
What are you going to do when the food supply gets cut off because we dont do what big brother wants? You going to stop looters with a empty gun? You going to stand by and watch criminals take the stuff you earned and assult your wife and children? Possibly die bitching and being stubborn about a few cents more a round?
Most of the sellers here are offering life insurance at a little higher price than normal. Whats the cost of not having it?
Wake up people the america we knew is no longer here. Its only getting worst. If they get the 2nd they will take the rest from us.
Sorry to rant, but the ammo price crying is getting old. If you dont like the prices of the ammo ads dont read them.
PS. If anyone has some CCI 22lr for sale around .15 cents a round send me a email."

goodgunprices.com has some extremely valuable information about reasonable prices for guns in this market. Don't lose out on your hard earned cash without visiting this site first!
You'll be glad you did. Here's a small excerpt from the site:

ARMSLIST and all other gun marketplaces are community run for the most part. As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

These price criminals only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but let's face it, do we really need 100 round drums or is that more of a want? Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back under the 1000s where they all belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The regularity will only return if we make it.

AR-15: $600-$1300 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)
AK-47: $400-$900
SKS:$300-$500
SCAR 16/17: $2000/$2800
AR-10: $1000-1500
Glock: $400-600
10/22: $229
ACR: $2000
1911: $600-1100
9mm ammo: $0.25/round is on the higher end
223/5.56: $0.35/round
.308/7.62 NATO: maybe up to $1/round (on high side)
.22: $0.05/round is high

Again, feel free to add your $0.02, make changes, repost, and then get to the flagging of overpriced scams."

Looking to trade for AR ammo and would even consider trading multiple stripped lowers towards a decent upper. I just bought several mags, so I really don't need any more of those, but would still consider a BCG or offer multiple stripped lower for an assembled complete lower.

 The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
 FACTS:
 You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
 We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
 The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
 The permit is valid for 5 years
 We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
 Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
 Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

528,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1421528,For Sale/Trade:  remington 721- reach out and touch somebody,"westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 500,"Listed On: Monday, April 8, 2013",Handguns,Remington                                                                                ,no type,Bolt Action,no type,"From 1921 up to WWII, Remington made sporting rifles (the Model 30 and variations) using Model 1917 receivers and parts left over from WWI production. They made only such parts as they had to. At the end of WWII, they decided that the M1917 ploy had about run its course. Even though they used some tricks to disguise the origin of the rifles, customers were aware that they were buying what was essentially a warmed over military rifle.

So they turned their engineers and designers, including the famous Mike Walker, loose with blank sheets of paper. The result was not one, but two rifles, the standard length 721 and the short action 722. The 722 was released with a brand new cartridge, the famous ""triple deuce"", the .222 Remington, from which came a whole slew of cartridges, including the military 5.56mm, aka the .223 Remington.

The 721/722 rifles were made to be affordable, a contrast to the Winchester 70, famed as the ""Rifleman's Rifle"" but quite expensive. The result of the desire to keep the price down was that the rifles were plain. While special treatment, even engraving and inlay, was available, the standard rifles had no checkering, trigger guards were stamped steel, and so on.

But they shot and shot well. A lot of owners wanted to upgrade, and for a while gun shops had bins full of take off stocks, replaced by better grade custom stocks. Eventually, Remington got the word and, using the same basic action, produced the Model 700, now I believe the best selling CF sporting rifle in the world.

There is a sad sidelight to the Remington success story. Winchester (Olin) was unable to admit that it was losing sales to Remington and began to focus on military surplus rifles as the source of their economic woes. So they persuaded Senator Tom Dodd, of CT, father of the current CT senator Chris Dodd, to include a ban on military surplus imports in his Gun Control Act of 1968, not hard to do after JFK was killed with a surplus rifle. In a nasty example of special interest lobbying, Winchester's attorneys even wrote that part of the law. There were hints that Dodd received more than thanks and campaign support, but nothing was ever proven.

***New Gun Legislation In Rhode Island***

Chafee is announcing sweeping gun control regulations TOMORROW and it's not looking good for us, or for the Second Amendment in general. An inside source tells me that the legislation is to mirror the recently enacted (and ridiculous) Connecticut legislation, but with even further restrictions. You may not be able to get these as soon as next week.

I purchased this from Gunbroker for my now ex-girlfriend to use, and, well, she's my ex-girlfriend now. I have spent a LOT of money on this rig. Everything is brand new, and was purchased within the last month. What you get is (with what I paid in parenthesis):

Bushmaster ORC AR-15 w/Original Box - ($1499)
Low Profile Red Dot Sights - (Included)
Pro Low-Profile Bipod - ($35)
Forward Grip - ($20 - I lost a screw, easily fixed, I'm sure - I'll throw it in)
Original Bushmaster Aluminum 30 Round Magazine (Included)
Aluminum (Not plastic) Quad Rail - ($75)
(2) Thermold Polymer 20 Round Magazines - ($50)
Pillared Plano Hard Shell Case - ($40)
Aluminum (Not plastic) 45° Back Up Iron Sights - ($50)

Original Handguard is also included. It has some mars from being removed.

I have A LOT OF MONEY into this rig, and I should have thought twice before spending this kinda money on the broad. My new girl is scared to death of guns, so no go there. My loss, your gain, I guess.

I don't have any ammo for it (I already sold it), but I can steer you in the right direction to get hold of some for a decent price. Another thing you should move quickly on, as the legislation will also greatly affect how we can get ammo in the future. This gun law shit sucks. I think it's time we all moved to New Hampshire...

The rifle has never been fired. The rifle will need to be sighted as it's never left the gun safe at my old man's house since I got it. Sighting it is quick and easy to do.

I'd love to keep it, but rent is overdue, and I need the cash.

Information provided by the Taurus website:

The Original Raging Bulls are still among America's favorite hunting handguns. Chambering the popular and powerful .44 Magnum and 454 Casull rounds, the mighty 444 and 454 revolvers are built for a lifetime of tough use. Offering award-winning designs in four distinct barrel lengths, these monsters feature a crisp trigger break and smooth pull for accuracy, cushioned grips and factory porting to reduce felt recoil.

Features:
Dual lockup cylinder
Provides stability under extreme chamber pressures.

Cushioned insert grip
Exclusive on the RAGING ™ Series large frame revolvers, Cushioned insert grip pillows recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.

Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

I am a cash buyer for a Mosin in good shape.  I'm well aware of what you paid for it a year or more ago, and I understand the principles of supply vs demand.   I can purchase one online (rated excellent)for $150 or less, have it transferred for $20, pay taxes, etc... And still come out just under $200.
If you can beat that (or match, and I don't have to clean out cosmolene)and the rifle is in nice shape (for a refurbished Russian WWI battle rifle) I'll buy it.  It doesn't need to be a hex receiver, or an m38 or m44 - this will be a shooter. Just a nice 91/30 will do.
I'm not buying your ""get this one there won't ever be another imported"" $450 Mosin, but I'm not opposed to you making a profit either. $200 doubles (or better) the purchase price of a 91/30 not that long ago, and they're still importing batches of these.

Also on this rifle is a Nikon P223 3 x 32 BDC scope, which has only been on the rifle for maybe 20 rounds- still has sticker on it (just enough to site it in).  I paid $150 for this scope less than 3 months ago. Rings are Leupold quick detach.

As you can probably tell by my additions, I had big plans for this rifle as my varmint slayer, but unfortunately I have run into the need for some cash.  I am asking $1200 obo for the entire package, and I will also include (1) brand new in packaging 30 round black Magpul PMAG, the factory metal mag that came with the gun, and a 20 rounds of ammo, so you can head straight to the range if you would like.

This little pistol has had a grand total of 30 rounds fired through it.  Functions flawlessly, was cleaned and oiled before it was put away a little over a year ago.  I have the original box and paperwork with this firearm.  

These are basically a bullpup pistol design, allowing for a longer barrel in a small, concealable frame.  Pistol will fire +p ammo.  I am the original owner, went through the waiting process at Boberg, and it was worth it.  However I am selling this to fund a project.  Not many people have heard of these, and they are not everyone's cup of tea because you can buy a 9mm cheaper, but these are just quality in every sense of the word.   Price will reflect a this as a used (however slightly) firearm, and will be set at 900.00.   I challenge someone to find one this nice for a cheaper price!   The firearm is located in Newcastle, FTF and cash is required.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 4zero5-6two6-one8one4.

The only ding with this rifle is one of the trigger guard ""ears"" is broken, but i did JB weld it back on there, so it is on there pretty good and in no way affects the rifle, just not pretty to look at, but you cant see it because the Stark grip, with its built in trigger guard, i have on there covers it up nicely (see pictures). So with over $400 worth of accessories ( And i actually paid more for them, the prices listed above are just an average of what they're going for online) and 450 rounds of ammo,that is hard to find right now and super expensive ( $1.00+ per round), i find this to be a great deal. I will also include an extra Black-Magpul MOE grip and all the original parts that came with the rifle. if you need any more pics or info just let me know price firm at 1500.00. please contact mike @ REDACTED YOU WILL NEED VALID NEW MEXICO ID AND LEGALLY ABLE TO OWN A FIREARM.

***New Gun Legislation In Rhode Island***

Chafee is announcing sweeping gun control regulations TOMORROW and it's not looking good for us, or for the Second Amendment in general. An inside source tells me that the legislation is to mirror the recently enacted (and ridiculous) Connecticut legislation, but with even further restrictions. You may not be able to get these as soon as next week.

I purchased this from Gunbroker for my now ex-girlfriend to use, and, well, she's my ex-girlfriend now. I have spent a LOT of money on this rig. Everything is brand new, and was purchased within the last month. What you get is (with what I paid in parenthesis):

Bushmaster ORC AR-15 w/Original Box
Low Profile Red Dot Sights
Pro Low-Profile Bipod 
Forward Grip
Original Bushmaster Aluminum 30 Round Magazine
Aluminum (Not plastic) Quad Rail
(2) Thermold Polymer 20 Round Magazines
Pillared Plano Hard Shell Case
Aluminum (Not plastic) 45° Back Up Iron Sights

Original Handguard is also included. It has some mars from being removed.

I have A LOT OF MONEY into this rig, and I should have thought twice before spending this kinda money on the broad. My new girl is scared to death of guns, so no go there. My loss, your gain, I guess.

I don't have any ammo for it (I already sold it), but I can steer you in the right direction to get hold of some for a decent price. Another thing you should move quickly on, as the legislation will also greatly affect how we can get ammo in the future. This gun law stuff bites. I think it's time we all moved to New Hampshire...

The rifle has never been fired. The rifle will need to be sighted as it's never left the gun safe at my old man's house since I got it. Sighting it is quick and easy to do.

I'd love to keep it, but rent is overdue, and I need the cash.

$1600 Or Best Offer (Higher or Lower). I am flexible on the price, but don't insult me with lowball offers.

This firing position lowers the bore axis in relation to the shooter, meaning that instead of your wrist absorbing the recoil of the shot, your arm will absorb more, and thus makes it much easier to shoot. It also has the flat hexagonal cylinder.  The firearm comes with everything as it did new, including the box, paperwork, and leather holster.

I am posting a few different firearms for sale, all at extremely fair prices, and whichever one sells first I'll be pulling the other ads down.  I'm trying to fund a project.

The price will be $700 and is located in Newcastle.  FTF and cash please.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me at 4zero5-six2six-one8one4.

Thanks,
Adam"

This is a beautiful Springfield TRP. I am not the original owner and purchased this just the way it sits. According to the previous owner the round count is ""way under"" 500. TRP Armory Kote, Night Sights dated 09 (still bright), Wilson FLGR, Wilson extended slide release. Wilson Shock Buff, Wilson G10 Grips. All original parts included. (except grips). 2 mags and box with holster and mag holder. Excellent condition. Cash price $1375 in Evansville. Trade options will pretty much be limited to nice 1911s. 9mm or 45. Not really looking for an officer model unless it is an STI 9mm or EMP 9. I may also be interested in an upper end Sig P229, 226, 239. Will also accept ammo and extras as a partial trade.

Please no lowball offers. Trades must be in excellent condition. FTF in the Evansville area only. Must have LTCH.

One specific gun I have been eying is a Kimber Tactical Pro in 9mm. The Colt carry model or a Remington R1 Carry. Would also trade for Ruger SR1911. A full size and a commander would be great. Prefer 1911s without the firing pin safety but not a deal killer. +/- cash for the right deal. Open to multiple gun trades. 

Other trade interests, Glocks, Shields, 9mm or 45 only, GP100 4"" Stainless

VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market 

The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope. 

All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual"

LOADED BUSHMASTER ORC AR-15 WITH TONS OF EXTRAS!

Definitely the nicest AR-15 on Armslist. Be the envy of all your friends. This thing is bada*s.

Get this quick. This is going to sell lightning fast. You will not find a more loaded AR15 anywhere in Armslist, in any area. This thing is LOADED.

I will not hold the rifle. First come, first serve. Cash ONLY. No trades. No deliveries.

Not sure I could have added much more to this rifle...

***New Gun Legislation In Rhode Island***

New gun legislation is on the way in RI...

The governor is announcing the new legislation on Tuesday morning of this week... In clear violation of our Second Amendment rights.

The time to buy is now.

I purchased this last month for my now ex-girlfriend to use, and, well, she's my ex-girlfriend now. I have spent a LOT of money on this rig. Everything is brand new, and was purchased within the last month. What you get is:

Bushmaster ORC AR-15 w/Original Box
Low Profile Red Dot Sights
Pro Low-Profile Bipod 
Forward Grip (Needs a bolt)
Original Bushmaster Aluminum 30 Round Magazine
Aluminum (Not plastic) Quad Rail
(2) Thermold Polymer 20 Round Magazines
Pillared Plano Hard Shell Case
Aluminum (Not plastic) 45 Degree Back Up Iron Sights

Original Handguard is also included. It has some mars from being removed.

I have A LOT OF MONEY into this rig, and I should have thought twice before spending this kinda money on the chick. My new girl is scared to death of rifles, so no go, there. My loss, your gain, I guess.

I don't have any ammo for it (I already sold it), but I can steer you in the right direction to get hold of some for a decent price. Another thing you should move quickly on, as the legislation will also greatly affect how we can get ammo in the future. I think it's time we all moved to New Hampshire...

The rifle has never been fired. The rifle will need to be sighted as it's never left the gun safe at my old man's house since I got it. Sighting it is quick and easy to do.

I'd love to keep it, but I need the cash.

Make me an offer. I am flexible on the price, but don't insult me with or waste both of our time with lowball offers.

Serious buyers ONLY. Cash ONLY. No trades. No deliveries. 

No sales to those that are not eligible.

This sale is to be made in accordance with all local and state laws.

Email me and I will get back to you very quickly.
