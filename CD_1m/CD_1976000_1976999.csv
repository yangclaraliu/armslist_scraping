I have seen these guns selling all day for $400 bucks with 2 used mags and a used holster if your lucky. Mags for these guns are getting hard to come by I spent $30 bucks a piece for the 3 new ones, $20 each for the leather holsters and the ammo was $65 for a 50rd box, I have 30 left so about $40 dollars worth. That's $170 bucks worth of extras going with this gun, $570 full blown retail, I think $450 is plenty fair. I understand that 8rd mags are not popular these days but this gun is every bit a quality Sig Sauer, all the mags work great and this gun is rock solid. I would love to keep it but I am buying a new house and the wife would have my balls if I dropped any cash on a new gun. I am getting my CCW back in a couple weeks and would like something smaller/lighter to carry, Golden is a scary place :)"

365,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1976365,"For Sale:  NEW Noveske N4 Lo-Pro 14.5"" .300 AAC Blackout Upper 300 Blk Factory Rifleworks","New York, New York, United States","$ 1,650","Listed On: Sunday, October 20, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is a BRAND NEW Noveske 14.5” N4 Lo-Pro .300 AAC Blackout complete upper assembly, including the factory bolt carrier group (with MPI bolt) and Noveske branded BCM gunfighter charging handle).  This is a Noveske factory direct signature upper complete with Noveske Stainless Steel Barrel, Noveske-branded VLTOR MUR-1A 7075 billet Upper receiver and AAC 51T Flash Hider.  The AAC 51T Flash Hider has been factory pinned (see pic) to make the barrel just over 16” and so this is not an NFA item.  It is 100% compliant to put on your rifle lower.

This upper uses all quality components and is pretty much top-of-the-line, the absolute best from Noveske.  You want the VLTOR MUR-1A billet upper because it is by far the most rigid and durable upper available on the market.  You want the stainless barrel because it produces the best accuracy vs. a traditional chrome-lined barrel.  The other lower-end Noveske uppers with traditional forged uppers and chrome lined barrels being sold is not representative of the true durability/accuracy that Noveske is known for.

This upper is fresh production and very rare to come by. No, this is NOT a factory blem “chainsaw” upper, this is NOT an upper pieced together at home or by other lesser known gun shops.  Get this while you can, before it’s gone again and you have to wait another 6 – 12 months before another production run.

The Sig Sauer Standard Adaptive Carbine Platform (ACP) allows any handgun with an accessory rail to be quickly modified into a personal defense weapon or carbine style firearm. Regardless of the brand, most pistols equipped with an accessory rail can be mounted to the ACP without the need for modification to the base gun. This basic model allows for fast, easy conversion and works with most railed pistols, equipped with a QD sling mount. Fabricated from solid aircraft-grade aluminum, the ACP sports M1913 rails at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions with a full-length top rail at the 12 o'clock position. Compatible accessories such as lights, red dot sights and lasers can be mounted for additional functionality. The ACP brings Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) features to almost any handgun."

190 pieces of the LC '10 are already primed with Fed match primers. The rest are ready to prime and load.

After firing some of these, I had a couple of blown primers and it is evident that some of the primer pockets are loose and are probably not suitable for a semi-auto.

Have some ammo I can throw in. Stock is a little scratched, but bluing is good and gun works great. I just don't ever shoot it. Willing to trade for something else. Has original wooden stock with squirrel on it, but aftermarket stocks are readily available and then you would have a like new great gun. I believe this gun shoots Lr, L, and S. I have only short Long Rifle .22s out of it though. Gun shoots great and is accurate. Not really looking to sell it, If I dont get a trade offer I want for it, Ill just keep it.

The only modification is the feed ramp has been polished.  (I've simply gone to all S&W handguns and this is the last non-S&W handgun in the safe.) The good news is...I never ask insane Gun Panic prices. The Price is $475.00 Cash Firm...Or reasonable firearms trade.

Details from Sig if you don't know what this gun is: http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/sp2022.aspx

Probably the best kept secret in ""value"" semi-auto handguns. Never once had misfire, FTE, FTF, etc. It's a beast and really fun to shoot. Problem is Sig raised their MAP pricing as of the 1st of the year and you cannot find these for under $500 anymore. Get it while you can!

What you see is what you get including box, lock, extra grip, book and 2 extra factory Sig mags (only comes with one from the factory and they're $40 each if you can find them).

$500

Cash only. No trades.

You must have valid MN drivers license and either a current permit to purchase or CCW permit. I'm ok with doing a Bill Of Sale or doing a 4473 transfer with an FFL.

This carbine has been further improved over the YHM offering with the addition of a Rock River Arms M16 bolt carrier group, Hogue OverMolded rubber grip, and a CAA stock saddle with storage compartments.

The M16 BCG perfectly balances out the carbine gas system for optimal reliability, while the Hogue provides a comfortable interface with a consistently solid grip that performs well in all environments. The stock saddle gives an enhanced cheek weld while also providing a dual O-ring sealed storage compartment for snap-caps, spare batteries, backup bolts, or other items.  As on all Diamond carbines, the rail provides a seamless optic platform on the entire top surface and the diamond fluted barrel provides a strong, stiff, and lightweight solution that also provides superior heat dispersion when compared to standard profiled barrels.

I have some optics, ammo, and a pair of magazines that I can include for extra cash or the right trade.

These pictures show a few different optic configurations in order to provide you with a bit of inspiration for how you'd like to make this gun yours. These images show the gun with just a pair of Gen 2 MBUS sights, a 1-4x optic, and an EOTech 552 paired with a 4x flip-to-side magnifier and MBUS backups. Whether you plan on range shooting, plinking, 3-gun, or want a bit of tactical-tacticool, this AR will serve you well.  Unfortunately the EOTech and magnifier are unavailable as I am keeping these for my personal use.  It's a great gun, I am only looking to part with it because I have another AR that I built, and really do not have a plan to use this one.

Thank you for looking and if you've got any questions or want to see more specific pictures, please let me know; I have detailed knowledge and photographs.

I am including the sling, fore-grip with detaching bipod legs and two (2) 30 round ProMag polymer magazines. I do not have the original handguard, the magazine, stock OR bayonet.
The rifle is a great shooter, the most accurate out of all my SKSs. The bore is pristine, with sharp rifling and a mirror shine, due to the chrome lining. The trigger is a crisp, smooth five pound pull. The rifle IS 922R compliant with a US made trigger assembly/sear, firing pin, gas tube and piston, magazine catch, stock and magazine. 
I also have many other accessories for sale, including: more 30-rounders, a 50-round korean made drum magazine, a BSA red dot scope, and about 800 rounds of Tulammo. 

I can negotiate on the price a bit if you want to add any more accessories. If you want a Russian SKS to throw in the safe for a collector's piece, this isn't it. If you want the best shooting SKS, then look no further. You will not find a more accurate platform for the price. The 20"" barrel keeps the groups significantly tighter than my 16"" Kalashnikov platforms.  The only rifle that I know which compares in this caliber is my 20"" VEPR, which retails close to 800 and that's before you add another 100 for the tactical stock. Even then, this Tula can hold her own against my VEPR performance wise. Compare magazines for the SKS at under 20 dollars compared to 30-50 for the VEPR, when you can find them."

As new condition, unfired- shot once by works in pavia italy.

This is for an unfired, 8 inch barrel with compensator , comes in box with paper and photocopied instructions, the barrel is unique in that it has absolutely no writing on it -- there is no ( READ MANUAL BEFORE USE)- but I checked with the importer and it is how it came to them, this mateba is rare even among the rare, only 2500 were ever imported to the USA and most people hold them as an investment, though some people went crazy and act like they are worth 6-8k-- fact is im offering a rare deal at a flat 5000- cash or credit card accepted for total amount , cash on delivery , credit card by paypal-- if outside TN add or dont want to travel to west TN, then shipping is 250 for overnight handgun fees as well as insured shipping, transfer fee for my FFL and yours. I will travel as far as memphis and nashville to make the trade but I will request more cash for the drive the further I have to go to get the deal done.

This thing is going on gunbroker in the next couple of days so act fast, email me with any questions -- pictures will be sent to serious buyers only , if you dont have the payment at hand, dont waste our time.

THis gun is factory tested, unfired in all the years i have had it , original case, fixed hairline crack to original walnut handle , just split from dryness, i since repaired and oiled the grip, I will let you look over it before buying ( in pictures) or in person if you are in the good Tennessee, am willing to deal out of state but must go through FFL, am willing to go through FFL in TN if buyer wants, I have no preference. 44 mag is the rare caliber for the mateba as most are 357."
