I just purchased a DPMS Oracle from Cabelas. As you know stock parts for these are very basic. What I'm looking for in my AR is a tactical/hunting weapon. I want the best of both worlds without spending an arm n leg upgrading it. I do know I'd like a red dot scope with a flip magnifier. I'll keep the stock buttstock and just add a buttstock pad for better comfort.

I'd like a free floating quad rail that I DON'T have to remove the stock gas block. Again I'm not one of these ""spare no expense"" type of guys who have boat loads of money to put into my rifle. So if you have something I need even if it's a cheaper/knockoff brand let me know. Even if you don't have it if you could be helpful and point me in the right direction (websites/links) that would be great appreciated. I'd really something like this guys AR http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFwQzczXA-A

Razor HD Gen II 1-6x24 Riflescope

Every component, feature and performance characteristic of this riflescope is so well thought out and executed, it’s almost scary. Incredibly versatile and perfect for the AR platform, the Vortex Razor HD Gen II 1-6x24 is the ideal optical solution for short to medium-range tactical applications requiring the pinnacle of optical performance.

Optically, the Razor HD Gen II 1-6x24 delivers the highest level of clarity, resolution, color accuracy, light transmission and edge to edge sharpness obtainable. The ultra-forgiving eye box with generous eye relief generates a heads-up display-like sight picture for fast target acquisition and optimal dual-eye visual monitoring of the surrounding environment. Ultra sleek and built like a tank on a 30 mm aircraft-grade aluminum tube, the Razor HD Gen II 1-6x24 features an ultra-low profile, capped windage and elevation turrets for streamlined performance. Zero-resettable turrets offer 50 MOA of adjustment in a single turn—ensuring ample travel.
The JM-1 BDC Reticle

Simple, intuitive and fast, the JM-1 BDC reticle is exclusive to Vortex. Designed in collaboration with world-renowned competitive shooter, instructor and gunsmith, Jerry Miculek, the JM-1 reticle facilitates rapid, accurate shooting at distances from point blank to 600 yards. A true daylight-bright illuminated center dot gives shooters red dot sight functionality and ultimate close-quarters versatility. Illumination is accessed and activated via the locking illumination dial positioned cleanly on the left side of the turret housing.

In all seriousness, it makes a great carry piece for a woman that wants to have something very small and trustworthy. It's fairly inexpensive and ""so cute"" (shudder).  Included is everything it came with, 170 rounds of .380, and 1 full box of Zombie defense rounds.  I have the receipt showing I paid close to $500 for everything including tax. Letting it all go for $300 cash money and you have to meet me close.  The only trade I'm interested in is one that is a great deal for me.  Since I doubt anyone is trading down for a pink gun, let's say I'm not really interested in trades.  Feel free to prove me wrong though!"

I have for sale, 62 cal smooth bore single trigger fowler. Furniture is iron and lock left white. There is moderate recessed engraving on the stock and no nose cap. _____The flint was designed to be a high quality hunting ""jack of all trades"" and accomplishes this very well. _____I had the flintlock made approximately 10 years ago by Miller of NC and then was injured overseas and am not able to hunt any more. It seems to be a waste leaving the gun in the vault as it only had one day at the range. _____The trigger is great and finish excellent. Will make an excellent primitive hunting rifle or re-enactment flintlock. _____ Tried to catch all details in the pictures. Please ask questions first. ____ Answer to a question from a prospective buyer: The length of barrel is 41"". The pull is 13 1/2"".___ This weapon handles great, points excellent, and is very light for all day hunting.___ You can shoot ball through it...I didn't want to choke the gun so I could shoot ball through it and make it a sort of ""Jack-of-all-trades"". This was going to be my one gun that could do it all that's why I went with one trigger and a single sight. The barrel came from a high quality blank. It has the ""sitting fox"" trade stamp on it.___ Another prospective buyer's question: What type of wood is the stock and what the overall length? The stock is walnut. The barrel length is 41"" and the total rifle length is 57"".___ Another answer to a email question: What diameter ball have you shot out of the rifle? I've shot .610"" ball out of this particular rifle. _____Another email ""How are springs and fit of pan to frizzen? Sometimes these have weak mainsprings. Bore clean? Thanks Bsusmc"":____The mainspring is extremely strong with the right amount of effort required to ""cock"" the hammer. In fact, it is a little stiff as the weapon has been hot very little and stored (OFC) with the hammer down ensuring the spring was not in a compressed position. The fit of the frizzen and pan has very little ""lateral"" movement and was very well fit to the flintlock. There are not the ""slop"" that developed after time with a poorly aligned frizzen. Allen Miller does a very good job making sure that all the pieces of the firearm are constructed with hand tools. We know that’s very important as modern tools tend to take off so much material in such a fast manner that everyone just slops it together and has to use adhesive to fill in the excessive spaces that are created.__The flintlock was taken out very few times and the bore was immediately cleaned with boiling water until it ran clear and then a ramrod with soft bore brush soaked in ""bore butter"" was applied. I think the flintlock only saw 3 range sessions at best and I cleared the bore before and after each session.____Remember, No FFL required, legally ships to your door!____ PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: The market is flooded with second-rate imported copies of these rifles.___Before you buy, Do your research and I think you'll find a quality, original, American piece such as this, is hard to come by for this price. In hindsight, you'll be glad you chose a true original American flintlock.

You can look up the Kimber and get all the detailed specs. The general specs are that it's a reliable and concealable 1911, .45ACP, tritium front and rear sight, and has crimson trace laser grips. I have six 8rd mags and four 7rd mags. As you can see in the pic, 4 of those mags are Wilson Combat and the run $35 a piece. I have three holsters: 1 Galco IWB, 1 Galco OWB, and 1 Black Hawk OWB w/paddle. 

The reason I'm searching for a new carry weapon is for simplicity of operation.  My Kimber has served me very well but I no longer want to worry about multiple safety's and I would like a higher mag capacity.  I love this gun but having a sidearm I can operate more efficiently is more important. 

As you can see in the pics the only issue with this Kimber is the wear marks from holster work and manipulation of the thumb safety.  I placed a small piece of grip tape on the front of the frame so I could have a textured surface for my support hand. If you don't like the grip tape it could be easily removed and the surface cleans up perfectly with solvent.  

I also have around 400 to 450 rounds I can work with too (not included in the posted price). I'm here at Ft. Lenard Wood and although I have an out of state ID I can furnish my orders to Ft. Lenard Wood. Thanks for looking!"

These price criminals only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but let's face it, do we really need 100 round drums or is that more of a want? Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back under the 1000s where they all belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The regularity will only return if we make it.

AR-15: $600-$1300 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)

I've fired exactly 470rds through this weapon. I bought this new 3yrs ago. It's a fantastic weapon. CAI firearms can be such a damn crapshoot, but this wins out big time! It is very, very accurate @ distances out to 250m. Haven't really tested it beyond that, but I've been more than impressed with the performance of this rifle. It's a major force multiplier. But less than 500rds in 3yrs = Safe Queen. Other weapons seem to occupy most of my time. This would be a great addition to any collection. It will be missed in mine.
