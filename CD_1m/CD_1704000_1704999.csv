These rifles may have some foreign parts and wood may be Walnut, Birch, Beech or other variety. Rifles do not have import marks. Bores will be generally good with only minor imperfections; the barrel crown may be nicked, and the muzzle may gauge more than “3” on muzzle gauge.

At the moment I have an inexplicable itch for an old fashioned .25acp single action pocket pistol.  Something along the lines of the tiny Colt classics.  Those are probably not the best example because I really can't afford a good example.  Perhaps a Beretta 950, an older CZ, Mauser, Browning, or similar.  Must be in sound mechanical condition, and at least of decent appearance.  I am not interested in Phoenix Arms, or any other pot metal cheapie, but neither am I looking for a rare, mint safe queen.  Also - NO TAURUS.  Something I can have fun with, and with a bit of historic appeal.

Would like to make at least partial trade.  Have very nice Wierausch .22cal air pistol with 1.5 power scope mounted, variety of holsters and grips for S & W J & K frame revolvers, J frame .38 speed loaders, speed strips, inexpensive pocket binoculars and monocular, Tasco red dot sight, and assorted other firearms related gee-gaws and do-dads.  Lets make a deal!

Added 6/2:  I dug out all of this gear I'm not using, and there's a whole lot more than I thought.  I count 8 holsters, some basic, some very nice, most for J-frame revolvers, a couple for pocket pistols.  Earmuffs, speedloaders, pocket optics, sm. zippered rug, S&W grips, mostly K-frame, sq. butt.   Let me know what you need.

Face to face only.  I am a Missouri CCW holder.

Note :  the system will not let me proceed without picking a brand but as I say above, I'm open as to make & model.  The system also will not allow me to specify .25acp caliber, but you already know that's what I'm looking for."

This is an original ""Easy-Load"" type drum that fits all AK47/Mac90 type 7.62 caliber rifles that use double stack magazines. This drum attaches to the rifle exactly like a normal magazine would. No alterations to the rifle are necessary. Simply drop in all 100 rounds of ammo, close the cover, wind up the spring, and you are ready to fire. A wind-up drum is a great way to store a loaded magazine long-term without the worry of a compressed spring loosing its ability to deliver enough push to empty a magazine. With the drum, you don't wind up the spring until you are ready to use the drum. This drum is in very good to excelent condition.

Has not been opened. 

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty. The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

16+1 9mm, 12+1 .40 S&W

I've had it for less than 6 months and have maybe put 200 rounds through it.  Shoots extremely well, has been fastidiously cleaned, and has that signature boring reliability for which Glock is know.  It comes with Glock box, papers, two 13 round mags, and loader (all the stuff that it comes with new).  Can throw in .40 cal ammo for the right deal. I also have a CVA Buckhorn bought new a couple months ago and shot four times I can throw in as well.  Or make cash offer.

Good thing is that .40 cal has been easier to find through the gun scare crap as of late.

Interested in other trades as well, just no .40 cals as I already have a G27 as my carry piece.  Again, I can throw in ammo for the right deal.  Let me know what you have!
