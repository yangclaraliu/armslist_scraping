Since this gun is so small, some people will want something to lessen perceived recoil. I have placed A Talon grip coverd by a Hougue Handall Jr.  

This is a great little gun ideally suited as a warm weather concealed carry.  Easily fits in the front pocket and with a pocket holster there is no printing issue.  I carried it in a wallet holster and it was great.  So light, you don't even think about it.

I original purchased it to shoot, but can't bring myself to as it's a great addition to a Sig collection as it's very unlikely that another will pop up for sale in NIB condition.

I'm primarily interested in Sig and Glock pistols and would consider a trade for Sig and/or Glock Pistols....I'm open to an even trade or a trade plus $. I enjoy handguns in general, so if you have something else to offer, please do. The worst I can say is ""no thanks"".

Cash sale price is $1,000. 

If you're interested, please send me an email with a trade offer with trade details if you have one and I'll respond promptly. ""Low Ball"" offers and just plain un-polite emails will be ignored. If you're not sincerely interested, please don't waste my time or yours. 

Must be a Wisconsin resident and willing to sign a bill of sale to document trade for both of our records. I have a Wisconsin Concealed Carry License as well that I can show you for your peace of mind. Thanks!"

My bugout gear has my issued Paraclete stuff, and I only really used these plates/carriers for weight training.

They are rated to stop multiple hits of .30 Cal small arms at zero angle variance from 100 yards or greater. It will stop lower mass/velocity rounds at closer range.

If you want them for your prepper/bugout gear rack, they are solid. And if you do that - issue them to your driver. They are about 28 lbs stand alone. Designed for a sitting Aircrew door gunner.

Anyway - they come with the original GI / Air Force care instructions and cartoon. Both carriers have been washed and haven't been worn. Front and back ceramics with matching NSN numbers.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed.
The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine.
The innovative Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform.
Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .3oo Win Mag ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil.

All 15ers.
150 rounds of 110 gr ammo.
And a Universal Carbine with tactical sling.

It is a very late model (399XXX) Gen 3. A breakdown of what that means is Gen 1 is a copy of the USGI model. Gen 2 is an alteration on the insides. Gen 3, they tried to fix what they had faltered on in Gen 2.

I got this from a retired Navy crewman who had used the USGI model in Vietnam, in place of the new M-16. He got this, and a few other models. He had the springs replaced, as per warnings from forums. He offered it to me to fund other projects of his.
He fired close to 300 rounds from it with no problems before the replacement, and the only problem I've had came from a day of dirt buildup after shooting all day.
Otherwise, a flawless machine with almost no markings on the stock.

It filled my ""assault rifle"" role, up until I got an AK-74. So it is now without a niche in my home. I'm looking for something new to me, that's fun.

Troy Industries Battlemag is an advanced polymer 30-round magazine for AR-15 style firearms in .223/5.56mm. The polymers used in the magazine are chemical, biological and impact resistant. The feed lips have been reinforced and the mags use an anti-tilt follower. The magazine body features an aggressive scale texture that provides a sure grip but will also extract from magazine pouches easily. The spine of the magazine is designed to prevent over-insertion common with some polymer mags. The floor plate features a shock absorbing pull tab, or can be used with the flush locking plate. Functions with all M4, M16, AR-15, HK416, and FN SCAR rifles."

The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish.

The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals.

 GSG-522 series SD style carbine American Tactical Imports GSG-522SD makes an ideal training tool for law enforcement, military personnel or civilians. Ergonomics and handling are similar to that of an MP5 style rifle; while the 22 long rifle caliber offers an immense savings over 9mm/40/45 caliber ammunition allowing extensive range time with the GSG-552SD at a minimal cost to the user. The 522SD has an overall length of 33.5”, weighs in at 6.6 pounds and has a barrel length of 16.25 inches including the faux suppressor. Unlike other MP5 style rifles the GSG 522SD is legal to own by anyone and is offered with either a 10 or 22 round detachable magazine. The GSG-522SD comes standard with a conventional MP5 style stock and forend but American Tactical Imports also offers a multitude of upgrades and tactical accessories to make this rifle unique to your personal style. Why buy and expensive copy when you can own the real thing? Whether you are looking for a low cost tactical trainer or a fun plinker the GSG-522 rifle is the obvious choice.

These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)

These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed.
The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine.
The innovative Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform.
Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .3oo Win Mag ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots

This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed.
The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine.
The innovative Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform.
Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .3oo Win Mag ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots

Acquired it about 16 years ago from a dealer who was going out of business. Didn't have much use for it, but he was practically giving it away, so I bought it. Never got around to doing anything with it, and it has never been fired.

She's a plain Jane from the Clinton AWB era, but ready to be pimped out with tacticool accessories.

SERIOUS REPLIES ONLY, PLEASE. I'm tired of flakes who abruptly disappear after I express interest in their offer. If you're not willing to follow through, don't reply and make an offer."
