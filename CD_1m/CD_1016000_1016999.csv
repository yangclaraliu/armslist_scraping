REMINGTON SINGLE SHOT MILITARY NUMBER 1 ROLLING BLOCK RIFLE USED AS THE CHIEF SERVICE ARM OF MANY ARMIES IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY. This is a .43 SPANISH (11.15X58MMR) caliber. ANTIQUE – NO FFL TRANSFER REQUIRED.



Probably over one million Remington Number 1 size rolling block rifles were made between 1867 and 1888. They were purchased in large quantities and in many different calibers and configurations by many countries including Argentina, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Turkey, Egypt and Mexico. Barrel lengths and other specifications differed from country to country. They were hard used for long periods of time and fought in many different wars. It was used by either the Spanish or Argentine military. The barrel and receiver both have a few areas of pitting in the metal. The barrel is 35 inches long and has an excellent bore with great rifling and no pitting. There are the usual slight dings and dents but no heavy gouging. The gun has it's cleaning rod. The rifle still functions perfectly. The multi line Remington roll stamp of name and patent dates is on the top tang and is still readable. Not the prettiest rifle I’ve ever sold, but it’s got tons of character and is a great example of 19th Century military history. Antique – No FFL or C&R required – can be shipped right to your door. Like I said before this is not a wall hanger. It has a bright and shiny bore with pronounced rifling. I am including a box of 20 rounds of Ammo, also. Yes Buffalo arms black powder 370 grn, ammo. Perfect for those montana buffalo poaching trips on Ted's private prarie, lol. Keep your brass and you can be reloading with a $50.00 set of dies. Much funner than percussion, lol.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers, ha hah. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters."

This is a side lock, percussion rifle. When I bought the rifle the open sights and ramrod were missing and were replaced (NEW). 
I also use Pyrodex 50 grain powder pellets instead if loose power, a new box of the pellets is included plus 18 additional pellets that came with some of the bullets and sabots. There are 3 different weight bullets included; there are 10 - 300 grain copper hollow point bullets with sabots, 12 power belt 245 grain bullets and sabots still new in pack. There are also 11 bullets and sabots, these have been open and I’m not sure of weight but I think they are 200 grain.  
When I began using the powder pellets the #10 nipple was just not hot enough to ignite them consistently so there is also a new #11 nipple installed plus 2 more still in the pack. A box of #11 percussion caps might be 8 or 10 caps missing (I have shot the rifle but  not enough to even adjust the new sight). There is a real powder horn; it could be made operable but it’s just for looks at this time because I use the pellets. All the above accessories except the powder horn fit in an old army mag pouch that I'm using as a possibles bag.
Also included is a Thompson Center Black Powder cleaning Kit and two knives from Smokey Mount Knife Works that have fake Damascus blades and plastic horn handles. (I had planned to replace the handles with Deer horn and make sheaths and a possibles bag from deer hide.)  

There is a couple of spots on the rifle where the factory finish has come off, I was going to refinish the stock just as soon as I got it lined out and shooting like I wanted, But due to sickness, then heart surgery I have not got around to it. 
Would like to get $300.00 out of it or maybe trade to a Hi-point (40 caliber?) carbine for plinking, or maybe a 9 for CC?  
If someone has a HI-point carbine to trade I can add cash. Thanks for looking.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.

This is my Remington 700 XCR.

I had no complaints with the upgrade.  Dealer called up Remington but they never responded, so they sold me the rifle for the price of a SPS Tac which was pretty awesome.

I have a hi-point pistol model JCP in 40 S&W for sale or trade.  I bought this pistol on January 30 at a pawn shop.

The pistol does not have any factory paperwork, box, manuals etc. I do have the paper work where I bought it and one mag. asking $250.00

The good thing about these pistols is the warranty, Hi-point will repair or replace if it cannot be fixed.

I bought this to take my CCL with then discovered just how big this pistol is. So I would prefer to trade it to a Hi-point 9mm or even a carbine. If you have extras mags, hard case etc., might be able to add a little money.

I will meet face to face in Columbus GA or I can meet in Atlanta on Saturday.  Otherwise shipping will be to an FFL of your choice.  Shipping costs are born by the buyer as well as FFL fees.

I have other magazines and ammo if you wish to purchase them as well.  I also have the oiler and tool kit which will come at no extra cost.

This is a great truck/bug out gun due to the small size when it is folded.  Easily fit in a large bag or under a seat in the car.  It is a reliable, accurate weapon which will work well in most any situation.

Senator Morgan Carroll, Representatives Rhonda Fields and Claire Levy are actively promoting ANTI-FIREARM legislation that will put further restrictions on our liberties!

In response to the growing rhetoric both in our country and in the state of Colorado for expanding gun control laws, local Second Amendment activists will be rallying at the West Steps of the Capitol Denver on February 8th, 2013, at 12 p.m.

While tragedies like what occurred in Newtown Connecticut and Aurora Colorado are horrific and deeply disturbing, we cannot allow the actions of criminals to destroy our heritage and our rights. These rights are continually being fought for and died for as external threats have presented themselves. We champion the soldiers who risk everything to preserve our freedom and liberty when they fight abroad, yet now we are faced with the prospect that we may voluntarily dismantle those same liberties at home because we are filled with fear and sorrow.

This rally on February 8th is being coordinated in solidarity with other pro freedom and pro Second Amendment groups who will be marching on their respective capitols across the country. This rally also follows two previous rallies on our capitol steps that took place on January 9th and January 19th, which received national media attention. We are planning to have a larger turnout than the previous two rallies, and we will look to maintain the momentum we are building to show our lawmakers what the people of Colorado demand from them.

The rally is being organized by Guns for Everyone and many other grassroots activist, to demonstrate to our state legislature as well as the federal government where Colorado stands in the current debate on gun rights. We intend to show that we stand firmly in our Constitutional right to keep and bear arms and that we will not tolerate reactionary political agendas to erode the rights that we have enjoyed in this country for centuries.

As was recently stated to a Westword reporter by one of the rally organizers Edgar Antillon, ""Anything against the Second Amendment is not common sense. Anything against the Constitution isn't common sense."" Antillon organized the first rally on January 9th and has been a central figure in galvanizing the support of local gun owners in this movement to resist the changes being discussed for Colorado gun laws."

I generally have a a handful of pens on hand at any one time. It can vary from week to week on what I have on hand.  I'm just getting back into guns after a long absence. For me, looks are second to functionality. (I've always ben a believer that 'ugly pens need love too' I don't see why that can't apply to weapons as well...lol)

So in short, I'd like to fill out the stable with a few of the basics. A .45/.44 handgun. Single or double action is fine. A 30/30 & a Mosin Nagant. I already have a Marlin model 15 for small game that I LOVE & a sweet Mossberg 500 w/ the 28"" ported barrel & thru-glo sites that has called me out to shoot daily for the past month...lol. 

All of the pens I restore sell/trade come with an unconditional 1 year guarantee. If it gives you any problems, send it back & I'll repair it gratis. (Keep in mind, that if you drop it on the nib & bend it, I'll have to charge you for straightening/retipping/adjustment or ??? depending on the level of damage)

Made in the 2nd Quarter of 1949. Red Stripe Parker Dou-Vac Senior. Blue diamond blade style clip. Chevron cap band. 14K fine vac arrow nib. Feed is marked T. Good imprint, weaker on the right side but still visible. The filler unit was broken when it came in, I couldn't find a correct 'clear' filler rod, so the amber that's in it is an acceptable stand in until one can be found. No brassing. Crystal clear barrel lamination's. Overall in 8.75/10 condition. $150.

19-teens-early '20's gold filled Conklin. Medium, medium flexibility 14K #3 Conklin Toledo nib. Flexes to a broad+ line. Engraved with the Chevron pattern. The pen would be 10/10 save one gouge on the back side of the cap. I'll let you judge it's impact. No brassing, dents or significant marks other than the one I just mentioned. Unengraved cap indica. 4 7/8"" capped, 3/8"" od cap. Spectacular pen. $200

1900-1910's, smooth BHR (black hard rubber) is slightly discolored but un damaged, no chips cracks etc etc. The imprint MONARCH is the only bit of information on the pen. The nib is a superflex fine/medium line with no pressure and flexes to 3B + There is a shield with 14K imprinted on the nib. The same nib imprint used by the Eagle Pencil Co. I suspect this may have been one of their very early offerings. Something else of note is the ribbed grip section, another feature found on pens of the early 1900-1910ish vintage. 5 1/4"" capped, 6 11/16"" posted, 7/16"" at the cap lip. The pen is in wonderful condition and is quite frankly, the best flex nib I have laid hands on in a long time. $125

1914 BCHR CRAIG COIN FILLER made by Sheaffer. 5 3/8"" capped, 1/2"" od cap. This pen has 2 issues, the first being the VERY flexible Warranted 14K No3 nib (narrow keel style feed). It has a small crack on the right side of the breather hole. The second is the cap. It ha a repaired crack. It has been epoxied closed and then a gold filled cap lip from a 1960's Sheaffer Imperial was added. It fits well and is keeping the crack from ever blowing the cap apart. The pen is unrestored. The nib shouldn't really be used until it's repaired. I can't speak for him, but Greg Minuskin (I'll forward his contact info if needed) repaired one for me like this to near perfect condition. So I'm guessing he can handle it. Very mild overall oxidation, deep crisp chasing. Perfect CRAIG imprint. This is a fairly uncommon pen. It has issues so I'll only ask $125 shipped world wide.

PRODUCT DETAILS WRITTEN BY THE MANUFACTURER (BROWNELLS):

The Most Up-To-Date & Reliable Civilian Magazine Available 

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups. All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber Yreinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. This mag has our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.”  .223 / 5.65 AR-15/M4 Color: Military Gray. 30-Round

The Jimenez Arms J.A. .380 is quite possibly one of the simplest, easiest to use and most comfortable compact .380's on the market today. Jimenez Arms includes such features as: a comfortable stance and an extended finger rest located at the bottom of the magazine. Other manufacturers offer this feature only on specialty clips at higher prices. Jimenez Arms, however, includes this feature at no extra cost. If you're in the market for a compact .380 and price, accuracy and comfort is a factor- the Jimenez Arms J.A. 380 is your solution."
