Don't pay dumba** prices for something used you can get at the store (yes people do have some). Also, bass pro shop about 2 days ago got in about 3 the other morning at 9am so they are coming people are just buying. Bass pro also got in a few boxes of 9mm and other calibers as well (limit of 10 boxes) all but 1 box was gone 15 min after opening. So anyway. Go buy an AR today because you want one don't come back and put it on here for thousands of dollars more. They most likely won't be banned and IF they aren't the market will be flooded soon because dumba** people bought 5 trying to flip a profit. It will hurt to be sitting on them with a maxed out credit card and 40k rounds of .22lr you thought was going to pay off your house. Hahaha. Good luck with that (repeat of 08). There that is my .2 goto gander moubtain this morning in their is a line stand in it and pay the REAL price for a brand new AR and you can even put it in layaway. Thanks. Good shooting to ya. Later"

To cut down on the BS price gougers trying to double and triple their money on these so called ""pre-ban"" AR-15's (give me a break...profiting on fear) GANDER MOUNTAIN in TURKEY CREEK has a pallet of about 30 AR's coming out on shelves this morning 3/15/13. I saw them last night while there and the guy said he had all diffrent brands ranging from $749ish to $1100 or so depending on brand. These are brand new and they also have layaway. Don't pay dumba** prices for something used you can get at the store (yes people do have some). Also, bass pro shop about 2 days ago got in about 3 the other morning at 9am so they are coming people are just buying. Bass pro also got in a few boxes of 9mm and other calibers as well (limit of 10 boxes) all but 1 box was gone 15 min after opening. So anyway. Go buy an AR today because you want one don't come back and put it on here for thousands of dollars more. They most likely won't be banned and IF they aren't the market will be flooded soon because dumba** people bought 5 trying to flip a profit. It will hurt to be sitting on them with a maxed out credit card and 40k rounds of .22lr you thought was going to pay off your house. Hahaha. Good luck with that (repeat of 08). There that is my .2 goto gander moubtain this morning in their is a line stand in it and pay the REAL price for a brand new AR and you can even put it in layaway. Thanks. Good shooting to ya. Later"

I cannot seem to figure it out and my casts rarely go beyond 10 feet. I watched videos, I've read stuff on line to no avail. So now I will admit defeat and offer this rod and reel for sale or trade.

Sabre Defense is no longer in business due to some ATF troubles, something to do with some employees walking away with some of the machinegun parts they made for the military. Sabre Defense was known to have made higher end ARs, you can google sabre defense for some reviews.

This rifle also comes with an Aimpoint red dot scope, it is a genuine, made in Sweden Aimpoint, but it is an older model. Still bright and works fine.

Also included are 3 30 round magazines, and 120 rounds of ammo.

Not really interested in trades at this time, but it never does hurt to ask, it would likely need to be something of lesser value with some cash added, as I need to get about $600-$700 worth of my wife off my ass for some other recent purchases I'm in the dog house for, LOL!

Tapco T-6 6-position stock. Comes with (2) Detachable 20 round magazines.
Bayonet and front foregrip installed. Bayonet folds back and fits into factory bayonet cut as it should, while clearing the front foregrip.
Foregrip is a Tango-Down brand, ""shorty""
Has two scopes and two receiver covers.
SCOPE 1: 4x32 Sniper that sits on a UTG High quality scope ring platform, built onto a receiver cover that has 4 factory hold down screws. When you mount this 4x32 scope, over the receiver, it locks down in place and holds zero. It also has a shell deflector installed with this 4x32 set-up, to keep expelled shells from hitting your scope.
OR you can pull this whole assy off as one unit, very easily, and then put on the original receiver cover and then put on the SECOND SCOPE, a quality holographic RED-DOT. It attaches in the ""scout"" position, farther down the rifle. (see 3rd picture)
Note, when using the 4x32 scope, you can also use the iron sites, they are clearly visible when the 4x32 scope is mounted.
Fires, functions, cycles perfect. Perfect in appearance and Mean looking. Rugged build and dependable.
If you don't know what a Red-Dot scope does or is for, look it up on Google, it's excellent technology. It is a lot faster than iron sites. One red dot to look at: turn the scope on and it displays a red-dot in the screen(you can choose your design, it's adjustable) wherever the red dot is, that's where the bullet goes. Very fast aiming and very accurate. When you move your head around, the red dot stays on the target as long as you keep the rifle pointed at it, very easy to use. 
I'll throw in 20 rounds of ammo with it, then sell you more at my cost, if you want them."

It is in great cosmetic condition.  It has never been used as a carry gun. It has sat in a drawer most of its life unloaded.   I would guess that I have put well under 500 rounds through it in its lifetime.  Range sessions for me consisted of buying one or two 50 round boxes, shoot, clean, put in drawer, repeat in 5 years or so.     
The safety tab is broken.  I can direct you to a couple different places that sell the part for about 6 dollars.

Put the pressure: make two phone calls and send one email right away!

Last night, Sen. Ron Latz (DFL-46) rammed his gun control bill through the Judiciary Committee (he's the chairman), and refused to take a vote on Sen. Julianne Ortman's (R-47) rights-respecting Criminal Control bill.

The good Ortman good bill, SF 1359, has been the support of GOCRA, the NRA, the Minnesota Sherrifs Association, the Minnesota County Attorneys Association, and a broad, bipartisan legislative support, including more than half of the Minnesota House. Sen. Ortman's bill addresses criminals' use of guns.

Sen. Latz's bad bill, SF458, attacks the rights of law abiding citizens, and would create unversal gun registration in Minnesota, send us back to the bad old days of ""May Issue"" purchase and carry permits, and strip gun owners of vital Due Process protections.

Demand a vote!

We need you to call Sen. Latz's office right this minute and demand that he put Sen. Ortman's SF1359 on the agenda of today's Judiciary Committee meeting.  The meeting starts at 11:30 this morning, so we need you to call RIGHT NOW!

Sen. Latz: REDACTED

If you can't get through, try his committee administrator:

Cheryl Youakim: REDACTED

Whether you get an answering machine or a person, here's the short, clear message:

Minnesota demands a vote on SF1359!

When you've done that, please call your own senator with the same message, and ask the senator to contact Sen. Latz this morning. 

To make sure the message gets through, please also send an email message to Sen. Latz on his web page.

Take action now! Don't let the rights-grabbing SF458 bill be the only option on the floor!

765,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1264765,For Sale:  Hornady Lock-N-Load A.P. Progressive Reloading Press with EVERYTHING!,"Allen Park, Detroit, Michigan",$ 1,"Listed On: Friday, March 15, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I received this press for christmas this year.  Without having a mentor to teach me, youtube was working but not good enough.  I guess reloading is just not for me.  Now if I had a father, friend, uncle etc to teach me the ins and outs a lot of money can be saved here.
I have decided that I need repairs to my newly purchased house more than this press so it and all the dies, shell plates, scale, etc are for sale together only. Will not separate!

The Hornady Lock-N-Load A.P. Progressive Press was purchased in Dundee on 12/15/2012   Paid $423
I loaded exactly 1000 rounds of 9mm very slowly while watching videos and trying to teach myself.  I think I did pretty good for no instruction. Then I loaded 100 rounds of 45ACP.  Thats it exactally!  None of the other dies or crimping dies or shell plates etc were ever used.

Whats included:
-Hornady 9th Edition Handbook of Cartridge Reloading  Paid $32	
-Individual manuals for the following calibers: .38 Special, .357 Magnum, .45ACP,         9mm Luger, 10mm/.40 S&W, .44 Magnum    Paid $7.50 each or $45 total		
-Hornady .45ACP #546555 3 piece Die Set  (used 100 rounds)    Paid $46	
-Hornady 10mm/.40S&W #546533 3 piece Die Set  (Brand New)   Paid $46
-Hornady 9mm Luger #546515 3 piece Die Set  (used 1000 rounds)   Paid $46
-Hornady .44 Mag/.44 Special #546548 3 piece Die Set  (Brand New)   Paid  $46
-Hornady .38 Special/.357 Magnum #546527 3 piece Die Set  (Brand New)    Paid  $46

-Lee Factory Crimp Die for 10mm/.40S&W (Brand New)    Paid $20
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for  9mm  (used approximately 600 rounds)   Paid $17
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for ..38 Special/.357 Magnum (Brand New)   Paid $17
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for .44 Special/.44 Magnum (Brand New)  Paid $17
-Hornady Shellplates - Each of these plates fit many more different calibers, too many to list. Reference Hornady's Shellplate Sheet for a complete list.
Hornady Shellplates  
#45  (.45ACP & 45 Winchester Magnum)    Paid $33
 #8   (9mm Luger, 30 Luger, 38 Super)    Paid $33
 #30   (.44 Special, .44 Remington Magnum, .445  Supermag)    Paid  $24
 #1   (25-06, 30.06, 270 Winchester, 7mm-08, 308 Winchester)    Paid   $35
 #6   (.357 Magnum, 7.62x39)      Paid   $35
 #10   (10mm, .40 S & W)     Paid $35
-Frankford Arsenal Quick-N-EZ Case Tumbler (used twice to clean to batches of brass)
  media in Tumbler is still good plus whats left in the cantainer of Corn Media I bought.
Can’t find receipt but I remember the tumbler was about $60 and corn media ?
-Black Media Sifting tray    Paid $9
-Hornady Lock-N-Load #050108 Bench Scale   Paid  $91
-RCBS Green Primer Flip Tray    Paid  $9
-Cabela's 6"" Electronic Calipers   Paid  $25
-Lyman Inertia Bullet Puller    Paid   $25
-Extra Lock-N-Load Die Bushings   2pack  Paid $11    &  10 pack  Paid $45
I purchased a 2-pack and a 10 pack plus the few that came with it.
These are what make the Lock-N-Load unique.  You can get your dies all set up for loading and with just a quick turn take those dies out and put in dies for a different caliber in minutes.
I also have a reaming case prep tool (never used)  Paid approx  $15  never used NEW!

I am sure I am forgetting some things.  

TRADES I MAY CONSIDER:
Colt Delta Elite 10mm in new condition, Preferrably Bi-tone Springfield XDS plus cash 
Thats most likely all I am looking for.  Maybe a Crossbow 350FPS or better plus cash.

I don't expect this to last long since they are sold out everywhere.  I am not looking to double my money or anything but I am well over $1300 into this!  If you want the reloader but you dont want all the die sets I have, let me know what you do want.  Then I can see what I am able to return and we might be able to work something out.

I also went and bought a used table off of Craigslist that has metal around the edges to mount the reloader too.  This may be available.  I would really like to keep the table, but as they say, everything has a price.

Now one way to make this work on both ends is, since alot of the dies, shellplates, crimping dies, etc are brand new, I can just return them and that would bring the cost down for a potential buyer.
I am looking to get my money back at the least.
Make me an offer!

I've got a rare PINK Walther P22 for sale. This gun has 5 rounds through the chamber and that's it. Mint condition, comes with 1 magazine and it's original case. This gun is on back order almost anywhere you go, especially for the pink model. Perfect concealed carry for your wife, girlfriend, mother or daughter.

Get this while you can, the ammo is cheap but .22's are extremely hard to come by over the past 3 months and it won't get any easier. This gun will be perfect for concealed carry, home defense, plinking or just survival in general. Asking $500, the gun is located in Oshkosh and will go back in the safe Saturday as I'm leaving for out of town. 

$500 OBO
Must have a Wisconsin I.D. and be 21 years of age to own this. Any questions or offers feel free to email me. Please don't low ball me, I won't respond to those emails.

In the heat of the moment when time is critical, we want to give you the advantage to react quickly and make it count.
