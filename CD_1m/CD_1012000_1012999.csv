IMPORTANT NOTE! You must go through an FFL (even if local) which means an additional $30 paid to the FFL for the background check.

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

The rifle has many nice features including Accuracy Bushing, Flash Hider, Bayonet Lug, Oversize Factory Forward Assist, Factory Match Trigger, and also has a Full Length 21 inch barrel. The full length barrel means you get the full 3000 fps out of 5.56 ammo, vs. the 2800 fps the current 16 inch government carbines achieve. The rifle has a match grade heavy barrel, and the rifle produces 1 inch groups from 100 yards, pretty excellent for an AR-15. The longer sight radius also makes the rifle more accurate with iron sights. If you are looking for an early colt A2 in government configuration, this would be an excellent example of it.  I must receive the payment first before I send my weapon out."

Nice blue steel and serial number 366XXX (last three digits not shown for privacy). This is a 1967 manufacture, based on the serial number and barrel as well, as it says ""67"" on the barrel as well and has the deer antlers and other marks, as to show proofings of being assembled and test fired at Ulm/Do (West Germany at the time and now Germany, having been reunited long ago). Importer is Interarms (Alexandria, VA). 

Fires great, accurate and all. James Bond style all the way. Never had a jam with it either on both European and American made ammo. Magazine holds 8 rounds. 

This gun is NOT on the California roster, thus very rare in California and not easy to find. Being that it's not on the roster, like many other guns, any of these old Walthers cannot be sold by an FFL here in this State or by FFL or private party out of State, so one cannot get one online and have it shipped here, since it's not on the roster. It can only be sold private party within this state. They just keep getting more and more difficult to find here in California, so this is a great chance to get one and a cool piece of history.

The Yugo SKS featured a gas shutoff switch to turn the rifle from semiautomatic to single shot. This was for use with the launcher which required a special blank cartridge. The switch on this one is stuck in the semiauto position which is why it is priced about $100 lower than I otherwise would have listed it.  From my research this apparently was not unheard of.  I have shot this semiautomatically with no problem. I looked in to having it fixed but it wasn't worth it since the rifle shot fine.

I am a collector and this rifle will continue to go up in value for several important reasons. There were only about 200 manufactured, and they will never manufacture more. Arsenal will NEVER again produce the Russian SGL AK series, as this will now be handled by FIME. This is a once a lifetime opporunity to own this rifle. I challenge you to find another one for sale. Destined to become far more collectable then the PolyTech Legend or any AK-47 variant currently being collected. This rifle comes with the original factory box, factory five round magazine, Russian IZMASH LEGION factory manual, Arsenal SGL brochure, and a extremely accurate factory test target. Unless you join the Russian military, you cannot get another rifle like this. Remember the SGL series is real Russian, unlike the cheaper SLR series. Price is firm, do not waste your time or mine with low offers, I will not respond to them.

The rifle has many nice features including Accuracy Bushing, Flash Hider, Bayonet Lug, Oversize Factory Forward Assist, Factory Match Trigger, and also has a Full Length 21 inch barrel. The full length barrel means you get the full 3000 fps out of 5.56 ammo, vs. the 2800 fps the current 16 inch government carbines achieve. The rifle has a match grade heavy barrel, and the rifle produces 1 inch groups from 100 yards, pretty excellent for an AR-15. The longer sight radius also makes the rifle more accurate with iron sights. If you are looking for an early colt A2 in government configuration, this would be an excellent example of it."

It has 400 rounds shot through it.  I kept very good care of it by cleaning and oiling each and every time I have went to the range.  It uses the same sites as a P series Sig, so it's easy to upgrade to night sites.  It's a much more accurate tool then I'm capable with.  Not a single malfunction in the 400 rounds with cheap range ammo and self defense rounds.  Read the reviews on this gun and you won't find a single one that doesn't love it.

The Sig comes with a 10 round magazine and 2 extra 15 round magazines.  The two 15 round magazines are not third party magazines, they are Sig mags.  You cannot find a dealer that sells these magazines anymore, because of the threat of eliminating sales of ""high capacity magazines"".  Even used, these magazines sell for well over a $100 each.  I also will include the nylon case that holds the gun and 4 magazines.  

I'm not taking lower offers and if you want a gun with ""high capacity magazines"" then make sure you buy it before the government bans sales of them.  Also, if you buy now then you don't have to worry about an FFL transfer for local private sales, which they are also looking at banning.  

Only selling locally and would be willing to meet in a public parking lot to do the transfer."

Send me an OFFER. Worse I can say is no. I'll also take trades for other rifles in 308, 30-06, 270

I bought this off another person planning to make this into a project rifle but things change and I need to sell this rifle. It's a very nice rifle with synthetic stock. Rough enough to take out into the brush without worries of scratching it up. 

It's a 300WSM caliber meant to take down large game. If you intend to hunt large game or are into long range shooting, this rifle is for you. This rifle has a lot of different versatile ammo you can choose from w/ more than plenty knock-down power you'll ever need. 

Has a very nice recoil pad to absorb all recoil. The trigger is extremely smooth with no creep. Feels like a 2.5lb (same as my featherweight m70). The Bolt and action is very tight and smooth with no sloppiness. Bolt is jeweled and very slick. You wont be disappointed. 

What you receive when purchased:
---Rifle only (no scope, no rings)

I am looking to buy a Kel-Tec PF9. I would also consider a other small (conceal sized) 9mm. I am simply more partial to the PF9 because two buddies have them and I really like the way it fits in my hand. And I am partial to the very slim design. However, i would consider others, just shoot me a picture, description, and asking price of it and we will see if we can make a deal. I would like it to be in great to new condition (not something with hundreds and hundreds of rounds through it). And preferably with little wear on the gun. I am fine with a little wear from carry, just not large wear areas. In terms of the color, I would honestly entertain any finish of the gun as long as it is functionally great. The original box is not a must, but wouldnt hurt. I dont necessarily need ammo included, but it also wouldnt hurt. I am looking to spend between 200-300 depending on condition, included items, and amount of rounds through it. If you have a PF9 that you would be willing to part with shoot me a message through email or shoot me a TEXT ONLY to REDACTED. I hate having to say text only but because of work and school I can almost never actually answer the phone. But with texting i can atleast be able to answer quicker and get the gist of what you have.  Also, I have various items I could trade. (Not gun related, mainly car audio related). So that is a possibility as well if you are interested in those types of things. Also,I prefer to buy froma  private party than a dealer simply because the money would go to an individual moreso than a business itself.

Private parties will also no longer be allowed to sell or purchase firearms without a background check after that as well. It is certain to be passed with a Democrat-controlled state congress. These magazines will quadruple in value as they did during the Clinton-era assault weapons ban, and Coloradans will no longer be able to purchase them, much the same as in New York or California.

Saiga .308. Has the rarer and no longer-manufactured lightweight wood furniture. Barrel length is 16"" which is stiffer and more accurate than the 21"" version. Comes with the following:

This functions flawlessly. There is roughly 500 rounds through it, without a single FTF or FTE. With good ammo, using the scope, it is capable of 1.5 inch groups at 100 yards. The only issue is that the front hand guard is a little loose. These are no longer for sale at any retailer, and are going to be on the immediate list of banned guns if the AWB passes by spring. If this does not sell, I have no problem keeping it as an investment.

Am open to trades for modern handguns, rifles, and revolvers, but I do not want your old military surplus clunkers, your hi-points, your single-action revolvers, or your 9mm ammo that you think is worth 50 cents a round. I reload, so I still get my ammo for reasonable prices. I am however interested in 5.45 ammunition as a partial trade, or straight across if you have a MASSIVE quantity of it."

Norinco SKS that has seen some action, cosmetically she shows her age but I have put prob 250 rounds through it since she came out of cosmoline without a single failure, she goes bang EVERY time. I wont include ammo with this rifle but I will include 10x stripper clips for 7.62 that work great. Has the folding bayonet still on it. (it's actually not a Norinco it's a Chinese Gvt (before Norinco existed) model from factory 26, but everybody calls them Norinco since its the EXACT same specs w/ milled rec etc)

What you see is what you get I have 6, 25 round mag and 2, 5 round mags for hunting. There is a Magpul mono pod on the back and a Harris bipod on the front. The Glass is an IOR 3.5x18x50 on top and is crystal clear even when shooting out to 1000 yards. I have taken 2 antelope with this gun and several prairie dog and coyotes. Total rounds through the gun are 456. It has always been cleaned every time shot. It also comes with 2 slings one that can hold the gun like a backpack. It slings over both shoulders and holds the gun in the middle of your back. This rifle will shoot a 6” pie plate at 1000 yards and a 3 shot group the size of a quarter at 500 yards. It has been a safe queen for most of its life and needs a new home. If you would like the gun only I will strip it down and sell it as it came to me.

This 3-day course is designed to train patrol officers to a level of proficiency in the use of the AR-15 style rifle as part of their patrol functions.

Upon completion of this course officers will have demonstrated the necessary skills and disciplines needed to make this weapon a safe and effective part of their departments patrol response.

STOP PAYING THE HIGH PRICES FOR GUNS AND AMMO!!!!  This crazy bill is not going to pass with enough teeth that it is going to really effect those of us in Kansas at all!  



This crazy stuff of buying ammo for triple the value is crazy and you are going to make the price go up and stay up when shop owners see that this is a newly accepted price. 

You know whats happening dont you?  These guys are going to stores and finding out when the ammo shipments come in, then they are standing there and when they get their chance they are buying it all. 

Then they come on here and they sell it for 3 times as much.  Start sticking them with that ammo!  Let them sit on 30 boxes of something they dont shoot.  Next time they will leave it at the store and you can buy it for $10 a box, not $40.  They are calling it a convenience fee... no it is being a thief. Call it for what it is. 



Same with guns. We all see the gun dealers on many internet sites with 20-30 guns at a time. Some of them do not even have a store front, all he has is  these sites to sell guns on. I promise you his guns are all at least 100 over MSRP and most of them are 200-300 over what any other Donaldson dealer can sell them to you for. 



We all think this price gouging is madness, so do your part to stop it... dont buy over priced guns, dont pay triple for ammo than its worth.  If you stop paying that much, there will start being ammo in the stores again, and prices will settle back down.  

Everyone do your part, and it will be better for all of us in the end."

Made in Israel. 40 S&W.  Comes with the factory high cap mag, plus two other factory high capacity mags new and still in their packages. First generations don't have the rail below, which make them look a lot more like a full-size Desert Eagle, only smaller and much lighter. This is the ""full-sized"" Baby Eagle (sounds like an oxymoron) with the five inch barrel and 12-round magazines. This version, too, is engraved ""Desert Eagle Pistol"". Very good double action trigger pull - feels like a single action pull. Feeds anything. Not many rounds through it. Front dot is orange for better targeting. Comes with box and all paperwork. Outside paper box has some wear. Inside foam box in very good condition. 

I just dropped the price on this by $50. Factory hi-cap magazines for this gun are going for $50 each on Gun Broker - and there is only one listing for them. 

Condition in 90 percent plus. There are are a few high spots that the black finish is barely showing through - safety, slide release, mag release and beavertail. Any other odd looks in the photos come from the fact I just wiped it down with a silicon cloth.

I finally just gave up and put my .22 conversion upper on one of them.  The other I'll just sell as it isn't doing me any good with unavailable uppers and no bcg's that aren't priced at their weight in gold.  This lower is made by New Frontier Arms.  It's listed as Multi-Caliber so you can mount whatever you'd like on it (5.56 .223 6.8 .22 etc)  It weighs 1.6 pounds, 7.2oz's lighter than a typical aluminum lower.  It's easy to clean and more scratch resistant than aluminum.  You can use MilSpec or Commercial parts with it.  Has a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer against defects in craftsmanship.  It has the accu-group composite fire control system installed, but can accommodate your own LPK as well.  The stock is the 6 position adjustable unit.  A lot of people talk down on the polymer AR lowers, but just by looking at how well Glock has done with polymer in their firearms, I think we can all see that these puppies are tough.  I've used my DPMS 5.56 upper on mine and it functions flawlessly.  The first picture shows the lower with a .22LR mag in it.  That mag is not included.  The second shows the lower with a S&W MP15-22 Upper on it.  The upper is also NOT included.  Those two pictures are just to show the flexability of the lower.  FTF meet to sale at my local range, I will need to see a valid GA drivers license.  Prefer to see a CWL as well. $400 Firm or stuff listed in trade
I meet at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club off 400 exit 13."
