The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 60-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-100 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

The fit and finish are excellent and it fits really nice in your hand. I am also including an extra Kim-Pro Tac mag as well. From what I've seen, this is a pretty hard gun to find at least around the state where I've been and I'm told the build time is pushing over a year right now. If you're looking for a great gun at a great price point just let me know!

The bore is clean and is just starting to turn dark with strong rifling still present. The standard sight is covered by the First Type Carbine Sight Cover in fine condition. The Lock Plate is the 2nd Type with the small shield on the eagle and it has the majority of its original blue finish that is only just starting to turn brown in places. The hammer is a 2nd Type with checkered thumb piece. The stock is black walnut and has no cracks but only normal handling dings and scratches. The left side of the stock has a mysterious non-standard cartouche that has the date 1888, which his the same date as manufacture, but is not the typical Springfield Armory cartouche. The lower band is a Model 1885 with generous remnants of original blue finish and the dish in the top for the rear sight. The butt plate appears to be a thick Model 1855-1863 butt plate with no provision for a trap compartment. Has a Buffington Rifle Rear Sight. The Breech is marked ""U.S./MODEL/1884.""

Some of us have to work because we have real jobs.  And for those of you who don't know, Walmart places their ammo out at 7 am every morning and Sportman's 1st thing Thursday morning.  Both places still charge normal prices.  If you can, get there early and beat these clown's at their own game.  I can't because I have to be on duty and don't have the ability to stand in line.

Now for the jerks who say it's ""supply and demand"" and ""our payment for standing in line"".  I say to you, you are the worst kind of scum in the planet.  So let's say we have a major storm in Reno and the food trucks can't make it here.  And let's say I run and grab all the bread in town.  So now I sell that bread or milk or whatever to families who need it for triple the cost or more.  By your dumb%^$ logic that's ok.  I say that makes me the worst kind of person destined to rot in hell!  This actually happened in Lake Tahoe many years ago when a train crashed in the Sierra's.  The closest coffee shop started charging $5.00 for a cup of coffee and even more for food.  That's ok with you idiots?  You can spin it anyway you like to help yourself sleep.  But in the end you're all thieves taking advantage of a bad situation.  But most important, you're taking advantage of fellow gun owners instead of standing together.  We are at war for our gun rights.  We should be sticking together and fighting as a group.  But you clowns are raping fellow gun owners.  I bet none of you have even called your Senator's or Congressmen to voice your opinion.  That's the ""line I've been standing in!""  Are you members of the NRA?  Probably not.  Sadly, we are going to lose this was war.  I hope you jerk wad thiefs opportunists sleep well at night.  No matter how you spin it, that's what you are!!"

This Krag is one of the hard to find Norwegian Stomperud models in 6.5x55 Caliber. These rifles were MFG 1946-1951 and this is one out of 1572 pieces that Kongsberg made. They were assembled from different types of parts and rifles given to Kongsberg. They were called ""Bastard-Krag"" or ""Stomperud"" Krag. These are a part of the Norwegian Krag history, and this a great sample out of these. Low number of them, so a bit rare to find complete. These were civilian rifles with bayonet lugs to be sold to the public. The Stomperud Krag had the barrel shortened by 15 cm to 61.3 cm and the front of the stock was cut sum 18 cm shorter. This rifle is about the same length as a K98. These rifles are rather scarce with less than 1600 manufactured. The condition of this gun is very good. The serial number on the receiver is #85XXX and the date is stamped 1909. The receiver number revealed that in April 1940 it was an original m1894 Krag, stationarized at the IR3 (Infantry Regiment number 3). IR3 fought against the Germans for a few days, and this Krag can be one that were out in action and perhaps got some damage, so that it later were refurbished as a Stomperud? This is only speculation, but could be the history of the Receiver. The rifle is in very good shape with strong rifling and a clean bore. The only things that make this an excellent rifle rather than perfect is that is my grandfather varnished the stock back in the 60's and my dad wrote Norway on it about an inch long with an electric pencil in the mid 70's. ARMSLIST would only allow 3 pictures. I will email more pictures upon request

One just sold on Gun Broker for $3526. I would put it up auction but, I’m looking for a quick sale. Only $2,850 or Best Offer.

This is a brand new holster that has never been used except for these pictures. You'll be surprised how well a pistol like the XDs can be concealed. And how comfortable it is to carry.

A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.

The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech® system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech® system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever.

The Mini-14 non-target versions can fire both the .223 Remington cartridge and the similar military 5.56x45mm cartridge. At an unspecified time in 2007 to 2008, Ruger added a heavier tapered barrel to the Mini series. The heavier barrel had an overall larger diameter with the barrel visibly becoming thicker in the final inches as the barrel approaches the gas block from the muzzle. These changes combined with tighter tolerances result in greater potential accuracy. The new Mini-14 supposedly can shoot under 1 MOA."

He posted it as ”BORE, ACTION, INTERNALS IN EXELLENT CONDITION. HAVE PUT 200 ROUNDS THROUGH THIS RIFLE WITH ZERO PROBLEMS.’’
 ” I briefly looked the gun over, I did not scrutinize it , I got distracted by patriotic statements from a young guy in the military. I came home and realized I can’t remove the gas piston shroud. Next day, I bought a punch and pushed out the pin w/ the punch and hammer. The pin supposed to be pushed out w/out effort, with the thumb. 
 Here are the picks of what I saw when I removed the cover. The rod was stuck, the bottom of the piston rod is bent, the middle has a wave. Obviously totally unsafe and in inoperative condition. 
 Took it to gunsmith (I could not remove the rod). Then I contacted Paul Austin and gave him a chance to make it right and the benefit of the doubt that he did not know what he was selling. He promised to send the spring and piston rod, a whole $30 worth of parts.., a month and a half ago. I'm still waiting.
 Is it deliberate deception w/no concern for safety of others or just greed and irresponsible stupidity? You be the judge. God help us all with “patriots” like this.

This exceptionally quiet pistol is made up of two parts: the Ruger Mk. III .22 LR pistol, and the lightweight custom Titanium AWC suppressor, combined together in a striking fashion. The result is an extremely accurate, lightweight weapon.

This Amphibian S comes equipped with high-visibility adjustable night sights, a frame-mounted American-style magazine release and a loaded chamber indicator. The 7” overall length makes for easy handling and transport, and the durable stainless finish ensures that the Amphibian S will handle a lot of wear and any climate and terrain.

The Ruger Mk. III is equipped with a loaded chamber indicator, which will always let you know when a cartridge is in the chamber. The gun also includes a manual safety, and the internal cylindrical bolt ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than typical moving slide designs.

The Amphibian S is much lighter than any of the previous variations because of AWC’s new baffle design; the new baffle utilizes a 303 stainless steel primary baffle and a lightweight Titanium secondary baffle.

Ruger also includes Weaver rails as a standard upgrade for connecting sights and other accessories. This suppressed semi-auto is so quiet, the sound of the bullet hitting the dirt was louder than the report. It’s a great addition to your handgun collection, or an ideal buy if you’re looking for a suppressed pistol."
