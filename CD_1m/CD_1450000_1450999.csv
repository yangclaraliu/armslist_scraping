281,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1450281,For Trade:  Mississippians' Second Amendment Rights,"Statewide, Jackson, Mississippi",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, April 13, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I cannot believe that Senator Wicker voted to approve debate on legislation that would establish a Federal law that effectively infringes on the right of law abiding citizens to transfer their property rights in a weapon to another individual. 

The 2nd Amendment was written to restrict ""federal"" infringement with respect to gun ownership. Requiring a background check is in itself an infringement as that check determines the eligibility of ownership, limits the owner's rights, compels the owner to act as a policing power, and creates an additional danger of confrontation for the transferor. 

Currently, the federal government requires background checks on the purchase of a new weapon from an FFL because that restriction is tied to the Federal government's power to license the FFL and through the federal government's dominating the area of interstate commerce. As part of getting the license, the dealer has to do the checks, and they are equipped to perform them as part of a business model. This has never been the case with private transfers with regard to federal law. There are states that require regulated private transfers, and those systems work for those States, AND that is exactly what the 2nd Amendment is designed to protect--the People's rights, as States, to regulate those transfers. 

Here Senator Wicker has ""negotiated"" Mississippians' 2nd Amendment rights to participate in the political process as a State, sovereign under the Constitution, to regulate the private transfers of a particular type of personal property. Until now, we have long enjoyed our rights to our property, free of taking by the government. We too enjoy the Constitutional protections of privacy in our papers, our writings and our homes. We enjoy free speech, and we are thankful that the Constitution has, thus far, prevented the federal government from infringing on the free exercise of faith and religion, all guaranteed under the First and Fourth Amendments. 

The law under debate, if passed and surviving Constitutional scrutiny, will allow the federal government to dominate where the Bill of Rights wholly intended to exclude it. The law places the first ""inch of infringement"" on an established guaranty in the Bill of Rights. Let's ask ourselves how long will we will continue to support politicians that are willing to negotiate those rights? If the inch is firmly established, there is no need even worrying about the mile; it will be just a given. 

I am left to wonder which other right will be up for infringement next--speech, privacy, religion, or perhaps racial equality? I thought they were well settled long ago too.  I have to wonder if I am ready to let them be negotiated also? 

I would offer that our founding fathers thought so much of the freedom of speech, the freedom of the exchange of information through the press, the freedom of the exchange of personal beliefs of faith through worship and the practice of religion, and the freedom to assemble and be heard by those that would govern us through the right of grievance, that they made them First among the many rights guaranteed under the Bill. They thought enough of the absolute necessity of these rights that they would pass the Second Amendment in order to insure their enduring effect. Is not the price of failing to protect the Second Amendment, the sacrifice of the assurances of the First? I urge readers to consider this question before casting another vote for Mr. Wicker again."

I traded my AR-15 last night for M1 Garand. I have no further use for my stash of .223 (5.56) ammo, I'd love to get it out there to people that want to go shooting at a reasonable price, like our forefathers intended. 

I have 261 rounds; 201 rounds are are brass PMC brand, and 60 rounds are steel case of a maker I can't remember. All these are lose rounds I had loaded into magazines, but took out this morning, and here we are..

I have no interest in doing multiple transactions with multiple people and the hassle involved with that, so here's the deal. The cheapest you can find this ammo on the off chance you even find it is $9.99 for a box of 20; I'll knock 10% off of that.. So we'll say an even $115 for all the ammo, giving the rounding difference in your favor. I did see some ammo yesterday at fleet farm but it was $20 for a box of 20..this is insane!! My price is below what you could even buy it for prior to the ammo shortage, and this is far less than I even paid for it, but I love shooting and we need to help each other out. 

I require a local pickup, but it's all ready to go.

Also I have several 30 round magazines left and if you buy all this ammo, ill take a 50% loss and sell em to you for $15 a piece, to the buyer of the ammo only, please don't message me for just the magazines, ill be keeping them if the buyer doesn't want them because I plan on purchasing another AR in the future.

For all you ammo and price gougers out there, you can go F yourself!! Shooting is a passion shared by all of us and screw you for trying to profit on this!!

For Sale New in the box Glock 17 Gen 4 In Flat Dark Earth.  Plus extra magazines and ammo.  

At the beginning of the Firearmegeddon, I bought as many Glocks, mags and ammo as I could.  Now I am culling some down out of the collection.   I am not a speculator and will sell at sane prices.

The Glock 17 Gen 4 in Flat Dark Earth. Comes with all standard Glock goodies, 3 mags, lock, back straps, cleaning brush, Glock case and paperwork.  Never fired except at the factory.   Date on fired case envelope is March 2012.   

Price: $600 - Cash Only, No trades wanted. 

Four Glock Magazines 17 Round Capacity and are OEM Mags.  - $100 for all four

350 Rounds of 115 grain FMJ brass cased Sellier & Bellot ammo - $75 for all 7 boxes
50 rounds of 124 grain Federal HydraShock Defense Ammo - $25 for the box 

For the package: Glock, ammo and mags - $750 Cash.   

Caveat:  I want to sell it all as a package.  I will not sell the extra mags and ammo separately until the handgun sells.  This package is priced at considerable savings over buying new and at a time when 9mm ammo and mags are at premium. 

I am in Hastings and would do a face to face sale in the south metro. No need for bill of sale unless you want one. Just need to show a PTP/PTC and valid DL. That's it. email with interest and offers or text/call: 952*215*4016.

433,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1450433,For Sale/Trade:  1944 Lee Enfield No4 MKI T Sniper Rifle w/Transit Chest & Scope Case,"Sellersburg, IN, Louisville, Kentucky","$ 2,000","Listed On: Wednesday, May 15, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Enfield No4T sniper rifles were issued to British commando squads or SAS ""seek and strike"" units that hunted and assassinated Nazi war criminals that killed British secret agents, under direct order of Winston Churchill. These were the most effective sniper rifles of WWII due to the painstaking attention that the world-famous Holland and Holland gunsmiths put into these rifles which often shot sub MOA. They would receive only the most accurate rifles from the arms factory and then rebuild them with bedded barrels and many other refinements as well as a high quality No32 scope ( which this rifle is missing) and a transit chest to protect this precision rifle. This was in stark contrast to many countries which often used rack grade rifles with modest quality optics. The professional appraisal on the gun, transit chest and scope case was $4500. The condition was graded at a strong 90%+. A reproduction No32 scope and mount from Numerich at a cost of $750 would increase the value to $6000. With the original scope and mount the appraiser said they would put it in their store for $8000-$9000. Since I'm in it below market value I would consider cash/trade offers of around $2000. In 10 years this package will at least double in value as it sits, or more with the addition of a scope and mount. Would love to keep it but my wife wants the cash back I used to buy it :) Make me an offer. You can then contact Mr. Skennerton as the foremost authority on these rifles and author of ""The British Sniper"" published in 1983 for all the provenance info associated with this particular rifle assessable from the serial number. Thank you for looking."

I shot a friend's G30 and was deadly accurate with it, but his sights were low and it drove me crazy. The Gen 1 Glock adjustable sights were worse than horrible. They were plastic and hung off the back of the pistol! This was right when they changed to quality iron sights that came with a little tiny screwdriver to adjust the sights. The way they are adjusted now, I put 10 rounds within a 2"" circle (from a Ransom rest) at 25 yards!! Unbelievable accuracy, especially from a 'sub-compact' .45ACP pistol.

I've never carried the pistol, so it shows basically no wear. What you see in the one picture on the rear groves is dust inside the valleys of the gripping points for racking the slide. I didn't notice until after I'd taken the pics and put it away. Otherwise, it's pretty well like new with the 2 factory ""commercial"" (don't really know what that means) 10 round mags and the sight adjustment tool in the original box that even says ""ADJ"" for sights on the box label. I'm pretty well thinking that with this Glock being rather unique with the factory adjustable sights on it and it being unbelievably accurate, that I'd want to get $525 out of it in cash or trade for a similar value pistol.

I'd trade for a compact (not sub-compact; already have those) Beretta PX4 Storm, FNS in either .40 or .45 (already have one in 9mm) or an XDS in 45."

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine. Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use. The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET. The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

The stock is original that was cut down and turned into a carbine style stock. Looks very good. The barrel is also shortened and recrowned. The bolt has been smoother out so you can easily manipulate with one hand and dont need to smack it. It also has a enhanced rubber buttpad which adds cushion and adds to the length of pull. It also has a trigger job. The mount and red/green dot sight is also a nice feature. I am getting engaged and can use the spare cash since I dont shoot long range very often.

The LWRC REPR is being currently deployed with U.S. and British troops overseas. The REPR is accurate enough that it is substituting for the bolt action sniper rifles in some multi role applications.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. This rifle is the Sniper version which includes the Geissele trigger. To complete the system all you would need to get is a short barreled upper.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes a patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

The Backup dual-output LED light features a brilliant 200-lumen beam ideal for identifying threats and overwhelming the sight of adversaries, or a low output 5-lumen beam perfect for reading a map, checking an ID, or navigating in low light.

The Backup can run for1.3 hours at high output and 40 hours at low output, a valuable feature for outdoor or emergency situations. A tough, lightweight Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum body protects the Backup's sophisticated electronics, and its smooth contours minimize clothing snag and pressure points. A two-way clip allows head-up or head-down carry. Available in black with a tactical pushbutton and twist operation or in black or silver with click operation and a shroud.

I inherited it upon his death.  Apparently, during my many relocations during my career in the Navy, the pistol got shuffled around a lot; even popping open--and at one point, the rear aperture-style turning receiver--screwing off the gun entirely.

Recently, I found the old pistol, but that aperture-style receiver lock that closes behind the single pellet was missing.  I looked everywhere, and cannot find it.  I've taken the pistol to numerous gunsmiths only to be told it's a lost cause.  I tend NOT to think so.

779,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1450779,For Sale:  CNC Milled 80% lower AR reciever,"NE, Arizona, United States",$ 175,"Listed On: Saturday, April 13, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"These are some beautiful lower receivers, 80% complete to military specifications.  These are NOT considered receivers yet by the ATF and are not serialized - meaning there's absolutely no tracking of these units and even if purchased through a gun shop, no background check is required and no paperwork filled out. 

These are completely legal to own and complete into working receivers - 
however, as will all things gun related, know the local, state, and federal laws that apply to your particular location and circumstances.  You are responsible for You!

 All that is needed is a drill or drill press, some end mill bits (basically drill bits with flat ends) , and the jig; here's a few links to places selling the jigs:
http://ar15jigs.com/drilljigs.html
http://www.cncguns.com/tooling.html
http://www.apex-brass.com/ut-arms-drill-jig-fixture.html

Of all the places selling the jigs (and there are many more), I highly recommend CNCguns.  Those guys have been there, done it (right) and now offer the proper pieces of equipment, videos, and first hand experience.  Plus, their just plain nice guys and will take time out of their day to get on the phone and talk you through any problems.

I ordered 5 of these when all h*ll broke loose earlier this year and I'll end up building out 3, that leaves 2 to sell.  

Again, these are mill aluminum works of art that you can build into flawless operating guns that you'll be proud to own.

I am able to accept payment via CC through Google Checkout (add 3.5%) and will only charge actual shipping (no ""handling"" fee), and these do not have to go through an FFL - they ship straight to your door."

 Check http://ammoseek.com to see the prices prople are actively paying for this ammo, when it's available. I know the prices seem high, but they've been high for months, and this is for people looking to shoot. The 5.56/.223 is all first-run factory production, and you get the quality brass that goes with it, NOT steel cases.

 **NOTE: .223 is USUALLY perfectly safe to fire in systems chambered for 5.56, but the inverse/opposite is NOT the case. We're talking 50,000 PSI a few inches from your peepers- better to ask questions and play it safe than blow pieces of your weapon (or yourself) into the guy standing next to you."

On 26 September 1874 Creedmoor witnessed a crowd of over five thousand people attending the first international shooting competition in America. At 800 yards the American had a good lead. The Irish gained on them at 900 yards, and by the time they had finished shooting at 1000 yards, were ahead of the Americans. In the end, the match was determined by the very last shot by the Americans. Shooting a bulls eye at 1000 yards to score 4, the Americans emerged the winners with 934 points to the Irish teams 931. In commemoration of this history USA Shooting Team event, Chiappa and Cimarron Firearms are proud to offer the USA SHOOTING TEAM Model 1874 Creedmoor Sharps Rifle. A percentage of the sale of this beautiful reproduction of the rifle used to win the first organized shooting event in the United States will be given to the USA Shooting Team to support their effort to continue our country's legacy in international shooting sports. Chiappa Firearms, under the Armi Sport brand, has been producing faithful replicas of Sharps models since 1966, creating along the years a rich variety of versions. What all these versions have in common, is that all our rifles have a greatly reliable mechanism and that all parts are interchangeable with the originals.
