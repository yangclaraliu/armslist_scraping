The pistol comes standard with a match grade stainless steel barrel/bushing, de-horned carbon steel slide and frame, cocobolo wooden grip panels, tritium front sight post, novak rear sight, checkered front strap and mainspring housing, skeletonized adjustable match trigger, ambidextrous safety, enhanced hammer and a lowered and flared ejection port. 

I have changed the grips to Hogue Extreme checkered aluminum grip panels, which are shown in the pictures. The original cocobolo grip panels will be included in the packaging. I also installed a Wilson Combat extended magazine release, but I will also include the original mag release. The one 7-round and one 8-round magazines that were included with the pistol are also included as well as a 15-round extended magazine. The pistol will come in its original packaging, including the hard case, owners manual and bushing wrench.

The pistol is in very good shape, there is one very small scratch on the left side of the slide, but it is only noticeable from very close. The gun has only been fired about 100 times since it was purchased 3 months ago, but in that time it has been meticulously maintained and cleaned.

Simply put, this is an exceptionally good 1911 for what it costs. While it is not quite at the handcrafted Wilson Combat or Les Baer level, it is considerably better than anything else in the $1,000-$2,000 range. In terms of accuracy, it is without question the most accurate pistol (centerfire) I own. 

I am also including a Blackhawk Serpa Belt/Paddle holster for the 1911. The holster is level 2 retention and has a button release. The button/lever on this holster has been texturized. This is a hard polymer holster specifically for the full-size 1911.

The rifle came standard with the Knight's Armament M4 carbine rail system, M4 profile barrel, full auto BCG, M4A1 rollmark and ambi. selector switch. 

The buttstock and grip were replaced with a Magpul ACS and Magpul MIAD. The trigger was replaced with a Geissele SSA-E trigger system. I replaced the standard iron sights with a front tritium flip-up/gas block iron sight and a rear tritium flip-up battlesight from GG&G. There is also a Troy ambi. magazine release installed on the lower receiver, along with a Magpul BAD lever. 

The rifle is in great condition, is only a few months old and has only had a couple hundred rounds fired through it. It has been cleaned and maintained meticulously and is practically perfect. 

The rifle was customized using some of the best available components to make an AR-15 that is fully upgraded with things that you actually NEED! Not a bunch of lasers and rangefinders that you will almost never use! Even simply using the iron sights this rifle is exceptionally accurate for a chrome lined mil-spec barrel. 

I am also including 2 standard-capacity polymer magazines, a soft carbine carrying case, a cleaning kit and a sling.

I purchased it from an aging WWII veteran a number of years ago and when I took it all apart I realized I had a real treasure. Obviously manufactured at the Springfield Armory at some point during WWII it must have been serviced at an arsenal depot on one of the war theaters, for it has a Winchester trigger group and HRA bolt, to my knoweldge, WWII parts.

I sent it off to Dean's Gun restoration and had the wood replaced with a beautifully well reproduction WWII stock in period stain color. It was completely reparkerized, every single part broken down and refinished, all springs replaced.

It is a great shooter. I'm selling it because the tax man cometh in force this year.

If you are looking for a genuine piece of World War II history, this M1 Garand is for you. It is truly a collector's piece, would be a real treasure of a gift for an aging WWII veteran or to add to your collection.

I'm selling it with a reproduction WWII era soft case and reproduction leather sling.

The Muzzle wear is minimal, around a 2.5 I'd guess, and the throat is in good shape. Unfortunately, I do not have the tools to give you a more precise measurement.

I have put only around three clips of ammo through it and it functions flawlessly.

You simply will NOT find Garands today in this kind of great condition and completely restored to their wartime, from-the-factory glory.

SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY.

I have a LOT more photos I can provide, just let me know.

The VENOM quickly and easily mounts by simply twisting out the existing cylinder pin and twist in the new LaserLyte integrated laser and cylinder pin configuration. The VENOM integrated laser holds the tiny 4x377 batteries, the switch and laser all in one compact package (less than two inches). The VENOM adds very little bulk to the gun, yet provides the user with the gained confidence of aiming accuracy. No sighting in is required with the VENOM due to the fixed-point-of-aim provided at the LaserLyte factory. The minuscule circuitry within the LaserLyte VENOM laser holds a programmable laser with: constant on, pulse mode and an auto-off after 6 minutes. The battery life is five hours in constant on and ten hours* in the pulse mode.

Please use the pictures below and more upon request to grade the firearm yourself. I’m not 100% sure if it has been fired, but it does not appear to have been. It is in very good condition with the original box, foam and paperwork. There are two spots that appear to have coloring issues on the right side of the frame as I point out in several pictures. It was hard to capture these as they really do only appear at a certain angle in the right light. The box is not in as good of condition as you will also see in the pictures. One of the end flaps is missing and the box has tape in another spot. It is the original box though. If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer but ask BEFORE bidding. I am very good at responding to emails but for this post, please allow at least 24 hours as I would like to limit the number of times I must remove it. Please feel free to contact me before bidding and I will do my best to answer.

XDM Features

 XDM DESIGN

 Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.






(M)odel Contour Frame

 The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.





(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

 Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.










(M)ega-Lock Texture

 The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 

The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.






XDM TECHNOLOGY

 Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.






(M)elonite

 Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 

The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M)is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.





(M)atch Grade Barrel

 Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry










(M)inimal Reset Trigger

 The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.




XDM INNOVATIONS

 The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD is now captured in the all new XD(M) line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.






(M)inimal Error Disassembly


Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.





(M)aximum Reach Mag Release


The modified contour of the new XD(M)grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.










(M)ega Capacity Magazine


The new XD(M) Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR Mag 
X-Tension (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
.40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.




XDM PERSONALIZATION

 Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M), you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.






(M)ould-Tru Backstraps


With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.





(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System


A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. 










(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case


Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.





(M)agazine X-Tensions


With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORYhas added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)




XDM STANDARDS

 In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD polymer pistol, they did just that….






Loaded Chamber Indicator

 The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.





Striker Status Indicator

 The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. 










USA Trigger System

 The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.





Grip Safety

 Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol."

NIGHTFORCE MODEL: C237
The top choice for law enforcement snipers. A large objective lens increases resolution and exit pupil size for rapid target acquisition and optimal light performance in twilight conditions…an especially useful configuration for tactical teams that may not have dedicated night vision. This superior optical design also benefits hunters and sport shooters who want to maximize their success in low-light environments. A large field of view, 110 MOA of adjustment and a practical magnification range make this an ideal riflescope for both snipers and sportsmen. ***The 3.5-15x56NXS is being discontinued and currently has limited availability."

It is the V1 model, which means it is SA/DA with a safety/decocker. Because this is the tactical model, the trigger is a match grade trigger that has a nice and crisp single action break and a smooth, moderate weight double action pull. Both of these will improve as the gun is fired more and the trigger surfaces are perfected. 

The gun is  in fantastic condition. Other than the fact that it has been fired >100 times it looks like it could be new. There are no blemishes on the slide or the receiver, or anything else for that matter. The action is very clean and well lubricated and while it has only been used a couple times, it has been cleaned and taken care of meticulously.

Also installed on the pistol are Meprolight Tru-Dot raised adjustable night sights. These have a green front and two green rear tritium lamps. The sights are raised so they can still be used when a suppressor is mounted. The magazine release has also been replaced with the extended magazine release, which is simply about 50% larger than the standard. I will include the standard size release with the sale as well. Finally, the pistol has decal grips installed.

The pistol will come with three 12-round steel magazines and one 20-round steel extended magazine. The extended magazine has a grip adapter which fits and extends the weapons grip. The pistol will be packaged in its original packaging. Including the H&K hard pistol case, H&K gun lock, H&K USP owners manual and the 2 test cases from the factory test fire. I can also include the original raised iron sights that came with the pistol, as well as the 4 replacement O-rings, sight adjustment tool, USP mainspring lock key and allen wrench which also came with the pistol or the night sights.

Most likely, sometime during the insurrection against the British, it was converted into a pistol and re-chambered to fire the British .303 cartridge.  The pistol appears to function, though I’ve not fired any rounds from it (would highly recommend being checked by a competent gunsmith), but know it would be a handful, even though it’s slightly heavier than your standard Glock!  The markings appear correct for the timeframe and it was made by the famous Enfield royal arms factories.  The pistol is in good condition, considering age and years of use (check pics, can send more if necessary).  The only thing missing is one piece of green material on the left grip, as seen in the pics.  $200 OBO

Please feel free to ask me any questions.  I will ship (at buyer’s expense) to the FFL of your choice (class 1 or C&R); they must accept firearms from a non-FFL holder (as per federal law).

Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Product Description Ideally suited for informal target shooting, plinking, small game hunting, and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate. The 10/22's heat-stabilized, glass-filled polymer trigger housing assembly is precision-made of high-tech material for improved manufacturing tolerances, impact, and abrasion-resistance, and has an unmatched ability to withstand the elements. The hammer-forged barrel is locked into the receiver by a unique two-screw V-block system and the A380 aluminum alloy receiver is precision-machined to provide long-term reliability to the 10/22 action. Ruger's patented, detachable 10-shot rotary magazine features a unique rotor to separate cartridges and provide reliable feeding. The easy-to-use extended magazine release provides smooth, no-fuss removal of the unique flush-mounted magazine without leaving it exposed to dent or creating uncomfortable protrusions at the rifle's balance points.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

This is my personal pistol used in the .45 caliber phase of NRA “bullseye” events.  The pistol started life as a brand new standard Series 70, but was sent to the Pachmayr shop for their “Signature” accurizing work.  This was Pachmayr’s top-of-the-line package for 1911’s, and included a new barrel, custom barrel bushing/assembly, slide tightener, complete trigger job with adjustment, Bo-Mar sight assembly, backstrap checking, component tuning, and slide/frame fitting.  I added the custom Fitz grips when the gun returned.  Unfortunately I cannot find the Pachmayr “proof” target, but let’s just say I was never able to outshoot the gun!  Match load data will be supplied.

The LWRC REPR is being currently deployed with U.S. and British troops overseas. The REPR is accurate enough that it is substituting for the bolt action sniper rifles in some multi role applications.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. This rifle is the Sniper version which includes the Geissele trigger. To complete the system all you would need to get is a short barreled upper.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes a patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

I received this rifle with all metal parts in excellent shape and the wood in terrible shape. I refinished the wood with a light maple stain and gloss urethane, looks good. Check out the pictures. 

 The bluing is pristine aside from the front barrel band and the crown, worn slightly  from taking the bayonet on and off. I would guess that this was a drill rifle, often used and rarely shot. I've shot it many times and cleaned it many more. It is very accurate and is a blast to nail gallon jugs at 100 yds.

 Literally, its a blast. The concussion and fireball this makes puts hair on your chest. Sling included. Link to private album below. I encourage that you check this rifle out for yourself.

       .40Cal. H&K USP "" Like New Condition"" , Purchased New and Stored in my Safe.
This is one of the best guns ever made. MSRP $1,085.00 + Tax.

The H&K USP Pistols is rated to be one of the best in the world.

""As the USP was developed the pistol underwent much rigorous testing. The barrel is cold-forged from chromium steel for increased life. The USP barrels are a polygonal profile to further increase muzzle velocity and barrel life. During testing, a bullet was deliberately lodged in a USP barrel. Another cartridge was then fired into the obstructing bullet. The second bullet cleared the barrel, resulting in a barely noticeable bulge. The pistol was then fired for accuracy and the resulting group measured less than 4 inches at 25 meters.""

""Temperature testing required the USP be frozen to −42 °C and fired, frozen again, and then thrown into a vat of flaming oil, cleaned up and then fired. These temperature tests were continually repeated with no adverse effects on the USP. Then the USP was thrown onto a busy highway. Several cars and trucks ran over the USP over the course of several hours. The USP was then recovered and fired with no adverse effects. Subsequently, the USP was tied to the back of a vehicle and towed for 5 miles over concrete at speeds up to 75 mph. The USP was then recovered and fired with no adverse effects. ""

""The gun was also subjected to NATO MIL-SPEC mud and rain tests, which were passed without difficulty. Water immersion and salt spray also presented no problems. German Navy combat divers have used the USP for two years without any signs of corrosion.""

""Safety testing exceeded the ANSI/SAAMI requirements adopted in May 1990. These included dropping a USP with a primed cartridge and decocked hammer on a variety of hard surfaces without discharging. The USP surpassed these commercial requirements, as well as German Army and police tests, including repeated drop tests from six feet (1.8 m), hammer first, onto a steel backed concrete slab. Proof round firing resulted in no cracks, deformations, or increase in head space. Attempts to fire the USP pistol with an unlocked breech proved unsuccessful.""

""The USP was given unloaded to a bunch of homebuilders to use in place of hammers. The USPs were used for 5 days straight to hammer nails into new homes. The USP was then recovered and fired with no effect on accuracy or operation.""

""Testing with a variety of ammunition proved the USP meets these high standards. During the USP testing phase, it was shown the recoil-reduction system reduces the force on the USP grip to approximately 300 newtons (67 pounds-force). Peak force shock on competing .40 caliber polymer and metal framed pistols was around 5,000 newtons (1,100 pounds-force).

The LWRC REPR is being currently deployed with U.S. and British troops overseas. The REPR is accurate enough that it is substituting for the bolt action sniper rifles in some multi role applications.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. This rifle is the Sniper version which includes the Geissele trigger. To complete the system all you would need to get is a short barreled upper.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes a patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

This is a Springfield XDM Compact with 3.8"" barrell in Bi-Tone. I Bought this a few months ago and fired less than 50 rounds through it. It comes with all the regular Springfield items including 1 compact mag & 1 full size 19 rd mag, OTW Holster, Double Mag Holster, changable grip pieces, speed loader, etc, etc. Accurate pistol! Excellent condition! Bi-Tone with stainless slide.

The XD has taken on another design in the XDM Compact. The ""M"" stands for a Model contour frame, Major grasp slide serrations, Match-grade barrel, and Minimal reset trigger. The XDM has a whole other level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches specification and precision engineering like Springfield Armory.

Action Double Action Only

If you want fat low end, use the 15, if you want to slap the shit out of it, use the 2x10's. . .if it's a normal sized club and you want knock things off the walls and rattle pictures, set them both up and tear it up!
