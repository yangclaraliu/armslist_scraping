SOCOM developed the new rounds for use with the Special Operations Force Combat Assault Rifle, or SCAR, which needed a more accurate bullet because its short barrel, at 13.8 inches, is less than an inch shorter than the M4 carbine’s. Using an open-tip match round design common with some sniper ammunition, SOST rounds are designed to be “barrier blind,” meaning they stay on target better than existing M855 rounds after penetrating windshields, car doors and other objects. 

Summit Ammunition uses the same machines as Hornandy, Remington and others. All once fired brass that will be mixed head stamp. All new components. 300 BlackOut in Supersonic 130 grain SOST. ( Special Operations Science Technology) Summit Ammo is using the same bullet as used in the MK319 Mod 0. The 300 BO 130 g bullet runs 2180 fps using a 16"" barrel. This round penetrates 19"" of solid wet news paper and the bullet recovered was .56 in diameter.This ammo is bad to the bone. This is in stock in limited quanities and ready to ship NOW!

I had originally posted this weeks ago, and I was disappointed when I didn't get any e-mails about it... only come to realize that all of the armslist e-mails were going to my ""junk"" e-mail folder. I've got it fixed now, so I should be okay with the e-mail going forward. Sorry for anyone who had written about the earlier listing, with no response from me!

Anyway, here are the VEPRs:

(1) Molot VEPR .223/5.56 - fewer than 150 rounds fired, with original box, owner's manual, and the two factory magazines (one 10 round, one 5 round). This is like a brand new rifle. This is a Version 02 with the integrated front sights, manufactured in 2011. 16 inch barrel. Outstanding quality fit and finish. $600.

(2) Same exact as #1 above, except this one is not even fired once. $700

If you want both rifles, the price is $1,200 (for both, combined).

Then several 10 round mags as well . this whole setup with the rifle at close to 1700 would cost roughly 31-3300 to put together. I feel like im forgetting something but it is what it is. maybe Ill figure it out later. Thanks for looking. I may include ammo for the right deal. I would like to trade for a mark 23, hk usp, usc, kriss vector, ps90. I dont want to go upside down on the trade so multiple gun trades are fine as well.thanks for looking"

Now if your still reading this you know that LWRC makes the best LEO and combat proven rifles in the world! the NiCorr finish on their barrels extends the accurate life of the barrel to 40,000+ rounds The bolt carrier and trigger as well as all the internal components are NP3 coated and 100% corosion resistant! any questions feel free to contact. i would prefer a local F2F deal but would be willing to ship for additional cost (only certified USPS Money orders accepted) and shipped to a registered FFL dealer.

I am thinning out my collection a little bit more. I have several 91/30 Izhevsk round receiver Mosin Nagants that I want to get rid of. First come / first served on getting to hand pick the best from the lot. If you buy a rifle I will throw in a 440 round spam can of silver tip milsurp ammo for $125. I can guarantee you will not find ammo any cheaper than this. Yes, you might find a cheaper Mosin but it is well worth a few extra $$$ to get to hand pick one that you get to see instead of using mail order, paying for shipping, paying an FFL fee, and then finding out it was ran over by a tank in 1945 and is horrible looking. My rifles look great and all are still packed in cosmoline by the Russians who were waiting for WWIII to begin. Ask around, people know I have a quality collection. I will only sell a few rifles so make sure you jump on this. All rifles have matching numbers (including the bayonet !!!), a cleaning kit, and an oil/solvent canteen. Prices are extremely FIRM.

USP
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release
Patented Lock-Out Safety device
USP Variants:
Variant 1:  Double action/single action with ""SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame.

Variant 2:  Double action/single action with ""SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety/decocking lever) on right side of frame.

Variant 3:  Double action/single action without ""SAFE” position. Control lever (decocking lever) on left side of frame.

Variant 4:  Double action/single action without ”SAFE” position. Control lever (decocking lever) on right side of frame.

Variant 5:  Double action only with ”SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety) on left side of frame.

Variant 6:  Double action only with ”SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety) on right side of frame.

Variant 7:  Double action without control lever (no manual safety/decocking lever)

Variant 8:  Double action without control lever (no manual safety/decocking lever) SPECIAL VARIANT FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCY

Variant 9:  Double action/single action with control lever (manual safety/no decocking function) on left side of frame.

Variant 10:  Double action/single action with control lever (manual safety/no decocking function) on right side of frame.

The back tires that are on it now are shot. None of the tires on it now are balance. the front are brand new. and it needs a radiator and the back part of the frame painted. It has been primed. I blew up the rad on a test ride after I got the truck put together. This is what I have done. When I got the truck the back part of the frame from cab to the back bumper was gone with rust. so I fab a new back frame up and mounted it and weld it in. I am a fab and tig weld at sfi. It came out great. I put a 2 1/2 body lift on it as well. and a power streering pump. Needs a carb work as it idles high..

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc.  Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight.  I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need.  Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime?  I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee.  Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly!  No waiting, no need to file with the Court.  Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!  

This can be a complex process and I am here to help.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.  I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast!  Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you.  That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust?  By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing  good Estate Planning for all your firearms.  


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (16 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)
- Assignment of Property (2 pages, send this in with your BATF forms)
- Affidavit of Trustee (1 page)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

The Rasheed is tough to find and records suggest that there were only 8000 of them ever produced making it one of the rarest of all military production rifles. Of that 8000, my research indicates that only about 2000 were imported into the US making them quite collectible. 

This Rasheed is in excellent overall condition with a bright & shiny bore. All of these rifles were issued, and most I've seen over the years were pretty beaten up from the service the saw in Egypt. So finding one in excellent condition like this one is no easy task.

The Rasheed design is a combination of the AG42B Ljungman from WWII and the more modern SKS. Like the SKS it's chambered in 7.62 x 39 and is loaded from the top using the same 10 round stripper clips. It is quite capable of a high sustained rate of semi-auto fire just like it's cousin - the SKS. This rifle comes with attached blade style bayonet, original sling, and 10 stripper clips.

Asking price is $950. FTF with pickup in Brandon. Must be 21 or older and a Florida resident to purchase."

The PT92 is a clone of the Beretta 92 or Military M9. Some would even say they prefer the Taurus due to the placement of the safety/decocker on the frame instead of the slide and the full steel guide rod. This one was made in 1991 which is the first year of the decocker feature. This gun is older but works perfectly, I think even better than a new one. There are a handful of minor cosmetic issues, none being anything more than surface/bluing blemishes. Overall the gun is wonderful. The only reason I am selling it, is because I'm moving into a non gun friendly household.  Also comes with one 15 round mag, one 30 round extended mag and a military issue M9 tactical drop holster. Asking $350 cash or possible trade for the right road bike 58cm-60cm. Please e-mail me any offers you want and I will respond as promptly as possible."

I normaly have trigger parts in stock and turn around time is usally around a day and might have done in the same day in some cases. I do not own a store front and do the work at home. So we can meet up locally in winston or at the gun shop I do some work for.

Please don't make any trade offers or half trade half cash offers. Bill of Sale IS required for my personal records. Please have a Valid State ID/DL to purchase this handgun.

I am selling my 5"" Kimber Warrior. I've had it for a few months and it's just collecting dust. I never have time to go to the range and I own 100 acres so whenever I have time, I just shoot my 22's (none of which are for sale). 

It's .45ACP, cleaned after every time I've finished firing it. They MSRP for $1,512 on Kimber's Site but I purchased mine from Vance's for $1,415 + Tax = $1,510.51. I've fired MAYBE 500 rounds through it. Kimber is an AMAZING handgun manufacturer and their Quality is unparalleled, if you can't afford a Wilson.

My asking Price is $1400 BECAUSE it comes with, in addition to all the stock items, 5 additional mags. Three 7+1's, One 10+1, and one 8+1. Not to mention it also comes with an open carry holster. The brand name of the holster escapes me, but it's VERY good. The grips are VZ Grips and are amazing, I put them on myself and I love them.

This is a package deal, so everything must be purchased. Seeing that each mag is roughly $25 and the Holster was $40, that brings my used Kimber's value at $1,235 which is actually a very good price for a Kimber Warrior in this condition.

Anyone who purchases this, can also purchase .45ACP target ammo from me. I have boxes of 50 and depends on how many boxes you want to buy, there are discounts involved. I have 750 rounds, so I have plenty upon request for sale.

Thank you."
