I purchased this gun new in September of last year, and have put maybe 200 rounds through it. .50AE ammo costs $2.00 to $2.50 per round now, and I just can't afford to shoot this gun much. It's a LOT of fun and gets plenty of attention at the range, but just not practical for self defense. I've had my fun with it, and it's time to let someone else have some fun, and I can use the money to invest in something a bit more practical.

Primary Reason is its missing sights the Ruger sights and i want to raise money for another gun.
My loss is your gain.

Rifle is used but in very good shape.

It has many fantastic features :

- A Cold Hammer Forged Fluted(!) 14.7 inch barrel that has the flashhider factory integrated for a total of 16 in lenght. Gives it a nice SBR look/feel w/o aftermarket pinning.

Here is a review for the SR556C http://www.gunblast.com/Ruger-SR556c.htm.

- hard chromed BCG, Hard chromed Bolt (!)
- Gun has no hint of carrier tilt at all!
- It will come with a Daniel Defense VFG included 
- Has a Nice and new Magpul CTR Stock
- This is the lightest of the SR556 series
- Magpul BAD Lever included
- LMT sights shown not included (they are back on the LMT) on request I can include a pair of MagPuls flip ups

The consensus is that the SR556CLA is the most desirable of the SR556 series.

1350 firm w/o the sights but with the Daniel Defense VFG

Beautiful Ruger Carry case and 2 new in wrapper PMags included.
If desired a local buyer will also have access to fair priced ammo for sale.

Double Barrel Couch Gun. 
This shotgun has a 20 inch barrel. The stock has been chopped to a pistol grip. It has been professionally done and custom carved to fit right into your hand. If you have ever done one you know it's challenging and time consuming. A picatinny rail has been fit and mounted on the foregrip. Because this shotgun is so small you can mount a front grip or possibly a flashlight for home defense. The wood furniture is in perfect condition, recently refinished. The finish on the metal is in great condition with minor wear. 

This shotgun is just big enough to stay out of class 2. It's overall length is just over 26 inches and has a 20 inch barrel so this is the smallest shotgun you can have without needing a class 2 weapons license. It is a blast to shoot and looks and functions great!

Up for sale is my M6A2 SPR. This rifle is perfect. Immaculate. The ""ferarri of AR's"" so to speak. One magazine fired thru it to ensure it worked. It comes with everything from the factory. Original box, warranty papers, cleaning kit ect. As well as a new in box Magpul MS 3 point sling and ergo grip, and 2 spare windowed Pmags. Below ill post the description straight from LWRCi.com

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

Considered by many to be the best AK-style rifle to make it into the US. The receiver, like the original AKs, was milled from a solid 6-pound steel forging in Bulgaria. The barrel is chrome-lined and cold hammer forged by Steyr. The SLR-95 is known for its accuracy - a rarity among AKs. This rifle has minor handling marks. Most notable is the scratch common with AKs where the safety rubbed against the receiver. The rifle has been shot rarely and well cared for. The barrel is in amazing condition and it shoots very smoothly. Because it's a milled receiver, it weighs in at approximately 7lbs 10oz unloaded and feels much more substantial than the stamped receiver AKs I've handled.  Thumbhole Stock replaced with ACE Sidefolder (US) and Traditional AK pistol grip (US) (ACE sidefolder can be set up to fold to either side). -Muzzle Brake removed. -Barrel threaded to proper AK 14:1 Left handed threads. - This sale includes: - Five (4) 30rd surplus steel magazines,"

Revenge Rifle scope
+ Redfield Lifetime Warranty
+ Fully Waterproof, shockproof and fog proof for a lifetime of rugged performance.
+ Fully multicoated optical system for maximum brightness in all light conditions.
+ Pop-up, resettable 1/4 MOA windage & elevation adjustments for quick and accurate zeroing or adjustment in the field.
+ European style fast focus eyepiece makes reticle focus easy to achieve and maintain.
+ Accu-Ranger Ballistic System for quick range estimation & precise long range shot placement.


Excerpt from Redfield Revenge's website:
Long Eye Relief
See your buck, target your buck. It’s easy with Revenge’s generous eye relief and Rapid Target Acquisition eyepiece. No more searching for the visual sweet spot when the shot is on the line.

Accu-Trac Adjustments
Precision, stainless steel, 1/4 moa finger-click windage and elevation adjustments let you quickly and easily zero your rifle on the range, and confidently correct for windage or elevation in the field. When combined with Redfield’s exclusive AccuPlex, you can quickly zero and place shots right on the money, even at long range.

100% Waterproof / Fogproof / Shockproof
These scopes are built to take anything Mother Nature can dish out: driving rain, sleet, ice and snow are no match for the rugged, airtight Revenge. Nitrogen processed maintubes stay bone-dry so the elements won’t dampen your hunt.

Impact Tested Reliability
Every scope we design gets put through its paces. Our tests dish it out to make sure every scope is tough as nails, fully waterproof and ready to hunt before they ever get to you.

Accu-Ranger Reticle:
As one of the first with bullet drop compensation, Redfield’s original Accu-Ranger pioneered the reticles we take for granted today. The new Accu-Ranger blends precise holdover points hunters need with a bold center that naturally leads the eye for fast shot placement at close quarters.
The reticle comes with precise aiming points that work with most popular hunting loads. For many standard cartridges simply sight in at 200 yards with the center crosshair, and the remaining hold points are dialed in up to 500 yards. The bottom of the circle intersects the vertical crosshair at the 300-yard aim point, the dot is your hold for 400 yards, and the bottom post provides a 500-yard aiming point. For faster, magnum-caliber rifles shooting light bullets, you can sight in at 300 yards and have hold points for 400, 500, and 600 yards.

Redfield Warranty
We build our Redfield riflescopes, sights, binoculars, spotting scopes and laser rangefinders to do their jobs. Day after day. Season after season. It’s what you expect for your hard earned money. If you ever have an issue, the last thing you need is backpedaling and passing the buck. That’s where our “No Excuses” Warranties come in. If you have a problem with your Redfield product, we will make it right. No Hassle, no excuses. That’s the Redfield way. See the Redfield support page for more details."

The FNX™-45 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

I have a gently used FN FNX 45. This pistol is incredible and I hate to see it go but its time for something different. The gun has only had a few mags through it and it is still in great shape. It shows minimal wear and functions flawlessly. When I bought it, I also got gander mountains extended warranty which I will transfer to the buyer. If there is ever any issues with this gun, take it to gander mountain and they will do whatever is necessary to fix or replace this gun. You don't have to worry about dealing with FN, you just go through gander mountain. This is also good for 1 free cleaning. I will also include the custom kydex holster I have and will add a TLR-1 weapon light. Otherwise, the box and all factory accesories and 3x mags  are included. Also, I will throw in 100 rounds of various hollow points, ball ammo and black talons."

The SW99 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. It is chambered in 9mm Para, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This mechanism differs with each variation of the action, which will be explained below. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety.  The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol, should the casing head rupture.
