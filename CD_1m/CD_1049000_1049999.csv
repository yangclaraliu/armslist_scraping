Our instructors are combat veterans and/or current active SWAT team members.  

We do not believe simply taking an NRA instructor class can prepare you to teach your students about real-world gunfighting and tactics.

We love what we do.  We train SWAT team members and we train first-time shooters.  We train hundreds of people every year, many who have never shot before.

We have ladies only classes.  Trust me on this one; you will be much happier if you get someone else to train your significant other to shoot or to play golf. We have loaner guns available for them to use in the class.

We believe that well trained individuals are much more likely to stop the next mass killing than any SWAT team is. Those nightmare scenarios are over long before SWAT gets on scene.

We appreciate those that shoulder the burden of protecting our children when we can not and we would be honored if you would choose us for your training needs.

CCW classes are on sale now for $99.00.  This includes time on the range with our instructor staff.  We teach as a team, you get hands-on training from guys that take your training seriously. 

If you are looking for a $49.00 training class from a guy that got his NRA certificate last week please keep looking. We are professionals, we carry guns for a living, and we think you deserve better training than that.

Please call us if we can help with your training needs, or visit our website for more information.

It has two blades, each with a safety switch that you push to release the blade. It is not a switchblade. I put it on E Bay and it quickly generated a lot of interest. The bidding was up to $50 when E Bay stepped in and removed the auction, claiming it was a switchblade, which it is not. It is in really good condition for it's age. The blades are solid, and you can tell they have been sharpened over the years. The handle is nice, too, with only a couple of marks on it, I guess from being in my grandfather's pocket for years!

Upper is used and has had around 7-800 rounds brought it without a single malfunction. Accuracy is excellent. Will come with a magpul mid-length handguard and a magpul flip up rear sight.  There are a few marks on the shell deflector but nothing that affects function and should be expected with any honestly used rifle upper. 

I'll also include the YHM phantom flash hider that's currently on the upper.

I have just received 5 more.  These will go quick.

I have a few Chinese Type 53's for sale.  All are in perfect working order with no cracks or any structural integrity damage.  All are listed as in NRA Good condition and all were handpicked from hundreds of rifles.  These are 40 inches in total length (carbine) and are much easier to carry to the range to handle than the Mosin Nagant M91/30 which is a whopping 48 inches long.  These each come in a cardboard box with the rifle only.

I have checked firing pin depth on all of these rifles and they are ready to shoot.  They will clean up very well as they have some dings and a sense of usedness to them (haziness in the butt stock which can be cleaned up with 0000 steel wool, discoloring of the bolt which again can be cleaned up with steel wool, etc).  The bolts on each of these should be torn down and cleaned along with a nice cleaning of the bore.  The cleaning of the bolt can be done with no tools.  All I have done is added some lube to the bolt to ensure you can at least feel the charging of the bolt.  Most of these rifles have many Russian manufactured parts on them which is a big plus.  

They have a permanently affixed side-folding bayonet, 5-round integrated box magazine, and fire the 7.62x54R round which can be found for dirt cheap.

I live in Downtown Atlanta and can sell locally or I can ship to your FFL for $20.00.  All were hand-picked out of the crates from my distributor.  The pictures look almost identical to the rifles I have in terms of condition and coloring.

All parts Colt, upper, lower, bcg. Has a TangoDown sling mount ($70) and QD sling I will include, as well as a 3-9 scope that still allows use of the iron sights.
Also comes with a 30 round pmag and a box of ammo.
If the price is right, I can include a TangoDown 30 round mag, and a black carry case.
These are currently going for over $2000 across the country for just the gun.
It shoots very smooth, as any 20"" Colt should, and is very accurate.
I was offered $1700 for just the gun a week ago, but turned it down because I was not sure I wanted to sell. I now have my eyes on another toy, and wanted to offer it to someone who wants to spend less than 2k on a rifle, but still end up with the quality of a Colt instead of some of the other rifles I am seeing on here.
Cash price is listed or best offer, may consider trades, especially semi 308s or single shot 50 bmg, but feel free to offer whatever you want."

DARK EARTH COLOR

Type ""F"" Traditional Double Action (Safety/Decocker combo lever)

The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol is the most advanced sub-compact sidearm of its kind. Built around Beretta's latest Px4 modular technology, the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. Available in two calibers (9mm and .40 S&W), the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system. A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant. The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable back straps (included). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. A reversible magazine release button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a smaller and larger size button (optional). An interchangeable slide catch can also be replaced with an optional extended profile configuration. A standard Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) allows for an array of after market accessories.

It was made in 1979 by Luigi Franchi S.P.A in Breschia Italy. This is a very rare rifle. Stories differ as you research the internet but there were 500 built in total or 5,000 built of which 3,000 were exporte3d or possibly 8,000 built with an unknown quantity exported. In any event, I've personally seen only this one in about 20 years of attending many gun shows. I purchased it fifteen years ago and aside from verifying function at the time, and again today, it has been in the safe the entire time. This rifle breaks into two pieces and fits in the original box which is a wooden box with olive drab canvas cover. It holds 10 rounds and feeds through the butt-stock.Comes with the original sling, original manual (in Italian), safety book, takedown tool, and allen wrench for the setscrew. The rifle is threaded at the muzzle and has the original flash-hider. The gun is beautiful and functions very well. I never have accuracy-tested it but the rifling in the barrel is still very defined. I'm assuming that since it's been a collectible gun from the start that it has seen very few rounds. The gun apparently was built in a small quantity to commemorate Italian Para-troopers. You won't find many like this one. Ironically, this rifle would break many of the rules in the proposed Feinstein legislation. Take-down, pistol grip, military-style butt-stock, adjustable rear distance slide military-style sights, threaded barrel for compensator or silencer, etc. If you need additional photos, I have plenty I can email."

Great Condition and beautiful wood and blue finishes.  This Italian-made handgun is both entertaining, attractive, and useful.  It is compact, and dead-accurate in my experience.  I love this thing, and am a little sad to see it go--problem is, I have too many and just don't shoot it often enough to justify hanging onto it.

Looking to downsize my AK collection so I have this for sell. I can assure you, this isn't bottom of the totem poll junk like the WASR 10's that are going for more than one K. The receiver is American made, built by Ohio Ordnance Works and is a later model that is fully heat treated and very tough. My opinion is that is it on par with Nodak Spud. The barrel is fully chrome lined and is also American made. From what I can tell, the rifle has all matching numbers except for the required number of American made parts to comply with 922-r. It features a Tapco AR style collapsing stock, Tapco G3 trigger group and Tapco slant muzzle brake. It comes with one Bulgarian Made steel 30 round magazine and Blackhawk sling. 

I am not looking to trade for anything at this time so cash only please.

I will require a bill of sell to be field out and proof of residency/eligibility for my own records prior to sell otherwise we will need to go through a dealer for transfer(you will be responsible for any transfer fees or sales tax). CPL and FFL holders preferred."

As stock, the AR-15 specs were:

Starts with one of our  chrome-lined Mil-spec steel barrels in the versatile M4 profile, mated to our forged aluminum upper, and finished off with a standard carbine hand guard, Pinned f-marked front sight post and A2 Flash hider.  The forged lower is built with our 6 position Mil-spec size 7075 buffer tube and PSA M4 stock, Standard PSA lower parts kit with A2 Grip and aluminum trigger guard.  The rifle is comes complete with a Magpul rear back up sight.  It comes with one 30 Round D&H Magazine (where allowed by law) so all you have to provide is the ammo to start having fun.

Barrel:  16"" chrome-lined mil-spec chrome moly vanadium barrel, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine gas system.   M4 style profile is phosphate coated to mil-specs, and is High Pressure tested, and Magnetic Particle inspected, to ensure quality and dependability.   Barrel is made for us by FN Manufacturing here in Columbia, and finished off with a standard carbine hand guard, pinned f-marked front sight post, and A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer, and are marked with the Palmetto State Armory logo on the left side, up front, just below the rail.

Lower:  These forged lowers are quality made using 7075-T6 aluminum and are marked ""MULTI"" for caliber.  Finish is Black Hardcoat Anodize per MIL-8625 Type 3 class 2.  7075 aluminum Mil-spec sized buffer tube is dry film lube coated on the inside, has 6 adjustment positions, is paired with a PSA M4 stock and has a staked castle nut.  Standard carbine buffer is Black anodized and has the PSA logo on the face.  Lower is finished with a A2 Grip and aluminum trigger guard.   Equipped with a standard PSA fire control group, the trigger has a smooth pull and clean break.

Since then I purchased the rifle, I've upgraded the AR-15 with an Adams Arms Piston kit.  The original AR-15 design is a direct gas impingement system which blows all the dirty hot gases from combustion back into the chamber and onto the bolt.  This means that your chamber and bolt are filthy by the time you're done shooting and you spend way too much time cleaning the thing.  With the Adams Arms piston kit, the AR-15 is now a piston driven AR-15 and the hot gases get pushed out the front of the rifle away from the chamber and bolt.  If you're ever fired the two side by side, it's like night and day.  You can shoot pretty much all day and your bolt will still be crazy clean and require only a quick wipe down and lube rather than the extensive take apart and cleaning with the classic AR-15 system.

Also upgraded is the grip to a Magpul MOE + grip which has storage compartment on the bottom and also has rubber coating for a more secure grip.  The stock has been upgraded to the Magpul CTR stock which is not only more comfortable, but also locks in place to prevent and movement.  The hand guards are also upgraded to Magpul for a more comfortable grip.  I'm also including an extra Adams Arms gas block and all the original stock parts as show in the photo.  Lastly, I'm including two more Magpul 30 round magazines with windows.

I will NOT ship the rifle anywhere.  If you want to buy it, we'll have to meet face to face.  I will not part the rifle out.  It's either all or none.  If you don't like something on the rifle, feel free to sell that part and replace it with something else.  I'm not interested in any trades at this time.  Lastly, if you're reading this listing, the rifle is still for sale.  

Lowball offers will simply be ignored.  First person who comes with the money, gets the rifle.  Simple as that.  Feel free to contact me to ask any questions, but most of the questions should already be answered above.

Oh, and before I forget, if you're legally not allowed to purchase or own this firearm (a.k.a. convicted felon, etc.), then please don't contact me about purchasing this."

Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

It shoots great and is in excellent condition. I've probably put around 500 rounds through it, but I keep all of my guns very clean and well taken care of. The Archangel kit is about as well built as the actual M4 stocks, and makes for a very cool little gun. It is a 6 point collapsible stock. Included will be the MagPul flip up sights, the BSA Sweet 22 scope, 3 25 rounds magazines, Butler creek magazine loader (not pictured), the Blackhawk Sportster AR-15 rifle case, and about 750 rounds of .22 ammo. I'm not really in any rush to get rid of this, just seeing what people are looking to trade for them really. Looking for a few things"
