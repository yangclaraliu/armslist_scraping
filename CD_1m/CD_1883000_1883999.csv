He gave me some extra money for my time and suggested I do this to help me pay for the AR-15 I've been saving up for. So I get up at the ass crack of dawn, stand in line and basically hope I get ammo. Some days I do and most days I don't. I'm telling you this so you understand why and what I'm doing. I have had one person be very offensive under the assumption I should sell my ammo for the store price or less. Apparently working for the money to buy my gun is a horrible thing for a young man to do. I guess some people would rather me steal it, borrow it or wish for it. I'm doing you a service. You need ammo and I'm doing the dirty work driving around to find it all morning while you sleep. If you don't like it, well I guess I'll see you in line at 5am. 

The following is what I have and the price I'm asking. Please feel free to make me an offer but I have these priced at what I see in the market for those of you that don't want to get up early and stand in line hoping they'll be getting them in. If you want store costs again I'll see you in line. If you want to offer me less feel free. Your helping me and I'm helping you.

There's a bit of a story here.  I picked up this pistol surplus on gunbroker.  Typical of these pistols, the finish was badly worn, but no rust or pitting and little signs of much use.  In other words, carried a lot, but used little.  This pistol came with black plastic grips with moderate wear (included).  I've replaced with a wooden set with much less wear.  The magazine safety has been removed (parts included) to attempt to improve the trigger pull.  The extractor spring has been replaced. I've had a quality refinish job to rival the best of the factory blue and the finish is 98% and looks factory. The only negative mechanically is the magazine fits tightly and will not drop free, yet functions well. This is an original 13 round FN magazine with an aluminum follower, probably from an older FN Hi-power.

I prefer to meet face-to-face, although my FFL will ship to your FFL for $35."

Brownings designs, and his genius shines through in every feature. The slim, stylish forged steel receiver and slender barrel takes down into two compact units without tools. The SA-22s tasteful engraving and select walnut make it an object of lasting beauty and enjoyment. Surely these rifles are meant to be enjoyed in the field as much as they are admired as heirlooms.

And just a pet peeve: If you sell, buy, or trade firearms learn the difference between a clip and a magazine. A clip (or stripper clip) loads a magazine and a magazine loads a firearm. You can not put a clip in a firearm and discharge the rounds. You can only do it with a magazine. You just sound ignorant when you say ""I have a 45 semi-auto with 5 clips for sale"" Clips are usually a few cents to a few dollars apiece. Magazines are $30 to $100 apiece ( I know drums are more). I'm sure crap firearms magazines are cheaper (don't shoot them don't know).Like I said just a pet peeve. lol"

That's $525 total but I'll take a loss for cash. Trade value should be about $500. Shoot me your trade offers as well! Willing to add a bit of cash for the right trade. This gun is immaculate. Thanks for looking!"

*The AF2011-A1 Double Barrel Pistol comes as the very first industrial double barrel semiautomatic pistol of all time 

* Less than 2400 available for 2013 

* One of the select few dealers in the nation 

* Blue with walnut grips 

* The gun can be handled by any shooter able to shoot with a .45 Acp and it is not only very pleasing, but very accurate and great fun. The AF2011-A1 holds amazing and surprising target performance for the shooter: in fact, it will group all the 8 double .45 caliber rounds (16 bullets) held in the duplex, single columns magazines, in a target of the size of an orange at 15 yards and of a water melon at 25. The stopping power of the AF2011-A1 is tremendous: 2 bullets for a total of 460 Grains weight impacting at 1 to 2 inches apart (depending on the distance of the target) will knock down a bull, while the whole 18 bullets, for a payload exceeding 4000 Grains, can be delivered to the target in about 3 seconds. The AF2011-A1 obviously features a number of very special parts, such as the single slide, the single frame, the single spur double hammer, the single grip safety, the single body double mainspring housing and the single double cavity magazine floor plate, the long and double magazine latch, the special barrel bushings and the hold open lever and side lever safety with long shafts: but the most interesting feature of the new pistol which we strived to keep during the development of the project, is the interchangeability of most internal parts, which come as standard 1911 replacement parts. These include the firing pins, the firing pins plates, the sears groups, the triple springs, the inner parts of the mainspring housings, the recoil springs and recoil springs rods, the magazine bodies and inner parts, the sights (including after market adjustable sights) the grips and grips screws and bushings.

200,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1883200,"For Sale:  Mathews LX ""MINT""","Bryan/College Station, Texas, United States",$ 600,"Listed On: Saturday, July 19, 2014",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Mathews LX Solo Cam with string silencers on each end of the string and Mathews roller guard system and its silky smooth, 29 inch draw, and 70 pound draw weight, with Trophy Ridge 5 Pin Sight with sight light, Trophy Ridge Stabilizer Bar, Bodoodle Arrow Rest, Scott Release, Alpine 5 Arrow Quiver, and 5 Beeman ICS Hunter 340 arrows that have never been shot, and an SKB Hard shell Bow Case! This bow is built to hunt!! I bought this bow in 2005 and it's been in the SKB case since then. I've taken it out and shot it 5 or 6 times but had to put it up after the fourth or fifth shot due to extreme pain back pain. The bow looks brand new with no scratches. It still has the original string on it and it's in perfect condition. I shot it through the chrono in 2005 and it shot 297 fps, and shot it again through the chrono at Gander Mountain where I work and got 282 fps, but that is due to string stretch. If I was to put a new string on it I believe the FPS would go back up in the 290's. THAT'S SMOKING FAST FOR A BOW AS SMOOTH AS THIS ONE!! I know it would make someone a great hunting bow!! This bow is so smooth, quite, and forgiving to shoot. I have included a 6 arrow group I shot at 20 yards with this bow, and it was the first time I picked this bow up in 4 years. I would put this bow up against ANY new Mathews bow on the market today, and if It didn't beat it, It would surely give it a run for its money! As an added BONUS I'm throwing in 22 Beeman 340 ICS Hunter Arrows with Blazer Vanes and 100 grain field tips for target practice!! These arrows are $6 each so 22 arrows X $6 = $132, the SKB case cost over $200 and the Scott Release was $60! To put it in a nutshell for you, I have over $1100 in accessories alone so you are getting the bow for free!! I have way over $1500 in this stuff folks and all of it is in mint condition. You just have to see it to believe it! When I say mint condition I mean brand new condition! Even the accessories are in brand new condition! I take real good care of my stuff! This is a good deal anyway you look at it and it's worth every dime of $600!! This will be my final price on this bow and accessories. A lot of the accessories are not listed in this ad!"

The land is not far from a reservoir just a few miles NW of one.  There you can use this land for whatever you desire within the confines of the law.  I had hopes of putting in a hunting cabin and a small dirt airstrip...career (Military) has changed and with current financial situations I need to sell this land to get out of some debts.  The land is currently just open range.  You have every right to go up and put in a fence if you so desire.  I was originally planning to go up a few summers back to plant 200+ trees but back to back deployments and being stationed in Hawaii stopped those plans.  This is a great piece of ground, something to pass on to the kids or grand-kids.  Asking 7,500    I will answer emails, not afraid to sift through junk/spam mail...they are too easy to spot.

The round count is only 25.... no wear, scratches, or idiot marks...

I have a Ruger SP101 in stainless, a truly beautiful weapon! Im fishing for trades, and i like quite a bit of different things. I would like to get ahold of a quality auto for this little pistol.

glock gen 4 only, unless its a gen 3 with lots of goodies... model 21,20,SF is a plus, 23,19, 31,32. FDE always makes me drool a little...
Sig, but no SP series. 
h&k usps, standard sights arent a deal breaker.
i will always pay attention to a 1911, but no ARMSCOR, RIA, or DAILY.

INCLUDED in the sale is 100 rounds of .38 spc for range enjoyment, and 50 rounds .357 HP 127 grain defensive rounds. Ammo is expensive and scarce these days, so this is a pretty dang good toss in extra!

also, i have a soft case, the original wood/rubber grips (the houge comfort grips are on it now) and a tactical tailor low pro holster.

please text offers to REDACTED... i will answer quickly and politely. ask me for pics, and i will send you some!

It currently has 172,460 miles on it. I purchased this truck in 2009 and am the 2nd owner. The interior is in good condition. Steering wheel and center counsel leather have the most wear. But, this is pretty common with all King Ranchs bc of the unique leather. Someone keyed the hood a few months back. Other than that it has pretty typical exterior scratches and chips for a truck. Small dent in back bumper so back up beeping sensor does not work. New front windshield. Newer tires, brakes, and alternator. Regular oil changes. Truck was used as a daily driver. Never really hauled anything with it or went off road. Comes with tonneau cover (non negotiable) an spray in bed liner. I use the tonneau cover during winters so it is off right now. Not many F150 King Ranchs come on the market for this price. Here is your chance to own on. Great looking truck overall. I love this truck and hate selling it but I need a car not a truck for my new line of work.

I am selling this gun on consignment. It is out of an old Indian Trading Post from Gallup, New Mexico where it has been stored in a vault for over 25 years. This gun is in superb (museum quality) condition. The gun is silver plated and fully engraved by Gustave Young who was Colt's premier engraver from the 1850s through the 1870s. He is often referred to as the Picasso of engravers. His ""signature"" mark is the dog/wolf head show here in photo #24. The gun's grips are ivory and it has all matching serial numbers. This gun was obviously a custom order gun made as a presentation piece. The back of the back strap was left blank where a persons name would have been engraved (see photo #29). I have been told the Confederacy ordered a small number of these Navy models at the beginning of the civil war to be used as presentation pieces. Because the serial number fits in that same time period it has been suggested that this could very well be one of those pieces? While we know very little about the history of this gun we do know it is extremely rare to find a silver plated Gustave Young engraved presentation gun for sale in this kind of condition. The gun is being offered with an on site inspection and approval by the buyer. It can be shipped registered mail but only after the buyer’s inspection, approval and payment has been made. Colorado buyers pay state sales tax. Email me with any questions. **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** All reasonable offers considered."

Serial number SH20028

This pistol was made late in 1981, .the barrel is off an ISU Olympic model, and that's were i'm assuming they got the grips.....the ISU's had aluminum slides and were often prone to wear, so it wasn't uncommon for people to swap out the match barrels to more sturdy models since the barrel assembly comes off with either a push button on more expensive models, or in this pistols case, the allen screw on the front of the trigger guard. even pieced together the barrel and grips are worth $400 on there own, 500 is a steal  if u know these guns u would agree if u want to run the serial number it's SH20028 
you have to be careful when pricing High Standard pistols, with literly hundreds of different models to choose from only way to get a accurate price is running the serial number which I did
these pistols were built strictly for Bullseye and Olympic style target shooting, and were the standard before all the free pistols started to trickle in. MANY Olympic shooters still use them to this day it has 1 scratch that's noticeable ( see pic) blueing is in good shape and it shoots amazing its insanly accurate $$$650  text or email only REDACTED

I have a great XD.45 that has the kit included. I only have used the reloader and the holster and magazine holder have sat there. 

--  It will come with a BlackHawk SERPA holster which was used very rarely. I used it while at the range only. 

--Along with the BlackHawk holster, I will also add in my Uncle Mikes cloth holster which was used more often when carrying. 

--Lastly, I have around 85 rounds that will do me no good after it is gone, so they will be yours as well.

My gun has had around 400 rounds though it and the barrel looks like a mirror. I have only shot fmj copper and brass target rounds.

I would be willing to do a trade, but I am looking for something valued the same. I am not looking to add $300 cash for your AR. I am not looking for your .22 and then you will give me cash as well. You are more than welcome to offer them, but most likely I will turn them away. I am always up for surprises so if you have something amazing, I could be interested.

Please use the contact seller as I don't want spam.

I will require a permit to carry or purchase and ID. The usual stuff."

I do love this handgun and with it being a gen 4 it's rare to have in California if your not law enforcement. I acquired this gun through a PPT and have 200 flawless rounds down range. I installed a Ghost 3.5 pound trigger in it due to the fact that the gen 4 triggers are a little rough. I have 2 9 round mags that have the Peace Extension Grips already installed.
