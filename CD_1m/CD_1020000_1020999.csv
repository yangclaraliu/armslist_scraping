Beauitiful gun!  He has put about 300 rounds through it and it has functioned flawlessly and is a tack driver.  A gunsmith could easly convert it to shoot 9mm which was his plan but it got sidetracked.  A trigger job was done and it breaks at about 3lbs.  The only thing he ""thinks"" it needs is a better pair of sights.  Most competitive shooters like us prefer adjustable sights.  He shot it today 2/8 and like I said its a tack driver.  See a pic of the target below.  That is a five round group bench rested at 33 feet.  With the ""sweet"" trigger the rest would be up to you!
Taurus seems to go all out on delux options with an Extended Ambi-saftey, a grip saftey with a ""turdle"" or the popular ""hump"", and an extended slide release. Kim-pro extended base pads were installed on the two magazines.  He also installed a nice pair of finger notch skinny grips which give you a secure hold.   He has shot it in two matches without one jam or any other issue but has decided to go with 40cal.  If you are looking for a 1911 look no further.  See this before you buy anything else.  38 super is the same cost to reload as 9mm once you aquire some brass.  One hundred rounds of ammo will be included with this pistol.  I'm right across the bridge and close to the freeway.  Great gun for the money.

This is a LOCALLY MADE(which means MADE IN USA) Black Rain Ordinance Ar-15 that is used but in spectacular condition. If you are looking at this post than you realize that you are looking at the best of the best in Ar 15s. Not only are the Ar 15s getting harder and harder to get the the BROs are even harder to get. It comes equipt with a Trijicon ACOG scope(which is top of the line as well) So when you send an offer please understand what you are looking at. This setup is done really well and has the best of everything on it. 

The clamshell case and the soft carry case is included. I will seperate the AR and ACOG as well I will sell without the clamshell case. I will be listing this rifle on GB as well which is the reason for the $1 price tag. Respectful offers will get respectful answers. 

I am not really interested in any trades but will entertain them. Please do not offer me $1000 credit on your $500 gun. Please do not hesitate w any questions. Please text when possible so I can get back as time allows. Or better yet even email, thank you.    REDACTED

I am listing on armslist so to give someone a chance that does not have a gunbroker account to MAKE AN OFFER. I will say that the rifle alone is going for over $2500 on GB w/o the $1200 ACOG. and those have less than this one.
