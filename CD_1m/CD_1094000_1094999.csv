        The subject of this review is my own Bushmaster XM-15-E2S that was made in Windham, (I got mine!).  It is an A3 model with an A2 style fixed buttstock,  handle sight, 20 inch heavy barrel with 1 turn in 9 inch twist rifling, bayonet lug, birdcage flash suppressor and it came with a 30 round magazine. 
    This Bushmaster rifle is chambered for .223 Remington and 5.56mm NATO rounds and is marked as such, so both may be safely used.  I don't recommend that these rounds be used interchangeably in any firearm that is not specifically marked for both.  There are many that believe that the .223 Remington and the 5.56mm NATO round are the same but in fact they are not.  According to Small Arms Manufacturers Institute, Inc, (SAAMI), it is unsafe to fire 5.56mm NATO rounds in firearms chambered for .223 Remington.  If you do a little Google searching around the Internet you can find the technical information related to that subject if it interests you.  Be careful and only use the ammunition your firearm is designed to fire safely."

Who is buying the companies manufacturing guns???   For the last several years a company called The Freedom Group has been buying up gun and ammunition manufacturers.  Some of the companies are Bushmaster, Marlin, Remington, DPMS, Dakota Arms and H&R.  Some people worry that this Freedom Group is going to control most of the firearms companies in the United States.  If you control the manufacturers you can decide to stop selling to civilians. What a perfect way to control guns.  Now if you do some digging you will see that The Freedom Group is owned by a company called Cerberus Capital Management.  Guess who controls Cerberus???  GEORGE SOROS, Obama's chief financier!!  He wants to restrict or ban all civilian guns. 

Please pass this on to all your freedom loving friends.  This needs to come out.  Why have we not heard about this in the ""mainstream"" media?  I would think this would be BIG news.  (Soros also owns Progressive Insurance).  If you don't know who George Soros is, you need to do some research.  This One-World Government atheist backed Obama with millions of dollars and Obama is a puppet on a string controlled by Soros. Send this to every gun owner you know!"

Scope mount included. Here is the specs:


The AK-54R rifles are built upon Category 1 (nice, minty, un issued) Romanian PSL rifle parts kits, using a special receiver that allows for the use of regular AKM type butt stocks and pistol grips. They also feature a correct, and fully functional, scope mount, installed on the left side of the receiver . The barrel is shortened to 16.5 inches, and is re-profiled, allowing the gas block and handguard retainer to be moved rearward, so that standard AKM length gas pistons (we use a Tapco stainless unit, which provides an extra 922r compliance part) and standard AKM type handguards can be used! The idea is simply to give the end user an AKM sized package that delivers the powerful punch of the 7.62x54R cartridge. This initial batch of rifles will feature a non-pinned Romanian PSL muzzle device, on 14x1 LH threads, K-VAR synthetic furniture, in plum, beautiful gun kote finish . 

These are very hard to come by. Plus the ammo is still affordable. I can add ammo for the right deal. More pics upon request. No trades 1500 OBO. Buyer must have IN DL and LTCH. FTF in Indy area."

COLORADO BUYERS: Colorado House Bill 1224 HAS PASSED. Magazines over 10 round capacity will no longer be legal to be sold in Colorado once the bill is signed into law. MAGAZINES OVER THAT LIMIT THAT ARE PURCHASED BEFORE THAT SIGNED INTO LAW DATE ARE LEGAL. YOUR TIME IS VERY LIMITED BEFORE THESE WILL NO LONGER BE SOLD IN COLORADO.

These are the real deal, they are NOT aftermarket magazines or plastic clones but genuine US government military issue magazines from the prime contract supplier (Center Industries), manufactured to military specifications (MILSPEC). Tan followers, non-reflective finish, ALL METAL with polymer follower. Do show usual manufacturing, assembly and quality control markings (scratches from insertion in tooling for assembly and function checking), but are all still factory sealed. Factory tight springs.

Will consider reasonable offers for BULK purchases, priced at local rates over the last 19 weeks and PRICE WILL ADJUST WITH MARKET RATES IN COLORADO. NOT priced against cheap knock-offs, clones, or immitation, low-grade and poor quality magazines...they are not caparable.

At least one magazine remains available as long as this listing is active."

You look at the pics and be the judge.  You could easily club someone with these mags!  Since they have some slight surface rust, but still function flawlessly (I tried 5 of them in my Poly Tech AK this morning), I'm selling for less than market value.  I'm sure you could refinish if you want.  Just look at how thick the steel is!!  No plastic mag will be as durable as these.  I'm going to sell one case of them to fund another firearm purchase I want to make.  $25 each if you want 1 of them or 50 of them.  You clean the surface rust and oil.  No guarantees as to how many will be left when you call though.  Similar mags with no surface rust but the heavy steel build like these have sold on Gunbroker for over $75 each."

The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. Figure 1 shows the trigger at full rest. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point shown in figure 2. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.

This is the most perfect example of an extremely well made SKS.  It comes w/ the  manufacturing report, and has signatures of various departments during manufacturing process.  Totally unmolested and completely original. All #'s match, even the stock.
I don't read or understand Russian or Albanian so I'm taking the word of the guy I bought it from who brought it back from the Eastern Block.
One look at this rifle and you will understand the high quality this rifle was produced under.  
The book that comes w/ the rifle has several pages of official stamps and signatures I believe to be inspectors sign off.
Also included is the original canvas carrying case.
This rifle has been stored in a humidity controlled safe and has not been fired except at the factory.
