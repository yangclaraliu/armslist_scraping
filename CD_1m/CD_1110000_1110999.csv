Arsenal/Molot VEPR 7.62x39 Caliber Rifle, Walnut Stock 

Autoloading Hunting Rifle Version. Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

Vepr in 7.62x39 caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 16” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.

Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. They are shipped with two 10-round magazines."

They lock the slides open like they're supposed to on the last shot; they free-fall eject correctly; and most important, they are always reliable, even with months of staying loaded.  The buttplates to these genuine Mec Gar 20 round magazines for the Smith & Wesson 59 and 5900 series 9mm pistols are classic polymer, virtually identical to the factory S&W floorplates issued for the past 25 years. Body construction is Blue Steel. Factory code is MGSW5920B. Most of us are aware that Smith & Wesson Magazines will fit into battery just fine on Daewoo DP51 Pistols. These magazines also fit some variants of the Kel-Tec Sub 2000 carbine, but only the ones made to accept Smith & Wesson 9mm Magazines. They also fit the Marlin Camp 9 carbines.

This gun was bought new by my Grandfather.  Found it in my grandmas closet with a box of shells.  6 cartridges  missing out of a box of 50.  From the looks of the gun I am guessing thats all that was shot through this gun.  I  shot 4 more of the cartridges and the main hammer spring broke.  I ordered new spring and installed last week.  Shot 6 more cartridges with no problems.  Gun and holster are in almost BRAND NEW condition.  I do have 34 .32long cartridges to go with the sale of this gun.

Up for auction is a brand new Barrett model 98B in .338 lapua magnum. This rifle is brand new in box and comes with a harris bipod. The USO scope and rings have been sold and are no longer available.

Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. Designed to adapt to a user’s every need, this revolutionary precision rifle offers long-range performance that others can only dream of.

Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it’s not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.

Thanks to its modular layout, this rifle can be adapted to fit each user’s exact needs. Its straight-line design, running from the muzzle to the shooter’s shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip. This allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a fresh round into the chamber as the bolt silently glides through a polymer guide.

The Model 98B rifle’s aluminum upper receiver boasts an 18-inch M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions.

This impressive long-range weapon isn’t all work. Equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod, it’s also a pleasure to shoot. From its highly efficient muzzle brake to its shooter-adaptable design and unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

The deal I had made for this gun has fallen through, the buyer was a no-show. You know who you are! Thanks for wasting my time and Gas!!  I also lost all the e-mails that have been sent to me in the last few weeks due to system issues.  Finally, I respectfully ask that you not ask if the gun is available. If the posting is active then so is the gun.  i will immediately, remove the postin once the deal is finalized. Just send an offer with your initial email,  the worse I can say is ""No thanks"".   So here goes, I'm going to try one more time....

I have lightly used Sig Mosquito .22 LR with less than 400 rounds thru. It is the tactical version with a threaded barrel. It also comes with all the accessories including additional front sights and a spare recoil spring along with the case and all paperwork. I bought for my son who really doesn't like going to the range very much so its been sitting in my safe. It has never had an issues and has been cleaned after every use.

I will also throw in 400 rounds of the impossible to find CCI mini-mag 22 LR ammo."

This particular Zastava AK pistol came with white un finished wood that was badly stained with black grease and the wood badly scratched.  The weapon is also hand waxed to remove all the oxidation leaving the black metal perfect and smooth as well as adding protection. All components are taken down and hand polished as well as properly oiled before assembly. You can see the finished product with Russian Red Wood. This is a two day process and a two day turn around. Cost would be about $100 dollars and the transformation is amazing. Also pictured are three 1963 Romanian mags. The finished one was badly pitted and rusted out. The rust was removed and the mag taken all the way down and all inperfections removed. The mag is then primeredand a proper finish baked on. The spring and follower as well as the base plate also done the same way or polished to a high luster resembling chrome.  The mag restoration would run about $40 dollars depending on the extent of the rust. This is something you would do to a high end vintage mag. I have a few that are worth several hundred dollars now but purchased for $20 dollars full of surface rust. They now work and look better than new. I will be more than happy to look at your weapon or mags and give you a quote, its free but can make a big difference and increase the value of your weapon dramatically.  Nothing sits here.I will have your weapon done and back in your hands in no more than two days."

Factory packaged, unopened, untampered with 9mm brass ammunition. I'm interested in respectable brands like Federal, Winchester, Remington, and PMC - just to name a few. 

What I'm not looking for: No reloads/home made ammo. No steel or aluminum case ammo. And no garbage brands such as TulAmmo (I like my firearms to work). 

I'm also not going to pay an outrageous amount for simple handgun ammo. It disgusts me to see so many sellers out there trying to off load their 9mm ammunition for $.45, $.50, $.60 or more per round. That is absolutely RIDICULOUS! There is no reason for those kinds of asking prices. And those that ARE paying those prices are only making the ammo shortage situation WORSE! 

So, if you want to do a little business and sell off some of your surplus 9mm ammunition, let's talk. If you're trying to get rich by selling your ammo for 200%-300% more than what its worth, maybe you can go ask your fellow Obama lovers to buy it. Because you're NOT getting rich off of me!"

The war eagle stampings on the stock are in excellent condition as well as the rest of the stock. There are minor dents here and there on the stock, but none that have broken through the wood fiber and could be steamed out if desired. The bolt and Magazine floor plate are electro penciled and has some minor rust under the wood as to be expected on an old rifle, but the action is smooth and locks up great. The price is firm at $400 as it includes a 20 round box of Wolf Gold 8mm Mauser. Thanks for looking, let me know if you have any questions."

It has a sopmod stock.  It is shown with an authentic  eotech 512 holographic sight, and a utg (I think) side flip magnifier. I will sell the rifle for $1600 without the sight and magnifier, which is about what I have in it without the inflated scare pricing. $2100 with the optics.  I am pretty firm at those prices.  I will also include one new pro mag 30 round magazine. Face to face only, I will not ship. I can take partial or even full credit card payment for 3% extra, with a credit card reader for my iphone.
