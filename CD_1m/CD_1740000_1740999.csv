They are 265 Grain lead bullets, 770 feet per second with 349 foot pounds at the muzzle. These rounds will fit the British Service Revolver #1 (Mark I, Mark II, Mark III, Mark IV, Mark V and Mark VI) and other revolvers that shoot 455, 455 Eley, and 455 Webley Mark II. 

Made in Montreal, Canada from Virgin Brass. Primers are oil proof and non-corrosive. 

No international sales.  A flat rate of $12.00 in 48 states.  All others, there will be an additional $5.00. 

These rounds are very very clean. They have been kept in a cool dry place over the years.  I can't guarantee if they will fire because of their age.  My opinion is that they fire just fine, but I'm no professional. 

LEGAL LIABILITY STATEMENT: You must have ammo inspected by a qualified professional if you intend to shoot it.  Your purchase releases the seller of all liabilities both real and/or intangibles. 

$70.00 is a Great price.  So, the price is firm. Serious inquiries please text or call. Leave message if no answer. Thanks!

This rifle is a carbon copy of what is in use in Russia today, a top of the line AK. I've decided to move in a different direction, and as such, want it to go to a good home. I have 6 magazines (30 rounders) in addition to the factory five rounder. Paper work is with it including the test target. It's in mint condition, save for the safety selector line that all AK pattern rifles will get. I'm not trying to profit from the inflated prices due to this panic. Included is 120 rounds of ammunition, as well. 

This IS a Russian AK, own the legend. CHL holders get priority, no felons, must be face to face close to Columbus, and at least 18 years old. Will also sign a bill of sale."

""As the USP was developed the pistol underwent much rigorous testing. The barrel is cold-forged from chromium steel for increased life. The USP barrels are a polygonal profile to further increase muzzle velocity and barrel life. During testing, a bullet was deliberately lodged in a USP barrel. Another cartridge was then fired into the obstructing bullet. The second bullet cleared the barrel, resulting in a barely noticeable bulge. The pistol was then fired for accuracy and the resulting group measured less than 4 inches at 25 meters.""

""Temperature testing required the USP be frozen to −42 °C and fired, frozen again, and then thrown into a vat of flaming oil, cleaned up and then fired. These temperature tests were continually repeated with no adverse effects on the USP. Then the USP was thrown onto a busy highway. Several cars and trucks ran over the USP over the course of several hours. The USP was then recovered and fired with no adverse effects. Subsequently, the USP was tied to the back of a vehicle and towed for 5 miles over concrete at speeds up to 75 mph. The USP was then recovered and fired with no adverse effects. ""

""The gun was also subjected to NATO MIL-SPEC mud and rain tests, which were passed without difficulty. Water immersion and salt spray also presented no problems. German Navy combat divers have used the USP for two years without any signs of corrosion.""

""Safety testing exceeded the ANSI/SAAMI requirements adopted in May 1990. These included dropping a USP with a primed cartridge and decocked hammer on a variety of hard surfaces without discharging. The USP surpassed these commercial requirements, as well as German Army and police tests, including repeated drop tests from six feet (1.8 m), hammer first, onto a steel backed concrete slab. Proof round firing resulted in no cracks, deformations, or increase in head space. Attempts to fire the USP pistol with an unlocked breech proved unsuccessful.""

""The USP was given unloaded to a bunch of homebuilders to use in place of hammers. The USPs were used for 5 days straight to hammer nails into new homes. The USP was then recovered and fired with no effect on accuracy or operation.""

""Testing with a variety of ammunition proved the USP meets these high standards. During the USP testing phase, it was shown the recoil-reduction system reduces the force on the USP grip to approximately 300 newtons (67 pounds-force). Peak force shock on competing .40 caliber polymer and metal framed pistols was around 5,000 newtons (1,100 pounds-force)."

The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Also most of the firearms that have been called out by this person include ammo, extra magazines or other accessories. Please don't throw stones at someone that can afford something you can't.

The upper halves of the two pistols are interchangeable, meaning you can get 4 different configurations for the price of 2. Also, the 5 inch barrel works in the 4 inch slide, although there is no practical reason to do this, it looks badass. Also, this makes a total of 6 functioning pistols! If that’s not enough, I have a 20 lb recoil spring for the 5 inch upper. This allows you to fire the excellent .45 super loading. The springfield XD .45 is one of the most robust designs on the market. Many people use the .45 super in XD’s with no modifications and no issues. However, I prefer to only fire it in the 5 inch upper with the extra power spring. The extra power spring also works well with standard loadings and softens the recoil. I will also include the factory 18.5lb recoil spring. I have fired 150 rounds of .45 super through the 5 inch slide with no signs of overpressure or additional wear. Both pistols have been used for CCW and show some cosmetic wear. Both pistols are barely broken in with about 1,000 rounds through each. Both pistols have always functioned flawlessly.

You can use Nikon's website or app for the Spot On ballistic match technology which helps you understand all the ballistics on different grain ammo and field charts for your exact set up. I have put in some pretty tight groupings at 300 yards. I have the receipt($2,138.06) of everything I bought for this rifle(proof of how great of a deal this is), also showing date of purchase(recent). I'll sell the complete set-up for $1,900. I will sell the Rifle with the factory trigger and buffer spring and the scope mounted with rings for $1,400. Price is firm. Do not email offers of cash lower then what I have posted. If it doesn't sale, it wont break my heart. Email me for more information.

I do not have the box or brush etc.....all I was given when I purchased the gun several years ago was the gun and magazines

Come with 4 magazines 2 - 10 round glock mags and 2 - 15 round glock mags

Also included is 135 round of 9mm Remington 155 grain brass ammo
and 40 round of Blazer 115 grain steel casing ammo

The gun shows a little holster wear but over all is in great condition, it has always been cleaned after each shoot.

Reason for selling: I have had this gun for several years and it has never once jammed or malfunctioned and I absolutely love it, however at this time it makes sense for me to sell it. Reason one is that I prefer to carry my M&P shield .40 and the glock just sits in the safe. Reason two is because I just recently bought a new guitar and need to finish paying if off. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the gun!

Yes I understand that you can go buy a new glock for under six hundered dollars (if you can find them that is) however those would not come with the extra mags and ammo...also gen 2 is harder to find

I work a lot and usually weird hours, so I will do my best to respond in a timely manner.

With the above being said, I am in no HURRY to sell, but would defiantly like to.
No trades please. 

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you!

INFO STRAIGHT FROM DD: The Daniel Defense LightWeight Package, part of our comprehensive line of Professional Operator Solutions, is built to meet the continually evolving rigors and requirements of today’s Law Enforcement mission. This package includes the Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, V5 Lightweight with our Cold Hammer Forged lightweight profile barrel, the new Daniel Defense DDM4 Rail™ 12.0, mid-length gas system and is perfectly outfitted with an Aimpoint Patrol Rifle Optic (PRO), fixed front & rear sights and MAGPUL PMAGS. The DDM4v5 LW is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimmed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This is one of the many features that create a rock solid platform that can be reliably counted on to deliver superior duty rifle service. The continuous flat top in conjunction with fixed front & rear sites and an Aimpoint PRO optic combination provides for a maximum field of view in regard to the suspect or target area, as well as the backdrop / potential round impact area. In other words, the operator can better observe and evaluate the down range area under stress, fatigue, low light situations and inclemement weather conditions.

I have a Like New FNH FNP 45 Black Tactical for sale. I only shot 3 mags through this pistol. These 45's have less felt recoil than a regular 40 from other manufacturers. It has been cleaned right after shooting and sat in my safe ever since. I am selling a couple of my pistols because all they have been doing is sitting in the safe. This is in like new condition. Never holstered. Comes with everything that it came with from factory. 3 15 rnd mags, case, changeable back straps, manual, spent casing from factory, lock, etc. This is a beautiful handgun. If from IL you must have a valid FOID card.

$1300 Cash.
