This is not your average imported AK-47 and is not comparable to your average AK-47 in any way.  100% American Made! No imported parts! Century is the only company making an all U.S. made AK! The Centurion 39 Sporter’s milled receiver is machined from an 11 pound block of 4140 ordnance quality steel. Instead of adjusting for windage from the front sight like other similar rifles, the rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. Other features include a buttstock that is 1 inch longer than military style stocks, for better comfort and handling. The upper and lower handguard have four Picatinny rails which can be used to accessorize the Centurion 39 with red dot sights, scopes, lights, lasers and a fore grip. Barrel: 16.5” with a 1:10 twist, Overall: 37.25”, Weight: 8.2 lbs.

This is number 16 of a 200 gun production run made specially for the Rhode Island State Police in the early 1970's. After receiving the firearms, the troopers determined that they prefered the 4"" barrel. They returned 198 of the guns to the distributor. (The govenor kept #1 and his driver kept #2.) Smith & Wesson made them 200 new model 66's with the 4"" barrel but refused to put the lanyard swivel. The distributor sold the remaining 198 original guns in the late 1970's. This is the only stainless steel gun that S&W ever made with a lanyard swivel.

This near perfect firearm comes in the original metal cornered box with the owner's manual, parts list, all paperwork and the S&W cleaning kit."

It is has a five round capacity but does not include a 5round en bloc clip.  I have fired the rifle and everything works great accept that the clip ejector releases but does not forcibly eject the spent clip.  As to the condition of the rifle I would say that it is clearly a used military rifle and thus has repairs to the stock and non-matching numbers from being taken apart and cleaned.  All around it is a great piece of history and would look great hanging in a man cave, trophy room or out at the range.

I also have around 500 rounds of military ammunition.  Keep in mind that the ammunition is also very old and so there will likely be misfires and hang fires........The price we pay as die-hard collectors!  The ammunition is on 24 round stripper clips used on the Hotchkiss machine gun, however,  can be popped off for shooting in this rifle.

I am asking 60 cents per round ($60 per 100) for the ammunition though I will make a deal if you buy the rifle or a large amount of ammo.

Thanks for looking and let me know if you have questions or want more pictures.

It has many unique features beyond a traditional 226

#1: This is a railed, German-made pistol - the proof marks and prized triple serial numbers are present. German-made versions with a rail are exceptionally rare - railed variants are typically only the lower-quality American versions.

#2: The slide, controls, and internals have been sent out to ROBAR for their NP3 treatment. For those of you unfamiliar with it, it's essentially a chrome/teflon coating that makes it impervious to rust/weather. It's amazing - I find that cleaning only needs to consist of wiping a cotton cloth across it, the residue falls off.

Comes with:

Original hard case
Bright Sig night sights
Six 18 round mags
One 20 round mag

*Note - these mags will be illegal to purchase after July 1st, and there will be no more private sales of guns after that either*

I'm not in a hurry to get rid of this. It's smooth as silk in it's functionality, and deadly accurate out to 25 yards. I just have come to the conclusion that it's going to be too large for practical carry for me (I'm skinny), and I will probably always be a die-hard Glock fan."

It comes with 2 magazines that hold 19 rounds each plus1 in the chamber. These magazines will not be available in CO here soon. I am asking 800 obo on this gun. Feel free to contact me via text or call me at REDACTED.
Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M) series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface."

When someone wanted a gun to put in the drawer and probably never fire it we steered them over to the ""Bargain Basement"" and sold them an RG. Those guns always made me laugh with their thin blueing (?) and shiny plastic grips. Some of them you would pull out the cylinder pin, remove the cylinder and use the pin to poke out the empties. Brilliant designs, I fired one once and it spat back at me and pierced my earlobe with a sliver of lead. They actually made a .44 Mag but I was afraid to fire it. I'm feeling nostalgic and figure there has to be some of those old RG's out there I can play with. I'm looking for servicable ones (as servicable as can be) and I'll pay a fair price or trade.

Cheap flat-rate shipping: $7.95  (free shipping over $150, (use promo code: freeship150)

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance.


The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers (sold separately). Manufactured in four molded-in colors: Black, Flat Dark Earth, Foliage Green and Olive Drab. Made in the USA.

High-quality stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance

Textured gripping surface and flared floorplate for positive magazine handling

Robust floorplate for increased drop protection, easily removable for field maintenance and cleaning

NOTE: NOT compatible with Armalite AR-10B, Noveske N6, Springfield Armory M1A, Rock River Arms LAR8, FN SCAR 17S or any other rifles that utilize M14, FN FAL, or HK 91/G3 patterned magazines.

*NOTICE: PMAG 20LR COMPATIBILITY WITH LMT MWS RIFLE A potential compatibility issue has come to Magpul's attention regarding the PMAG 20LR magazine when used in a limited number of 7.62 NATO caliber LMT MWS weapon systems. When the PMAG 20LR is inserted into the magazine well, some MWS rifles exhibit interference between the bolt catch and the rear of the magazine. This can cause partial engagement of the bolt catch and result in unintentional contact between the bolt carrier group and the bolt catch during normal weapon operation. Although this issue has only been reported by a very limited number of end users, Magpul has introduced a slight modification to all new production PMAG 20LR magazines to eliminate any potential for bolt catch interference,"

I have a 1st generation iPad 3G 32GB that has been jailbroken. I installed some apps and software to make the iPad even better. This iPad gets free movies, free music, free apps and this iPad can be used as a fully functioning cell phone. That's right! You can install your sim card and make calls right from the iPad. This iPad makes and receives cellular calls with your sim card not VOiP calls like other iPads. If you have a data plan on your current cell phone you can put that sim card in this iPad and surf the web on 3G and still make and receive calls! This is a really cool iPad. I currently have it on T-mobile's prepaid unlimited plan and it works great. If you too would like T-mobiles prepaid unlimited plan I have an extra t-mobile sim activation kit I bought online. I forgot I bought one online and went to the Walgreens and bought one so I have two now. This iPad blows my friends away when I put their sim in it use the web and make a call. They find it hard to believe that I can make cellular calls with my iPad. You don't have to hold it to your head and look funny. The calls are on speaker phone or you can use ear buds.

This is a reliable and quality shotgun and I am sad to see it go, I just need the cash right now. I am original owner and have only put 24 rounds through this shotgun.

The ghost ring sights on this shotgun are some of the best sights I have used (I have carried guns in my profession for many years and have served as a weapons and tactics training instructor) they make for quick target acquisition and are very accurate.

The Benelli M2 is a 12 gauge Semi Automatic Inertia Driven Shotgun. Inertia Driven action uses the recoil energy to cycle the action. This eliminates all the problems associated with gas-operated systems, such as the necessity of frequent cleaning and the tendency gas-operated systems have for malfunctioning during adverse weather conditions. This is the definition of reliability. 

This gun holds 5+1 rounds

This Benelli M2 also comes with Chokes IC, M, F and wrench. No box or manual to go with this sale.

It has about 20 Sabot's through it and that was range time only.  It is in excellent, like new condition. 

You will receive all the original parts (stock, forend, magazine cap, mag spring, etc) so you can return the 870 back to bone stock if you so desire and sell off all the extras to make some money.   

First off, this 870 is badass, no crap parts, no hang-ups, just brutal reliability.  I'm a shotgun guy, I like them, I have a few of them.  This one was at the bottom of the totem pole and I have my sights set on another project at the moment so I'm letting it go.  Also, the 18"" smooth bore has zero rounds through it, it is brand new.  The 20"" riffled barrel has the 20rds I mentioned above on it....also, pretty much brand new.  This has well over $600 just in parts installed on it, let alone the $350 for a new 870, so please, no low-ball offers.

Parts installed and what I paid:
Blackhawk! GenII Knoxx Recoil Reducing Stock (this works awesome one 3"" Sabot's) $130 (also from Vance's), Knoxx kit comes with the Blackhawk! forend.  
Brand New 18"" Smooth Bore (Cylinder) 2 3/4""-3"" Chamber Remington Barrel $140 (Cabela's Polaris)
Blackhawk! Night-Ops Gladius LED Flashlight $200 (3 settings: User Adjustable, Tactical Strobe, and Max Brighness)
Vtac QD/Clip-in rail mount forward sling point $35
Viking Tactics 1"" rail/light mount $30
B-Square Shotgun Saddle Optic/Holo/Red-dot mount $50 
Nordic Components Barrel/Mag Clamp with 2 rails $60
TacStar +3 870 Magazine Extension $65 (Gander Mountain) 
Nordic Components High Performance Mag Spring $15
Remington High-Vis Mag Follower $5
20"" Remington Fully Riffled Barrel (Original Barrel) 

Total for parts is roughly $730 without Tax, Shipping, etc.
Total for what I paid to put it all together: $1080

Also, this has 7 sling attachment points.  3 on the stock (1 QD, 1 Clip-in, 1  1 3/4""), 1 on the Receiver (So you can run single-point), and 3 on the Barrel/Mag Clamp (1 QD, 1 Clip-in, 1  1 3/4"").  Not only is is versatile on ammo (Sabot Slugs, Riffled Slugs, 00Buck, HV Field, ....pretty much anything for 2 3/4""-3"" Chamber) but versatile to carry as well.  You can run it single or double with one sling.  

So, I'm knocking about $630 off what I have in it because I put 20 rounds through it and want to get it moving quick.  Thanks for looking.  I'll also throw in the case and BoreSnake Extreme (pictured).

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Blackwood: A natural stainless steel slide and black hard coat anodized alloy frame are paired
with Hogue Blackwood grips.

The bluing in the gun is great minus the few little spots on the cylinder. The bore is bright as can be and the rifling is flawless. Beautiful looking and functioning.

989,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1651989,For Sale:  LaRue Covert Rifle Case MkII,"Lodi, Madison, Wisconsin",$ 169,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 29, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"LaRue Covert Rifle case in foliage green, same color as pictured. Brand new condition, comes with everything from factory including all the dividers and straps. This is the newer edition MkII. I bought this after waiting 4 months on backorder, but have since went a different direction, just looking to get what I have in it out, which is $170 since LaRue charges almost $20 for shipping alone. I'd prefer FTF, but if needed to ship, that would be an additional $20. 

From LaRue:
LaRue Covert Rifle Case, MkII
We took the Covert Case to a whole new level.

Based on feedback from our customers, we decided to upgrade the old covert case with a variety of enhancements. We’ve made them an inch and a half wider, and an inch deeper. These dimensions may sound small, but they provide the needed room to easily add longer barrel-length uppers (like 18”) and also position uppers vertically (to save room). We replaced the mesh pockets with a 10” x 7” Velcro loop panel and a 9” x 7” pocket. The loop panel provides a base for a variety of hook-backed accessories. The pocket has a YKK zipper and 5 rows of MOLLE Web. The moveable barriers now have hinge-points for easy positioning and customization. Velcro on the hinge-points allow users to branch off additional smaller barriers in order to make compartments. Made in Texas, USA

Overall construction is of abrasion-resistant Cordura nylon, the case has rigid, dense, padded walls protect your valuable contents, without taking up space. Generous use of hook and loop surfaces allow as many configurations as your imagination will allow.
