One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is a Satin Nicke.45acp Colt Series 80 Government Model 1911 A1 pistol that has had some tactical/competition enhancements – namely an accurizer bushing, a flat, full-length guide rod, a fully-adjustable competition rear sight, and a high-blade front sight with a painted red ramp. The pistol, as mentioned, has a factory satin nickel finish with blued slide stop, safety lever, and grip safety, it has Pachmayr wrap-around grips with silver-colored Colt medallions, the blue parts and black Pachmayr grips contrast nicely with the satin finish. It has a stainless steel Colt-marked 8-round magazine. The pistol has not been a “safe queen,” it has been carried and used, and the slide and receiver have lots of service marks and minor scratches. The Pachmayr grips show only minimal wear, and overall condition of the pistol is about 85-90%. The pistol has a very shiny bore with strong rifling, trigger pull is smooth. This pistol would be at home both in a Police Duty holster, or carried concealed, as well as on the target range! This is a high-quality Colt 1911 that has actually been improved a bit with the additions."

Some words to the wise. Shooting Advice from various Concealed Carry Instructors. If you own a gun, you will appreciate this. If not, you should get one and learn how to use it:

A: Guns have only two enemies: rust and politicians.

B: Its always better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6.
Shooting Advice
C: Cops carry guns to protect themselves, not you.

D: Never let someone or something that threatens you get inside arms length.

E: Never say ""I've got a gun."" If you need to use deadly force, the first sound they hear should be the safety clicking off. (I prefer the sound of a slug being chambered when you cock a shotgun)

F: The average response time of a 911 call is 23 minutes, the response time of a .357 is 1400 feet per second.

G: The most important rule in a gunfight is: Always win - cheat if necessary.

H: Make your attacker advance through a wall of bullets . . . You may get killed with your own gun, but he'll have to beat you to death with it, cause it'll be empty. 
If you're in a gun fight:
1. If you're not shooting, you should be loading.
2. If you're not loading, you should be moving,
3. If you're not moving', you're dead.

J: In a life and death situation, do something . . . It may be wrong, but do something!

K: If you carry a gun, people call you paranoid. Nonsense! If you have a gun, what do you have to be paranoid about? (I call it being prepared)

L: You can say 'stop' or 'alto' or any other word, but a large bore muzzle pointed at someone's head is pretty much a universal language. AMEN!

M: You cannot save the planet, but you may be able to save yourself and your family.

If you believe in the 2nd Amendment, please forward."

The problem is that not everyone wants to shoot an AR-15 platform for every task, and let’s face it, AR-15s aren’t cheap. Mossberg came up with an idea to make a .223 bolt gun that uses AR-15 mags and for SHOT Show of this year, they released the MVP series. A lot of us are jumping up and down yelling YES YES YES. The MVPs come in several different configurations, from a 24″ barrel and target stock, down to a 16″ stubby patrol rifle that takes a suppressor. All of the guns have a 1:9 twist rate, so they will handle the same range of bullets as most AR-15s, and from what we found with our test gun, an 18″ laminate stock Predator model, these new Mossberg bolt guns are tack drivers. Our primary concern testing the gun was whether the reverse engineering for AR-15 mags worked as hoped, because nobody has really done this before and you have to wonder why. But our little MVP had zero problems digesting from its own 10 round mag and even the long 30 round P-Mags, never failing to pick up the next round, and you could jiggle the magazine back and forth with no hitching of the bolt whatsoever. It works because Mossberg put a little tab sticking out of the bottom of the bolt to pick up the shells. The MSRP for our MVP Predator is $729, and the series tops out at the Flex Patrol version at $928. The street prices will be well under that when the market comes back to normal, and your local stocking dealer most likely has them well below MSRP right now, but call before you go."

Love the gun! But I would trade it for a 10mm. If it is a Glock it must not be SF and it must be a Gen 4, no EAA please, otherwise not really interested in selling.

This is a Springfield XDM Compact with 3.8"" barrell in Bi-Tone. I Bought this a few months ago and fired less than 50 rounds through it. It comes with all the regular Springfield items including 1 compact mag & 1 full size 19 rd mag, OTW Holster, Double Mag Holster, changable grip pieces, speed loader, etc, etc. Accurate pistol! Excellent condition! Bi-Tone with stainless slide.

The XD has taken on another design in the XDM Compact. The ""M"" stands for a Model contour frame, Major grasp slide serrations, Match-grade barrel, and Minimal reset trigger. The XDM has a whole other level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches specification and precision engineering like Springfield Armory.
 Specifications:
 Type Pistol
 Action Double Action Only
 Caliber 9 x 19 mm Parabellum

 Capacity 19 + 1

 Weight 27 oz
 Finish BiTone

Standard Match Grade Barrel!!

This gun is a compact size gun suitable for concealed carry with the compact mag and it is a full size gun with the 19rd mag suitable for home defense or great at the range. Less time reloading.

Any Questions just ask.

Stored in humidity controlled safe and lubed with Frog Lube!

Please, please I will not take a penny less as my price is firm!

Price is $700 FIRM!!!! I know this is high but that is because I don’t really want to sell and would rather trade for the 10mm. 
I will add cash for the right gun, like a Delta Elite or Kimber Eclipse II.
If you want to get a hold of me quicker then call or text because I dont have a fancy phone with email and I only check my email once a day.

    PVS-14 unit
    Head Mount
    Compass Unit
    3 x Magnifier

    The PVS-14 night vision monocular is a third generation NVD.  Gen III tubes last longer and deliver brighter images with greater detail.
     Viewing in any NO-light or low-light scenario as demanding for US Military.
    It has a built in infra-red illuminator (IR).   Basically what an IRI does is throw out a beam of infra-red light that is near invisible to the naked eye but your NVD can see it. This means when you are in complete darkness you could not see, this function allows you to use your scope even in total darkness.
    It can be operated in hand-held, head/helmet mounted for hands-free goggle-style viewing, or tripod mounted.
    Powered by two AA batteries."

    I purchased this gun from an older gentleman years ago and forgot it was in my safe until recently.  He claims he bought it new, put it in his dresser drawer and never fired it.  I can assure you I never fired this classic.   I’ve never even opened the cylinder!

    But don’t take his word or my word for the condition.  I don’t know if the pictures show it, but take a close look at the cylinder.   On a used revolver, you will see scoring or what is commonly referred to a “turn mark” as a result of the cylinder rotating.  You if look really closely, you see a very faint line probably as a result of factory test firing or fitting.  And as your looking for that turn mark, please take notice of the deep, old style. S&W bluing.

    Comes with original box, S&W anti-corrosion paper, cleaning kit, warranty card and manual.  It doesn’t get much better than this. If I can’t get $750.00 for this truly investment quality firearm, I’ll put it back in the safe for a few more years.  If you think my price is high, you haven’t done your research.  Local sale only.  Will not ship.

Retails for $185 on http://www.alessigunholsters.com/alessi-holsters-bodyguard-holster-beretta-guns/. 

The Bodyguard holster is made from 100% top grain russet leather. The Bodyguard is the most comfortable, concealable shoulder rig in production today. Nothing but the finest materials is used in its construction. The rig comes with a provision for spare ammo.

When adjusted properly, this rig can be worn for exceptionally long periods without any discomfort. The harness does not utilize any nylon or elastic which can be uncomfortable after extended periods of wear.

The holster is positioned semi-horizontally (butt down in the hollow of the body) for a fast natural draw. The unique ‘Speed Break’ system is foolproof and fast. Some of the holsters will be made with a thumb break, due to the nature of the weapon. Glock and Sig Sauer for example will have a thumb break, as well as those with out external safeties. On the opposite side of the weapon is a dump pouch or speed loader pouch.

All the parts seem to be original and it seems this rifle has been taken good care of. There is some aging as one would expect. The ejector on the bolt can get a little stiff. However, I just take a small can of remwith me when I go shooting and that keeps it working well.
I hate to part with this rifle however changing circumstances dictate my need to down size my collection.

M67

In the 1960s Yugoslavia experimented with new bullet designs to produce a round with a superior wounding profile, speed, and accuracy to the M43. The M67 projectile is shorter and flatter-based than the M43. This is mainly due to the deletion of the mild steel insert. This has the side effect of shifting the center of gravity rearward in comparison to the M43. This allows the projectile to destabilize nearly 17 cm (6.7 in) earlier in tissue.[4] This causes a pair of large stretch cavities at a depth likely to cause effective wound trauma. When the temporary stretch cavity intersects with the skin at the exit area, a larger exit wound will result, which takes longer to heal. Additionally, when the stretch cavity intersects a stiff organ like the liver, it will cause damage to that organ. However, the wounding potential of M67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes, especially when the bullet yaws (tumbles).

I have 495 rounds of this ammo I would like to sell, it is brass cased, and sealed around the primer, so it will last longer than anyone reading this now.

*YHM-15
*Seven New in Packaging Magpul M2 Non-Windowed PMAGS

First of all, YHM, DPMS and Del-Ton have been making milspec AR15s for a long time, probably longer than 90% of manufacturers you see these days, so please do your research before you asking me questions about quality. This rifle's lower is completely new with all New DPMS lower parts (just sold my old lower to create a matching YHM upper and lower). I have installed a Magpul B.A.D Lever, MIAD Grip (not MOE) and CTR Stock (again not MOE). The compete upper was ordered and built custom from DTI. The upper receiver, free float quad rail and quad rail gas block are all YHM. The complete Bolt and Carrier Group are DPMS and the heavy barrel is DTI (Del-Ton Inc.) 16"" 1/9 twist chrome lined with a Vortex flash hider. The charging handle is badger ordinance and I've installed a reversible ranger plate sling adapter(forget which brand) and Gear Sector Rail Mount Sling Adapter. Obviously the rail covers are KAC and the sights are Magpul BUIS. 

I've shot less than 500 rounds through this barrel (as I have had many many other firearms to occupy my range time) and have consistently cleaned it properly with MPro7. It also had a proper 20rd break in with MPro7 as well. When I had a Leupold Mark 4 on this upper I had consistent first round hits on mini AR500 plates out to 800 meters (I'm US Army Sniper School Trained though). 

(Does not come with steel mag or windowed pmag pictured.)

$1,700 CASH! Price is firm (I am not making money on this), My last buyer was forced to back out because he was in the hospital. I've had many offers out of state, but I am trying to stay local.

We feel that the more you know about firearms, maintenance, storage, ammunition, reloading, collecting, and refurbishing, the better off we all will be.

Over the course of my life I have seen many examples of poorly maintained, and badly refurbished firearms. It is my sincere hope to accurately provide everyone with the information needed to keep their firearms in great condition for generations to come.

Quality firearm restoration and maintenance has been a hobby of mine for years, I am not, however, a licensed gunsmith. I am a collector and firearm enthusiast with a class 03 FFL. It is my hope to eventually obtain my class 01 FFL and open a small custom firearm and collectors shop. I want to provide responsible and honest service to the firearm community where everyone can share and learn.

Made in Germany by Loewe. This is a full length rifle. It is complete numbers matching on everything including the stock. It was made in 1894. This is an earlier one with the shorter handguard and the steel cleaning rod with the brass end instead of all steel. The cleaning rod is numbers matching as well. Rifle stock is in very good condition with alot of proofs, and the crest proof on rear of right side. All the marks are nice and crisp. The crest has been ground off the reciever like most were by argentina. The blue is very good throughout. Bore shines. Everything is in great shape. The wires that hold the handguard on are tight and in excellent shape. 

Rifle shoots extrememly well and is very accurate. Shoots the 7.65x53 round or 7.65x54 as some call it as well or 7.65 argentine. This is a complete rifle, never been messed with in any way or cut up. All numbers matching. 

I AM TRADING THIS RIFLE ONLY. NOT LOOKING TO SELL. I collect these and have a few in excellent shape just as this one is and I know what they sell for. Not looking to sell it. Looking to trade it for a 1911 pistol, can be a forieng one, or an older well used one. patina, surface rust ect..but with a shootable bore. This rifle is not junk by any means and not looking to trade it for a 1911 that has a cracked frame or shot out barrel. Hit simpson ltd if you are curious as to what these 1891s are selling for and gun broker as well. Even a chopped up one that bubba got ahold of goes for a very good price."
