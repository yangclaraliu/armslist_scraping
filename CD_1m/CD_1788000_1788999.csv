It is a pre war manufactured 1930 rifle, and is a more desirable Tula made rifle as well as having a hex receiver. (sorry for the bad quality of the receiver pic, its the best I can do with my phone)

As most Mosin's on the market these days are it is in great shape, the metal is almost perfect and while the stock has the usual scuffs and scratches it has a nice deep finish.  All numbers match.  Absolutely nothing wrong with it, I just prefer Mausers and never use this rifle.

I'd like to sell the rifle, sling, and whatever surplus ammo I have laying around (Ill have to check to see exactly how much) for $120 cash.  If interested I also have a bayonet, though the numbers dont match.

For an extra $40 or $160 total I can also include a new in box UTG scout style scope mount that will allow you to mount a scope on it without damaging or modifying the rifle in anyway.  The UTG mounts seem to be the best regarded scope mounts of this type.

The ONLY trades I would consider would be full or partial trades of ammo or gear for a Glock 27.  I'm looking for .40 caliber glock magazines of all sizes, a nice kydex OWB or possibly IWB holster, and magazine pouches/carriers (kydex or leather please, no nylon) for a G27.  Ammo is always great too, but I'm only needing .40 caliber.

It has been in my safe since the mid 90s, and made in West Hurley N.Y. by Auto Ordnance before they were sold to Kahr Arms. It was discontinued back in 1994 during the first AWB. There were only 3,500 produced for the public. It includes a new Auto Ordnance factory 50 round drum mag and new 30 round factory stick mag, and box with manual. This Thompson ""pistol"" has the classic ganster foregrip attached legally from the factory because it has a 13in barrel, unlike the other 10in later versions made by Kahr Arms, which voids it from federal AOW registry. There are not that many of these particular models around because most have been converted to SBRs. Mine is brand new in immaculate condition, plus you can enjoy this Thompson as it was originally intended with it's vertical foregrip attached without worrying about the ATF harassment.

The ND3 Laser Designator uses patented technology to create true night vision and turns your scoped rifle into a night hunter. Combining a powerful, green laser diode and a precision optical collimator, the ND3 pairs with your scope and allows you to cast a bright beam of green laser light to fully illuminate targets up to 250 yards.The patented optical collimator allows for quick, one hand, full range adjustment of beam diameter and light strength with just 180 degrees of rotation. You never have to take your eyes off the target or your hand off the trigger. High power green laser light reflects intensely off the eyes of animals allowing quick detection up to 250 yards. The ND3 works well for both night hunting and game spotting. This laser came with AR Mount.

•100 percent new-production parts and components.
•Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier and double-hook trigger.

It is a correct Springfield with nice wood and very nice original finish. It is a Korean War era and all parts are original and are correct for when issued. The metal seems unused and wood has nicks and dings from long-term 60 years of storage. It was bought originally from CMP. Will send more pictures upon request. When CMP was selling these they sold for $1100 plus shipping - now if they have the they are auctioned and go for much more.

Here is the CMP description: CORRECT GRADE: (Very Good to Excellent) 
Correct Grade Rifles are similar to the Service Grade, but will show less wear and use. Correct Grade rifles will have all correct parts for the date of manufacture with 80% or better overall original metal finish. The stock and handguards will be of walnut and correct for the rifle but will have some dings, dents, scratches and marring of the wood finish. Stocks will have the appropriate original inspector's cartouche. The rifle bore will be very good with no significant defects. Very good to excellent condition. This grade is rare and is only available occasionally in limited quantities. Because of the scarcity of these rifles, they will only be sold on the CMP auction site.

•Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.
•Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.
•Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.
•When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.
•The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.
•Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics.
•The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in Black and Camo finishs. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight."

These are a great piece of our history and a very fun firearm to shoot.  After shooting one you see why they were so popular by our troops in WWII.

The IBM has an original IBM barrel and a good deal of IBM parts.  Would take minimal effort to make 100% correct.  Selling it for $950. (SOLD)

The Standard Quality has an Underwood barrel and is correct for this manufacturer. Standard did not make their own barrels and was part of what was called the free barrel program.  Selling it for $950.  The three phots below have been updated to be all of the Standard carbine.

Of the 5.5 million or so of these made (who really knows how many remain after war loss, US governemnt destroying these with captain crunch and the large number given to our allies)IBM and Standard were of the most rare.  Standard made only about 247 thousand and IBM made only about 346 thousand.

Both are from the CMP, and I will include the paperwork and documentation.  If you want magazines or ammo, I will sell as part of package for reasonable (at cost) price.  USGI 15 rd magazines (will try to make match rifle manufacturer) for $20 each. 30 rd magazines for $22 each.  50 rounds of carbine ammo for either $25 a box (Aquila) or $30 for Lake CIty.  I may even have a M4 bayonet or two if interested.

I will be posting photos this afternoon, just wanted to get these listed ASAP because I want to move these this weekend and the prices reflect that for nearly correct carbines.  Frankly I was not planning on selling but the new laws have me concerned that when I liquidate my collection it is going to be a pain in the a$$. I will also have additional photos upon request.

FTF only and thank you for looking. If these do not sell this weekend, I will consider shipping but first priority for expediency and to provide last opportunity to buy one without government meddling is face to face in Colorado."

 Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

 The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
 The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
