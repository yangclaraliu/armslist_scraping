Factory Fresh! New in box! 

Advanced Armament Corporation complete MPW 16” chambered for 300 AAC BLACKOUT. 

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm
caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300
AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines.

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide
extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming
chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to
accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™
flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX
III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories.
The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high
hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also
a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme
corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a
single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened
steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement
in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind
even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium
ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible
life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower
strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with
Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a
Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by
MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are
not included.

The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides
an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories. The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

This pistol caliber carbine is a blast to shoot, VERY accurate -- silver dollar size groups with iron sights at 50yds. Comes with 2 factory 10 round mags.  Meticulously maintained & cleaned.
Great self defense gun -- super-reliable, short, easy to manipulate, packs a good punch but the 9mm won't over-penetrate through your neighbors house (if you ever have to use it for self defense indoors). 
I was getting 1300-1400fps with regular loads, and it is factory rated for +P ammunition as well. 
It's a ton of fun to shoot and best of all, with 9mm you can actually afford to shoot it!

No low-ballers, I'm not in a hurry to sell. 
Please don't bother e-mailing me to ask if it's available, if you're reading this, it's available.  I'll take down the ad after it sells.

Item Description: Well, I (think) I'm going to give Glocks a try. Never had one. Still don't find 'em sexy. But would like to have one to see if it lives up to the hype. Really only interested in Gen 4 Glock 19 or 26. Would not have any interest in .40 caliber as I don't have the ammo. Nor would I want a .45 since I already have/love my XDS. 

Will absolutely entertain offers aside from Glocks, especially a RAMI, PPQ or S&W 686 4 inch revolver. Just seeing if there's an interesting trade worth making. So here goes. 

Will sell for cash, but would prefer to find a good trade.

Item Description: LNIB 9MM M&P Shield

Included in this auction are the firearm, three (3) 15 round magazines and a Beretta hard case. About the pistol: The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. . Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged. . Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. . Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. . Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. . External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. . No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. . Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy. . Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released. . Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. . High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm. 92 FS - A LEGEND IN FIREARMS. ?The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.?The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.?BERETTA U.S.A. RELIABILITY AND DURABILITY STATISTICS FOR THE BERETTA 9mm PISTOL.?• The average reliability of all M9 pistols tested at Beretta U.S.A. is 17,500 rounds without a stoppage"

I'm looking to get $1300 for the package (that's less then what I have into it). May even be able to throw in some rounds if I get my price as I'm kinda lenient towards the price.....

OpsCore ACH Head Loc Chinstrap H-Nape 

Color: Tan 

Size: S/M: 24.5"" - 26.5"" 

The Head-Loc RS was developed to improve safety, comfort and stability of chinstraps used in MICH/ACH ballistic helmets. Every component, down to each stitch pattern, was designed specifically for this purpose, giving the ACH greater utility than ever before. Custom adjustment tabs allow the helmet to be adjusted while wearing it, without any hanging loose ends. Simplified strap geometry makes the system 3X more stable than existing chinstraps. 

This system has resulted from years of input and testing by some of the most respected operators in the USSOCOM community. Their demanding requirements for NVG stability, multiple environment versatility and overall performance are credit to the design today. Without their help, the Head-Loc chinstrap would not exist. 
•3X more stable under rotational forces than standard issue system 
•Patented tabs provide one-handed adjustment while wearing the helmet 
•Straight force lines and unique design eliminate loose strap ends 
•Padded leather chin cup and nape pad provide support and protection 
•Custom webbing weave has greater durability and ventilation 
•The only chinstrap available in Tan that meets SOF DG2 IR specification 
•Airborne Certified for USSOCOM"
