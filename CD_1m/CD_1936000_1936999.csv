Kimber 84M Classic in 7mm-08.  $1150 sale, $1250 trade
This rifle was purchased new in Lexington in June for $1150.  Less than 40 rounds through this rifle, it's only on the block because I purchased a Kimber Classic Select in .280 AI for a Utah Elk Hunt.  Includes remaining ammo, including 2 boxes of Nosler Trophy Grade Accutip 140gr, 3 boxes of Winchester Silvertip 140 gr, and 2 boxes of Federal 140gr. The rifle itself has only ever been on a range, and it is spotless! If you know Kimber, you know you're getting a great deal on this rifle. Price is firm with ammo included. 

H&K MP5-22 - $600 sale, $750 trade
 Purchased in 2012, this is a genuine H&K, not the GSG replicas. Only 10 rounds through it, I need the money to fund another project more than I need the rifle itself. Gun itself is mint. It includes the following extras:
- 500 rds .22 lr
- H&K MP5 sling
- H&K MP5 armorers' manual
- original magazine, plus 2 H&K-made magazines.
- Fore-end Picatinny Rail (never mounted)
- Front pistol grip (never mounted) 

Mossberg 500 Tactical Marauder - $400 sale, $500 trade
This was purchased new in Lexington in 2011, and has never been fired.  I've upgraded the stock pistol grip with a Blackhawk Spec Ops Folding Stock.

(You missed out on a great deal, Mark!)

Here is a 12 gauge Rossi Overland Coach Gun in excellent condition. It has 20"" barrels, has the original Rossi butt plate. Excellent bluing, and very nice wood.  These older Rossis have much nicer wood that some of the newer one.  The gun is nice and tight.

These Rossi shotguns are great because they are solid and reliable, and there are no extra safeties like the unnecessary tang safety that you find on currently manufactured hammered shotguns.    They make great Cowboy Action guns as well as home defense guns.

More photos available, just ask.

Asking $500.00, plus $30 for shipping and insurance in the Continental United States. Shipping to Alaska and Hawaii will be higher.

Here’s something you don’t find very often. A Rossi SxS with hammers, in .410. These are just like their nice 12 and 20 gauge SxS but with a smaller frame for the .410. It has a 26"" barrel, is nice and tight, and has a really nice feel and balance to it. Has the original Rossi butt plate. This would be a perfect gun for that young Cowboy Shooter, and like all of the older Rossi SxS shotguns, this has no extra safeties, making it just like the shotguns of the old days. 

However, it does have one problem. The toe of the stock is broken and is missing. Really too bad, however, it does not affect the function, and with a little skill, should be able to be repaired.

More photos available, just ask.

Asking $625.00, plus $30 for shipping and insurance in the Continental United States. Shipping to Alaska and Hawaii will be higher.

The BUY IT NOW price includes the Leupold Mark 4 6.5-20x50 scope and rings. 

Here are a few things about this rifle from the manufacturer: ""Unlike other semi-automatic .50 BMG rifles, the Model 82A1 is completely reliable. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments.

Its re-engineered muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make the 82A1 comfortable and, dare we say, exciting to shoot.

The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it is transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute by simply inserting two assembly pins through both receivers. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. The rifles M1913 optics rail is tapered 27 MOA to take full advantage of the scopes elevation travel.""

This rifle actually will fit in the case fully assembled, which is a nice advantage. No need to mess with assembly while out in the field. Also, the chrome-lined barrel will make it easier to clean"

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

I have a Sig 2340 in 40 cal.  This firearm is the predecessor of the 2022 and most of the parts are interchangeable (not the barrel incidentally) and it takes the same magazines.  It is DA/SA with a decocker and external hammer, extra backstrap, 2 magazines, and a hard case.  It is in excellent shape and has no wear on the finish at all with the exception of standard operational wear on the barrel's finish (shown in photo).  The only issue is that the gun carry case is missing a latch and it does not have the manual.  It is a very accurate gun my only issue with it is that I am a smaller framed man and the ergonomics for me and my smaller hands can be a bit tricky.  I am looking for even trades of similar quality and value; I cannot add money on top (limited finances).  I am interested in semi autos primarily though I do have a soft spot for SP 101's.  Send me an e-mail of what you have to trade and, if I am interested, we'll get in touch.

     I have been asked what the difference is between the 2340 and the 2022 so, here goes.  You could consider the weapons to be generations 1 and 2 respectively of the Sig Pro line.  The line was originally designed as a less expensive option for law enforcement and civilian shooters as many could not afford the 8-900 dollar price tag of the Sig classic line.  At the time of the first design, rails tended to be proprietary as there was not yet an industry standard.  Thus, the 2340 wears a proprietary rail unique to Sig (incidentally, there are adapters to convert this rail to standard specs as Sig didn't update their design till 2004-2005).  In 2005 (I believe this was the date, I don't have my resources in from of me) the french government put in an order for the Sig pro line to arm both military and police contingent on some updates.  Incidentally, it was also during this time that sig did some shuffling around with ownership and branding and the US subsidiary went from the brand Sigarms back to Sig Sauer (though you still see literature and other things still bearing the name Sigarms).  The updates given to the Sig pro line were both to satisfy the french contract and to bring the polymer line up to speed with the tastes of the market.  So the Sig 2022 has the following updates:  A slightly different barrel link design, an external extractor( the 2340 has an internal extractor), a standard accessory rail, and a squared trigger guard (the 2340 has a “classic” sig profiled guard).  Both weapons are made with a polymer frame, stainless steel for the major components which is then coated in a black matte finish, they both have the standard decocker and hammer, and they have interchangeable back straps (these,as far as I am aware, are interchangeable between generations)."

Also two magazines and a soft case included. Gun is in great shape....has two magazines. Eats everything. Cycles and fires every and all ammo, bulk or otherwise. Is ridiculously accurate. Has the S&W sites and also has the picatinny/weaver optics rail on the top for the installation of a magnified, holographic or red-dot type scope...if you choose. Dead accurate if you don't choose. I have had a 2x -7x 42mm pistol scope on here and it is deadly. Match grade rifle accuracy in the size of a pistol. A lot of fun. This isn't the first (early) model 22a, which had only 2 slots/grooves in the top optics rail, this is the newer model with many grooves/slots in the optics rail. This is the revised Sport Series pistol and it is the perfected edition of the S&W 22A. I am wanting to get a different .22 pistol for a different purpose. I want something smaller but not too small. I have my eye on the Walther p22, that's what my wife can shoot comfortably. I also have been looking at the GSG 522. I would trade for these; if it is a Walther p22, the Walther has to be reliable. Some of them are outright junk and I won't except that for trade. I will seriously consider one that eats anything and is totaly reliable. Some of the Walther p22's are junk and they do nothing but jam and must be fed CCI mini-mags or higher velocity or they won't operate, while other P22's will eat any ammo that you give them and are pretty much trouble free. I'll trade my trouble-free for your trouble-free. The GSG 5-22 would be great, as long as it was trouble free also.   If you ask, I can send you pics of this pistol with a 2x -7x  42mm pistol scope installed on it. So that you get the idea of what kind of optics this thing will hold. The scope is not included, I am just illustrating that it will hold this kind of optic...that's what it's made for. I guess I would sell the scope to make the deal, with the gun, at the scope's cost, that takes it to $370.00, but I only really intended to sell the pistol at 300.00. The scope is not included in the trade for a Walther p22, or the GSG. Unless the GSG was something extra special."

There are a few of these floating around, but not many. They made 210,000 Winchester model 77's in the 1950's and 60's, which is quite a few.. But only 10 percent of those were tube-fed...that's 21,000. This is one of those Tube-fed models. I saw one sell on GunBroker last week for $455.00 without the scope.
This one is in very good condition...very good, and it functions perfect and has every modern feature. They stopped making the Model 77 in the 1960's.
It is grooved for mounting a scope. (same size groove that is on the Ruger 10/22 and all .22 rifles). It has fully adjustable iron sites also. The bolt is on the left side, which is one of the tell-tale model 77 characteristics. It functions flawless and looks great. It will shoot cheap bulk ammo as fast as you can pull the trigger without a hiccup. This is a collector's gun BUT, it is ready to be an everyday shooter also. It looks and feels better than a Ruger. It is a Winchester, back when they were the best. It's not overly heavy and it lacks nothing that a brand new .22 rifle has. You don't feel like your holding an old outdated gun. Model number is 160694"

There are a few of these floating around, but not many. They made 210,000 Winchester model 77's in the 1950's and 60's, which is quite a few.. But only 10 percent of those were tube-fed...that's 21,000. This is one of those Tube-fed models. I saw one sell on GunBroker last week for $455.00, without the scope.
This one is in very good condition...very good, and it functions perfect and has every modern feature. They stopped making the Model 77 in the 1960's.
It is grooved for mounting a scope. (same size groove that is on the Ruger 10/22 and all .22 rifles). It has fully adjustable iron sites also. The bolt is on the left side, which is one of the tell-tale model 77 characteristics. It functions flawless and looks great. It will shoot cheap bulk ammo as fast as you can pull the trigger without a hiccup. This is a collector's gun BUT, it is ready to be an everyday shooter also. It looks and feels better than a Ruger. It is a Winchester, back when they were the best. It's not overly heavy and it lacks nothing that a brand new .22 rifle has. You don't feel like your holding an old outdated gun. Model number is 160694  I Will Trade for GSG-522 rifle or Walther P22 pistol. Either one would need to be in great shape and be trouble free, without any feeding/cycling/firing/ejecting or other problems. Thanks."

The new M-m4 pistol line continues this tradition, while featuring many detailed innovations.

The integrated Picatinny rail, in the front of the frame, is a modern and internationally applicable solution to mount quickly and easily a variety of laser-aiming, or illumination devices. With a total weight of only 766 g, (27oz) the new M-m4 pistol is extraordinarily light.

The unique trapezoid sight offers a new dimension in rapid target acquisition. The sight's shape guides the eye onto the target, and thus the target is captured exactly and quickly

The new innovative grip offers unsurpassed ergonomics, which results in a natural pointability. It optimally supports the natural posture of the wrist during shooting. Improved adhesion is provided by the special surface design.

Factory Fresh! New in box!

As mentioned in title, we have this rifle in BLACK. These will go fast so hurry!

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour 16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications.

New for 2012, we are offering the 16” R.E.P.R. with a spiral fluted barrel. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

Additional Description: The Ruger SR1911 is a classically styled pistol designed with all of the modern manufacturing advances that you have come to expect from Ruger. Original 1911 Series 70 design provides for easy takedown and re-assembly. Slim traditional design with hardwood grips and checkered backstrap. Precision CNC-controlled machining process  results in a superior slide-to-frame fit and smooth slide travel. The stainless steel barrel and bushing are produced from the same bar stock, on the same machine, for improved accuracy. Positive barrel lock-up allows for a superior accuracy out-of-the-box. Oversized ejection port and extended magazine release enhance competition performance. Lightweight, aluminum, skeletonized trigger features an adjustable over-travel stop and provides a very crisp, no creep, light trigger pull with a quick, positive reset. Skeletonized hammer is lightweight and provides faster cycling. Dovetailed, 3-dot sight system features a Novak® LoMount Carry rear and standard front sight that combines optimal target acquisition in an ideal carry configuration. Stainless steel frame and slide feature blasted, low-glare finish and slide serrations for positive grip.
