Unlike some other ""op-rod"" systems, on the HOGAN gun, op-rod springs have been eliminated due to possible damage and system failure during sustained firing of the gun. The HOGAN gun system has been designed and manufactured to greatly decrease/eliminate heat, carbon build-up, gas leaks, fouling and wear/tear on operating parts which can have an adverse effect on an operating system.

This gun is almost in brand new condition except the normal scuffs that occur from spent cartridges exiting however they are very minor & u almost can't even see it . Other than that it is in perfect condition . The gun function's flawlessly . I own 3 of these guns so obviously I greatly believe in them. They have a 1/7 twist barrel & the Patrol version weighs 7.6 lbs as opposed to 8.1 for the Classic Swat model. It isn't nearly as front heavy as the Classic Swat model. The only difference is the shorter rail & piston to shave off the front weight. I know these guns are very hard to find in person without taking a leap of faith & ordering it. If you want to meet face to face & know what you are getting then this is the gun for you. Please don't try to send me BS offers cause I won't give it away. You can call or text me anytime at REDACTED.

•
The Hoppe's BoreSnake Bore Cleaner is a unique product cleans a bore in less than 10 seconds. With a single pull of the Hoppe's BoreSnake Bore Cleaner, you'll have a barrel that is shiny and clean. Its integrated bronze brush effectively loosens hard fouling and lead, then the woven cotton floss that follows picks it all up. Completely washable so you can reuse it over and over. The Hoppe's BoreSnake Bore Cleaner has 160 times more cleaning area than a standard patch, which makes for a cleaner bore in less time. The brass-weighted is stamped with the size and the drop-through cord slips easily down the barrel. The Hoppe's BoreSnake Bore Cleaner has no exposed metal to damage the rifling or crown of your barrel. The Hoppe's BoreSnake Bore Cleaner is a great product to use at home, at the range or in hunting camp.

This listing is for one Adams Arms Huldra 5.45x39 16"" Complete Upper. Includes BCG! It is brand new in the box, never fired, never attached to a lower. This is a beautiful high quality upper! The pictures show exactly what you will receive.

The Huldra 5.45 carbine upper comes complete and is ready to go into any mil-spec AR-15 lower. Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome.

The 5.45x39 caliber bullet matches high muzzle velocity with excellent sectional density, resulting in a flat trajectory and good penetration. The standard ball cartridge will penetrate 5mm of steel plate at a distance of 350 meters. The lowered recoil impulse of the 5.45mm cartridge (verses the 7.62x39mm) has a beneficial effect on accuracy. The 5.45x39mm cartridge is an excellent round that offers comparable penetration, accuracy and lethality to anything fielded by NATO. More importantly, 5.45x39 ammunition is less expensive to shoot! This upper has been designed to handle dirty and corrosive surplus ammunition. The bolt and bolt carrier have been protected by an ion-bond finish. These processes make the parts more corrosive resistant and harder than hard chrome. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surplus ammo without the fear of the parts being unduly worn. Each upper also comes with a 30 round magazine and a Wolff Extra Power Hammer Spring to ignite the older hardened primers.

The melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrel provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. The melonited barrel has higher lubricity, lasts longer and is just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chamber is speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber.

Three things about these bullets:
          1st These rounds have super knock down/stopping power. 
          2nd The cases are great for reloading later.
          3rd they cost 1.50 a piece if you can find them to buy.
I have way to much .357 ammo. I like to carry these daily, then shoot .38 Special when I go to the range, then shoot a round, or two of these before I quit and reload with them when I leave. I have over 200 rounds I am going to trade someone out for some other ammo to shoot among the calibers listed above. If you could find 10 20 rnd boxes, or 200 of these to buy, they would probably cost you in the neighborhood of 280.00 - 300.00. I'll trade mine out for 1/2 price. Also you can trade for what you need. You want it for carry ammo and only want 12 rounds to load your gun twice, or 24 rounds to load it 4 times, that's fine. I have a bunch of ammo in all my carry caliber that have one, or two mags loaded out of a box and the rest just sits there and never gets loaded, carried, or shot because its not range ammo and two expensive to shoot for target ammo. I'd like to get 0.75 a round out of this. I don't want any high dollar ammo, just cheap range ammo of any brand is fine by me. I'll give the below prices to you for swap value, this is what I've been paying for it:
45ACP 23.00 per 50
9MM 15.00 per 50
40S&W 18.00 per 50
380 acp 17.00 per 50
,22 Lr 3.50 per 50 on bulk, and 5.00 on 50 on CCI, Blazer

For example a Box of 50 .45ACP would trade out for 30.6, or 31 rounds of my Nickel Plated Hollow Point Defense Ammo. If you have any ammo listed above that your not shooting and want to swap for some of mine send me a e-mail with what you have and I'll send you a reply for what its worth to me for trade.

This is the high end, top quality tactical shotgun for the serious shooter. Check out the photos below and see for yourself.
Make: Heckler & Koch / Benelli Armi 
Model: M1 Super 90 – Tactical Defense/Police Configuration with rubber pistol grip.
Serial Number: M075757
Year of Manufacture: 1989 - Italian Proof Mark “AH”.Caliber: 12 Gauge 3” Magnum or Standard 2 ¾” Shells – with 7 shot tubular magazine (7+1). It takes any shotgun round to include Standard 2 ¾” or 2 ½” inch British shells.
Action Type: Inertia-Operated Semi-Automatic.
Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “BENELLI ARMI SPA URBINO ITALY”. The right side of the barrel is marked “MAGNUM CAL .12 CL”. The right side of the receiver is marked “HECKLER & KOCH.INC.-STERLING.VA”. The left side of the receiver is marked “MOD M1 SUPER 90 BENELLI”. The underside of the receiver is marked with the serial number and 4 distinct Italian proof marks. The bolt is marked “BENELLI ARMI SYSTEM”. Barrel Length: 18 ½” 
Choke: Improved Cylinder .722
Sights / Optics: This shotgun is mounted with standard tactical rifle sights. 
Stock Configuration & Condition: The stock is a black synthetic with a rubber pistol grip. The checkering on the forend and ribbing on the pistol grip are sharp. There are very few light handling scuff marks on the buttstock and forend. The gloss finish of the receiver reveals many light faint scratches (in the right light) from several early years of riding “shotgun” in the trunk of a patrol vehicle. This shotgun has been very well cared for. It spent a majority of its life in storage, waiting to be used. The LOP measures 14 ¼” from the trigger to the Benelli rubber recoil pad. The recoil pad is soft and pliable and fits the buttstock nicely. I would rate the composite stock on this shotgun as “about Excellent” in overall condition and appearance. 
Type of Finish: Glossy Black Enamel Receiver (DIFFERENT THAN THE MATTE FINISH).
Finish Originality: Factory Original 
Bore Condition: The bore is Bright and Smooth. There is no apparent erosion. CASH ONLY"

These firearms now sell for around 600-700 on Gunbroker and I am willing to give a significant discount considering the incomplete nature of the product."

The barreled action is bedded in a Hogue OverMolded synthetic stock with a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability. The soft-touch stock is extremely comfortable, and made to assure a positive grip in both stressful situations and inclement weather. The rifle also has Remington’s X-Mark Pro externally adjustable trigger, set at 3 ½ pounds from the factory. The receiver is drilled and tapped for optics. It comes with a hinged floor plate magazine with 4-round capacity.

This is a 20-gauge with the 3"" magnum chambers. It has 25"" barrels that are choked Modified and Improved Cylinder. It features a gold plated single selective trigger, automatic ejectors, and nicely engraved silver receiver with contrasting blued trigger guard/trigger plate/top lever. The checkered buttstock is of the straight-gripped ""English"" style and is factory fitted with a recoil pad. LOP measures 14-inches. Overall condition is excellent and the gun retains nearly all of the original finish. I'd rate the finish at about 97-98% overall. There is no rust or pitting. The stocks are in excellent shape also with a few small handling marks but no crack, chips or gouges. The wood has very nice contrasting figure and has never been sanded or refinished. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the action is snug and on-face. The bores are excellent and bright. This is a very nice, high quality Side-by-Side that would be a pleasure to own and shoot."

Feels like an extension to your hand.  comes with 4 magazines (5 if i can find the last one) all mags are 8 rounders (not the more common 7rd). Only differences from factory are as follows...
- hi-Visibility rear 2 dot iron sights modified with phosphorescent paint that glows (bright) after short exposure to any light source.
- tritium from post night sight included (not currently attatched but cost $20 at the armory on Pima)
- pachmeyer rosewood/rubber grips.
- padded hard case.
- 4 or 5 mags
- Wilson combat slide spring installed.
- about 2 magazines worth 45acp ammunition.
- shoulder harness/holster with 2 magazine pouches. (You can carry 25 shots total)

If I think of anything else I'll add it. If you have any questions I'll answer them. The gun has never jammed up misfed failed to fire or failed to eject. Everything works perfect and I have experienced 100% reliability with this gun and incredible accuracy. 
If this gun doesn't sell by this next weekend (its currently July 2nd) I will get the sight put on and relist it for a higher price or at least put FIRM on the price.
The armory on Pima has a good trustworthy gunsmith and from what I'm told works fairly quickly and at a good price. Or you can just spend $30 and buy a 1911 front sight staking tool. I had one and planned to do this myself but lost it and need to sell the gun. So buying a sight tool for a gun I don't plan to own for very long isn't going to happen. 

The price is $500obo.  You can offer me trades of value or lower but I can't add cash on my end. And right now I'm only interested in 40cal semi auto pistols. Smith and wesson m&p 40s being a favorite. 
But others will be considered.
My price is negotiable as the sight does need to be put on. But I'm not going to drop the price $100 for work that costs $20. 
From the factory these come with plain GI style sights, ugly grips and one magazine. And the only part that I've ever heard wearing out or failing is the recoil spring which has already been replaced. 
This gun will fire any brand/quality ammo. And the all steel construction and 100 years battle proven design make it RELIABLE AND POWERFUL!
Don't settle for a 9mm model. Get the full power ww2 winning version.

Contact me through email on this site as it will most likely get the fastest response.

- 505 Scale (slightly older, but still new in box)

Cosmetically everything is in very good to excellent condition, functionally it's all perfect. I've loaded about 1,500 9mm and 2k .38Sp/.357 on it since buying it last June.

In all it's everything you need to get started reloading 9mm and .38Sp/.357 except a tumbler which you can find at harbor freight.

You'd spend over $500 buying individually.  I will not part out dies or any pieces, hence I won't reply to requests for selling dies or any other pieces unless the person who buys the press just doesn't want them.

Selling as a set for $350, local to RTP/Durham.   I'll try to get some pics up sooner rather than later.

Depending upon the specifics of the deal I may be able to throw in some brass and/or a few primers to get you started."

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. P30 and P30S models available in 9 mm and .40 S&W. Key Features: * Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates * MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories * Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame * Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life * Multiple trigger firing modes available * Patented HK recoil reduction system * One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel * Corrosion resistant “hostile environment” blued finish * Ambidextrous slide levers and * Ambidextrous magazine release magazine * Patented lock-out safety device * Bobbed hammer (LEM models) * Spurred hammer (DA/SA models) * Automatic hammer and firing pin safeties * Ambidextrous safety levers (P30S model) P30 Variants currently available from HK USA: All P30 pistols supplied with two additional backstraps and two additional sets of lateral grip plates 734003-A5…P30 .40 S&W (V3) DA/SA rear decocking button, with two 10 round magazines (NO MANUAL SAFETY LEVER) SHIPPING TO A LOCAL DEALER."

I have had this AK for over two years and almost 1000 rounds. It has never let me down, never a failure to fire or feed. This AK works flawlessly with every magazine I have tried in it. I have also fed brass cased ammo in it and it has never missed a beat. I installed a UTG quad rail, and Magpul AFG. The quad rail is solid and has not lost zero with any optic I have placed on the rifle. I have the box, two magazines and original foregrip that will go with the rifle. This rifle has not been fired with corrosive ammo, and had been cleaned after every outing. I have several AK's and I can tell you there are none others out there built like these, the Yugo AK's are tanks, and the most accurate AK's on the market. I do not need to sell this rifle and I am not trying to get rich off it. I just have another project in mind and the wife said if I want to do the other, I have to sell something to fund it. If the rifle sells great, if not I dont mind to keep it in the safe. If you have been wanting a reasonable cost AK, do not buy a surplus kit built Romanian WASR. Buy an AK built in an arsenal that has been building them for over 50 years. I would prefer face to face sales with a bill of sale. But I will ship it to an FFL near you on your dime. I might be interested in trading for a quality AR, but no junk Olympic guns please. Text is best 7 zero 3 - two 9 eight - 4 zero 2 nine"

I also changed the breech block pin from the two piece to the one piece rolled pin. I still have all of the original parts from it.
There is some cosmetic ""issues"". Whatever finish was on it when I bought the gun from Bill's gun shop rubbed off within two weeks of handling (not even firing). I was going to send it in to be refinished but never did it. It's just cosmetic, doesn't effect performance.
I would prefer $700 cash but if you want to trade for something let me know what you have. Some things I'd be interested in are listed below.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

601,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1834601,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD FREE 45-70 MAG. +P 350 gr. TSX-FN (2150 fps) - 20 Round Box﻿﻿,"azusa, California, United States",$ 63,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 2, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=307

 This is a super powerful 45-70 +P (or magnum) loading. It is externally identical to SAAMI spec. 45-70 ammo, but internally it generates FAR more power and pressure. So, our 45-70 ammo will fit/chamber into any 45-70 firearm. HOWEVER, its use should be limited to firearms that are built to take the +P pressures it generates.

Its use should be limited to the following firearms: All Marlin 1895 (1895 Marlins are simply 336 actions, with a 45-70 barrel screwed on) iterations made since 1972, all Browning 1885 and 1886 copies, Rossi Rio Grande, New England Arms Handi Rifle, T/C Encore, ALL falling block actions made of modern steel such as the Ruger #1 and #3, Shiloh, Christian and Pedersoli Sharps, all Winchester 1886 iterations made since 1915 and all Siamese mauser bolt actions.

This all copper expanding 350gr. TSX-FN long-for-weight bullet will penetrate about as deep as the typical premium 400gr. + lead core partition expanding bullet, yet it gives the benefits of a lighter bullet, which means it recoils less and has flatter trajectories.

We were not able to develop velocities as fast as we’d like because the long-for-weight all copper bullet crowds the limited powder capacity of the 45-70 casing. Still, 1,900+ fps is very fast and is very powerful and for those who like the benefits of the all copper Barnes TSX-FN bullet, it is a worthwhile trade off. As an added benefit for many, this reduced velocity also means significant recoil reduction.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating advertised velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

    1,931 fps -- Marlin 1895, 22-inch barrel
    1,914 fps -- Marlin 1895, 18-inch barrel

Many shooters do not understand why the 45-70 needs very little barrel length to obtain maximum velocities. As evidenced by the above velocities, ANY straight walled (not a bottle neck case such as the 06 or any number of casings that have a shoulder) case that uses relatively fast burning rifle powders, will generate all the velocity possible in barrels much shorter than bottleneck chamberings."

FULL-AUTO RUGER 10/22 .22LR CONVERSION DVD & FREE TEMPLATE (from the ORIGINAL manufacturer) 
This DVD video explains an easy way of how to convert the very popular semi-auto RUGER 10/22 .22LR rifle into a true full-auto sub machine gun. Many months of research and testing went into this conversion and put onto DVD video that shows the worlds most reliable and easiest full-auto ever made for the RUGER 10/22 rifle. There is no modification to the rifle's factory original receiver, bolt face, hammer, trigger, sear, disconnector, or any part of the trigger group. This is a non-permanent conversion. The full-auto converted RUGER 10/22 can be put back into its original semi-auto mode of fire. You do not need the skills of a gunsmith to make this conversion to the RUGER 10/22 rifle. This full-auto conversion functions similar to that of the reliable MAC-10, UZI and M3A1 sub machine guns. All other full-auto conversions for the RUGER 10/22 suffer from 'bolt-bounce / light-strike' which cause many malfunctions. The GUN SLINGER VIDEOS full-auto conversion has been tested and proven reliable.  Any person in the U.S.A. can buy my DVD gun videos and booklets.

There is a slight gap at the rear of the receiver, and a rub on the right side of the stock as can be seen in pics, but PERFECT otherwise.  Incidentally, the most accurate 7.62x39 I have ever shot.

Despite being 93 years old the bore is mirror bright, truly pristine quality. I have personally shot this rifle and was able to get about a 1.5 MOA group offhand. The wood has a great grain and it looks amazing for 92 years old.

The bad is that the stock has a crackin it. As picture 3 will show the crack, it is big. The crack makes it so I cannot shoot it, however with a stock repair it would be perfectly shootable. I just do not have the minor skills to fix it, two screws into the wood and some strong wood glue should completely fix it.

Due to the crack I am selling this cheap, I do not have time to repair it, with my other more pressing projects. So I am selling this for $250. It is easily worth 350+ due to the barrel, however. Again it shoots amazing and with some screws, wood glue, and time it would be a 350-400 rifle.

About mine:
1943 ""Tula"" Mosin Nagant M91/30 (overall i give it a 7 out of 10), strong rifiling, great bore, cycles great, shoots great.. as far as i can tell, all serial numbers match
includes bayonet (dated 1942, not matching), cleaning rod, and about 600 rounds of ammo (about half of one can and another unopened can), also i added a recoil pad but have the original butt plate, and i have a reproduction tool kit for it too..
Has a scope mounted on it, Bushnell 3-9x40, cross reticle..eye relief isnt perfect but it works well up to 6 power..was recently sighted to 50 yards, very capable beyond that...includes the original open sight components..
