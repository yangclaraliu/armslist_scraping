Missing small parts and the handguard. I took a few parts from it to restor my other rifle... no longer need it.
Still has: stock (cracked) ALL gas system parts, complete bolt and springs, top cover, bayonet and lug, sight block,retainers, hand guard clip (they break easily this one is intact) rear sight, all springs, COMPLETE trigger group, receiver, barrel (seen better days) recoil spring,recoil spring guide, sling retainers, screws and pins, few other things.
You could restore but It would most likely cost more then the gun is worth complete... but thats up to you.. If you have one of these rifles and need parts, or you love a challenge.. this is it. 
If you want to take the time to part it out on GB or other auction sights it would be very profitable. I do not have the time with my work schedule.
I will ship entire rifle if need be.

You can add all the cool stuff to it, 7-shot tube, adjustable stock, etc. These are as hard to come by as AR-15's. This one is absolutely NIB, the box is pretty too. For those of you that can't afford $1500-$2700 for an AR-15, this is your chance to get one of these fine shotguns that can be customized to fit your needs. Great home defense weapon.

 This model without the safety is very hard to come by and perfect for a CCW

The Spike’s Tactical CAR-1 Fake Can gives you the looks of having a 10.5” suppressed rifle but doesn’t come with all of the expense and paperwork that’s required for the real thing. This is how it works; The CAR-1 shrouds back over the barrel of your rifle concealing part of it inside of the CAR-1. This is what gives the illusion of a suppressed SBR and of course, no stamp is required. Keep in mind, this fake can is just for cosmetic looks and does not provide any sound suppression whatsoever.

Sabre Defense is no longer in business due to some ATF troubles, something to do with some employees walking away with some of the machinegun parts they made for the military. Sabre Defense was known to have made higher end ARs, you can google sabre defense for some reviews.

This rifle also comes with an Aimpoint red dot scope, it is a genuine, made in Sweden Aimpoint, but it is an older model. Still bright and works fine.

Also included are 3 30 round magazines, and 120 rounds of ammo.

Not really interested in trades at this time, but it never does hurt to ask, it would likely need to be something of lesser value with some cash added, as I need to get about $600-$700 worth of my wife off my ass for some other recent purchases I'm in the dog house for, LOL!

I had an EoTech red dot sight on it, but I sold it already.  This sale is for a rifle that is an honest 98-99% firearm with one Teflon 30 round mag with the green follower.  Nothing else comes with the rifle.  I have a lifetime LTCH and have collected firearms for years.  I just flat don't know what happened to the box.  Wife says I have too many firearms and the boxes take up too much room. That is my only hint as to what may have happened to the box.

Otherwise, this is a flat top DPMS factory lower and upper with a 6 position collapsable stock.  It clearly says DPMS on the lower, the stock as well as the barrel.  No funny business, no games.  I want a Ruger SR1911 Commander and I must sell this to get one.  If you have one to trade, let's make a deal.  If not, here is your chance, I'll sell this for $1050 cash to the first person with the cash along with proper ID and can own this rifle.  A valid driver's license is a minimum.  I'd prefer you have an LTCH, but it's not mandatory.  What are you waiting on?  Here is your chance to buy a brand name AR for a thousand and fifty bucks!!"

Built around Beretta's latest PX4 modular technology, the Beretta PX4 Storm 9mm Sub-Compact Pistol delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. The Px4 Storm Sub-Compact utilizes Beretta's reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system for a more compact and lighter package. Direct barrel-slide locking system design delivers a low barrel axis that reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise. Its stainless steel barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance, a great choice for a concealed gun kept close to active, perspiring bodies. The PX4 Storm's durable frame includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating provides superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. White 3-dot sights provide quick acquisition of the target. Weight: 26.1 oz. Capacity: 13+1 rounds.

People like you are the reason there are unnecessarily inflated prices for guns and ammo. 

The AWB proposal passed the Senate Judiciary Committee - this was expected and no surprise to anyone as it is an 18-person committee (Democratically chaired) with 10 Democrats and 8 Republicans. The vote was exactly along party lines 10 to 8. 

This is nothing special. The real fight will happen on the Senate floor where even Feinstein knows it isn't likely to pass. Even if it did it would not pass a Republican controlled House. 

Lets remain calm and do our part to contact our local legislators, but it makes no sense to try and stoke irrational fear and inflate prices for absolutely no reason."

This upper is used, and has seen about 1000 flawless rounds.  Still in wonderful shape, shoots very soft due to the heavy barrel, excellent brake, and midlength gas system.  Very accurate, quick followup shots.  Have really enjoyed this upper but have moved on to other projects!

Never had a single jam with any kind of ammo.   A pleasure to shoot.

Asking $550.  Prefer to meet at Cabelas in East Hartford for transaction.

Thanks."

It has the factory hammer extension for use with a scope as well as the factory rail for mounting a scope. Still has the factory iron sights on it.

The scope mounted to it is a Leupold vari-power 1 - 4x scope for use on big bore rifles with the heavy 4-plex cross hairs - which makes it very easy to get on target quickly. 

Comes with a sling. Still have the factory shipping box for it.

It was modified by a professional Gunsmith down at Ahlman's guns. They bore the barrel to accept a Thompson Contender choke. 

It is specifically used to improve shot shell patterns. Out of a normal barrel at 20 yrds you're lucky to hit with 1/4 of your shot. The choke installed stops the wad from spinning, resulting in a 80% hit ratio. This means your PDX1 shot or any other .410 will be way more deadly. 

You can unthread the choke and shoot 45 still as well, It has threads wider than the barrel so it wont be gummed up! I was able to hit the center two rings of a 10"" target @ 40 feet bench rested. 

The base price of the gun is 450$, the choke threading runs 150$, 85$ Dura coat job and two boxes of ammo 50$ can be your's at the price of 575$ 

Serious offers only. This is a bad ass gun, with Taurus's reliability and lifetime warranty this is a surefire life long gun!"

This rifle is not factory stock and in the 2 years I have owned it I have done quite a bit to it and spent lots of money. I am aware of the recent ban and supply & demand problems, but I am not going to price gouge like a lot of guys and try to get $5000 for a stock POS AR-15. I know what I have spent on the rifle with time and money, and the price I have listed is fair, in my thoughts. There are too many ball breakers on this site, just like Craigslist. If you think you can find a better deal on better rifle, then DO IT. This isn't Burger King. You can't have it your way. Anyway, onto the rifle. Started out life as a 18inch heavy barrel, as listed below.

DPMS LR-308/AR-10
18 inch heavy barrel with 7.62x51 stamped. Not the cheap .308 civilian model. There is a difference.
Forward Assist and Brass Deflector
A2 Flash Hider (Is gone)
Telescoping Stock (Is NOT installed)
Boring...........

Since then....................

Magpul PRS Stock
Timney Competition Trigger at 3.5lbs (Complete Trigger Kit, not junk)
BCM Bolt Carrier Group
Hogue Rubber Grip
Hydraulic Buffer Tube
Troy Claymore Muzzle Brake/Compensator
Burris PEPR Scope Mount (30 mm)
Weaver Tactical 4-20x50, 30mm tube, FFP with external target knobs. Lots of questions on this scope. Go to weavers website and look at #800360. This is from their tactical line up for military and LE. It is not a cheap chinese copy, and is MSRP on their site for $1200.

This entire setup is less than a year old and has seen less than 100 rounds. I have used only Federal GMM 168 BTHP's and my own handloads with Hornady TAP, Nosler Ballistic Tips, and IMR XBR 8208 powder and CCI match primers. There has never been anything besides 168grn and 175grn bullets fired from this. Mostly 168, as I only shot it at really long distances 3 times.

This rifle is extremely accurate and is very reliable. 

Included with sale if right price is met:
A2 Stock for AR10. Had it mounted up, and hated it. Its new.
M4 Stock
Pelican case with cut out for current setup
Blackhawk 3 point tactical sling
(5) Pre-Ban 20 round Magazines
(1) 10 round Magazine

Ammo? I have a lot of my own handloaded 168 TAP, Barnes TTSX, Sierra 175 Matchking, Ballistic Silvertip, etc. Who knows. They were reloaded with the newest and most accurate setup I have seen. I have the new RCBS Chargemaster with scale and power case trimmer.

I won't give this away. I have spent hours tuning and testing it to get it shoot and operate the way it does. Yes, it was a home job. However, I have ALL of the AR required tools and didn't hack anything up. It is done right, and has outshot plenty of built 700's and more expensive LMT and Daniel Defense AR's. Regularly. Attached picture of target is a 3 shot group at 342 yards using my handloaded once fired Fed brass, 168 Sierra Matchking, 43.6 grains of IMR XBR8208 powder, and CCI match primer. Temperature was 47 degrees with a 5 mph crosswind off of a bean bag rest. The rifle is a tackdriver. The scope allows for in the field adjustment for MOA with return to zero. I usually tape a ballistics card to the stock so I have all of the information I need when I need it. I also use military issue Rite in the Rain notebooks. I can provide you with all of the ballistic info you need. The rifle has shot as far as 840 yards at iron man sized silhouettes without a problem. The 175 matchkings work better for that, as the 168's are a little light. The scope has more than enough MOA adjustment to go even farther if need be.

In excellent and above average condition with around 200 rounds shoot threw it. Comes with a Bushnell 3X-9X scope. The stock has no nicks or scratches, and the checkering is perfect. I've had it in storage for quite a while, and have purchased a new 7MM so I no longer have a use for it. the rifle has killed many a deere, and one elk. I will also consider a trade for a glock .40 S&W or 9mm Or ?"
