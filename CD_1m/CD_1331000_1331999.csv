Fits up to 46"" chest.  Here are some specs, info I found on it 

This surplus German flak jacket is a versatile piece of protective clothing and  an authentic German military surplus item. These flak jackets were originally designed for and used by members of the German heer, or army, which is one of the five service branches that makes up the Bundeswehr, or unified armed forces of Germany. The flak jacket appears to have been previously issued, it remains in good condition and ready to continue service.
This surplus German flak jacket is Constructed from Kevlar® paneling contained in a nylon cloth carrier, the flak jacket is designed to offer protection from shrapnel, fragmentation, debris and other indirect projectiles to the chest, back, sides and shoulders. The easy-to-wear vest features Velcro® closures that are located on the left shoulder and both hips. Additionally, there is a large, expandable front pocket and rings located on both the front and back of the jacket for carrying additional gear. Not satisfied with the level of protection offered? The surplus German flak jacket includes a zippered closure for the insertion and removal of Kevlar® paneling and other plates.
Features the Flecktarn camouflage pattern. Flecktarn is a multicolor disruptive camouflage pattern, generally utilizing three or more colors. This particular pattern was designed for use in temperate woodland terrains, though by varying the colors, it is adaptable to other backdrops.

The surplus German flak jacket is a great choice for:
- Paintball and airsoft
- Costumes
- Reenactments

*NEW* Vest official specs:   PROTECTS AGAINST LEVEL IIA THREATS. This body armor protects against 9mm Full Metal  Jacketed Round Nose (FMJ RN) bullets, with nominal masses of 8.0 g (124 gr) impacting at  a minimum velocity of 332 m/s (1090 ft/s) or less, and .40 S&W caliber Full Metal  Jacketed (FMJ) bullets, with nominal masses of 11.7 g (180 gr) impacting at a minimum  velocity of 312 m/s (1025 ft/s) 357 MAG JSP, 158 GR at (1250 Ft/s) and all lower  ballistic threats. With complete full side, front, back, shoulder and collar coverage.  Includes one camouflage, three point, Velcro adjustable, outerwear carrier with Velcro  abdominal security strap attached inside of carrier, and six, removable, Kevlar ballistic  panels: one in the front portion; one in the back portion; one in each shoulder  attachment; and two in the collar assembly. Velcro fasteners over left shoulder, and both  sides.All panels are  manufactured with 13 layers of lightweight, high-tenacity Kevlar  129  fabric and are each enclosed in a sealed water repellent heavy nylon cover. Conforms to EN ISO 14876-1-2002 General requirements (ISO FDIS 14876-1 2002)
As stated in the specs, this vest uses 13 layers of kevlar 129, which is a higher quality than traditional kevlar 29 vests.  Kevlar 29 is usually found in older American flak vests and older bulletproof vests.  It has about 20% less tensile strength than kevlar 129.  This usually equates to needing more layers to accomplish the same amount of bullet resistance vs the german vests.
Couple that with Europe’s higher standard for backface deformation and you have something that is effectively extremely overbuilt for flak and comes out to be approximately a level IIA quality vest.
Things that effect ballistic Kevlar over time: As a rule, Kevlar is very durable and ages very well.  However, there are certain things which can vastly reduce the function of Kevlar by thirty or more percent.  The first is ultraviolet damage.  If the panels were stored outdoors for an extended period (look for sun-bleached covers), you might want to discard the panels or find an alternate use for  them.  The second is water damage.  Kevlar absorbs moisture.  This absorption means that the water will stay in the fibers and reduce it’s tensile strength.  
Luckily, the Germans considered this and built extremely heavy duty vinyl covers for the interior ballistic panels that are both water and UV resistant.  

Real world testing:  Now don’t take my word for it; numerous tests have been done by members of the community which validate the properties of this armor.  you can utube it to find out more about it."

I usually sell these things for $1800-$2000 at the shows (even pre-S.H. I was getting 1600), but there's not another show here in k-town till May, and I'm a little strapped for cash, so this one's gonna go to the best offer I get.

-The piece of mind that all the stores that I know of have plenty of cheap ammo for this IN STOCK
-A few stray ""Dremel"" marks where I modified the stock to accommodate the scope mount.

If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750 (If you want the ""Holo-sight"") If you want to save yourself $100 and have your own sight you can have it for $650.

Seriously....,if you want this, email me stating your intention to buy, a number that I can call or text, and be prepared to show a valid form of ID and sign a Bill of Sale, because I'm ONLY SELLING to a LEGAL, law-abiding CITIZEN!"

I've fired it before and haven't had any issues with it at all.   If you choose to purchase it, it would be a better project gun or you could just buy it for the parts.   The barrel is not DP marked at all so its good with bright bore and good grooves.   The only things that are DP Marked are the bolt action and Magazine Clip which are both functional. or could be used as parts etc.   Other than that,  the barrel is full length and not cut down. 

I thought about buying a full stock for it however I'm just to busy. Oh well, Cheers!"

Are compatible for a range of small arms(Mac/MPA 10, M3, and several others).  No longer have the weapon for these and not ready to be a collector. The two that were opened were in excellent condition. They were sold with the weapon. 

These three are likely in great condition and could be used effectively(still sealed). They are also great for collecting because of the care they've been given. Can ship to where-ever(US). 

For the safe or the range, these are a great addition to a collection. Price is as follows:

S &H-                Actual cost of stamp, local not applicable
ALL 3-               265.00(plus shipping if applicable)

I've seen these for around 129.00 EA.  So this is a steal for Vietnam Era collectors or anyone with a Mac10 or M3 and assorted others.

I wanted to let you know about a new petition I created on We the People,  
a new feature on WhiteHouse.gov, and ask for your support. Will you add your  
name to mine?  If this petition gets 100,000 signatures by April 23, 2013,  
the White House will review it and respond!


We the People allows anyone to create and sign petitions asking the Obama  
Administration to take action on a range of issues.  If a petition gets  
enough support, the Obama Administration will issue an official response.


You can view and sign the petition here:


http://wh.gov/HOjc


Here's some more information about this petition:


Start teaching Hunters safety in public schools. Give the youth  
the proper education on firearms. Not in games or movies

If the youth is informed about the do's and don'ts of firearms  
from school they maybe less likely to imitate movies and video games. Im not  
faulting hollywood it seems more like a parenting issue that is not  
addressed. you would not have to involve actual firearms in the class. Altho  
it would be nice if it was offered as an extension to the class. The parents  
could decide if they ""the parents"" would like to accompany there  
child to the shooting portion of the class with there own firearm. I would  
assume the shooting portion would be at the parents expense. Hey the children  
may even teach there parents whom may not be educated on the proper use of  
firearms. Wouldn't think it would take much work since the classes  
already exist, i took mine after school at my grade school."

I wanted to let you know about a new petition I created on We the People,  
a new feature on WhiteHouse.gov, and ask for your support. Will you add your  
name to mine?  If this petition gets 100,000 signatures by April 23, 2013,  
the White House will review it and respond!


We the People allows anyone to create and sign petitions asking the Obama  
Administration to take action on a range of issues.  If a petition gets  
enough support, the Obama Administration will issue an official response.


You can view and sign the petition here:


http://wh.gov/HOjc


Here's some more information about this petition:


Start teaching Hunters safety in public schools. Give the youth  
the proper education on firearms. Not in games or movies

If the youth is informed about the do's and don'ts of firearms  
from school they maybe less likely to imitate movies and video games. Im not  
faulting hollywood it seems more like a parenting issue that is not  
addressed. you would not have to involve actual firearms in the class. Altho  
it would be nice if it was offered as an extension to the class. The parents  
could decide if they ""the parents"" would like to accompany there  
child to the shooting portion of the class with there own firearm. I would  
assume the shooting portion would be at the parents expense. Hey the children  
may even teach there parents whom may not be educated on the proper use of  
firearms. Wouldn't think it would take much work since the classes  
already exist, i took mine after school at my grade school."

Start teaching Hunters safety in public schools. Give the youth  
the proper education on firearms. Not in games or movies

If the youth is informed about the do's and don'ts of firearms  
from school they maybe less likely to imitate movies and video games. Im not  
faulting hollywood it seems more like a parenting issue that is not  
addressed. you would not have to involve actual firearms in the class. Altho  
it would be nice if it was offered as an extension to the class. The parents  
could decide if they ""the parents"" would like to accompany there  
child to the shooting portion of the class with there own firearm. I would  
assume the shooting portion would be at the parents expense. Hey the children  
may even teach there parents whom may not be educated on the proper use of  
firearms. Wouldn't think it would take much work since the classes  
already exist, i took mine after school at my grade school."

Super Reliable!,"North High Point, Greensboro, North Carolina","$ 1,400","Listed On: Monday, August 5, 2013",Rifles,CMMG                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This carbine has CMMG upper and lower, 16” barrel, with standard front sight and Magpul folding rear sight, compact 1-4 x 24 scope with illuminated mil-dot reticle, 2 Magpul Pmags, ambidextrous single point sling, and tactical soft case.

This carbine has been designed and built for reliability.  Do an internet search on ‘so, you want to buy an AR-15, huh?) and you will be led to a thread in forums.officer.com, where the specifications and features that lead to reliability are discussed.  The author of the thread compared brands of AR-15 carried on duty by police officers and ranked this CMMG as equal to Colt, LMT, and Noveske, and ahead of S&W, Sabre Defence, Stag Arms, Bushmaster, and Rock River Arms (posts to the thread dated 1/23/2008).  Since 2008 new companies have come into the market (most notably Bravo Company and Daniel Defense) with very high quality products and CMMG’s reputation has suffered.  The carbine offered for sale here was purchased in February 2010, and since then CMMG seems to have let quality control slip in an effort to increase production.  The carbine for sale here (upper model U1605, lower model MOD4SA) is no longer for sale and new CMMG products should not be considered equal to products in the 2008-2010 window.  All this information can be found in postings on the thread introduced above, which is still active.

The features and specifications of this package and how they contribute to reliability follow:
>4150 grade steel barrel- harder and stronger than 4140 steel, meets military specification.
>Chrome lined chamber and bore- resists corrosion, easier to clean, very hard, naturally lubricating.  Some manufacturers are using Melonite surface conversion instead of chrome lining, but the military has been using chrome lining for more than 40 years.
>Government profile barrel weight- lightweight barrels can lose accuracy when they get hot, heavy barrel adds too much weight.  Government profile is the ideal in between weight for a fighting rifle.
>5.56 NATO chamber- can safely shoot .223 or 5.56, 5.56 should not be shot in a .223 chamber.  The 5.56 chamber is designed to chamber whatever is in the magazine, whereas the .223 chamber is intended for accuracy.  The 5.56 chamber is also designed for higher pressure limits.
>1/7 twist rate- allows the shooter to select bullet weights between 52 grains and 80 grains.  Heavier bullets mean harder hits on the target, a necessity in a fighting weapon.
>M4 feed ramps- Feed ramps are actually extended past the barrel into the upper receiver, and provide more reliable chambering of rounds from the magazine
>Magnetic particle inspected- a test that examines barrel (and bolt, in the case of this rifle) for microscopic flaws or cracks in the steel, after high pressure proof firing.
>Shot peened bolt- increases surface hardness of the steel.
>Midlength gas system- longer than the typical carbine length gas system on a 16” barrel, reduces gas pressure slightly to allow the carbine to cycle more smoothly than the carbine length gas system.
>F-marked front sight base- front sight base is high enough so that when sighted in the front sight is still protected by the ‘ears’ on the front sight base.  A sight that protrudes above the FSB can get bumped or broken during use, with obvious effects on accuracy.
>Properly staked gas key- the gas key must remain properly attached to the bolt carrier despite the shock of repeated recoil.  If the gas key works its way loose the carbine converts to single shot!
>Magpul Pmags- reliable magazines are a must to feed the carbine smoothly.  Pmags are highly recommended for their reliability and toughness.  This carbine comes with 20 round Pmags because it is very difficult to shoot from a rested position with the longer 30 round magazines.

Over a period of three years about 600 rounds have been fired through this carbine, both factory ammunition and handloads.  (Never any steel cased ammunition).  This means the rifle is used, but in no case is it worn.  These rifles are intended to fire many tens of thousands of rounds over their lifetime, so 600 rounds is barely broken in.  In fact, a typical one day defensive carbine course will put 600 rounds of ammunition through a carbine.  In addition, every one of those shots fed, fired, and ejected properly.  No stoppages.  This CMMG carbine is 100%, perfectly, reliable.  It is not a target rifle, it is a fighting carbine.  If you had to defend your family against home invaders, would you rather have a new gun that has never been fired or one which has been demonstrated to be reliable?

The scope on this carbine has an offset riser mount for optimum co-witness with the iron sights. It has flip-up caps and an integral sunshade, and red or green illumination. At 1x it behaves like a red dot, or it can be zoomed to take longer shots.  The sling plate has a curved loop that allows the sling hook to slide from one side to the other depending on what side you want to carry the carbine on.  Much easier to use than dual loop ambi sling plates.

You will be happy with this carbine.  I have been very happy with it, the only reason I am parting with it is to fund more hunting firearm purchases.  I would be happy to arrange a trade for LH bolt rifles, specifically 30-06 or .223.

Bolt was rebuilt after 500-600rnds with +4 rollers and a brand new locking piece. Bolt gap sits at a comfortable .012 currently. I love this gun. She shoots softer than any battle rifle I have ever shot and is accurate too. The reason I'm selling is the gun likes 7.62x51mm NATO ammo and all my guns are chambered for .308 Winchester. If you reload I will warn you this beast will fling brass 30-40 feet and has a fluted chamber. The spent brass is pretty beat up making it hard to reload the old brass. Also a warning for you guys, the muzzle brake makes this gun wicked loud to any bystanders.

Comes with two 10 round factory magazines. Comes with the Keltec frame mounted carry clip in Stainless Steel. Right hand carry for the clip position. Also comes with the factory hard case and manual.

I have completely worked this gun over with the full fluff-n-buff job on the barrel, frame, and trigger. I have reshaped the feed ramp by removing the factory hump which tends to drag on 147 grain ammo and polished it to a full shine. I beveled the mag well, and removed all the molding flash on the grip and frame. Trigger registers right around 7 lbs, down from the factory 11, and is very smooth and non-stacking. (I added an over travel trigger stop behind the trigger that is instantly removed. It is covered by grip tape in the picture. It cut my group size by more than half.) I made the slide lock much easier to release by filing and polishing the necessary areas. I polished the magazine followers and polished the internals of the magazines and springs for even more reliable function. I have carried this gun many times and it has always worked flawlessly after I put some elbow grease and loving care into it. It does have a few tiny light scratches on the slide from being carried, but this gun isn't about being a mantle piece. It's a save your ass gun that needs to work!

You get a good, ready to carry firearm made great, with all of the hard reliability upgrade work already done!

I wanted to let you know about a new petition I created on We the People,  
a new feature on WhiteHouse.gov, and ask for your support. Will you add your  
name to mine?  If this petition gets 100,000 signatures by April 23, 2013,  
the White House will review it and respond!


We the People allows anyone to create and sign petitions asking the Obama  
Administration to take action on a range of issues.  If a petition gets  
enough support, the Obama Administration will issue an official response.


You can view and sign the petition here:


http://wh.gov/HOjc


Here's some more information about this petition:


Start teaching Hunters safety in public schools. Give the youth  
the proper education on firearms. Not in games or movies

If the youth is informed about the do's and don'ts of firearms  
from school they maybe less likely to imitate movies and video games. Im not  
faulting hollywood it seems more like a parenting issue that is not  
addressed. you would not have to involve actual firearms in the class. Altho  
it would be nice if it was offered as an extension to the class. The parents  
could decide if they ""the parents"" would like to accompany there  
child to the shooting portion of the class with there own firearm. I would  
assume the shooting portion would be at the parents expense. Hey the children  
may even teach there parents whom may not be educated on the proper use of  
firearms. Wouldn't think it would take much work since the classes  
already exist, i took mine after school at my grade school."

We the People allows anyone to create and sign petitions asking the Obama

You can view and sign the petition here:

Here's some more information about this petition:


Start teaching Hunters safety in public schools. Give the youth  
the proper education on firearms. Not in games or movies

If the youth is informed about the do's and don'ts of firearms  
from school they maybe less likely to imitate movies and video games. Im not  
faulting hollywood it seems more like a parenting issue that is not  
addressed. you would not have to involve actual firearms in the class. Altho  
it would be nice if it was offered as an extension to the class. The parents  
could decide if they ""the parents"" would like to accompany there  
child to the shooting portion of the class with there own firearm. I would  
assume the shooting portion would be at the parents expense. Hey the children  
may even teach there parents whom may not be educated on the proper use of  
firearms. Wouldn't think it would take much work since the classes  
already exist, i took mine after school at my grade school."

Here's some more information about this petition:


Start teaching Hunters safety in public schools. Give the youth  
the proper education on firearms. Not in games or movies

If the youth is informed about the do's and don'ts of firearms  
from school they maybe less likely to imitate movies and video games. Im not  
faulting hollywood it seems more like a parenting issue that is not  
addressed. you would not have to involve actual firearms in the class. Altho  
it would be nice if it was offered as an extension to the class. The parents  
could decide if they ""the parents"" would like to accompany there  
child to the shooting portion of the class with there own firearm. I would  
assume the shooting portion would be at the parents expense. Hey the children  
may even teach there parents whom may not be educated on the proper use of  
firearms. Wouldn't think it would take much work since the classes  
already exist, i took mine after school at my grade school."

 This rifle is still in the factory box, and I've actually only opened it once (to take pictures for this add and to make sure nothing was missing). I ordered the gun on a wait list a few months ago but then ended up finding another one locally and jumped on it in case any bans happened, and then this one came in, so now I have two. My ask price is basically what I paid, which is not a bad price for such a nice firearm (especially in the current market). I've fired plenty of fine AR-15's (LMT, DD, Colt), and let me say that my other KAC is the smoothest-firing, most well-balanced, best weapon I have ever handled.

 Email me with questions, and I'll provide my phone number for any serious buyers who want to discuss. I will ship to an FFL dealer or meet for an in-person transaction. If you're interested, we'll figure out details that work for both of us."
