Original rear sight removed, Williams adjustable rear peep sight for full length sight radius. I added a rubber butt pad for length, but can be removed. 
Spring-loaded bolt, like SMLE, very fast and smooth operating. 
All matching Serial #'s. Made in 1968. Finish mostly removed from bolt, looks stainless.
Has a removable 10 round magazine, also can feed M1a stripper clips. 
Finish on the gun is outstanding for it's age, wood is good as well, not all dinged up. 
Very bright/clean bore and barrel. 
Only thing missing from the gun is the front top handguard. I never saw a need to replace it but if you want one, they are very available and cheap. 

Ishapore's are not cheap copy's, they were made for the Indian military to stand alongside their FAL's in the same caliber. 
There are only 1 of these currently on Gunbroker, and the bidding started at 450, and that's without a rear peep sight. 

Can send pics via email, but I'm going on a trip until Monday night so can't sell the gun until then. Thanks for looking."

However GunBroker is no longer a site where you consistently find good deals. (Don’t get upset I said consistently not ever.) I have had several customers buy from GunBroker and come to me for the transfer. They proceed to tell me they got a great deal and even got 10-15% off because they where military or the dealer told them they were special. Then they tell me how much they paid and it is $100-$150 or more than I would have charged them out the door. Don't get me wrong, many guns are now hard to find but they are available. If you can't find a gun locally and really want it, spend whatever it takes. I’m not saying don’t use GunBroker or any of the other gun site as I use them also, but if you want a firearm at least give me a call and ask what price I can do on the Item.

I will drive an hour from Tricities or ship at buyer's expense."

The M59 is practically a carbon copy of the Russian SKS and, , was made at Red Banner from 1960-67. The 59/66 series was manufactured at Red Banner from 1967-70. Many M59s were converted to the 59/66 configuration during that time. Most of the 59s and 59/66s had beechwood stocks. Some Yugoslav 59s and 59/66s with teakwood stocks were made for export to Africa.

The main difference between other SKS rifles and the Yugoslav versions is that the bores of the Yugo versions were not chrome plated--Yugoslavia has no significant native chromium ore deposits, chromium was expensive to purchase and Yugoslavia's  relationship with the USSR (a major chromium ore exporter) since 1948 was lukewarm at best. One reason Yugo SKS rifles (in fact all Yugoslav small arms seem ""beefier"") is because Yugoslav cartridges are much ""hotter"" loads than other similar ""East Bloc"" ammo, plus since Yugoslavia's manufacturing capacity was relatively limited, each weapon had to be more durable."

Product Information

The Plinker Tactical M&P 15-22 magazine is a 22 long rifle, polymer, 35-Round magazine. This magazine is specifically designed for the Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22. The magazines have the look and feel of real 5.56x45mm Nato magazines. The Plinker Tactical magazines function just the same as factory magazines, but give you an increased capacity for longer shooting sessions. These mags are specifically designed to work with the Plinker Tactical magazine loader. The magazines are constructed of impact and solvent resistant polymer and are sonically welded for long term durability. The solid mag body, without exposed springs or loading tabs keeps dirt and debris out, increasing reliability and long term durability.

The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

Rare built Iron Man Mark III complete costume. This incredible professional grade Iron Man costume is painted in ""Battle"" finish and is a complete suit; i.e. Helmet, neck piece, front/back torso, arms, gloves, legs, boot covers, even boots with lifts (size 10.5/11), and two undersuits. 

Upgrades include: mechanically activated / built helmet with motorized movable face plate, LED light kit for eyes, brightest Light-up detailed chest uni-beam and hand beams youll find (thumb activated-no wires in forearm) and set of boots. 
Between me and the original owner the suit has only been worn for special costuming and charity events...and...ill let the buyer know of another detail.
 It's an impressive suit and is incredible when seen on display or when worn. Buyer pays for packing and shipping (this will be a big box to ship) The suit is located in Colorado so plan on shipping accordingly.


Lots of inquiries. Here's some additional info:


I originally paid over $5,100.00 for the suit.
Fiberglass is the main component of the build.

No, I'm Not interested in parting out.

The way the suit is made it can adjust to anyone from 5' 9"" to 6' 4"", there are straps inside the torso that allows adjustment to how it fits. I'm 5' 11"" and the legs work perfect or me with the boots and lifts. 


Thanks again everyone! good luck folks!
Oh, and if I can get the right agreement/contract and healthy down payment , I will Work with someone on a deal/ payments even!

I have the receipts for everything from where I purchased the Rifle less than one month ago. This is the all steel model and not the cheap carbon model. This AR comes with everything that came in the box along with some extras which include a quad rail, a fore grip, a rubber form fitting pistol grip, an extra pmag, and 2 boxes of ammo. The accessories are made by UTG which is a reputable manufacturer. You get everything you see in the picture. I understand prices are going down and prior to all of this commotion this AR sold for around $1049 +tax. I feel my price is fair in comparison with all of the similar Bushmaster AR's on armslist.com. There are some of the same Bushmaster models posted on armslist in upwards of $1300 without all the extras. This is a great deal considering whomever buys it will get all of the extras as well as save on the actual cost of the AR itself. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. I am not trying to make money off anyone. My receipt reflects I paid $1099+tax for a total of $1197.91 for the AR alone w/o the extras. If this ad is still posted I still have it.

The barrel has an A2 style profile, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, and Mp and HP tested. The upper is and is finished off with a MI flip up front sight and A2 flash hider.

Butt plate is slightly worn, but that's to be expected on a used 7mm Rem Magnum.  

This thing packs a punch and will drop any animal you want to hunt in North America.

And the good thing about this cartridge is that it is actually in stock everywhere as opposed to some other calibers.

I haven't seen a Model 70 in ANY condition go for less than $550 on Any auction sites so with this one in great shape, I am listing it at $575.  If you were ever going to get a Winchester Model 70 but didn't want to pay the $900-$1200 new price, this is your chance.  If it doesn't sell by next Friday, I will take it off and list on an auction site.

Let me know if you have any questions.  If you can muster up $450 and then work out soome type of ammo deal, that would work for me too."

made in october of 1953 according to date stamp. 
painted camo since original wood finish was, well... gone completely. has a fiber optic front site (with allen wrench in toolkit to adjust elevation) and cocking knob peep sight made by josh smith at smith-sights.com. cleaning rod included.
i still have original rear sight leaf and spring. bore is a mirror, also includes sling, tool kit with sight drifter added, ammo pouch, and limbsaver recoil pad.
my price is now firm. the ammo alone costs $125 plus shipping online and the rifle in original condition goes for $170-200. the sights go for 108 total for front and back. i figure taking a total of $178 off is pretty fair. i dont have to sell it. you basically pay for the sights and most of the ammo and get the rest of the ammo and the rifle for free. will need to see indiana i.d., face to face only. i will not ship to nigeria or some place like that. cash is the only acceptable payment. i will not accept $50 or $100 bills for my protection. almost got burned on that once but luckily i had a bill checker pen. no longer do, so no bills larger than $20 please.

I bought this combo for $150 a couple years ago and used it for a few trips to the range.  It has 200-300 rounds through it, all CCI MiniMags.  Later I decided I prefer the original wood stock and lightweight barrel over the improved accuracy, so this has been sitting unused for a quite a while.  On MidwayUSA it had 4.2/5.0 stars when it was available.  It's fairly easy to install (requires only a screwdriver and possibly a mallet for installing the barrel) and should fit any Ruger 10/22.

Asking $80 obo, also interested in trades (see below)

Manufacturer's description:
This stock and barrel combo offers match grade accuracy without the cost of a custom build. The stock has many of the features found on high priced centerfire target stocks, including double palm swells, a high comb and raised checkering. All stocks come standard with a quality recoil pad and Uncle Mike's QD swivel studs. By combining special bore & groove ratios with the Bentz Match chamber and recessed target crown the included barrel provides excellent accuracy with a variety of target or standard ammo."
