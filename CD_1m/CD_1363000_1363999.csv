There are no scuffs,scratches or marks except on cylinder where it turns in circle. Comes with scope,rings and scope mount which all cost over $200 alone. 
I'm still looking for rear sight that was misplaced when mount was installed, mount uses existing holes and is easily switched back and forth. Also comes with 50 rounds of hollow point ammo,
I've seen this 41 listed from $600-$1000 dep. on condition without the extras 
I'm just wanting a different gun for carry purposes not looking to give this one away but willing to work with you
LOWERED THE CASH PRICE TO $700 FOR QUICK SALE and due to not finding the rear sight, new rear sight is $56 but still looking for original, it can't be used if optics are installed anyway."

No parts missing. 30rd Troy Battlemag rebuild kits available to ship today! These are exactly the same as standard Battlemags only disassembled.  
I accept PayPal ""gift"" payments or Postal Money Orders.

Super Fast Shipping!  Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate.  All items ship via USPS priority mail.  

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.
 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits!  Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

This tactical AK pistol is is made in the world-famous weapon plant in Radom Poland. Chamberred in 7.62x39 caliber with a 9.25” barrel and no rear stock. Poland AKs are better than Russian, Yugo and Romania ones. I have 2 of these, 1 I send SBR paper work already. This one I am selling, I installed Tapco Tactical Quad Rail and Echo 93 single point sling adaptor. Including the single point sling as well. The added stuff costs me over $120 and time to install them properly, but they are well worthy, just see how cool it is after the changes. 

Muzzle flash is suppressed with a Krinkov-style flash hider, and a 30 round magazine (can remove the mag if 30 round mag is not accepted in buyer's state).

The gun weighs only 5 pounds and has an overall length of only 21 inches!

It includes a two-year warranty. Perfect for SBR projects or purely fun.

This tactical AK pistol is is made in the world-famous weapon plant in Radom Poland. Chamberred in 7.62x39 caliber with a 9.25” barrel and no rear stock. Poland AKs are better than Russian, Yugo and Romania ones. I have 2 of these, one I send SBR paper work already. This one I am selling is still pistol, I installed Tapco Tactical Quad Rail and Echo 93 single point sling adaptor. Including the single point sling as well. The added stuff costs me over $120 and time to install them properly, but they are well worthy, just see how cool it is after the changes. I test fired this pistol with 30 rounds to make sure flawless function. Other than that, it is pretty much new. 

Muzzle flash is suppressed with a Krinkov-style flash hider, and a 30 round magazine (can remove the mag if 30 round mag is not accepted in buyer's state).

Innovative Cam-Lock System Completely Removes Any Slop or Play Inherent with Collapsible Stocks
Will Fit Both a Mil-Spec or Commercial Sized Buffer Tube
Weighs Only 7.3 oz.
Rugged Enough to Pass a 36"", Fully Loaded Drop Test
The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the ultimate refinement in AR/M4 stock technology. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. Our stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle.

I have a very good condition Sig Sauer RCS custom.  This is the same thing as the C3 pistol except this one originates from the Sig Custom Shop.  It has an alloy frame with stainless steel slide with Sig's Nitron coating.  This is similiar to the DLC (Diamond Like Carbide) coating used on the Kahr line of handguns.  The front strap is checkered and it has the thin Sig Rosewood grips.  Three dot night sights. Two magazines, box, all paperwork.  The round count on this gun is approximately 60 for partial break-in with both ball and HP ammunition.  It is a very accurate handgun.  It has the commander length slide that is 4.25"" with the Officer's length grip.  It is similiar to the Colt CCO line of handguns, except for this one doesn't need all the upgrades.  This is a very well built concealed carry type of 1911 and is dependable.  No trades, cash only due to other projects in the works.  Can meet by appt. to show."

Below is info straight from Brownells site on these high quality magazines:

The Most Up-To-Date & Reliable Civilian Magazine Available

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups. 

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions."

info on gun... After WWI the newly formed Marlin Firearms Corporation started the serial numbers all over again. If your gun's barrel is marked, ""Marlin Firearms Corporation"" it is made in the mid to late 1920's. If it is marked, ""Marlin Firearms Co."" it was made in the early 1920's. If it has this same Marlin Firearms Co. marking on the barrel, but also has the ""bullseye"" in the buttstock, it is post1924-1930 era. All Marlins marked ""Model '93"" on the top tang were made after WWI. The catalogs designated the change from 1893 to '93 in around 1905, but too many receivers with the early marking were already made up, so the new stamped 93 after WWI"

Anyway, ive done some work to this rifle, it comes with BLACKHAWK quad rail, pistol grip, foward grip, and buttstock. Also have UTG 1x4 CQB scope which has really surprised me and is a good scope espically for the money, also have UTG iron sights, and Bushnell trophy reddot.

I'm just considering going to a bolt rifle, and seeing what interest is out there for this AR10. Mostly I want cash for it, but open to some trades. (BUIS not included). Located in Greensburg, In

I have an Armalite AR10 .308, with 12"" Daniel Defense lite rail, Rainier Arms 16"" ultramatch barrel (Shilen blank), Armalite tactical 2 stage trigger, and LMT Sopmod stock on Vltor buffer tube. FDE magpul MIAD grip and FDE Tango Down vertical grip. BCG and lower parts are all original factory Armalite parts. It has the improved bolt catch. I also have 7-20 round factory mags, and 1-10 round mag (maybe a 15 rounder also, i'll have to check). Mags are basically brand new. All of them except 2-20 rounders are brand new and have only had ammo loaded into them. I've shot the 10 round mag once, and the other 2-20 rounders once or twice each. Rifle is in perfect shape, and has only seen about 60 rounds of quality ammo, and well cleaned. I've had it over a year now and that's all i've shot it. One of the reasons i'm posting this. If you know how much the parts cost last year at ""normal prices"" then you know i'm asking reasonable value for the rifle. It's pretty much what I have in the rifle. 

I'm probably missing a couple things. All I can say if you're looking for an AR10, this is an impressive gun and will not disappoint. Comes with 1-20 round and 1-10 round mags (other 20 round mags will cost extra). I'm in no hurry at all to part with it, and will consider trades/trades+cash. Anyways, shoot me some offers. 
I won't sell mags unless the rifle goes too. I also have a brand new First Spear Scar heavy kit (seen here First Spear Scar Heavy Operator Carrying Kit (SHOCK) - Khaki) for mags/gear. It's had mags sitting in it and never used.

I have an antique production Winchester Model 1873 Saddle Ring Carbine, manufactured in 1892. Chambered in .44-40, 20” barrel, checkered oval finger grip dust cover, lever lock & of course a saddle ring. The rear is an adjustable flip up carbine sight with markings. It has not been “over cleaned” or tampered with & has that great vintage gun look. The stocks are walnut & are solid with no cracks or repairs. The condition is incredible especially considering the age. They are easy on the handling marks & fit the metal tight, a factory fit. The butt plate is the steel curved carbine style. Mechanically sound with a smooth tight crisp action, holds cock & half cock, loads, cycles, fires & ejects just fine with no issues. The bore has strong pronounced rifling with no rust or pitting issues, very nice. It appears to be correct & original. The Model 1873 is “the gun that won the west”; here is your chance to own a nice usable early Winchester and a piece of American history. I am asking $3500.00 obo, anyone that knows Winchester, knows these are hard to come by."

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M) series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface."

As stated above I'm thinking about selling this AR-15, it is an RRA with a heavy 5.56 barrel, This is a sweet looking, feeling and shooting gun.....It's been well kept and has had 350 rounds through it.....
As you can see, it has a nice quad rail with covers, an Eotech 552.A65 Holographic sight, an adjustable stock, a very smooth, light trigger job (not sure on specs, but very nice), sweet ergonomic foregrip, magpul flip up front and rear sights, a Magpul 30 round mag, a black recoil pad and a nice tactical sling...I'll also throw in this plastic carrying case and 300 rounds of Federal .223
NO, I don't want to sale the ammo by itself
I'm not desperate, so don't waste our time with silly offers, I have alot invested in this gun and will just keep it if no one wants it....but it is a quality gun....If you want or need to pay less we can start taking add-ons off if you'd like to make it more affordable

I especially like the Para-Ordnance line of LDA pistols, particularly the ones made in Canada, even if they are steel frame. Guys, I already have a 1911 and the only thing would get me to want another would be a killer combination of great sights, alloy frame and/or big capacity mags. 
I definitely do not like plastic guns.  I fiercely dislike the profiteers and outright gougers who are playing to the lyin' lefts attempts to drive good American citizens away from buying what they need because of crazy prices. I do prefer dao action or sa/da over 1911 style. Only can spend $600ish.

You are looking at a nice SIG SAUER. The P238 Special Edition Two-tone with Blackwood Grips. It’s just a fraction of the size of our full-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with blackwood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights. The SIG SAUER P238 comes with an extra magazine, and two different kinds of handle grips besides the originals which I took off. Both are real wood, one is Rosewood and the other not sure the wood but it is also very nice. It also comes with a holster so you may carry it in your pocket and a lockable hard case with original paper work. Lastly I have about 450 brass ball rounds of various brands and 38 brass/17 nickel casing hollow point rounds to go with this gun. I am asking $900 obo for the gun.  Feel free to contact me via text or call me at REDACTED."
