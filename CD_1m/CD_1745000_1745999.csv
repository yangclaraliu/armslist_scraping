AR-15 16"" 4140 CHROMOLY STEEL,  H-BAR,1:9 TWIST THREADED COMPETITION BARREL


DESCRIPTION:

These Barrels have been professionally developed for Accuracy and competition target shooting, a 16"" H-Bar which is more rigid will eliminate any vibration and improve barrel accuracy. Our H-Bar Competition barrels offer the accuracy of a bull barrel but the lighter weight approaching that of an M-4 Profile. H-Bar Profile for increased Strength, Rigidity, and Cooling, while Reducing weight compared to Standard 18-20"" bull barrels. Custom Machined from solid Bar Stock of Chrome-Moly Steel Hardened to 26-32 RC Spec and then Cryogenically Stress relieved and blued for prolonged accuracy under heavy use/competition.

Nitride Treated: Read about this process bieng better than Chrome lined bores
These barrels have been treated with a Black Nitride treatment. The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with Black Nitride have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, Black Nitride gives better corrosion protection. Additionally, Black Nitride is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as carburizing and carbonitriding. 

PERFORMANCE REVIEW:

Our H-Bar Barrels are capable of 1/2"" MOA 5 shot group at 100 Yards. This means all 5 shots will be touching. 



SPECIFICATIONS:

H Bar Fluted Profile
Nitride Lined Bore and exterior for superb corrosion resistance.

5.56 Nato chamber also accepts .223

Great Arisaka sporter professionally converted to 300 Savage. Conversion was done by a professional, and headspace checked on go nogo for safety. Action is smooth, and locks up with no binding or other issues. Bolt face is great. Bore has sharp rifling.

Receiver is from Nagoya Arsenal, and looks to be an early series production. 

Although not widely known outside of C&R circles, the Arisaka action is the strongest of any WW2 bolt actions! Among the many sources you can use to verify this is ""Hatcher's Notebook"" first printed in 1946 with additional editions later. The Arisaka was loaded up to 120,000 psi at which time the testing was stopped. All other military bolt actions started to have blown extractors at around 70,000 psi and started shedding locking lugs at around 90,000 psi. Some of the bolt actions tested were the 03 Springfield, 1917 Enfield, and the German 98 Mauser. He sites a story where kids were loading and firing .35 Remingtons in an Arisaka chambered for 30/06. They used a mallet to force the bolt closed, they fired 3 rounds before the rifle failed. (No one was killed.)"

AR-15 16"" 4140 CHROMOLY STEEL MELONITE FINISH,  M4 PROFILE,1:9 TWIST THREADED COMPETITION BARREL


DESCRIPTION:

These Barrels have been professionally developed for Accuracy and competition target shooting, a 16"" M4 which is lighter in design and  improves barrel accuracy due to quicker target acquisition on the move. Our M4 Competition barrels offer the accuracy of a heavy barrel but the lighter weight approaching that of an M-4 ""pencil"" Profile. M4 Profile for increased Strength, and Cooling, while Reducing weight compared to Standard 18-20"" heavy barrels. Custom Machined from solid Bar Stock of Chrome-Moly Steel Hardened to 26-32 RC Spec and then Cryogenically Stress relieved and nitride/melonite finish for prolonged accuracy under heavy use/competition.

Nitride Treated: Read about this process bieng better than Chrome lined bores
These barrels have been treated with a Black Nitride treatment. The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with Black Nitride have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, Black Nitride gives better corrosion protection. Additionally, Black Nitride is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as carburizing and carbonitriding. 

PERFORMANCE REVIEW:

Our M4 Barrels are capable of 1/2"" MOA 5 shot group at 100 Yards. This means all 5 shots will be touching.

Year: 1882
Cal: .38 Colt
Finish: Nickel
Barrel: 3.5""
Grips: hard rubber original, one is chipped

Overall finish is good. I believe it is refinished, but it may not be.

The pistol does need some work. The cylinder stop does not engage and it does not function in single action.

This pistol is however in very nice physical condition and would make a beautiful presentation piece or you could send it to the gunsmith and have a working heirloom."

The gunsmithing on this gun was first rate.  The DA/SA pull is buttery smooth; almost as good as my Python.

The blueing is good, but not perfect. There is some minor wear and the turn ring is pronounced (for what it's worth, S&W will re-blue for a couple hundred).  There is absolutely no pitting, rust or other issues.  As noted, I have fired this revolver and it works great!!  It is a terrific range gun and will shoot .38's all day long.  It is a K frame so though it can certainly handle .357's (and I have shot my fair share of these loads in it), it's light weight is probably overall slightly better suited to .38; if shooting a lot of rounds.  Given that .38 is a cheaper load, all the better.  The wood target grips are in really excellent condition.  Just a really nice piece.

You must of course have a current FOID, with matching drivers license and I reserve the right to not sell this gun to someone I deem unsuitable.  The price is firm as I do not have to sell it."

AR-15 16"" 4140 CHROMOLY STEEL,  H-BAR,1:10 TWIST THREADED COMPETITION BARREL


DESCRIPTION:

These Barrels have been professionally developed for Accuracy and competition target shooting, a 16"" H-Bar which is more rigid will eliminate any vibration and improve barrel accuracy. Our H-Bar Competition barrels offer the accuracy of a bull barrel but the lighter weight approaching that of an M-4 Profile. We have them Fluted for increased Strength, Rigidity, and Cooling, while Reducing weight compared to Standard 18-20"" bull barrels. Custom Machined from solid Bar Stock of Chrome-Moly Steel Hardened to 26-32 RC Spec and then Cryogenically Stress relieved and blued for prolonged accuracy under heavy use/competition.

Nitride Treated: Read about this process bieng better than Chrome lined bores
These barrels have been treated with a Black Nitride treatment. The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with Black Nitride have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, Black Nitride gives better corrosion protection. Additionally, Black Nitride is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as carburizing and carbonitriding. 



PERFORMANCE REVIEW:

Our H-Bar Barrels are capable of 1/2"" MOA 5 shot group at 100 Yards. This means all 5 shots will be touching.

AR-15/10 .223/.308 Screaming Banshee Muzzle Brake Pressure Reducer 1/2x28 or 5/8x24 Pitch Thread
Product Description:  This can brake is based off of the Russian Krinkov design, it is in essence a suppressor with 1 baffle and an open conical face, it does not suppress sound but it does suppress flash and also directs all concussion down range at a 20 degree angle. This is important if you are defending in close quarters, a regular ""bird cage"" will direct concussion virtually 180 degrees from the muzzle thus blasting your squad with a physical concussion report. 

Specs:

Industrial Grade Steel
Heat Treated
3 piece Krinkov design
Solid Machined Construction
Black Oxide Finish
Reduced back pressure
Measures 3.4""
1/2""x28 or 5/8x24 Pitch
Overview

Black oxide finish, solid precision machined construction. The AR muzzle brake will reduce recoil & climb which will improve shooting and control. The AR Krinkov style muzzle brake redirects propellant gasses and reduces recoil and flash dramatically. Wraps around your threaded barrel and threads on 1/2""x28 pitch. This muzzle brake is great for an AR pistol, SPR, and a SBR AR15."

A. Distinctive military style markings: on various components  closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols.

I've got a gen 3 glock 19 with a custom cerakote job on it. Comes with box 2 clips & all paper work. I fired 1x33 round clip thru the gun to test out a 33rd Ko-rean clip, and only sighted it in after I coated it. Its as close to brand new as you can get.

Please keep in mind that cerakote is an ADD-ON feature. I'm sure you don't get up in the worning to work for free, and I don't cerakote for a living to work for free either. I've got 12 hrs in the shop plus materials invested in this thing and I'm not just gonna chalk it up as recreation, and neither would you. If you brought a glock into my shop to get cerakoted, I charge $250 for a 3 color camo pattern. Do the math; 
Gen 3 Glock 19 = $500
3 color camo job = $250

The only way you can get a gun like this for $650 is if you found a glock for $400 & brought it in & paid me $250 to coat it for you, and even then you'd still have to pay for gas and do your time on the waiting list.  This way you can save time & money and have a one of a kind, BAD-ASS glock that all your friends will envy!
