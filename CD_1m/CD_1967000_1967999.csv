I've shot: PDX1, Ranger T, Winchester White box, Remington green box and UMC, American Eagle, CCI Blazer and a few more I'm forgetting.

The finish is excellent with zero damage or scuff marks.

It's been cleaned after every shooting session. Always oiled immediately following cleaning. It's not over-oiled.

Comes with FNX-40, three magazines, three backstraps, Blackhawk XDM holster (fits/releases/re-holsters perfectly), Blackhawk shoulder harness, 2 Blackhawk double stack magazine holders for the belt or the shoulder harness and a Old Faithful Holsters IWB hoslter.

There is one issue with the pistol. The small plastic tab that retains the interchangeable backstraps broke. So the most comfortable backstrap was installed with a small amount of epoxy to hold it in place. It's been like this since 200 rounds, so there won't be a problem.

I'm asking $580 for the pistol and accessories. $525 for just the pistol. Most gun shops are right around $680 with tax and fee.

Must be willing to sign a contact stating that the pistol is being sold to you and that you can legally purchase a handgun in Wisconsin. This is just to protect myself in case it's stolen or something along those lines."

The 9x18 Police cartridge has been based on pre-WW2 9x18mm Ultra ammunition, developed in Germany by the Geco and Walther on request from Luftwaffe (German Air Forces). The 9x18 cartridge offered about a maximum power which could be used in relatively compact and lightweight blowback pistols.  Only about 2 000 of 9x18 PP Super pistols were purchased by Bavarian Police during 1970s. The Walther PP Super is an all-steel, blowback operated, double action pistol. Unlike its predecessor, the Walther PP, the PP Super featured an external slide stop lever, and a manual decocker on the left side of the slide, which, when pushed down, locked the firing pin and released the hammer, and then automatically returned to the 'fire' position. There is no manual safety, but the PP Super has a firing pin safety, and was intended to be carried with the loaded chamber and hammer down, ready to be fired in double action mode. The magazine catch is located on the side of the grip, next to trigger guard.
The 9x18mm Police/Ultra is NOT compatible with Soviet 9x18 Makarov PM ammunition.

The Benelli Cordoba is a lightning-fast 12-gauge shotgun or 20-gauge shotgun, especially built for hunting. Inspired by the high volume of dove shooting found around Cordoba, Argentina, the designers of Benelli shotguns engineered this one with all the advanced features of a serious sporting clays model. Incorporated into the Cordoba is the 10-mm tapered sporting rib favored by competition shooters and porting to keep barrel climb to a minimum
The ComforTech® stock cushions the blow when ammo isn’t measured in boxes, but by cases in an afternoon. The ComforTech® system also helps reduce barrel climb and puts the shooter back on target 69% faster, so that the Cordoba just may be the fastest field gun ever built. A Crio® barrel and extended Crio® choke tubes put more pellets on target. And the whole package is finished in matte black GripTight® coating or Realtree MAX-4®, so a reflected flash won’t give you away."

The Fire fighter Tribute Edition commemorates not only the actual firefighter, but also the public trust that Americans place in all firefighters who answer a call of distress. The original art for this rifle has been cut by hand engraver Rob Bunting and through a mechanical transfer the scenes and tribute text is impressed directly onto the nickel plated receiver cover retaining all of the hand engraved elements of the original.

On the right side is the text IN TRIBUTE TO AMERICA'S BRAVEST with special bannering in 24 kt gold plating high lightening the words America's Bravest. The main panel image depicts a firefighter rescuing a child from the flame style scroll in the background. The front panel is a 24 kt gold plated replica of the American flag with a gold border outlining both scenes.

On the left side is the iconic Saint Florian cross, a symbol of protection and a badge of honor, with 24 kt gold plate and the unique flame style scroll pattern on the edges. In the front left panel is the text SERVICE VALOR COURAGE in 24 kt gold plated bannering and below a firefighter's helmet with shield number 343 signifying specifically those firefighters killed on September 11, 2001, but also representing all within the brotherhood of firefighters, career and volunteer, who have perished in heroic service to others.

As a final identifying image the American Walnut wooden stock has a replica of an aerial truck laser etched and hand painted to simulate the recognizable colors and gold leaf lettering. The American made Henry Golden Boy Firefighter Tribute Edition honors all those who are called to duty on a daily basis to help those in peril.

The Firefighter Tribute Edition is outfitted with a 20"" octagonal barrel topped with classic buckhorn sights just like all rifles in the award-winning Golden Boy family. Caliber .22 S/L/LR."

I would be interested in a FN FNP/X/S, Ruger or colt single action .45 LC revolver, OR any quality 1911 (no Taurus)"

This was a TALO exclusive. Not a thing wrong with it, but since my other WC is returning w/some custom touches, I have no need for two of them.

Colt carbon steel Series 70 Government model, designed in collaboration with Wiley Clapp. Has 5"" National Match barrel, Novak gold bead front sight and Novak wide notch rear sight, 1918 thumb safety, high swept beavertail grip safety w/palmswell. Custom metal-work by Pete Single including 25lpi front strap checkering with high enhanced trigger guard cut, matching checkered bar stock mainspring housing, rounded at heel, fully beveled magwell. Wiley Clapp designed tactical oval wood grips. Will come in the box w/2 Colt 7rd magazines, all paperwork, including the Davidson's warranty card for you to fill out.

Simply put, this is the finest 1911 that I've carried. Wiley Clapp designed it to be the perfect concealed carry 1911, and as he said, ""everything you need, and nothing you don't!"". Only 20 rounds through it for function testing. It shows some slight holster wear on the high spots, and I've tried to capture that in the pictures.

Will consider trade for Armalite AR10."

=============
Stoeger’s new Double Defense side-by-side shotgun is a straightforward, rugged and reliable home defense shotgun. Ideal for use in tight quarters and tense situations, the Stoeger Double Defense with its traditional break-action and short, efficient design is easy to load and quick to deploy in an emergency. 

     A double-barrel shotgun has been the defensive firearm of choice for generations, but Stoeger has added practical, up-to-date features to the “tried-and-true” double gun. The Double Defense is chambered for 2-3/4- and 3-inch shells, in either 12- or 20-gauge. The tactical-length 20-inch ported barrels feature fixed, improved cylinder chokes. The fast, single-trigger design and convenient, tang-mounted automatic safety makes the Stoeger Double Defense ideal for home security use.

     The Double Defense gun is outfitted with a green, fiber-optic front sight and comes standard with two Picatinny Rail accessory mounts: one on the receiver for red-dot sights and a second factory-installed rail under the barrels for attaching targeting lasers or tactical lights. All metal surfaces are finished in matte blue and come complete with non-reflective matte black hardwood stock and forearm.

I got these from a good friend who is a contractor overseas who stopped wearing them to shave some weight from his loadout and offered them to me. There are a couple places on the carrier where you can see a little wear but the inserts are in perfect condition(In one of the pics it looks like a hole in one but its a bug). The front insert was made in 2009 and the rear 2010 pretty sure they have a 5 year warranty on them from the manufacturer but dont hold me to that. The exact model is HML3000-3A, pretty sure IIIA rating is the highest rating you can get with soft armor. It stops 9mm FMJ@1400 fps and 44 MAG Semi Wadcutter@1400fps(Keep in mind your typical 9mm fmj from a handgun is around 1100 fps).

Description
See life in high-definition. Leupold® Golden Ring® 10x 42mm HD Binoculars offer optical performance that's stunning even to the most sophisticated binoculars users. With calcium-fluoride, high-definition lenses, their performance is supercharged with absolute clarity. Leupold Golden Ring HD binoculars feature superb resolution and performance with optimal light management thanks to Leupold's exclusive Index Matched Lens System®.
Leupold's DiamondCoat™ on exterior lens surfaces provides outstanding scratch resistance. Plasma-coated prisms work with the lens system to maximize light transmission for supreme clarity, contrast, and color fidelity. The interpupillary distance-lock feature locks in the distance between your eyes, so no adjustments are necessary during use and you can easily use your binoculars one-handed. Finally, the second-generation argon/krypton waterproofing is guaranteed for life.
These high-definition binoculars also feature eyecups that can be twisted up or down to provide proper eye relief for their use with or without eyeglasses. Leupold's signature brown armor coating allows you to use these binoculars in the most rugged environments. Full lifetime guarantee.
From humble immigrant beginnings, Leupold grew, based on a promise of quality, to become a classic American company. In 1907, Fred Leupold set up a one-man shop at 5th and Oak streets in Portland, Ore., to repair surveying equipment. He was joined by his brother-in-law, Adam Voelpel, and later by inventor John Cyprian Stevens, and the foundations for a century of success were in place.
During Leupold's second half-century, the company has focused heavily on the sports optics business. Leupold's presence in the hunting and shooting market expands, and finally dominates, with innovative optics and features that are now legendary among hunters, shooters, and outdoors enthusiasts. Many of the industry's standards - nitrogen waterproofing, the Duplex® reticle, and more - are Leupold creations."
