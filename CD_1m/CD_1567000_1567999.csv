For sale is a hard to find Smith & Wesson M&P 10 AR-10 chambered in .308 WIN/7.62x51 NATO. This was previously made for military and law enforcement use exclusively, so I bought it as soon as it was available to civilians. .

There have been 315 total rounds fired at distances of 100, 200, 500 and 1000 yards with a great deal of accuracy.

I can have the original finish restored at buyer’s request with no additional charge. This rifle has gotten a lot of attention at the long distance range, so you may want leave it as is.

The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 M150 Rifle Combat Optic Scope provides fast target acquisition and superb optical clarity.

At less than 6 ounces, the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 M-150 Waterproof Rifle Combat Optic Sight is perfect for fast-moving tactical teams operating in close quarters or for speed-oriented competition venues.

If you're frustrated by the lack of brass available anywhere here's a great package of pistol brass in several calibers. They are reloadable and overwhelmingly brass with a few steel and nickel cases mixed in. They are a mix of maker headstamps.  Already polished saving you a lot of time & effort. Primers need to be removed. These did not lay in all sorts of weather on the ground on an outside range. If I don't sell it here I'll take it to the next large gunshow to get rid of it. This is your chance. I went through each caliber inspecting, reinspecting, and counting to make an honest effort to throw out bad brass. I'm throwing in thirty-nine, 9mm (9X18) Makarov steel cases.

I WILL NOT BREAK THE PACKAGE UP TO SELL SPECIFIC CALIBERS. Serios offers considered, but not half price.
Package consists of:
380 Auto - 195

how about we flag the dealer hiding behind private sales and gouging customers on ammo. Hrmm I am not sure how that works when your a dealer or work for one, like can you take from the shop and sell privately? or do you just ""buy them"" on paper from the shop if they sell privately....I am sure your allowed a few but just seems a little jenky to me, I could be wrong. Maybe you let them know when they say they are interested they have to come in and fill out paper work.   But then again I think it all sounds like a Jeff Foxworthy joke.....you know your a gun dealer if your offering 10's of thousands of rounds of ammo at triple the msrp you bought it for when it is available for purchase online.

Brand new, never fired...just as if you bought it from a local store.
Got this gun in as a trade on a pistol I was selling. Not needing it, so I'm trying to get rid of it.
Asking = $525 FIRM
this is very reasonable...1) Glocks are hard to find in this economy... 2) A brand new Gen4 Glock, you won't find for less than $539 list price....that's without TAX!
Save good money and buy this for less than list price!

Can also do a package deal...
Have 2 extra 17rd mags...and 2 33rd mags...can let go as a package for $675
(note: buy the package and I'll throw in 2 boxes (100rds) of FMJ brass target ammo)

If you want just the gun, I also have several boxes of 9mm target ammo I can add for more cash! The ammo alone is almost IMPOSSIBLE to find!

Pics: I will take some photos and post them..I just don't have the gun with me right now. The gun is NIB though- so I'm sure you know what it looks like!

FIRST COME FIRST SERVED!

Will need one of the following to purchase...
1) Concealed Carry license
2) Pistol Purchase Permit
***MUST ALSO BE WILLING TO SIGN SIMPLE BILL OF SALE..this just shows transfer of ownership! Just trying to remain a COMPLETELY legal transaction!

Beretta JXC9F21 PX4 Storm Compact 9mm 3.2"" 15+1 Poly Grip/Frame Black

Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Storm Compact the
ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols. Built around the same modular
concept as the full size Px4, the compact model features the locked breech
with rotating barrel system and chrome-lined barrel with a deeply recessed
combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling, but with a shorter and
proportioned slide and grip. The durable polymer frame is
fiberglass-reinforced with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail and a modular grip
system for a custom fit. It has a manual safety and an ambidextrous slide
stop lever. The Bruniton non-reflective black coating is offer superior
resistance against corrosion and wear.

concept so these pistols can be adapted to different needs. The Px4 Storm
Sub-Compact uses a locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more
compact and lighter weight system. The stainless steel barrel requires less
maintenance and is corrosion resistant. An ambidextrous manual safety
lever, reversible magazine release button and interchangeable back straps
make shooting the Px4 Sub-Compact easy for all shooters. The light frame
employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced polymer with a milstd-1913
picatinny rail for an array of aftermarket accessories.  The Bruniton
non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion
and wear.

The top of Savage's line of firearms. 26"" fluted stainless steel barrel, stainless steel receiver, Accu-trigger, oversized bolt handle, Laminated stock with beaver-tail forend. 

I have put about 50 rounds through it. It is clean and the metal finish is flawless. The stock is flawless except for a 3/16"" X 1/32"" dent in the underside of the wrist (where your fingers wrap around). The owners manual and trigger adjustment tool are included. I do not have the box. If you want the lock that came with it, I'll throw that in too.

The 12 currently is sporting a Seals 8-32 X 50 mm, 30mm tube scope with red & blue illuminated range finding reticle, side focus (parallax adjustment) and target knobs (1/8"" adjustments). It's mounted with Leupold standard rings and bases. The rifle is zeroed for 100 yds. It is capable of shooting sub - 1/2"" groups repeatedly. I know, I've seen me do it...

New, this rifle sold for $1100.00 retail. The scope sells for $450.00. Ring and bases retail at around $80.00. That would be a $1630 investment. If you'd like it as is, with the optics, the price is $1100.00. If you'd prefer to mount your own optics, the price would be $750.00 for the rifle alone. Shipping is $35.00 (It's heavy!).



I will consider trades for a high accuracy .308 bolt gun, but I think that's about all I'm interested in...

Check out how good the ejection of shells is... hate to be a guy on my right! hahaa


What's Included:

***20"" Flat-Top Heavy Barrel Upper... Barrel Stamp Reads: ""B MP 5.56 NATO 1/9  HBAR"" ***

____* Chrome Lined for superior accuracy and wear
____* 1/9 twist has been proven to be the best/most accurate twist for the different Grain Levels of ammunition- from the cheap stuff to good stuff... chews through it all with not even so much as a hiccup. 
____* Factory Powder Coated dark-dark Grey Barrel and Site/Gas Block so absolutely NO reflections when stalking or in the stand
____* Forward Assist, Shell Deflector, and Ejection Port Cover... M4 Feed Ramps.
____* Triangle end cap
____* Black ""rubberized"" sling/strap holder



***2.5-10 x 40 ""Hooded"" Mil-Dot Red/Green Illuminating Scope, Laser (Red), and Reflex/Red Dot w/ Quick Release***

_____* Rear Ocular adjustment for those who wear glasses
_____* Has the .223 ""Bullet-Drop"" Compensator dial 
_____*5 levels of illumination in both Red & Green- so 10 in all: From Very Light to Super Bright!
_____*Etched Glass cross hairs are Black when not Illuminated 
_____* 4 Mil-Dots Up, 4 Down, 4 Left, 4 Right
_____* Reflex/Red Dot is canted to the left side of the scope so ""target acquisition"" is IMMEDIATE as soon as you shoulder the rifle (can be shifted to the right side if desired) 
_____* Protective caps included



*** 1 inch Riser for the scope ***



*** Bi- Pod ***

____* Cants Left and Right
____* Each Leg has a standard locking position but Each Leg can also be locked at any given length for different height-leveled terrain
____*  Bi-Pod can quickly be removed in seconds by loosening ONE screw- no tools required and screw DOES NOT come off Bi-Pod so no fear of losing it in the field



*** Genuine ""Real Tree"" Furniture ***

_____* All three pieces: Forearm, Pistol Grip, and Trap-Door Stock w/ Buffer, Spring, and Tube (Stock not in the pics)
_____* Dual metal heat shield inserts



*** Removable Carry Handle ***

_____* Vertical and Horizontal ""doping""  
_____* I think it's a Colt but could be mistaken




Now the Cherry-On-Top.... The BCG (and Charging Handle) IS INCLUDED!!! Great Staking... Cocks the hammer with the bolt not the firing pin like some BCG's... Rear underneath of the bolt is about an inch long- not quit full-auto length but not skimpy at all. (Bottom Bolt in the picture)

****Everything is in Great Condition****

****** Price is FIRM, BUT I'll take $50 off the price if someone has a BLACK pistol grip and trap door stock or 6 position to include with the cash***** 6 piece must have the spring, tube, buffer, castle nut, plate, ect...********

********* I'm open to trades but it has to be something really nice... like a Norinco AK w/ the paratrooper under-folding stock, AR pistols, Baby Eagles, Berettas with threaded barrels, ect.... I know, I know- the Norinco is not that nice but compared to the AK garbage that is made now and is out there, it is what it is...********"

It is in rough shape, you can tell that it has been used pretty well. Does not come with a magazine. It is being sold as is. For what the gun is worth we do not really want to take the time to get it checked out when it is so inexpensive. So buyer is assuming the risk. Come in before the 15th and we will sell it to you for 55 dollars plus tax. Buyer has to pas a NICS background check.

I have looked from gun shop to gun shop for years and carefully selecting and inspecting various Mosins. Snatched this one as soon as I found it. All matching numbers, not re-arsenaled, crown not counter-bored, first year production 1944 and looks to have never seen combat or fired much at all. Bore, receiver, barrel, everything looks like a new rifle that's been stored for decades. Cleaned the cosmoline completely down to the pins and then coated with CLP before storing in my gun safe.

Here is the component cost to me -- 

Mosin M44 - $275

ATI Monte Carlo Stock - $70
Brass Stacker See Thru Scout Scope Mount - $65
NcSTAR 2.5x30mm Long-eye relief scope - $40
UTG Tactical/Sniper Profile Adjustable Height Bipod - $30
Mossy Oak Buttstock Rifle Cartridge Holder - $10
7.62x54R Laser Cartridge Boresighter - $10
18 Steel Mosin Stripper Clips - $20

Everything included is brand new, never used. I haven't had a chance yet to go to the range with it and haven't even had a chance to mount the Brass Stacker and scope. Rifle has never been fired since I bought it.

Cost to me comes up to $520. And I will be willing to sell it at that exact price, no lower. What you get is an insanely rugged/reliable and accurate scout rifle that shoots a massively powerful deer round that's cheaper than 22LR in today's ammo panic climate!!! Please do not message me with lower offers than my asking price, they will not be responded to.

Buyer pays the transfer fee [$25] at my FFL - Northeast Trading Co. in North Attleboro.

I need 10mm, .41 Mag, .380 ACP","NW, Las Vegas, Nevada",Offer,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 28, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 11 boxes of Fiocchi .40 S&W 180 gr FMJ factory ammo, item number 40Q180, 1 box of Winchester .40 S&W 155 gr Silvertip hollow point factory ammo, item number X40SWSTHP, and 3 boxes of Federal Premium .223 Rem 50 grain Speer TNT hollow point P223V1.

I want to trade for 10mm, .41 mag, .380, maybe even .22 LR ammo. FACTORY ammo only, no reloads please. We can work out an equitable trade depending on what you have.

I would also consider trading the ammo plus cash for a Glock 23C, Glock 19 or Glock 17, Gen 3 or 4, if the price was right.

I'd prefer trades but I'll entertain cash offers only if you want the whole lot.

I probably won't respond if you ask me to trade for ammo I don't have listed or a pistol other than the Glocks I mentioned. I'm not trying to be rude, but there are certain things I need and others I don't. Thanks."
