This rifle is outfitted with multiple high end upgrades from JP Rifles, LaRue Tactical, Harris, and Kahntrol.  This rifle is was recently finished.  It was originally going to be my personal long range rifle but I need the cash.  It has not been fired in it's current build.  Please contact me with any questions you may have.

I am asking for $3,250.  Please take into account that JP Rifles sells their AMCS Rifle without the upgrades for $4k.  It is not a 20"" LTR Barrel and it does not come with three 10 round magazines or the Harris Bipod.  This rifle will include the original Rem 700p LTR Stock and a hard carry case.

I am willing to ship this rifle to an FFL after payment has been made.  Details on the rifle are listed below:

The Build

I.  Remington 700P Light Tactical Rifle, LTR
	-Caliber:  .308 WIN
	-Barrel Length:  20"" (Fluted)
	-Standard Twist:  12""
II.  Larue Tactical Remington 700 MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny Rail with built in 20 MOA
III.  Kahntrol Clamp On Muzzle Break
IV.  Harris Bipod, 6-9"" Leg Notch Swivel Version
V.  JP Enterprises' Advanced Modular Chassis System (AMCS) with three 10 Round Magazines

Remington 700p LTR

Model 700P LTR (Light Tactical Rifle), chambered for .308 Win.; features a slimmed down stock to improve portability and reduce weight. The flutes in the 20"" LTR not only assist in weight reduction and heat dissipation, but are engineered to enhance barrel rigidity for pinpoint accuracy.

Like its big brother, the LTR stock is laid up around an aircraft-grade aluminum bedding block that runs up the entire length of the receiver. It has a textured, black, non-reflective finish and comes with sling swivel studs.

 JP Advanced Modular Chassis System™

The JP AMCS™ is the direct result of years of long-range shooting experience. After trying another aftermarket chassis, I realized that I wanted the vastly superior ergonomics of a gas-operated rifle such as the AR-15/AR-10 platforms for my bolt gun. The JP chassis delivers the best of all worlds. The cheek piece can be raised to accommodate an AR-15-type optics mounting system like the JPFTSM-30 with the line of bore relative to shoulder identical to the gas gun. Combined with the palm shelf grip, you have the most comfortable chassis system with the most linear impulse feel and reduced muzzle rise possible. For a more traditional bolt gun setup, you need only lower the cheek piece and use your preferred standard height rings.

The JP AMCS™ is completely machined from 6061 T6 aircraft-grade aluminum with the mil-standard black hard coat anodizing process. The chassis will accept any Remington 700 right-hand short action or clone thereof as well as Savage short action rifles. The ambidextrous, extended magazine release does not require the operator to relinquish the shooting grip to perform a magazine change. The chassis includes the precision type tactical grip with palm shelf, fully adjustable folding butt stock, QD studs for bipod or sling systems and is also designed to accept the Accu-Shot Monopod system. We sell JP magazines that will hold 10 rounds of any cartridge based on the 308 Winchester with an OAL of 2.820 or less. The JP magazine can also feed 7 rounds of short mag with slight modification."

Not interested in trades.

Here is what it is:

""The Huldra 5.56 Midlength Evo-Slank 14.5 Upper (Ultra Lite Piston Upper) is a .625"" lite profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. With the combination of the .625 ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution hand guard, and the new reduced radius permanently affixed flash hider, we now have the lightest dedicated piston upper on the market.

Product Details:
Shoot silently without the suppressor!

This is a cartridge that contains no gunpowder. The little 20g. bullet is solely propelled by the powerful Eley priming mix. For this reason, it does not generate any significant pressure. Due to the lack of noise when fired, the .22 Colibri may be shot indoors, even in the living room, provided a proper back stop is available. The .22 Colibri may be used to eliminate pests such as rats. It may be fired in any .22 LR rifle or pistol, however, it will not cycle the slide or bolt of semi-automatic guns. Has a Solid Point Made of Lead.

Specifications:
Manufacturer: Kel-Tec
Model: 12 Gauge 3”
Caliber: KSG
Capacity: 6+6+1
Method of Operation: Pump
Overall Length 26.1 inches
Barrel Length: 18.5 inches
Weight: 6.9 lbs, 8.5 lbs
Condition: Used

Product Details:
The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Extra:
Includes MBUS Front and Rear Sight
Includes Surefire Z70 Picatinny Rail Covers

Features:
Zytel (Glass Reinforced Nylon) Grip and Stock

I know for a fact that the dramatic increase in private ammunition sales has concerned many city officials in Ohio and Michigan. I've personally taken call after call from citizens complaining about people making ammo transactions on public and private property. There have been more than a few incidents of private people selling to people with firearm disabilities (under age, felony conviction, etc). I guarantee those people will be made examples of just to further someone's political career. 

Know the law and ask the buyer the appropriate questions. Ask to see their ID to check they're age. If the buyer ""just doesn't seem right"", don't sell to them. I know for an absolute fact that local, state and federal law enforcement keeps a close eye on Armslist. People repeatedly selling large quantities have already been targeted. They will definitely be tested and probably already are. If you're consistently selling ammo you better be collecting local and state sales tax and declaring to the IRS because that's their fallback plan. They'll get any way they can.

Google anonymous email and learn about it. 

Armslist allows you to see everything a single buyer has for sale. Makes it very easy to see who selling for profit. If you're selling large quantities, use as many Armslist accounts as you can and make sure to use different IP addresses when you setup and access them. If you haven't done this already and have more than a box or two of ammo for sale, then you're on law enforcement's  radar.

Research the buyer. Check the header info when you receive an email. Google their email address - if it comes up with zero hits it's probably new. Not a good sign. 

I hope this was helpful."

When I look up the serial it appears to be from 1915. Unfortunately I have little knowledge of this particular gun. He was born in 1927 so that makes him at least the second owner I believe this was one of his first guns other than a rifle that I'm keeping. The grips have obviously been changed, the magazine is original (only one included). Unfortunatley it appears he did some touchup to the bluing at some point. I'm happy to answer questions if you can be specific on what I should look for and describe for you or I can take additional pictures. The gun seems to be in working order but I can't get my hands on any 32acp rounds to try it out. In general my grandpa didn't use any of his guns for probably the last 20-25 years but before that he had them to enjoy, not so much to collect. There is no visible rust, there is pitting that you'd expect with age. Make an offer, if it sounds good it can be yours. I'm not interested in trade except for a 24-30 gun safe but this won't make that an even trade."

I have added a flash suppressor on it and got rid of the flimsy POS Kel-Tec front sight. I added a Mag-Pul flip up front sight to still allow the folding capability. I am asking 650.00 if you want to keep that front sight on it. If you are planning on adding optics or sights of your own I would be willing to knock the price down to 600.00 without the Mag-Pul front sight. To sweeten the deal I am throwing in 3 factory Glock magazines; 2 of them are 15 round mags and one is a 22 round mag.  Since I am going all 9 mm in my collection I have some ammo for sell as well. I have 78 rounds of Winchester white box 165 grn/ 40 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 165 grn/ 150 rounds of Lawman SPEER 180 grn/ and 7 rounds of CCI 40 S&W- which I dont know what that is. TOTAL 275 ROUNDS. If you want the ammo by itself I will sell it for 120$. If you buy the Kel-Tec too, I will lower the ammo cost to only 90$ that would be added to the gun purchase. So if my math is correct (Kel-Tec w ammo and front sight = $740.00) (Kel-tec without front sight and with ammo = $690.00) (Ammo by itself = $120.00. call or text (for oh fiv ate six tree for six tree svn)"

Only had one clip fired through it. I'm pretty sure this is the ONLY 1911 that comes from the factory with a threaded barrel, meaning the barrel fits perfectly and the gun is specifically designed for use with a suppressor. Besides having every feature that comes on most high end customized 1911s, this has sights that are high enough to see over the suppressor when shooting with one so they are actually usable (good luck using the sights on any other suppressed pistol). Comes with everything that it comes with brand new, the box, all the papers, two magazines, a gun lock, everything. Read up on this amazing weapon and see for yourself why you should buy this gun. I desperately need to buy a new car and so it's time to part with some of my toys. I really wanted to hang onto this gun until I filled out the paperwork for a suppressor, but a car is more important so I'll let someone else enjoy the dream.
