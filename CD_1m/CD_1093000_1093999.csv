I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again.

I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again. And sorry if i got your hopes up on buying one at a normal price i wish i had enough to sell to everyone wanting one Thanks for reading this and God bless"

Stock # MSH250803SP. Serial # 898xxx. One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is a RZM-marked .32 caliber Walther PPK, made in 1935. As you probably know, “RZM” was the purchasing office of the Nazi Party (NOT the Whermacht, etc.) and RZM-marked guns usually went to High-Ranking Nazi Party Leaders, Gauliters, SA Officers, etc. The pistol has a factory blue finish and wrap-around plastic factory grips with the Walther banner, it also has a Walther-marked factory finger-rest magazine. Besides the RZM marking on the left side of the slide, the pistol has the correct “Crown N” proofs on the right side of the barrel and slide. The pistol is only serial-numbered on the receiver. The pistol has some holster wear on the slide, and a few service marks here and there. The factory Walther grips are in excellent condition with no cracks, however, these grips, while original, may have been replaced at some time, or, more likely, they have just shrunk over time, there is not enough clearance for the safety/de-cocker to come all the way down. Overall condition of the pistol is about 90%. The pistol has a shiny bore with strong rifling, and trigger pull is smooth. RZM PPK’s are quite desirable, this one needs a home in your collection! We do not have any accessories, extra mags, holster, etc. for this gun. * All ITEMS ONLINE ARE SUBJECT TO PRIOR SALE IN OUR RETAIL STORE"

This is a limited edition Glock 19 with the EXO finish by FailZero.

Unlike films, conventional coatings and applied lubricants, it will never rub off, never flake off, never build up crud. EXO Technology eliminates wet-lubrication failures of critical components, giving you an ""active weapon advantage"" under all conditions. (http://www.taloinc.com/glock.htm).

_______ FAQ_______

To clarify, I live in Ohio.  If you do not live in Ohio, federal law prohibits me from selling this gun directly to you.  I must transfer it to an FFL in the state in which you reside.  I wish that this were not the law, and believe it is a hindrance deliberately calculated by our federal 'betters' to attempt to keep records of when we citizens sell guns to one another.  Nonetheless, I will comply with the law because I don't want to go to prison, and I strongly believe that while our federal 'betters' have no interest whatsoever in incarcerating dangerous, violent, repeat criminals, they strongly desire to incarcerate innocent persons on malum prohibitum paperwork offenses involving core, central, individual liberties.

If you live in Ohio, I will gladly sell this firearm to you face-to-face.

Thank you."

They do not make these anymore because during the economic downturn they started to compete the the kits from the higher end parent company DW drums, so now they just make low end stuff. I paid over $1,200 for just the shell pack (drums) and basic hardware, because they are the upscale birch and maple layered shells.  This is the perfect opportunity to have everything you need for one price and know that it is good quality equipment.

Everything here is in good shape, well taken care of by a serious and caring musician. They show very little wear on anything except the heads themselves.  Everything here new totaled approximately $4,000. I'm willing to let it go for $2,000 worth of firearms. I'm interested in AKs because I already have guns in 7.62, but I'm also interested in ARs (especially one in .300AAC) and anything that you have that is of good quality.

Excellent condition no scratches, no holster wear.  It stayed in the box except for the few times it has been shot.
It is NOT a slim frame.
It has Ameriglo Operator night sights (yellow/green) installed which cost $110.
Decal grip also.
It has 2-13 round magazines.

 I put my preferred type of sights on it but rarely shot it because I just always shoot my 9mm Glock. I'd guess only around 200 rounds through it.

The only trade I would consider is absolutely mint gen 3 G17 plus $40 or if your mint G17 has Ameriglo operators I'll gladly trade even up.  

Buyer must have a valid WI drivers license.  Buyer MUST be willing to sign a bill of sale kept only for my records. If you are not willing to sign the bill of sale, please just ignore my ad and buy one from someone else.

Buyer must drive to pick this up.  I'd help but I am always on call for work when I am in town and can not drive to deliver.

For the guys who are going to email to tell me I am a bad American because my price is $50 more than they think it should be, please do not waste your time! Please just ignore my ad and go buy one of the many other mint used Glocks available with $110 night sights on it."

Please read this, 
I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again.

I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again.

I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again. And sorry if i got your hopes up on buying one at a normal price i wish i had enough to sell to everyone wanting one Thanks for reading this and God bless"

I recently moved to using Frog Lube on all my weapons and really like it.

A couple of mod's have been performed on each of these weapons. Each gun has had the Truglo TFO's installed  that are green/green. If you have never used or seen these, they are fantastic for low or no light situations. They both had an extended mag release button installed along with an extended slide release. 

I had the barrel on one of the guns polished to stainless. Don't worry the tenifer finish is still on the barrel. I just wanted to be able to tell the difference between the two guns quickly. 

Each gun comes with four high capacity magazines that are Glock magazines, original Glock carrying case, all Glock paperwork and the guns are in sequential order. There is no ammo that goes with the deal. 

I am not interested in splitting these up at this time. I am not interested in any trades at this time either. We will need the transaction to take place in Memphis at my office.

Purchased new last summer; Approx round count is 150 .22LR and 18 of the .22WMR. Included with the gun is 82 rounds of CCI .22 WMR, 50 rounds of Hornady V-max 30 grain poly tipped .22WMR, what's left of a box of .22 short, and 2 40 round boxes of American Eagle Hp .22lr and 1 box of 50 Winchester .22 WRF. As you can see in the photo all of the original paperwork, lock and box are included.  I am open to cash or trades for firearms only.  The finish is blued, but the .22 WMR cylinder is nickle finish; it was ordered this was because it made it easier for me to tell which one was installed and gave the gun a nice contrast when installed.

If you're looking at this aution you're probably aware that Mark 23/MK23 entered service with the US Special Operations Command in May 1996. It was one of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history. It was also the 1st .45 acp handgun to enter service with the US military since the venerable 1911A1. This particular HK Mark 23 is unfired! It is in beautiful condition ('BA' date code). I am the 2nd owner and have not fired it. The original owner told me he did not fire it either, and I believe him based on the condition of the pistol and internals. The only mark on this gun is a slight line across the top of the chamber from working the action. The auction includes 2 magazines (12 rounds), original box, manual, cable lock, factory test fired shell casing, extra O rings and the thread protector.

This is the most advanced full ambidextrous battle pistol made to date. It’s been tourtorcher tested, and far exceeds the militaries requirements. http://pistol-training.com/archives/2741 The HK45 is the next iteration of the HK USP, which has been a world renowned combat pistol for years. I bought last year and shoot maybe 100-200 rounds out of it. I love the gun, it shot perfectly smooth and flawless, however I rarely if ever shoot .45 ACP anymore, and just don’t have a use for it. This gun is in near perfect condition, with no noticeable wear or marks anywhere. There isn't a blemish in the polymer, barrel is bright and clean, gun operates flawlessly, everything is clean and oiled, etc. It comes with the original box, (3) 10 round magazines, and all 3 backstraps.
If you are looking for an indestructible, ergonomic, high-capacity, smooth shooting, .45 ACP, this is your gun. Most .45 ACP's are feel like bricks (ie. the HK USP), have a tremendous amount of recoil, are only single stack, (hold (8) rounds) etc. This is the best of the best when it comes to a modern .45 ACP pistol, and everyone knows HK makes some phenomenal guns, and it’s fully ambidextrous. I forgot to take pictures while at home, so these are just stock photos. I’ll work on taking pictures of my gun soon, and posting them, otherwise I can send them upon request.

Q4364 is genuine government contract overrun ammo made for the FBI. This is top quality ammo normally not available to the public. The absolute best you can buy in case you need to use your gun in a self defense situation. Ranger ammo is normally $35/box plus taxes and shipping, and is typically restricted to Law Enforcement Officers. It is legal for civilian ownership and use, and many people including myself think that the best way to avoid complications in the event of having to use a firearm in self defense is to use the same ammo as the police would.

Manufacturer: Beretta 
USA Caliber: 45 ACP Action: Double / Single Action 
Firearm Type: Pistol 

BERETTA 8045F COUGAR 8045 .45 ACP No longer in production due to high production costs these fine pistols are getting harder and harder to find. Handgun features double or single action, 3.7 inch barrel, de-cocker, and three dot fixed sights. The point and shoot of this pistol is a natural feel. The Cougar uses a relatively rare rotating barrel locking system, in which the barrel rotates on recoil to unlock itself from the slide. The rotating motion of the barrel is controlled by the stud on its bottom, which follows the cam track in the steel frame insert. 

The unit has had approximately 350 rounds through it. It comes with 4 - 8 round Mags (3 with the hard to find spacers) and one conceal 6 round Magazine. Also comes with the original COUGAR lockable aluminum case.  It also comes with a removable Packmayr grip. 

There is NOTHING wrong with the pistol, just TOO much pistol ... need something in smaller caliber, It has just been sitting in the safe as a Safe Queen, would consider trade for a SIG P290 9mm or an EOTECH 552

I will also include a New box of .45 ACP Winchester USA Full Metal Jacket 230 Grain 100 Round Box to get you started.
