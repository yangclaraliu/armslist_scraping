This particular AR15A2 is AS NEW. While it may have been fired (but VERY little as there are only very minor wear marks on the buffer and bolt carrier assemblies), we estimate that less than 50 rds were fired. 

The finish is mint with no scuffs, scratches or damage. There is virtually no marking on the case deflector and other wear areas

I haven't shot it and if it has been shot then the previous owner took very good care of it. Looking down the barrel looks perfect. The bluing looks great also. I have owned many sks in the past and this one is the nicest. It comes with a 4x28 scope with covers and its mounted from the side with a mount that says Norinco. I have never seen this type of mount. You have a complete unobstructed view of the open sites right under the scope, Great idea.
It comes with a sling, 30 rd mag, factory 10 rd mag and ill throw in a 5 rd hunting mag and a couple stripper clips too. I can also add a hell fire trigger that ive never even used in box with instruction for an extra $25 if interested. I usually take off wood stock and put on a plastic stock to improve the look but this stock is nice. 
I can send more pictures if interested because I can only load one on here due to size.
Im pricing it to sell and might negotiate on price depending on response, I see some on here going for big bucks

Also, the last shot will hang up when chambering unless you use longer bullets like CCI Stingers. (This is a magazine problem, it has nothing to do with the gun.) This gun is VERY accurate. It will consistently hit water bottle caps at 50+ yards with ease. I used it for target shooting and squirrel hunting, but you could use it for competitions as well.

From Sig Sauer website:

""SIG SAUER P250 SUBCOMPACT NITRON

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.
SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year. This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250®...""

If you want ""the best handgun in the world"" then you should chose Sig Sauer.
If you want ""the best Sig Sauer"" then you should chose Sig Sauer P250.
There is only one better then this one for me. But this one is the best for many others.
Start with this subcompact model, and then later add different sizes and calibers. This is the original solution for many people that want more then one caliber, and one gun for more then one application.
If you ever shoot the best of all handguns, this one will surprise and impress even you. It is so smooth, sweet, stylish, comfy, very sturdy, accurate and very light. It works like a dream.

bushmaster

One of the world's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models, the Bushmaster M4 features the distinctive M4 barrel profile and a six-position telestock for ease of deployment. The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a ""birdcage"" type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9 right-handed twist. Shipped complete with 30-round magazine, a safety and operations manual, and a carrying sling.

Generally the better of the SKS variants... It has a chrome lined barrel and is a bit longer than the AK's, so its typically more accurate.  This gun is very accurate and fun to shoot.  The numbers on the receiver/action/bolt/cover all match, but I have done some modifications to it.  I put it  a Tapco stock, with a pistol grip, adjustable but stock, and I added a fore grip.  I will be including a 30 round metal Pro Mag, a 20 round metal Pro Mag, a 20 round poly Pro Mag, and 2 20 round poly Tapco mags.  I will have to do a round count but I will also include roughly 600-800 rounds (mostly bulk).  This is a sweet gun.  Its in very good condition and is taken down and cleaned after every time I shoot it.  I don't really need to sell it so no low balls.  I could use the cash, but may be interested in trades or partial trades.  All I would really need is a tactical 870, or maybe a carry 9mm, or possibly a 1911 of sorts.  Get it while you can before your government puts a stop to it all.  thanks"

One of the world's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models, the Bushmaster M4 features the distinctive M4 barrel profile and a six-position telestock for ease of deployment. The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a ""birdcage"" type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9 right-handed twist. Shipped complete with 30-round magazine, a safety and operations manual, and a carrying sling.

The numbers on the receiver/action/bolt/cover all match, but I have done some modifications to it.  I put it  a Tapco stock, with a pistol grip, adjustable but stock, and I added a fore grip.  I will be including a 30 round metal Pro Mag, a 20 round metal Pro Mag, a 20 round poly Pro Mag, and 2 20 round poly Tapco mags.  I will have to do a round count but I will also include roughly 600-800 rounds (mostly bulk).  This is a sweet gun.  Its in very good condition and is taken down and cleaned after every time I shoot it.  I don't really need to sell it so no low balls.  I could use the cash, but may be interested in trades or partial trades.  All I would really need is a tactical 870, or maybe a carry 9mm, or possibly a 1911 of sorts.

The gun is in great shape.  It has, however, been modified in the fore-grip with a professionally added additional forestock.  This stock was added for the original owner who was short in stature and reach.  It appears that it could be removed with some effort.

The addition of the fore-stock makes the camming action of the foregrip easier to actuate and thus a more modern 'forward grip' on the foregrip can cause the gun to disassemble ( eek ).

Price reflects age, condition, and alterations as described.  Single family ownership."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. These magazines are going to be banned very soon now, however you will be allowed to keep any that you have bought before the ban. 

Package includes:
-Russian Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling
