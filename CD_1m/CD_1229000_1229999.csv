I recently purchased an M&P .40 with the external safety. It was everything I was looking for but not the right caliber. I'm looking to trade my slide for yours the same. If you have one and you live locally feel free to give me a call. Doesn't have to be brand new but well taken care of. REDACTED is the best way to get in contact with me.

Two Boxes (50each – 100 rounds) Federal 147gr FMJ Flat-points

Two boxes (100each - 200 rounds) of Winchester 115gr FMJ.


For many folks,  147gr bullets are the current way to go in 9mm ammo.  The increase in weight allows more flexibility in terminal ballistics.  The trick (for hollow points) is to find a load with adequately high velocity. That’s something the “standard” manufactures are not likely to do anytime soon in this bullet weight. 

Enter Double Tap.

The Double Tap Company specializes in doing what’s necessary to get velocities up while maintaining industry standards in pressure. Double Tap ammunition is loaded for high performance through any firearm. This ammunition is new-production, non-corrosive in boxer-primed, reloadable nickel-plated brass cases. 

These 147gr +P Double Tap rounds weren’t easy to get before ast December, and good luck these days.  The other rounds;, the 147gr FMJ flat-point Federal rounds will allow you to know what your weapon does with this bullet weight. The 115gr Winchester ball ammo is currently the world ""standard"" in 9mm. With this 9mm ammo lot, you have both proper practice rounds, some standard practice ammo and a comfortable supply of the best stuff.

I won’t advertise the muzzle velocity of the Double Tap rounds here, but check it
out for yourself here, along with the reviews . . . .

The upper is a factory YHM unit with a 20 inch barrel. I had the barrel threaded and a YHM brake/comp installed by local gunsmith. Has a free float handguard with movable quad rails also YHM and gunsmith installed. I find this design much more comfortable to shoot than a full quadrail. The gun will also come with the original free float slick tube. The lower is an AR 57 unit that was built by the same gunsmith. The trigger has been worked on and has a fantastic pull and clean break. Pistol grip is a Magpul MOE plus unit with internal storage and stock is a Magpul as well. The rifle will have Magpul folding sights instead of the ones shown, and two GI mags are included. I have over $1400 in the upper alone so this is not a price gouging sale, very nice rifle. I am looking to sell for $1500 but would trade for a Sig 556 SWAT patrol model rifle with a side folding stock. Prefer to meet face-to-face in the nova area but can travel a little. Just need to see ID with a local sale or can ship via local FFL for an additional $60.  I am willing to sell the upper complete with BCG for $1250 if you are interested"

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. This carbine is a National Postal Meter. It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP a few years back. It has a low 1.4 million serial number so was made in middle of WWII. Stock is birch and is clean with only a few dings.

I am selling it with 50-rds ammo, two 30-round magazines, and a carbine pouch with two-15 round magazines (15-round mags are loaded with ammo). It also includes the sling and oiler.

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

I had no intent of selling any of my carbines but with the craziness in Colorado (proposed high-capacity mag ban, limitations on private sales, etc.), I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and with 15- and 30-round magazines now at a fair price. This is the third one I am selling.

If you are not familar with the M1 Carbines, these are Amerca's first real a$$ault rifle. My favorite gun to shoot - they always go to the shooting range. The AKs and ARs are more intermittent.

Please send me a message if you have questions. Not interested in trades and price is firm. Thanks for considering."

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP. It has a low 1.4 million serial number so was made in middle of WWII. Stock is birch and is clean with only a few dings.

I am selling it with 50-rds ammo, two 30-round magazines, and a carbine pouch with two-15 round magazines (15-round mags are loaded with ammo). It also includes the sling and oiler.

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

I had no intent of selling any of my carbines but with the craziness in Colorado (proposed high-capacity mag ban, limitations on private sales, etc.), I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and with 15- and 30-round magazines legally at a fair price.

If you are not familar with the M1 Carbine, these are our first real a$$ault rifle. My favorite gun to shoot - they always go to the shooting range. 

Please send me a message if you have questions. Not interested in trades and price is firm. 

Thanks for looking."

It cost me a little under 1500$ total to make this hunting rig so when sending me your offer please take that into account. I haven't used it much so I'm not looking to cut half of the price out.

If you have a concealed carry permit life will be much easier with the sale. If not, we'll go through the FFL process WHICH YOU WILL BE PAYING FOR! Not sure how much the process costs, but its not too much. Google it.

The NHM-91 went for 900-1200 before the shootings, and the VZ-52s are not cz-52 surplus.  I could write paragraphs about why this is one of the best aks ever made...one thing the Chinese did right is their gun clones...excessively overbuilt which leads to a long service life. Comparing it to wasrs ...let's just say this. First hand military accounts of wartime use shows the MILITARY GRADE Romanian aks weren't even liked....much better constructed than the civilian wasrs that aren't even designed to take high cap mags....not trying to offend anyone...I'm just annoyed when people don't take the time to research a gun before they buy it and expect my gun to be worth the same as a gun half the quality. Don't offer me gouged prices, I won't offer you gouged prices.
