Brand new in box. For sale far below MSRP for a limited time. According to STI's website:

STI International’s patented 2011 technology gives the STI Tactical 3.0 more fire power advantage than 1911 tactical pistols without greatly increasing the size of the grip. Combining this advantage with less felt recoil and other popular 2011 features, the STI Tactical is a superior pistol for all personal protection applications. New for 2012, the STI Tactical 3.0 fulfills an important part of the ‘STI Tactical Family’ line of pistols.

Building on the popularity of the 5.0 version, the STI Tactical 3.0 delivers the same high capacity, accuracy, and dependability in a more compact package with an aluminum frame to lighten the pistol even further. The STI Tactical 3.0 is well suited for multiple applications, ranging from police and SWAT teams requiring a back up firearm with a light rail and high capacity, to the individual demanding a high performance pistol with special features for personal protection. The tactical rail milled into the dust cover of the frame accepts all industry standard light mounts.

Text for questions:REDACTED
From Mystery Ranch:

Using every trick Dana has up his sleeve, the Kodiak is truly a beast of a pack with the ability to carry 7000 cubic inches of gear weighing up to 120 pounds. The Overkill Guide Frame combines the added stability of the Overkill Yoke and the comfort and weight transferring ability of the Five Segmented Lumbar Wrap with the absolute best internal framing. A classic top loading design with dual draw cord shroud increases weather resistance and allows for upward expansion. The Daypack Lid separates top load into two compartments for better organization and load control. Built-in shoulder straps convert the lid into a day pack complete with ports for a hydration reservoir. The SpeedZip sleeping bag compartment can handle the largest winter bags while remaining easy to close. Plus it can be sucked flat to reduce the size of the packs volume for smaller loads. Side zippers provide great access into the pack. From backpack hunting in Alaska to extended missions and expeditions all over the world, one word describes the Kodiak- overkill.

Model: 92 FS
Caliber: 9mm
From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the U.S. Armed Forces have counted on Beretta pistols for almost two decades of distinguished service. The 92FS, Beretta’s premier full metal gun, is virtually identical to the military M9 9mm pistol. Accurate out of the box, this workhorse features an open slide design that eliminates jamming, a safety system that combines decocking with a positive thumb safety, and a combat muzzle crown. Beretta’s proprietary black, non-glare Bruniton finish gives your 92FS a wear-resistant coating, which means it will stand up to any special duty.

The GLOCK 17 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G17 Gen4 9x19mm pistol also retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

For many gun enthusiasts there is only one caliber for a personal defense handgun and that's the 9mm. GLOCK was the first player in the composite gun game and they are probably the worlds most successful handgun company.

The class lasts about 7 hours total, includes a written and range test, basic handgun safety, handgun cleaning, handgun knowledge, handgun marksmanship, and qualifies you to apply for a CCDW license in KY. Students should bring a modern functioning handgun with 50 rounds of factory new ammunition and appropriate cleaning supplies for the firearm. Don’t have a handgun, ammo, or supplies? No worries! Get in touch with me and we can work out the details. There is also a $60 fee divided between the state and local police that is normally paid 2-3 weeks after the completion of the course. A criminal background check will be done by the Kentucky State Police after the completion of the course. Due to high volume, it is currently taking up to 5 months after the class for the actual license to be issued by the Kentucky State Police.

GLOCK 26 - $565
""Baby"" Glock

The triumphant advance of the smallest 
GLOCK pistol, specially developed for 
concealed carry and previously a 
domain of 5-round snub nose revolvers, 
started with the presentation of the GLOCK 26 in August 
1994. The GLOCK 26 offers more than an alternative in 
this field. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services.

***New in box***
Glock 19-$575
The GLOCK 19 is ideal for versatile use
through reduced dimensions compared with 
the standard pistol size. With the proven caliber 
of 9x19, it has found worldwide distribution in
security services. In addition to being used as a
conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. For instance, many of the elite pilots
of the USAF for instance trust the GLOCK 19 for their efficient defense in emergency situations."

The Hamilton Company, as a result of its focus on the railroad industry, Hamilton never had the widespread brand recognition of giant watchmakers like Elgin and Waltham. But Hamilton was content with its reputation for accuracy. In fact, its pocket watches were so highly regarded that by the beginning of the 20th century, the company’s 1893 Broadway Limited model was named the official timepiece of all U.S. Expeditionary Forces. In World War I, a wristwatch version of the Broadway Limited was made for troops and General Pershing himself. The Broadway Limited, along with another railroad-grade watch called the Model 992, accounted for the bulk of the company’s sales during this period. Some 992s, like this one had Montgomery dials, in which not only the hours were labeled but the minutes as well. Other companies tried to copy this design, but Hamilton’s Montgomery dials were unique for the way in which all numbers could be read on the dial—the 6 at the bottom of the watch was actually placed inside the seconds dial so that the numeral 30 would still be readable. Today, these pre-1920 workhorses are among the most collectible and rarest Hamiltons if you can find one.

This pistol comes with (2) 5-round magazines and (1) extended 7-round magazine.  The have been a total of 4 magazines of ammo fired through this pistol (22 rounds) so it's not brand new but the next best thing.  I recently got my wife a Sig Sauer P238 and we both love this little pistol so I'll trade my 6 month old XDs .45acp for a Sig Sauer P238 .380 or 938 9mm.  I may consider a Kimber Solo as well but my first choice is going to be the Sig.  I have many pistols so I am going to be very picky.  I'm not interested in small Glocks, LCP's or Bodyguards...  I already have a PPK and a Bersa 383DA so I'm not looking for just any pistol I'm looking for a Sig.  I appreciate the activity so far but I am going to limit what I interested in trading for.  If you wish to buy this pistol outright the price is $675 cash.  If you don't care about having 3 magazines you can buy them around town cheaper when you can find them with only 1 or 2 magazines and extra magazines are made of unabtainium right now.  As far as I know there have been 3 factory magazine packages for sale for quite a while in Albuquerque.  If you don't know what the XDs looks like there are 10.000 pictures on Google.  My pistol is like new and if you have a pistol I'm interested in I'll get you pictures of my pistol.  Call/Text Rick 5O5**6IO**529I  Thanks"

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look.

Below is a brief description of the rifle (borrowed from Ask.com). From what I have researched, there are very limited numbers of this rifle (I will not quote the numbers as I can not guarantee their accuracy).
This package comes with 4 mags and the sling. The rifle has around 350 rounds through it and is a blast to shoot! Also, I can say that it is incredibly accurate.
Please do your research on the gun, and you will see the price is a good one. I am selling to go with a smaller caliber AR15. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. 
Thank you for looking.

History:

The M16K was produced by La France beginning in 1982, subsequently a highly modified variation of this gun was developed which was designated the M16K-45 which was chambered for the .45 ACP round and utilizing 20 or 30 round Thompson submachine gun magazines. Except for the magazines this firearm was entirely manufactured by La France and not just a modification of an existing firearm as was case with the original M16K. 

The later M-16K .45 variant (this gun for sale) was produced using proprietary upper and lower receivers designed by Timothy F. La France specifically for the .45 ACP round. Both are forgings. The M-16K 45 was produced in both a fully automatic Title II version with a short barrel and a semi-automatic version fitted with a 16"" barrel to allow it to be sold as a Title I firearm (this gun). The barrels are compensated to reduce muzzle climb in fully automatic fire. Production delays resulted in the semi-automatic version not being ready for civilian sales until after enactment of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 1994, which impaired sales. When the Federal Assault Weapons Ban lapsed, M-16K 45s again became legal for sale"

This rifle has given those rifles a run for their money and it shoots extremely well.

I'm selling my barely used Marlin 2000L Target .22LR that has only about 50 rounds shot through it.  The Biathlon Kit was purchased with this rifle (costs extra) and is currently in this configuration.  This allows for 5 shots in the magazine and is VERY easy to convert back to just a single shot for competitions.  This rifle has not been modified for use of a scope.  The sights on this gun works perfectly.  

This rifle comes with everything that it would at retail: instructions, tools, various sight pictures, etc.  Everything but the box!

Also, this Marlin will come with a cleaning kit ($20 value), snap caps ($10 value), hard case that can hold 2 rifles for competitions ($75 value) and ammunition (about $120 value).

Summary of what's included:
*Marlin 2000L Target .22 in EXCELLENT condition with instruction manuals and tools
*Marlin Biathlon kit (comes with tools, 5 round magazine and bottom rail)
*Hoppes .22 cleaning tools
*.22 plastic snap caps (about 10 of them)
*Hard case that holds 2 rifles and extras;  has wheels and two different areas for handles
*650 total rounds of .22 ammo: 450 rounds of Federal Champion ammo, 100 rounds of CCI Mini-Mag High Velocity ammo, and 100 rounds of Remington Target ammo

Brand New in Box…..Unfired……And No Longer in Production!!!!!
Just picked up from my FFL on 5/9/2013. Field stripped the gun and lubbed it with Frog Lube (the Best) and decided to go in a different direction for my collection.  Gun is absolutely perfect and brand new and comes with everything as you would expect a new Delta Elite to come with.
The 10mm cartridge is gaining popularity with ballistics better than the 45ACP and very comparable to the 41 Magnum.

Get it now while you can still find a new one! This is not the model they made in the 80's as you can tell by the grips and the trigger, but it is the model more recently manufactured by Colt.  

$1400 FIRM and not a penny less, don't waste your time with offers.

UPDATE!!!!
Please I am torn about even selling this and also know I am not desperate or in need of cash, it is more of a want thing.  I changed my mind for the next addition to my collection and now want the hard to find and very expensive and absolute BEST 1911 made.  The FBI Springfield TRP Professional model for $2500 to $3000.  That is the only reason I am even considering selling this.  So to all of you people I have received many emails from offering me your revolver and LCP or LC9 and your Glock or any other run of the mill guns or the lowball offers, I AM NOT ACCEPTING OFFERS.  PRICE IS FIRM!!!! PLEASE DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MINE.  It will take me a while to find the Springfield I want since there is over a year wait from the factory so I am not in a hurry to sell.

983,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1699983,For Sale:  Ed Brown 1911 California Kobra Carry (KC-SS-CAL2),"ANACORTES, Washington, United States","$ 2,819","Listed On: Tuesday, August 20, 2013",Handguns,Ed Brown                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The Kobra Carry is essentially the Kobra modified for carry. It's the solution for those who prefer a smaller model 1911, but insist on complete reliability. The slide has been reduced to the minimum possible (4.25"") without significantly impairing the legendary reliability of the 5"" slide. The frame has been modified with the innovative Ed BrownBobtail™ housing which reduces the projecting butt of the mainspring housing without sacrificing the full size frame and magazine capacity. The Bobtail™ minimizes the print under your jacket when carrying and reduces weight. Officer's frames reduce magazine capacity and limit grip, while keeping the projecting, sharp butt. Slides shorter than 4.25"" are notorious for reduced reliability. These problems are eliminated with the Ed Brown Commander Bobtail™ configuration, which reflects the genius of John Browning with an innovative modern flair. The functional simplicity has yet to be matched. Unique with the Kobra series pistols is the innovative snakeskin treatment. It is a directional pattern, meaning it is smooth to slide your hand up, but bites in for a snug grip the other way where you need it. It's easier on the hands than checkering, and our female customers in particular can't stop bragging about it. Not to mention it just looks cool! The Kobra Carry is an innovative masterpiece, and a serious tool for those who want something a little different. We are sure you'll be charmed by the Kobra Carry!


The Kobra Carry features the following:
4.25"" Commander model slide, single stack commander Bobtail™ frame. The John Browning traditional design innovatively modified for concealed carry, without significantly detracting from reliability or accuracy.
Weight: approximately 35 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.
Exclusive snakeskin treatment on forestrap, Bobtail™ housing. A beautiful, unique, and snag free gripping surface.
Matte finished slide for low glare, with snakeskin on rear of slide only.
Fixed dovetail 3-dot night sights with high visibility white outlines.
