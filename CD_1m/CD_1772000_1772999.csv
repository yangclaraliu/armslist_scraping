This is a fantastic rifle! Only wear is from be moved around the safe. 1/2 MOA verified out to 200 yards after removing barrel. DOES NOT COME WITH SCOPE, SCOPE MOUNT OR BIPOD shown in picture, but does come with factory bipod and pin. Both barrels are unfired... I bought the 308 from the original owner who never fired it.
MSRP for everything you get and the custom work is well over $7500, plus tax... no tax with me and a great rare gun for well under retail! Could be open to trades for gun or group of guns that has a retail value close to what mine is.... would consider other precision bolt actions, FN guns (SCAR, FNAR, Five Seven, FS2000, PS90), or high end AR10 platforms such as POF. So if you have a package that comes somewhere in the range of $7500, let me know and we can talk. Shipping is $100 paid by buyer.

The sights are made in Germany in a ISO9001 facility and are all individually tested and packed per order to guarantee a quality product when you mount it on your personal weapon.  

At Precision Shooting Arms we fully believe in the U.S. Constitution and the 2nd Amendment, after all we are Veterans. We feel it is your god given alienable right to self defense but that shouldn't mean you have to pay an arm and a leg in order to have a quality tactical product. Lets be honest, Eotech and Aimpoint are a great product but not everyone can justify spending $700+ on a single optic, it is just not practical for everyone.

At Precision Shooting Arms we believe in the American Dream and we believe in hard work and anything worth working hard for is worth protecting, that's why we offer the Precision Shooting Arms Fusion Fire Red Dot.

Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45.

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.

Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

Both the HK45 Compact and full-size HK45 use an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever. The control lever is frame mounted and is quickly accessible; it has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 and HK45C can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45C is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system, providing an enhanced double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics::
Integral MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
ERGO (HK45 full-size) and slim-line (HK45 Compact) grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
8-round metal magazine is standard for the HK45C, common high-capacity (10 rounds) that fit both the HK45 and HK45C also available
Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system
O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and better accuracy
Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and increased accuracy
Improved ergonomic control levers (safety and/or decocking)
Low profile drift adjustable 3-dot sights
Contoured and radiused slide with forward slide (grasping) grooves and anti-glare longitudinal ribs

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going"

Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of manufacture."

It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference."

It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm. The SP2022 – the only polymer framed pistol engineered to perform, built to protect and good enough to be called a SIG SAUER."

Product FAQ
Q: What is the warranty coverage for this rifle?
A: All Stag rifles have a lifetime transferable warranty.
Q: What do I need to know about installing sights?
A: A metal front sight which is ""gas block"" height is required since the rail of the gas block sits .250"" below the height of the rail on the upper receiver. Plastic front sights will not function properly but any other rear sight will work. Due to the nature of drop in style handguards, slight movement of the hanguard is normal so sights should not be installed.
Q: What types of rail attachments can be installed on the handguard?
A: Only Diamondhead rail sections will work with the handguard."

If you have ever held a colt mustang or something similar then you have a pretty good idea of how this gun will feel in your hand. It has a very similar look and feel to a mini 1911 in 380 acp. The gun has a stainless finish and ivory colored grips. The grips are original and are in good shape. The gun has some finish issues near the rear of the slide and by that I mean rust spots. I have cleaned it up about as good as it can get and you should be able to see the finish issues in the photos. I have been working in gun stores selling guns for over three years now and have only seen two of these guns. After I saw and felt my first one I knew I wanted one, but couldn't afford it the first time around. I bought this gun from a customer last winter, but I now need money more than this gun. I would be happy to show it to you anytime I am available and I guarantee the gun to work. It will feed hollow point ammo just fine but I have had trouble trying to feed Hornady Critical Defense through it because the polymer tips will jam against the feed ramp and will cause the gun to jam. However I have also shot regular hollow points and fmj's through it and they feed fine with no issue. The magazine capacity is 7. The gun features a single action only, and has a safety. The gun is lightweight and very comfortable to carry and hold in your hand. The recoil is very light and wouldn't be too much for even a beginner shooter or a female that hates recoil. The gun does come with the holster shown in the pictures. If you would like more pictures please call or text me at 4one7-two99-two7two1. Thanks

Seller's Description and Comments 
2007 Roush Stage 3 Ford Mustang Roush Peformance unveiled the 2007 Roush Stage 3 Ford Mustang. As the the quickest, and best-handling Roush Mustang ever the Stage 3 packs 435 horsepower with 400 lb-ft of torque under the hood thanks to Roush's proprietary ""Roushcharger"" supercharger. The Roushcharger supercharger kit, which we unveiled last november here, is a roots type blower that pumps up the horsepower on a stock 4.6L 2005-2007 Ford Mustang nearly 40% thanks to 5psi of boost and an air-to-water intercooler. But this car is more than just being quick on the throttle as the more than 1G rating on the skidpad attests. The suspension upgrades include specially-engineered and tuned front struts, rear shocks, front and rear springs, front and rear sway bars and jounce bumpers. The front brakes are also upgraded with 14-inch front two-piece rotors and four-piston calipers. Each component was specifically engineered so that ride comfort was not compromised at the expense of the tremendous gains in performance. Exterior styling is enhanced through the addition of a seven-piece body kit constructed from OEM-type materials which sees a front fascia, front chin spoiler, hood scoop, rocker panels, rear fascia valance and rear wing installed by Roush factory technicians. Other amenities include lower valence fog lamps, custom 18-inch forged rims with high-performance tires, sport leather seat covers, embroidered floor mats, billet aluminum pedals including a new dead pedal, and the Stage 3 electro-luminescent white face gauge cluster. The car also has Roush badging throughout and a serialized engine bay plaque indicating the car was hand-built in the Livonia, Mich., facility. ""This new Roush Stage 3 Mustang will literally turn heads twice,"" claimed Joe Thompson, general manager of Roush Performance Products. ""The first time is when they see how much better this car looks, and the second comes as you put your foot in it, kick in the Roushcharger

Wife bought without trying it at the range first, and doesn't feel safe carrying a .22, she's looking for a .380 instead.

Comes with the box, 2 key locks for the grip safety, and 3 total magazines.  1 magazine is the original taurus brand, and 2 are promag 8 round magazines (never used).  Also comes with 50 rounds of Winchester White box .22lr ammunition.

The PT22 is a .22LR semi-automatic pistol produced by Taurus and features an 8+1 round capacity magazine. The PT22 is often viewed as a Taurus copy of the Beretta 21 Bobcat due to having a similar ""tip up"" barrel. In fact this small pistol is very different in design and function from the Beretta. The PT22 is a cast steel frame and slide, manufactured in Florida, USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. The ""tip up"" barrel is useful in that the first round may be chambered directly into the barrel, and the operator does not have to ""pull back"" or ""rack"" the slide. Retracting the slide is difficult due to the heavy spring required in this blow-back action. The grip feel of the PT22 is ""fat"", and fills a normal-sized hand."

The 10/22 I have had for quite a while and it has seen some rounds. It's slightly beat up but overall is in good condition and functions flawlessly. The original sight fell off about 4 years ago so I put a peep sight on it that works great. I have the original magazine and 3 20 round magazines.

The 870 is in very good condition. It's never been dropped in the water/mud ext. I don't remember what choke size I have in it. I believe it is an improved but I can't find my choke tool to take it out.  It's an express mag so it take up to 3 "" shells. It has been my duck/dove/deer gun for a long time and has never given me a bit of trouble.

799,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1772799,For Sale:  Complete .223/5.56/300 BLK Bolt Carrier Group. $135,"Raeford, Fayetteville, North Carolina",$ 135,"Listed On: Sunday, November 10, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"We only have two left! 
Brand New .223/5.56/300 BLK Complete Bolt Carrier Groups. Retail is $185 our price is $135! Ea. 
REDACTED
 They are made in the USA and are superior to Mil-spec. These are full auto bolts and will work in AR15s, M4s and M16s. They come completely assembled ready to drop in.  
These are the same BCG's that New Frontier Armory uses at their range for all of their full auto rifles and they run thousands of rounds w/o any issues. 
A break down of the Specs are below.

Bolt Control Group Info from the Manufacture:
Changes vs milspec: rake and fillet cuts at the bolt head, heat treating, chamfering changes, a proprietary spring and polymer insert under the extractor

Material as follows: 
Carrier, Gas key, Cam pin, Ejector: 8620 or 4130/40
Extractor: tool steel & MIM'd
Bolt: 9310 or 4130/4140
Firing pin: 400 series stainless

Everything but the firing pin and extractor are carbo nitrided to allow a hard surface and more malleable core to help avoid cracking and still reduce wear. We have the extractor MIM'd (metal injection molded). This requires reducing hardness rather than increasing hardness. MIM'ing is very reliable when done correctly with updated technology in the US, less expensive and provides a superior part in the end. Did you know that the desert eagle 50 cal has almost all internal parts MIM'd? We have actually tested to destruction and found the MIM part to be more robust than the machined part. 

Some feel that the mil-spec carpenter 158 material is the only correct material to use on a bolt since it is called out in the mil-spec. They couldn't be more wrong. Many companies make look alikes to c158 with the same specs to the carpenter 158 but cannot sell it for military contracts because it doesn't say carpenter in front of it. This has nothing at all to do with performance or quality. It has to do with influence. Look at the specs for c158, E150, 9310 and 4130. You will find very little difference among them other than yield strength. Yield is not at issue in a linear function like a bolt carrier group experiences. 

Carbo-nitriding was not accepted in the mil-spec primarily because it required a cyanide process in the 1940s and 1950s. This is no longer true and provides superior performance and longevity.

Many purchasers want a magnetic particle inspection of the bolt. This is the MPI mark on some bolts. The problem with this is that: 
Magnetic particle inspection does no good on an un-fired part. There won't be any cracks to detect. The purpose of MP testing is to detect cracks after a proof load is fired through a gun at much higher pressures. No one that I know of actually proof load tests individual bolts. Many mark their bolts MP and if called on it, say it means manganese phosphate. I won't allow that kind of deceit. Unless there is a true MPI / HP test done, it’s a waste of time/money. Even then, they only test one out of a batch of parts. We can get them tested, but we'd obviously have to add the cost into the parts."""

I understand if this makes you feel uncomfortable and are not willing to do business, but it would simply add 10 minutes to the transaction time.   I can provide a copy of the pawn ticket for proof.   It's a great deal if you're willing to jump through a hoop.

It has a 196-8XXXX serial number which means it was manufactured in 2002. I've had it for a couple of years, shot about 800rds through it, and it has been 100% reliable.
   This mini comes with two setups for different uses. One is for hunting and target practice, and the other is for tactical work and home-defense.
   The hunting setup uses a Hogue overmolded synthetic stock. It has had a front sling stud permanently installed for mounting of the folding collapsible bipod. It has a Bushnell 4x-12x by 40mm scope with adjustable parallax and fast-focus eyepiece. I bought this scope a year ago for $80 on sale. It's very clear. The scope is mounted in tall Ruger factory stainless rings. I also have a set of blued mid-rise Ruger factory rings.
   The tactical setup uses a Choate folding synthetic stock. It has an AR-type picattiny rail under the forend equipped with a Blackhawk! vertical foregrip with a removable extension and waterproof storage compartment. The barrel has a custom flash-hider welded and molded to the stock front sight. The optics consist of a B-Square weaver rail monting a Centerpoint red/green dot sight that is brand new(just mounted, never used for firing).
   The gun also has an M14-style handguard and includes the stock handguard.
   For ammunition I'm including 110rds of Federal XM855 5.56mm, 78rds of Federal American Eagle AR223, 50rds of reloaded 55gr softpoint(I've never shot reloads in this, I just got them in a trade and would probably only use them for reloading components), and 20rds of Winchester Varmint ballistic tip .223.
   Also included with this gun are two factory Ruger 20rd magazines, a mini14 stripper clip guide, sling with quick-detach swivels, gun sock, stock recoil spring(I just installed a Wolff replacement), and a copy of The Mini-14, The Plinker, Hunter, Assault, and Everything Else Rifle. 319-four80-8395 .
