Bearing the namesake and call sign of legendary Navy SEAL Paul Basal, this knife is the perfect choice of operational warriors throughout the globe! Designed by Basal with the Dark Ops design chief, it features all the critical items for a Modern Spec-Ops knife. The Shadow offers an extended blade length for penetrating Comm-bloc frag vests with an accelerated spearpoint tip and sharpened foretip for maximum penetration. The top edge features a bone breaker and a radical, self-cleaning BlastRip™ saw for carving survival notches in spears and anchoring notches for detonation cord. A pat pend. BarbSnap™ cutter allows for rapid notching and snapping of interdiction wires in entry ops. An abbreviated top-hilt/bottle opener works with a new serrated palmstop, allowing for a reverse grip with an astonishing six linear inches of surface area! The Shadow features a custom DIGI-CAMO corrosion resistant finish designed to take the saltwater immersion often involved in SEAL operations. The handle is made of a low-durometer, high tensile aramid composite that is impervious to everything from aviation fuel to Al Qaeda body fluids. The handle is thinner and wider for greater mechanical advantage with deep finger grooves orienting the blade axis of the knife in the hand and dramatically increasing effective grip surface. A prominent WhipLok™ finger notch provides an axis point for hacking as well as 200 degrees of grip area, ideal with wet hands or when using gloves. The handles are field replaceable to blend with woodland, desert or black camo schemes. Quartz impregnated inserts provide extreme circumstances grip enhancement and are replaceable should decontamination be required. The Basal Shadow utilizes the same CTV2™ Blade Steel and CryoHardening techniques as the StratoFighter™ Folders! The hilts do not protrude forward effectively reducing the length of the blade. Hollow grinding lends to greater cutting and slashing effectiveness. Deep blood grooves keep the weight of the full .250 inch thick blade properly balanced in the hand. The custom DIGI-CAMO vacuum deposited finish is designed to shed the micro-fine airborne sand of Middle-Eastern deserts.

What I really want is a P229 non-railed or with NO rail. Or the SAS. Or I would consider one with either E2 grips or Nice custom wood grips that does have the rail. The rail doesn't kill the deal but if there are two identical guns with the only difference being the rail I will choose to go without it every time.

It comes from the factory with a full quad rail that free-floats the barrel, Magpul folding sights, a Magpul 30-round magazine, and a 6-position telescoping stock. Although it does not have a match trigger, the trigger on this particular rifle has no noticeable creep and breaks very cleanly for a military spec trigger.

You can switch out between the two uppers depending on what you want. This was my baby but I haven't played airsoft in about 5-6 years. It might need new hop-up buckings and a tune-up since it has sat for so long. 

I think the lower is all stock. I wired it so the wires come out the left side of the gun and I electrical taped a piece of wood with velcro to attach the battery to the folding stock. 

The M16 upper has an upgraded spring that should put it at 350-375 fps, an upgraded piston, an upgraded cylinder, and a metal spring guide. It has a JBU front end and a CA M16 outer barrel. I also installed a CA metal hop-up unit and an M16 length inner barrel. With the M16 upper this thing is really accurate and I could reach out and touch people from 200 feet away. 

The M4 upper is stock and is accurate. 

I am also including an KM lightweight silencer with the package as well as 5 mid caps, 2 STAR 30 rounders, and a high cap magazine.

Ok everyone I know your sick of paying $60 plus a carton of cigarettes. I can get you your smokes cheaper with no hassle to you. At the tobacco store they sell 1 pound bags of tobacco for anywhere from 15 to 25 dollars that rolls 2 cartons of cigarettes . Tubes are 3 dollars a carton so for about 20- 30 dollars you can get 2 cartons of cigarettes. But rolling can be a big hassle for a lot of people. It's messy , time consuming, and can be down right annoying. But good news for you is I will roll your smokes for you and you will still get them cheaper than what you pay now. If you are interested I am charging $40 dollars per carton ( tobacco and tubes included at that price) that saves you $20 a carton and puts a little money in my pocket.

However it does not affect function of the firearm at all, but does affect it being a collector piece. I know it looks brown and it is brown, but this one is called seneca green.
it was made in Feb of 1960 and it is the seneca green model. 45,270 were made between 1958-1963. Mine is in rough shape. This in good shape is the most collectible model out of all the nylon 66's. in good condition this is a $1000+ rifle.
I am going to say this one is $500obo but I prefer trades.
Trades: most caliber Rifles; 9mm, .45, .38, .357 pistols; I love .22's of all types, reloading supply, higher end knives, good optics, let me know what you have.

$535.00 OBO

NIB (New in Box), Complete with All Paperwork.

Located in Millville, NJ 08332


Benelli's SuperNova Tactical embodies a modular design concept in a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. At the heart of this pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the SuperNova Tactical super-light, super-strong, and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova Tactical isn't just tough on the outside. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from 2-3/4"" light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums. 

This SuperNova Tactical comes with newly designed, military-style ghost-ring sights (the harder to find version, sold out just about everywhere). The rear sight is click-adjustable for both windage and elevation.  A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. The top of the SuperNova's receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics.


Benelli’s SuperNova Tactical is a modular concept pump action shotgun, that can be configured to fit any defense or tactical situation.  The ComforTech stock absorbs nearly 48% of felt recoil to dampen the recoil of heavy buck shot loads.  In addition to taming recoil, the ComforTech system minimizes barrel climb, putting you back on target twice as fast as other comparable shotguns.  For tight quarters when clearing buildings or in a patrol vehicle nothing beats the compact versatility of the SuperNova.

This Benelli Supernova Tactical (20155) is a pump action shotgun that fires the 12 gauge shell. It has an 18.5” cylinder chrome lined barrel, overall 40"" length, 2-3/4"", 3"", & 3.5"" chamber, with a matte black finish. 7.8 lbs unloaded.  This is a brand new shotgun that holds 5 shells (4+1 capacity) and comes complete with a Comfortech stock, receiver, barrel, ghost ring sights, stock shims, etc., manual, warranty card, and a box.  Complete! All Mint, NIB.  Many options available.

The Benelli SuperNova embodies a modular design concept in a pump action shotgun. It’s like having several Benelli shotguns in one.

At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the new SuperNova super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova isn’t just tough on the outside. With its dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel, the SuperNova is rock solid to the core.

There are so many videos and much information on this shotgun available on the internet; here's a photo of a great setup of a Supernova located here on this website IMO, check it out:  http://www.chicagolandsportbikes.com/forums/showthread.php?t=101039  


I can provide more pics if needed (only three are allowed per listing). I live in Millville, NJ which is in South Jersey, Cumberland County Area.

The ONLY reason I'm considering trading it, is because it's simply too nice to treat like an AK. It has really nice bluing, and I'm terrified of leaving oily fingerprints on it, so it has essentially become a safe queen!

It's a preban (imported early/mid 80's) Norinco 56S-1 underfolder with ALL MATCHING NUMBERS! Has the famous ""Triangle-66"" factory marking. These featured the robust 1.6mm receiver, which makes them much stronger than your average AK with a 1mm receiver. Has threaded barrel and polished stainless bolt/carrier. Front handguards are from a Polytech Legend (milled receiver), which I refinished and modified to fit the Norinco 56S-1 (stamped receiver). VERY low round count. Next to a Polytech, these are pretty much the best preban AK's American money can buy.

Also included is an ORIGINAL Chinese 30rd bakelite magazine which also sports the ""Norinco"" logo on one side, and the ""Triangle-66"" factory marking on the other side! It just doesn't get anymore authentic than this folks. I paid $160 for just this ONE magazine alone, which should attest to the rarity of these mags. It's a miracle I even found one at all, because Chinese bakelite mags are rare enough as it is, let alone finding one with the same factory marking as the gun!

For the right price or trade, I'll include ammo and/or additional mags as well.

$2000 for the rifle + (1) matching Norinco bakelite mag + original sling

Will either sell, trade straight up, trade for multiple guns, or trade with cash on either end, depending on the trade offer. Would really like an FN Five-Seven pistol! Please include pictures of your guns in the email. Thanks for looking!"

The ONLY reason I'm considering trading it, is because it's simply too nice to treat like an AK. It has really nice bluing, and I'm terrified of leaving oily fingerprints on it, so it has essentially become a safe queen! I've owned several AK's and this is by far the nicest I've ever had the pleasure of putting my hands on.

It's a preban (imported early/mid 80's) Norinco 56S-1 underfolder with ALL MATCHING NUMBERS! Has the famous ""Triangle-66"" factory marking. These featured the robust 1.6mm receiver, which makes them much stronger than your average AK with a 1mm receiver. Has threaded barrel and polished stainless bolt/carrier. Front handguards are from a Polytech Legend (milled receiver), which I refinished and modified to fit the Norinco 56S-1 (stamped receiver). VERY low round count. Next to a Polytech, these are pretty much the best preban AK's American money can buy.

Also included is an ORIGINAL Chinese 30rd bakelite magazine which also sports the ""Norinco"" logo on one side, and the ""Triangle-66"" factory marking on the other side! It just doesn't get anymore authentic than this folks. I paid $160 for just this ONE magazine alone, which should attest to the rarity of these mags. It's a miracle I even found one at all, because Chinese bakelite mags are rare enough as it is, let alone finding one with the same factory marking as the gun!

For the right price or trade, I'll include ammo and/or additional mags as well.

$1600 for the rifle + (1) matching Norinco bakelite mag + original sling

Will either sell, trade straight up, trade for multiple guns, or trade with cash on either end, depending on the trade offer. Would really like an FN Five-Seven pistol! Please include pictures of your guns in the email. Thanks for looking!

The serial number on this M1 is 1946863, which places its date of manufacture in September 1943. The receiver has 98%+ of its original gray-green parkerized finish. The barrel is also Springfield manufactured and is SA marked and dated ""9-43,"" so it is the original barrel for this rifle. The bore is excellent with a mirror bore and it gauges at 0.5 at the muzzle and about 2.5 at the throat so it is simply superb. The gas hole is correctly parkerized and the majority of the original parkerized finish remains on the barrel. The Rear Sight has the correct Type 1C Elevation Knob with knurled knob and closed arrow heads, Type 2B Lock Bar and Type 2 Rear Sight Cover. The Bolt is a correct -12SA Springfield bolt with the majority of its original parkerized finish and with wear on the friction points. The Operating Rod is an original, uncut and correct Type 5 ""D35382 6SA"" rod in excellent condition. The Follower Rod is a correct Type 4 ""short fork"" ribbed and riveted. The Operating Rod Catch is a correct Type 2. The Follower Arm is a correct Type 4 with rounded shoulders. The Follower is a correct Type 2C marked ""11"" on the bottom. The Bullet Guide is a correct Type 3 forged and milled with the wide slot. The Trigger Housing is a correct Type 8, -12SA marked with the majority of its original parkerized finish remaining. The Trigger Guard is the correct Type 1G, milled, that is unmarked. The Trigger is a correct Type 2 with no tooling hole and ""S"" mark. The Hammer is a correct Type 2D, -5SA marked. The Hammer Spring Plunger is a correct Type I with no rims on the sides. The Hammer Spring Housing is a correct Type 2. The Safety is a correct Type 3B, -9SA marked with most of the original parkerized finish remaining. The Gas Cylinder is a correct Type 2C, unmarked, wide, that has been field painted over (this part is stainless and GIs found that it would not take a parkerized finish and would turn silvery bright and they would use all kinds of things to reduce glare and keep this part dark). The Gas Cylinder Lock is a correct Type I chamfered front face. The Gas Lock Screw is the correct Type I Single Slot. The Stock is a beautiful original Springfield Armory walnut stock marked with boxed SA/GAW and large Ordnance Escutcheon on the left side, a small Ordnance Escutcheon on the bottom of the pistol grip, and a sharp circle sans serif ""P"" firing proof mark. The hand guards are also excellent and the colors of all three blend nicely together. There are no cracks in any of the wood and it just has minimal dings and small scratches from use. The stock is simply gorgeous. This rifle comes with an original MILSCO marked Model 1907 Leather Sling, dated 1944, that is in excellent condition. The black has worn from the steel clips, but it is supple and still has both leather keepers. The butt trap compartment has an original WWII plastic Type 2 Oiler with hole in the pull through end, which is fairly commonly seen since the soldiers used to break the cap so the pull through could be inserted without having to unscrew the cap. This is a simply beautiful and all correct WWII Springfield Armory M1 Garand from the middle of the war. This rifle is C&R eligible."

 - Low profile loop with additional coverage on the front and back.
 - Front twin-tail design provides improved fit and function.
 - Welded, heat-seal ballistic panel cover with antimicrobial protection.
 - Easy care: removable panels allow convenient cleaning of the carrier.

We do not waste time teaching subject matter you already know, and we do not accept just anyone willing to pay the fee on the firing line either.

If someone accused us of placing high standards on our clients, we would have to enter a plea of guilt. We require every student to pass a handgun safety and proficiency test before the class starts to ensure the safety of all of our clients.

Because all of our Concealed Carry-Handgun (CCH) instructors are Marine Veterans who possess Criminal Justice expertise, we know first-hand how best to prepare you for two of the worst fights you could be in; a gun fight in the private sector, and the legal fight that will surely follow.

Though we teach the state mandated materials, we spend the majority of time teaching and explaining what you must know about North Carolina concealed carry and use of force law. If what you are looking for is both a challenge of your handgun skills and an educational course that will teach you much more than the N.C. CCH curriculum requires, this is your course.

PLEASE NOTE: It is our opinion that a concealed carry handgun course is NOT the place/time to become proficient with handguns. Anyone seeking to obtain their CCH Permit should already be proficient with handguns. For those who would benefit, we also offer NRA Pistol Courses. If you attend one of our NRA Pistol Courses first, we will discount your tuition fee for the CCH Course.

I had read about brand new (to New Jersey at least) AK-pattern/actioned rifles from Serbia that were famous for Yugo quality and accuracy, were reasonably priced, and NJ legal from the factory.  I read about these new Zastava PAP (PAP is three letters acronym in Serbain that means SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLE so its like saying , Remington SAR if you will) ... they were single stack 10 round mag rifle with the most BEAUTIFUL teak wood furniture you have ever seen on a rifle... with a BEAUTIFUL thumbhole stock that not only functioned perfectly and comfortably but looked so great, and a 3-hole Yugo style teak forend.  When I ordered mine, it finally came in but in plastic junk ""polymer"" furniture.  All the rifles coming into the United States now had polymer furniture.


The rifle was a gift for my old man and he really wanted the wood.  I have been trying to buy a new set since 2010.  Never found.  If you have some please hit me up.

For home, cabin, remote adventures and emergency preparedness, this grab-and-go kit has essentials you need to survive. The rifle is a DPMS A3 T.E.K. Lite 16 carbine in .223./5.56 NATO. Its 16"" barrel has 1:9 rifling twist with an A2 flash hider. The removable rear sight mounts on an optics-ready Picatinny rail. Six-position collapsible stock. Constructed of strong, lightweight components, the rifle weighs only 6-1/2 lbs. Comes with four 30-round magazines. Includes a Gerber Bear Gryllis Ultimate Kit™ that weighs only 9.4 oz. and is packed in a 4.5"" x 6.8"" ripstop-nylon bag. Kit contains a fire starter; waterproof matches; waterproof bag; snare wire; emergency cord; cotton balls for fire tinder; miniature light; handsaw; signaling mirror; survival blanket; waxed thread; fishing kit; sewing kit; land-to-air rescue and S.O.S. instructions; survival guide; and a Gerber miniature multitool with more than 10 tools.

In excellent condition, I just fired it 3 weeks ago and it shot perfect.  It's a ton of fun to shoot.  It has the long barrel.   I also have about 15 rounds left and some brass leftover for reloading.  I'm not interested in cash I would like to trade for a .45 ACP pistol.  Make or model is not that important as long as it's in good condition.  If you are interested in trading let me know.  I value the Ruger at about $500.  If you have a .45 ACP that is worth mrore than $500 let me know and I'll make up the difference with cash.
