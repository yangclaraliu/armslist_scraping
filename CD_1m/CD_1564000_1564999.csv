70mm (2-3/4"") and 76 mm (3"") cartridge case. 

The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well.

This morning I went in and when I got closer to the sporting goods counter I noticed a employee (not one of the sporting goods guys) with a cart of empty boxes. There is a blue tote sitting on the counter and he picks up a Winchester 555 rd box and puts in his cart and takes off. I thought that was funny so after seeing no ammo in stock I took off to locate him and saw him a few isles down in the toy section. I looked in the cart and there were no 22's in the cart. Hmmmmmm,,, He headed out to the back room with his empty boxes and no 22's. If I had been a few seconds earlier I would have beat him to them. I'm guessing he stashed them in the toy section for later purchase by him or an accomplice who plans on jacking the price to about $60.  I'm sick of it and I'm sure it happens all over this country. I guess you have to somehow supplement your income working at walmart."

Gun has some scratches from being worn by a police officer (previous owner) on a sling against a tactical vest. Flash suppressor has some slight damage. Was on the gun when I got it. It doesn't affect the accuracy at all. Gun is reliable and fun and the EOTech feels like you're cheating. It's just too easy!

Fired 60 times exactly. Shot a 1"" group at 110 yards with changing bore conditions while doing a bench rest break-in with factory ammo. It is plenty capable of Sub-1"" groups. I've decided to purchase another rifle now, so this one has to go.

Specs:
Ruger American 30-06 Springfield 22"" barrel with 1-10 RH twist ($359)
Factory ring bases
Weaver tactical 6 point 1"" scope rings ($45)
Caldwell XLA 6-9"" bipod ($49)
MeOpta MePro 3x9-42mm ($399) Very nice BDC (bullet drop compensator) optic
100% tang to the tip of the forearm glass bedded with Miles Gilbert Bedrock, and 100% free floated barrel.
Stippled grip, magazine, and forearm.

That comes to $852 for a very solid rifle (not including the glass bedding, free float, and stippling job). You don't need to spend $1000+ on a rifle to get great sub 500 yard groups. The weakest link in the chain is the optic, which is why I spent $400 on one for a $350 rifle. 

If you interested in brass with the rifle. Just inquire."

It has a 12 rd magazine and shoots the 9mm Makarov, which are currently cheaper and easier to find than your standard 9mm Luger.  It has a great trigger in both single or double action and can safely be carried cocked and locked or hammer down on a live round.

The shoulder holster is a brand new original Czech police shoulder holster specifically designed for use with this gun.  The gun and holster would make a great concealed carry option.

This is THE most reliable and accurate pistol I have ever owned.  I consider it way better than Glock's, especially when considering it runs about half the price.  The gun has typical finish wear but operates flawlessly.

Private transaction, C&R eligible.  Would consider trade for Ruger 10/22, semi-auto 22 LR pistol, or semi-auto 12 gauge with 3"" chamber.

Weight Unloaded:   33.3 oz 	
Magazine Capacity:  15 rounds*

Open Slide Design
    Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.

Disassembly Latch
    Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.

Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block
    The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

Rear Sight Profile
    The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

External Hammer Design
    A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

No Glare Finish
    Beretta's exclusive Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.

Light Aluminum Frame
    Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.

Reversible Magazine Release
    Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.

Unique Ultra Safe Design
    The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively ""on"" or ""off"". The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

Sure, Firm Grip
    The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. The grip frame is flared slightly at the base to enhance pointability and control.

High-Capacity Magazines
    The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

Chamber-loaded Indicator
    When a round is chambered, the extractor protrudes slightly to show a red indicator. In the dark, the user can feel the protruding extractor."

All of it is hard to find stuff as follows:

1 box of the original ""Black Talon"" ammo in .45 ACP - $55

2 (20) round boxes surplus 6.5 Carcano ammo with FMJ (nickel jacket) bullet - $30 for both.

2 boxes 30-06 Red Tracer ammo by Talon Mfg. - $60 for both.

2 boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser FMJ bullet & 2 boxes of 6.5 Swedish wood bullet ammo. The wood bullet ammo was considered to be ""blank"" ammunition when used with a special  adapter that shredded the wood bullet. However be extremely careful if firing without adapter because wood bullet is dangerous/deadly at close range. $50 for all four boxes. All of the 6.5 Swedish ammo listed is non-corrosive.

5 boxes WWII era 8x56R ammo. This ammo was made in 1938 as Germany was preparing for battle. This is the correct ammo for the M95 Steyr ""straight pull"" carbines & long rifles. This ammo is in amazing condition given it's age and each box, and every individual round bears the date of manufacture, and the proof mark  ""War Eagle"". The vast majority of this ammo will fire reliably and I shot many boxes through a M95 carbine I used to have. Recoil is quite heavy though in the carbine. This ammo is a ""very collectible"" piece of WWII history. Price is $20 a box or $80 for all five. Each box contains 10 rounds packed on 2 blued steel M95 stripper clips which sell for $5+ each on Gunbroker & Ebay.

Ammo to be picked up in the Brandon area and you must be 21 to purchase."

The  Holographic  Weapon  Sight  (HWS)  is  the first electro-optic sighting system to apply holographic technology to small and medium-sized weapon platforms. When used in close quarter battle environments, this revolutionary weapon optic delivers amazing speed and accuracy gains, an uncompromising use of peripheral vision, leaves no muzzle side operator signature and is packaged in a compact, durable unit. Now deployed with elite Special Forces and SWAT teams the world over, the HWS delivers a vastly improved shooting performance for all levels of operators. In holography, all the information required to reconstruct the reticule image is recorded everywhere in the Heads-Up Display window. If the window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain etc., the HWS remains fully operational, with the point of aim/impact being maintained.  Even in such extreme cases where the laminated window is sheltered, the HWS is fully functional!"
