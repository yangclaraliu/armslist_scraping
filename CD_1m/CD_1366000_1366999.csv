The GWACS Armory CAV15 MKII AR-15 lowers are made from glass-infused nylon-6 which is durable and resistant to chemicals and the elements. GWACS Armory tells me that they have a lower that has been run over by a truck and has 50,000 rounds through it so they are feeling pretty confident about the durability of their lowers. That is pretty impressive for a lower that only weighs 1 pound, 14 ounces (with all lower parts installed).

CAV-15 MKII Receiver Features:

Receiver weight (complete) is 1 full pound lighter than a complete aluminum receiver with an A2 stock.

A1 Length Integral Stock (5/8"" shorter than A2) with sling loop. 13"" Length of Pull.

Carbine Buffer System

Wider magazine well accepts unmodified, submachine gun magazines in pistol calibers. With caliber conversion upper receivers and magazine blocks, standard AR15 magazines can be used without modifications.

Uses all standard mil-spec parts with the exception of the take down pins. The front pivot and rear pins are a Quick Take Down style with Detents built into them. This allows for quick and easy removal of the pins while maintaining a positive lock.

Longer life, Nylon6 resists impacts and wear better than aluminum.

12.5 cents a round is pretty reasonable for this stuff in the present market, so I don't feel it is a ridiculous price.  That is pretty much the going rate, particularly when you consider the pain finding it, paying shipping etc.

Mossberg International's new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today's AR-style platforms with Mossberg International's reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. 
Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18"" barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. 
The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13"" length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4"" - 14.5"" LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. 
The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. 
Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine.

Mossberg's 500 pump-action shotguns offer an amazing amount of gun for an unbeatable price. First and foremost, the 500 is built to the same uncompromising mil-specs as the renowned Mossberg 590. Then a host of features are introduced-Quiet Carry dual-action bars, 3"" chambers, and an ambidextrous safety, to name a few. A simple change of barrel and/or choke tubes is all that's required to take one shotgun from upland birds to waterfowl, to turkey, to deer. Mossberg's incredible Field/Deer Combo includes a 28-inch ported field barrel with a ventilated rib and twin bead sights and a 24-inch ported fully rifled Slugster barrel with an integral scope base. The hardwood stock has been carefully checkered and uses a dual-comb system to allow comfort adjustments. Includes full, modified, and improved cylinder Accu-Chokes. Cheap scope also included.

This is a Browning Buck Mark .22 Long Rifle Target Pistol, late 1980s model.  It is in great condition, except for a few scratches from use here and there.  I have sent approximately 300 rounds through it since the late 1980s.  I am not aware of any problems with it and wish to get rid of it to buy another pistol.  I put a full magazine through it, a few months ago.  I have rarely used it and really have no use for it.  Because of its use, scratches, and age, I will sell for $250; however it normally goes for $400.  Yes, you are getting a deal.  I just want to get rid of it.  I used it as a kid for target and small game shooting.

Please ask as many questions as you need

One pistol

One magazine (separated)

One cloth wrapper (to compliment Indiana law)

From the Daniel Defense website:
-----
You asked and we listened. The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, v5 is perfectly adapted for end-users who plan on attaching the ever popular red dot, holographic or magnified optics to their firearm. The slick top monolithic upper receiver provides operators with valuable top rail real estate for accessories that fit their shooting needs.

Daniel Defense was always apprehensive about releasing a factory made firearm with a set or clap style gas block. Therefore the Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, v5 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

Product description below:

SureFire EP210 Listen / Talk Radio Comm System is a two-wire, single-cable radio communication system featuring an electronic ear coil (EA50) with an inline direct-connect speaker. The system utilizes the Push-to-Talk (PTT) button at the radio's side mount to transmit. Its single-cable design eliminates wire tangling by bonding the wires together into one durable cable. Sure Fire EP210 system uses the highest-quality components to deliver crystal-clear, two-way radio communications. Incoming communications are covertly channeled directly into your ear, reducing the potential danger of others overhearing messages you receive. Outgoing transmissions are equally as clear thanks to the water-resistant, high-gain microphone with integral windscreen for eliminating distracting wind noise."
