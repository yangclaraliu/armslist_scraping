Through a Rem700 SPS-V these rounds grouped as follows: Best was .30-.35 MOA / Worst was 1/2 MOA.   

Price MAY be negotiable, depending on the amount you wish to purchase. Please contact for ANY questions concerning this ammunition. Shipped in a cardboard box lined with a thick plastic bag. Buyer assumes responsibility for any shipping costs or any special shipping requests. 

Get this stuff while it's around, you will not be disappointed."

If you don't like the 5"" Flash Hider/Comp, I can spin on a Birdcage for you in it's place. (I run this same 5"" Flash Hider/Comp on my Stag and it works really well! Gonna try 'em out on my M17s next...) If you don't like the 45 Degree Offset BUIS, I will install a LMT or Similar Quality Rear Sight so that you may employ the Stock M4 Style Front Sight.

I have a good reputation for owning & building sweet AR's and other firearms for my own use... I spare no expense. When I decide to sell off the occasional weapon, the folks on this site have that acquired Weapons from me have been quite satisfied... I take my time and assemble things correctly... I seek professional assistance if I have even the most minor doubt about what I am building. WITH THAT SAID, it is always wise to have any firearm that you are not familiar with checked out by a qualified gunsmith and obtain an operations manual prior to operating any firearm.

TERMS: Come to my shop in Sheridan for a Face-To-Face AND for weapons inspection. I reserve the right to laugh in your face and slam my door shut if you look like a miscreant to me. Thanks to new regulatory idiocy in Colorado, a visit to an FFL Holder is Required for Transfer. I suggest that we go to Ark Tactical in Lakewood or Rapid Fire Bunker in Littleton for the Requisite Extraction of Funds & Second Amendment Violation now required by the State of Colorado... Including Documentation (you will now be on a ""list"" somewhere where the Federal Government can obtain access to it) now required by the State of Colorado, Background Check Fee Expense (this is a Digital Footprint which, as we all know, NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY) now required by the State of Colorado and the Transfer Fee Expense (gotta' pay the FFL Holder to do all of this useless, expensive and invasive crap for the State and the Feds) now required by the State of Colorado...

Eagle Arms, back then was basically the retail outlet for Lewis Machine & Tool's AR's, which are widely regarded as some of the best. 
Here is a short article about Eagle Arms:
Karl Lewis and Jim Glazier formed a company named Eagle Arms in Coal Valley Illinois
in 1986. Lewis had manufactured a wide variety of both commercial and military parts for M16 rifles, and Eagle
Arms assumed the increasingly distracting retail business from Lewis’ company, Lewis Machine and Tool (LMT).
Eagle Arms initially marketed M16 and AR15 type rifle parts. The early Stoner patents had expired, and Eagle was able to build both parts and complete rifles. In 1989 Eagle commenced production of complete rifles, with LMT serving as the major supplier.
In January 1994 Mr. Mark Westrom purchased the company. 
After the purchase, he continued producing Eagle Arms EA15 rifles with a focus on high grade target rifles. The bulk of the engineering work was contracted out to Lewis Macine Tool.
 In early 1995 Westrom purchased those rights, and production of ArmaLite rifles resumed in Illinois. The corporation was reorganized as ArmaLite, with Eagle Arms
converted to a division of ArmaLite. First shipments of new ArmaLite rifles began in 1995.

I contacted Armalite and furnished serial number and photos of this rifle....
****  Here is the reply from them...""Your rifle is an Action Master rifle produced in 1993, 20” Douglas stainless steel 1:9” twist match bbl float tube, flat top upper receiver and Natl match trigger.

So this is basically a 'Pre-ban' rifle that was made by LMT (Lewis Machine Tool)....If you do not know who they are....search online and you will find the quality and prices of their guns.

I got this from the original owner ...he bought it new and it has ~500 rounds thru it.

I am retired and my hobby is collecting and trading guns; as such, I would prefer to trade this rather than sell it.

This is not some mix and match AR that someone tossed together!! Look at the link pictures and see what others say online about the quality of LMT and specifically this Action Master from Eagle Arms!!

I will be open to trades where cash comes my way....if both parties feel it is fair.
I like .45 acp autos, .357 carry size, but open to anything I do not have....will consider multiple guns as trade. Keep in mind that I have OVER $1500 in this package.

This weapon is very rare and will be worth double its current value in 10 years. 

Currently there are several versions of the 551 in the US but none of them as rare as this import. This is the original all Swiss 551-2 SP in green, not the later imported 2 SP designated for the LE agencies in Black or Grey.  Those rifles were released for sale to the consumer market after being used. Those rifles were imported in the 90's AFTER the assault ban. They are well used and show plenty of wear by the LE agencies that owned them. This rifle is nearly spotless some marks from handling. There is no wear, burns, or scratches on the ejection port or any other moving parts, including the stock. This rifle is almost mint quality there are probably less than 20 in the US in this fine condition. This rifle belongs in the hands of a collector who likes to own rare guns, especially Swiss guns.

175,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1794175,For Sale:  2009 Bowtech Sentinel setup without sight,"Newton, New Jersey, United States",$ 500,"Listed On: Saturday, June 22, 2013",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale: Selling my baby..., a 2009 Bowtech Sentinel compound bow. This bow is the one with the Roller Guard, not the FlxGuard. Right-handed, 50-60 lbs., 7"" brace height, 36.75"" axle-to-axle (I think), draw lenght is 30.5-24.5"", 80% let-off, supposed to be about 330 fps IBO (I never shot close to IBO, so I never got close to that speed). Buying a new bow...

String is a white/blue twist, one cable is white, and one is blue. The strings and cables are less than one year old and are in excellent shape (MINIMAL serving spread around tight bends on cams), they were custom built by Stone Mountain, and they are the Titanium Pre-Stretched line. String has a 3/16"" blue G5 Meta peep (face has been blacked with a sharpie to provide a more definitive ""halo"" for the eye. The string loop is a white 4.25"" PSE, with a small serving of red material above the top knot to provide a reference point in case of necessary replacement of loop, the loop is in good shape yet, it was only shot with a Carter RX1 release. The kisser button is a double clamp Bohning Hunter hard plastic one. There are no silencers on the string, but each control cable has one oem Bowtech silencer on it (replaced when I replaced the string). The rubber string stop was also replaced when the string was.

Bow limbs are not original camo, as they have been replaced with 50-60 lb. limbs about a week ago, they are black. The limb texture is also the new one, the riser is the InVelvet finish in Realtree Hardwoods Green. The camo riser and black limbs give it a sharp look though... The SVL split limb silencers are included.

Bow will include a Ripcord Code Red drop-away rest that is less than one year old. The rest does not have the top containment bar on it, due to the Roller Guard/rest placement. The Ripcord's drop cord has been served into the one control cable to reduce weight and for more security. The bow also will include the Octane 7"" hydraulic stabilizer in matching camo. Front of the handle has the SVL handle strip.

The bow is used, but as stated, it was my baby . This bow was used for hunting and target. Cams show minor dings/rubs/marks. Does show minor wear, and some of the screws show minimal dustings of rust and slight use wear in allen key insets... For a 2009 this is in EXCELLENT shape!

This bow would make a great target or hunting bow, when I had my sight on it, I had it dialed out to 90 yds. WHEN I did my part, this bow would shoot between 4-6"" @ 90 yds. I had to be careful at the ranges of 40 yds. and under due to the fact that the arrows would touch.

Bow is set at 60 lbs., and a 28.5"" draw right now.

I would like to get $500 shipped in continental US, $475 cash FTF. Any questions, feel free to ask before you commit. Reasonable offers will be entertained if it doesn't sell soon. I may list elsewhere also though...

Thanks for looking."

It has had exactly 15 rounds fired. The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

UPGRADES INCLUDE

ATI tactical adujustable stock with pistol grip. (for a Home ""d"" shot gun a pistol grip WITH buttstock is better for control, its much harder for someone to wrestle this away in a struggle)

ATI pistol forgrip

HEAT SHIELD with ghost sights. (easy sight picture, with side walls to protect sights)

If you just slap this on your glock, you will be breaking the law. Not that anyone would know or care- just giving the facts here.)

1.Can I use ANY stock assembly with the tactical stock adapter? 
Yes.  You can use any fixed stock, collapsible stock, folding stock etc.  If it fits on AR-15 / M16 / M4 rifles it will work with the tactical stock adapter. 



2.What are all the parts I need in order to use the tactical stock adapter?
1) Buffer tube (also known as a ""receiver extension"")
 2) The shoulder stock of your choice
 3) Anti-rotational receiver plate (should be included when you buy most stock assemblies)
 4) Castle nut (should be included when you buy most stock assemblies)


ENDO Tactical - What parts you need 



3.Do I need to insert the buffer spring and the buffer weight inside the receiver extension (buffer tube) before I attach it to the tactical stock adapter?
No.  Neither will be useful in this instance. 



4.What tools do I need in order to install a tactical stock adapter?
None, but you may want to use a special AR-15 / M16 / M4 stock wrench to snug the castle nut up against the reciever plate, which holds your buffer tube secure.  The castle nut does not need to be very tight so a good hand tightening should work fine. A dot of blue loctite will stop the castle nut from coming loose if the issue ever arises. 



5.Can my compensated (C), long (L), or Rough Textured Frame (RTF) version Glock be used with the tactical stock adapter? 
Yes, it will work with models G17C, G17L, G20C, G21C, G21L, G22C, G24C, and G31C and RTF versions, because the frame is the same size. 



6.Will it fit the new Gen4 Glocks? 
Yes, with very minor modification to the backstrap insert of the adapter."

This is the HK MP5 22 made by Carl Walther under license from HK, it is currently the only licensed HK trainer. It is made in Germany and imported by Umarex. It is almost identical in weight and function with the MP5N 9mm, intended as a low cost trainer. It IS NOT the cheap plastic GSG clone, it a metal receiver fully licensed replica/trainer and will accept most all standard HK sight rails, forgrips and other accessories.

Barrel Twist:	1 in 13-3/4 in
Grooves:	6
Operation:	Blowback
Front Sight:	Interchangeable Posts
Rear Sight:	Adjustable Wind & Elevation

I've had a blast with this rifle. It's pure joy to shoot with excellent accuracy with iron sights and will accept all MP5 sight rails and accessories. Mine has a Blackhawk single point mash hook sling and one extra magazine (so a total of 2), factory included small tools and additional front sight post, the original box and paperwork.

It does have some finish damage around the rear sling point. The mash hook is a little harder on a weapon but it is a positive connection sling point, so you can rest assured your weapon isn't going to fall off as you run through a shooting stage. (see photos) Otherwise, the fit and finish are excellent.

Face to face trade, must be willing to complete a bill of sale for private party transaction, have a valid photo ID.

 The GSG-5 Pistol is an identical replication of the MP5, except one great thing: It's a .22
 caliber. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG-5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle, or a serious varmint hunting rifle.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact Sig Sauer pistol, engineers designed the P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame Sig Sauer pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the Sig Sauer P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular Sig Sauer slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the Siglite Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The Sig Sauer P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing.

After 25 years of being accessorized, customized and re-imagined in countless movies, television shows and video games, the Desert Eagle® Pistol has emerged as a pop-culture icon. You can customize your Desert Eagle Pistol with a variety of impressive finishes to add your own distinctive twist to this timeless firearm. All models feature a full Picatinny rail on the barrel from the end of the chamber to right behind the front sight and standard ambidextrous safeties.

Here, all is for sale since I don't want unneeded ammo sitting around and can't seel ammo on ebay.  I travel all over the eastern half of Texas and can meet up most anywhere."

This is a Remington 11-96, which was manufactured from 1996-99 and was voted the shotgun of the year in 1997. Essentially this is an upgraded 11-87 that has been lightened with the addition of a trimmed receiver, and a different contour barrel and forearm. What really sets this one apart is the Claro Walnut factory adjustable stock which was nearly a $400 option. This was the first/only time that Remington offered an adjustable stock on the 1100 series, and I have only seen photos of 3 with this option! You will also find that the scroll work on the receiver is a notch above the typical work you see, and combined with the stock gives it an excellent eye appeal. That means you will get looks and compliments from others on the hunt or at the range, make sure you can handle that. 

Because of the weight, this shotgun points exceptionally fast. Weighing in around 7 pounds also makes it easy to carry in the field without sore arms at the end of the day. You would think that with the lighter weight it would punish your shoulder, but that is not the case. It has proved effective with skeet and trap, and is very quick to the bird. It is in excellent condition, with very few shells fired (estimated in the 200 range). It will come with a nice Bulldog case and additional gas seals. If you have any questions please let me know."

Serious firepower in a small package. The X-25 is a .308 caliber 50 round single stack compact drum designed for AR .308 SR/25 rifles. The magazine easily loads and unloads by operating the front hand wheel. Designed to operate in automatic and semiautomatic applications, it employs a larger hand-wheel and double spring for increased reliability. Unique to this magazine's design is a patent pending feed device that allows the magazine to run massive spring pressures without effecting the firearm's bolt operation. The durable body is constructed entirely of aluminum; and finished in a friction reducing ceramic coating. All internal and operating assemblies are made of black oxide steel and aluminum. Comes with a lifetime warranty and includes an instruction manual. Currently available in black, optional colors coming soon. Please note: That with the wide variance in receiver specs there may need some slight fitting in order to work properly. Please read the owners manual before use."
