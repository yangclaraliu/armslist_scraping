I took this Brand New Bulgy AK74 in on trade and really don't have a use for it.  It was built 11/2012 by TGI (not a typical cheapo and not a “truck gun”) with an unissued parts kit around a NODAK Spud Receiver and by far the nicest one I've ever seen.  The rivet job is spectacular and the furniture is perfect and obviously never issued as well. I have run 25rds down the pipe (non-corrosive) and she's a real peach. 

Comes with (2) Tapco 30rd Mags, Tactical Case and a Bulgarian (plum) Plastic Furniture Kit.  I picked this up to swap over in the event I kept her to keep the original furniture perfect for the future.

Only Trade Considered is a Ruger SR1911 + Cash

I will sell FTF to a KS resident legally able to purchase and own a firearm in our state or thru your out of state FFL.

ATI's Omni lower receiver is as strong as aluminum and will accept any .223 caliber upper and magazine. The Omni is a multi-caliber AR15 lower made of reinforced polymer. It is designed after a mil-spec lower and is compatible with most current AR15 lower parts kits, grips and stocks. Made with a high-grade durable polymer material, the Omni can withstand harsh environments as well as everyday wear and tear.

It has tested reliably with .22, .556, and .410, but is not recommended for higher calibers.

The reason I'm selling is because I bought too many of these. These are going for much more on gunbroker.com and has 1-2 month back logs from the manufacturer. Also no FFL to deal with or expense. I would rather sell local to save on sale expenses at gunbroker.com or consignment.

Will sell individually for $110 each.

ATI's Omni lower receiver is as strong as aluminum and will accept any .223 caliber upper and magazine. The Omni is a multi-caliber AR15 lower made of reinforced polymer. It is designed after a mil-spec lower and is compatible with most current AR15 lower parts kits, grips and stocks. Made with a high-grade durable polymer material, the Omni can withstand harsh environments as well as everyday wear and tear.

It has tested reliably with .22, .556, and .410, but is not recommended for higher calibers.

The reason I'm selling is because I bought too many of these. These are going for much more on gunbroker.com and has 1-2 month back logs from the manufacturer. Also no FFL to deal with or expense. I would rather sell local to save on sale expenses at gunbroker.com or consignment.

Will sell individually for $110 each.

Madison, NC – In 1908, John D. Pedersen was issued a patent for his unique pump shotgun design. That same year, Pedersen began his long-standing relationship with Remington and the first Remington pump-action shotgun – the Model 10 was introduced. Other slide-action designs followed including the Model 17 in 1921 – the first Remington 20-gauge pump shotgun; and then the Model 29closely followed by its replacement two years later – the Model 31 which remained in production until 1949. Remington’s long-standing history of delivering dependable pump-action shotguns was solidified with the introduction of the Model 870 shotgun in 1950 which continues in production today. To recognize this historic benchmark in firearms history – Remington introduced the Model 870 Wingmaster 100th Anniversary Commemorative Edition in 12 gauge. 
The venerable Model 870 shotgun, is still the shotgun by which all other shotguns are measured. This limited edition, one-year only offering of the Model 870 Wingmaster features fine line embellishments on both sides of the receiver and on the left side, the centennial logo is emblazed with gold. “100 Years of Remington Pump Shotguns” banner and flushing pheasant encased with the anniversary years 1908 – 2008 is gold-inlayed onto the contrasting, high polish blued finish. A striking gold trigger complements the inlayed logo. 
In honoring Remington's storied past, Remington didn’t stop with enhancing just the metal work on this finely-crafted gun. Further setting this commemorative edition apart is the solid American walnut stock and fore-end, constructed from “B” Grade wood and finished with a classic high-gloss sheen. Both stock and fore-end also feature our nostalgic fleur-de-lis checkering. 
This Model 870 pump-action features the same proven twin-action bar design that has made this shotgun so popular for its flawless feeding, extraction and ejection. The receiver is machined from a single block of solid steel and can reliably handle light 2 3/4 to magnum 3-inch loads. The hammer-forged, carbon steel 28-inch vent rib Rem Choke barrel. One hundred years of leading the industry with innovative, pump-action designs is worth celebrating and the finely-crafted and handsomely-embellished Model 870 Wingmaster 100th Anniversary shotgun is worthy of the honor.

Caliber is 7.65mm (.32 ACP). It is a semi-automatic small frame pistol based on the Walther PPK action. It was used primarily by police forces. The overall condition is good. The frame and slide shows some wear and overall thinning. The black plastic grips are very good with only a few marks and scratches from use. The bore is clean with strong rifling. The action is excellent.

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP. It has a low 1.4 million serial number so was made in middle of WWII. Stock is birch and is clean with only a few dings.

I am selling it with 50-rds ammo, two 30-round magazines, and a carbine pouch with two-15 round magazines (15-round mags are loaded with ammo). It also includes the sling and oiler.

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

I had no intent of selling any of my carbines but with the craziness in Colorado (high-capacity mag ban, limitations on private sales, etc.), I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and with 15- and 30-round magazines legally at a fair price.

If you are not familar with the M1 Carbine, these are our first real a$$ault rifle. My favorite gun to shoot - they always go to the shooting range.

I can show up on time, and bid interior work.
Most bid most smaller rooms w/ 8 foot walls at $250.  This includes labor for patching and painting the ceiling, walls, and trim.  Paint is extra.  A plausible trade is a pump shotgun, such as a mossberg 500 plus some cash for gas and food.

A nice revolver or a lever gun, perhaps?

price:  I don't need to sell, but would like to fund a different tool. I am not looking to gouge you, but I am not about to take anything that resembles a loss either.  Therefore, send me an offer.  If it is too low in my estimation, I will ignore it.  If it is in the ball park, I'll reply.  The point is so that another patriot will be armed and ready to respond, no more piece-meal buying of a stripped lower here, upper there, crap ammo on craig's list, thermold mags at a gunshow in Montrose, scope next week, sling never 'cus 550 is ""just as good,"" etc etc.  However, if you want just the gun because you already have the ammo and mags, then fine.  

Please note: I will NOT sell just the ammo unless you offer some unbelievably stupid price.

typical rules, CO DL+ BOS required, Mil CAC or CCW gets priority.  Cash is king, but open to Gold or maybe some soon-to-be-banned-but-perfectly-legal-today gun trades. I'm only interested in guns that obama would not want me to have, so while your trapdoors and lever actions are neat history, please do not waste our time with those kind of offers.

This is a VERY reasonable price at this point in time, so I imagine this should sell quickly. You will need to show proof of age 18+yrs. Priority will go to CT residents with pistol permit, 2nd form of gov't ID, and flexibility in meeting time/place. I will NOT hold the sale for more than 8hours waiting for a potential buyer to arrange meeting/payment.

NO TIRE KICKERS - I've seriously had 15 people back out of the deal on this rifle without even seeing it in person. Either trade or cash deal. Since this is such a large sum of money, you will need to pay with a Certified Bank Check or Money Order...

I value my rifle at $1500 pre panic price and will include one 30rd pmag, one 20rd pmag and a magpul ms2 sling. I put prices I paid a year ago for everything. As you can see it comes to $1500 before my labor to assemble and test the weapon. Since everything is very scarce now, I'm asking $1750 cash or will do $1500 trade value...

I've lowered the price substantially, If you're one of the people that has welched on the deal previously, I WILL NOT sell to you on the grounds of you being a doucher."

I'm real. Pat Quinn wants to appeal concealed carry. 

I have two (2) American Tactical Imports OMNI lower receivers for sale for $200.

ATI's Omni lower receiver is as strong as aluminum and will accept any .223 caliber upper and magazine. The Omni is a multi-caliber AR15 lower made of reinforced polymer. It is designed after a mil-spec lower and is compatible with most current AR15 lower parts kits, grips and stocks. Made with a high-grade durable polymer material, the Omni can withstand harsh environments as well as everyday wear and tear.

 It has tested reliably with .22, .556, and .410, but is not recommended for higher calibers.

The reason I'm selling is because I bought too many of these. These are going for much more on gunbroker.com and has 1-2 month back logs from the manufacturer. I would rather sell local to save on sale expenses at gunbroker.com or consignment.

 Will sell individually for $110 each.

 If interested please email your name number and a good time to call or text. Not interested in trades. In the western suburbs and can meet halfway."

These are great to double your capacity and they work well as a handle for you to club someone over the head with your heavy p series when you run out of ammo. 

$30 each I can ship them if needed for $3 each.  Don't ask me to ship anywhere they are banned, YOU can break the law, but I will not! I will take PayPal, but add 3% to total to cover the fees.

This is hand checkered wood, not some crappy punched or machine cut checkering. Hand finished with 4 coats of Tung Oil and rubbed to a semi-glossy finish. That way it still has eye appeal, but is not too reflective in the field. There is a Pachmayr Decelerator pad on the buttstock for the big magnum calibers

As a warning this stock was finished with Tung Oil, so if you have any tree nut allergies, this is not the stock for you. 

I am more than willing to ship this stock, but you will need to pay for shipping.

Santa Cruz Gun Locks sells additional keys for $2 a piece- they sell the actuation switch for $8 (or just pick a switch at the auto parts store) and they sell replacement solenoids for I believe $12 (not that there's anything wrong with the solenoid).  I think these were originally mounted to the shield separating the front seats from the passenger pokey- but the chassis is flat and could be mounted most anywhere with very minor fab.  Cool piece- perfect for keeping your truck-gun handy-yet-secure.  I'm asking $75 OBO or trade (which I think is pretty fair considering the police dept paid around $300 for it!).

Bolt Carrier Group: Nickel-boron coated M16 Full-auto bolt carrier group, MP and HP tested 

Lower: Complete New Frontier Armory LW-15 Lower

Accessories:
Recoil Pad- Increases comfort, length of pull, and reduces recoil
Quad Rail - Replaces stock carbine handguard, stronger than stock handguard, and allows for any picattiny/weaver attachments.
Ladder Covers - Protects the rail from damage and make it much more comfortable, these are Magpul FDE (tan)
Magpul RVG - Excellent vertical grip, and the magpul grip is much nicer than most of the competition, allows for either normal full grip, ""C"" grip, or Magpul Dynamics style handstop

These rifles also come with a rear sight, charging handle, and 2-point padded sling. 
These rifles are 100% ready to go, just add ammo. They have been laser bore sighted and test fired for functionality. The barrels are extremely nice and made by FN USA, the chrome lining will keep the barrel in top shape longer than you can afford to shoot it. The upper is built completely to mil-spec and features M4 feed ramps for more reliable feeding. And the bolt carrier groups are of the M16 variety, the gun is only semi-automatic but the bolts are built to be used in automatic weapons and will hold up much better than most which are only built to meet the .223 ar-15 semi-auto specs, they are also coated in nickel boron which reduces friction, requires less lubrication, lasts longer, and is incredibly easier to clean. These are not home brewn parts guns, they are barreled upper assemblies that have been factory assembled and headspaced, with a bolt carrier group installed, and pinned to a complete factory built lower, buy with confidence.

Nickel plated trigger assembly, Leopold rifleman 3-9/40mm($200), Burris scope mount, custom camo paint($200). This is the mountain rifle stainless synthetic without the fixed clip or base plate, it has the blind magazine. this model was only made in 1993 and is not a BDL, ADL, or CDL. Very smooth, flat shooting gun. I'm also throwing in a box of .280 rem 139 gr hornady superformance sst rounds. Remington didn’t offer a stainless-steel M700 until 1992. In 1992 the very first M700 in stainless was called the Model 700 Stainless Synthetic. That rifle chambered .270 Winchester featured a blind magazine and a 24-inch barrel. In 1993 that model was changed to the Remington Model 700 BDL Stainless Synthetic, and as a BDL it then featured a hinged floor plate. Also in 1993 Remington introduced what is called the Model 700 Mountain Rifle Stainless Synthetic. It featured a blind magazine and a slimmed-down mountain profile 22-inch barrel and that's what I have here. In my pics there are photos of the relevant pages in the 1993 Remington catalog.

The original owner purchased this rifle in the early 60s to go hunting in Alaska.  He took it to a Colorado Springs gunsmith to have a muzzle brake installed, but there was some discussion about installing a muzzle brake on the original barrel of this rifle.  The gunsmith was also concerned that the original Winchester stock might not be strong enough to absorb the recoil of the new 338 caliber. 

It was finally decided to install a new 338 Winchester barrel on the original Winchester action, add a muzzle brake and fit it into a new Winchester synthetic stock. This is the current configuration, but the original stock and barrel are included in this sale if the buyer wants to restore the rifle back to original.

Leupold 2-7 Vari-X II scope and rings available for $200 extra – original mount will stay on the rifle with or without the scope.

 This combo has already withstood years of use and I made it for myself, so you know I did not skimp on anything.
 You can dang near split rails with this bad boy. The shield is also VERY tough, and is of thick gage steel. It started life out as a serving tray until one day I fabricated it for a higher purpose.

One side of the shield is painted with black epoxy paint, and shows a bit of wear on one side. The inside is totally unpainted.

I also ""greyed"" the blade in the old style French method, just like I did my Sabatier chef's knife. NO, I will not divulge the secret. I swore an oath....the Code of the Norman Swordsmiths. (yeah, right!) The grip of the sword is solid and slip resistant. I will tell you how I did it once you hold it in your hand.

Anyway, I have this set so it can be displayed in your Man Cave, yet ready to defend your castle. Even if you have to chop your way though the door. This will do it.

This is NOT a wall hanger, or a cute conversation piece. It is a serious weapon and deserves due respect. You will NEVER regret obtaining this. it is the kind of sword you can pass down to your grandkids.
