 .22 LR and has a double-action/single-action (DA/SA) trigger. 
Single action trigger pull is 4.4 lbs while Double-action is 12.4 lbs.
 The polymer frame and small size (compared to the SIG P226) allow the pistol with magazine to weigh little more than 24.6 oz. 
The overall height is 5.3 inches with a barrel length of 3.9 inches. 
The Mosquito's frame has an accessory rail, a ten-round capacity magazine, and adjustable sights.

The SIG Mosquito is a blowback-operated, semi-automatic pistol based on the SIG Sauer P226, but 10% smaller in size and chambered for the .22 LR cartridge. The pistol is manufactured with an aluminum-zinc alloy slide and polymer frame. The controls are similar to those present on full-size models and include (from front to rear) a left takedown lever, a left decocking lever, reversible magazine catch and ambidextrous manual safety. In addition, the pistol is provided with an integral safety lock located at the rear of the magazine well which when enabled prevents cycling of slide, hammer fall, and trigger action."

This gun is the commercial version, and the 6th variant (there were six model variants?). The Ortgies pocket pistols were made (officially) from 1919 to 1924. This particular gun (according to the serial number) was made around 1922-23. The Orgies semi-automatic pistols were excellent, well made guns. The design was ahead of its time. This gun has the factory original 7rd magazine. Overall, this gun is in very good condition. Has all matching numbers (barrel, frame, slide). Bluing is in really good condition for its age (this gun is at least 90 years old). All original finish, not re-blued, or anything like that. Has factory wood grips. The grips has no cracks, splits, or damages. Has a few minor dents and dings. Barrel is in very good condition - has a few minor surface rust. Bore is in very good condition. Has a a few minor rust (the Germans or people back in the old days used highly corrosive ammo). In addition, there's an old Ortgies owner's manual. It's really worn out, tattered, but all the pages are there (but not intact - it looks like as old as the gun itself).  You must be at least 21 years old or older and have a valid Kentucky driver's license (KY CCDW) to buy/trade this gun. Local (Kentucky) sale/trade only. No shipping. Just email me with any questions. Serious inquiries only please. Thanks for looking.

 -- Below is an excerpt from one of the Ortgies websites. It is not my own. I am just giving a credit to the author/creator of that particular website. You can do a google (or yahoo) search on this particular pistol on the internet. There are several Ortgies websites on line --

 "" The Ortgies pistol has a number of unusual design features. The most obvious is its grip safety which, once squeezed, stays in the “fire” position without further pressure of the hand on the grip. A button on the left side of the gun allows the grip safety to pop back out. Since the grip safety is powered by the striker spring, the safety can only be popped out, i.e., placed in the “safe” position, when the striker is cocked. Hence, if the safety is enabled, the gun is cocked. When the grip safety is enabled, the sear is prevented from moving downward and the tension on the striker spring is reduced. Pressing the safety- enabling button also allows the slide to be lifted off the frame rail for disassembly. The striker serves as the ejector. ""

The Nano's extremely low profile, snag-free design makes it easy to carry
and draw from concealment. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis
the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is
simple to disassemble and maintain. The light, durable frame employs
thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass-reinforced
techno-polymer. The Nano's sights are user-adjustable with a 1.3mm hex
wrench. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine
release button can be easily reversed. Modular structure, ergonomics and
ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

The Sig Sauer P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other
combat handguns are measured. The P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy Seals,
Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas
Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police. The
exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to
handle. 9mm, its longer barrel
yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

Please note: You can use any full size or compact handgun with a rail. It does not have to be a Sig Sauer in order to operate this awesone platform.......The SIG SAUER® Standard Adaptive Carbine Platform (ACP) allows any handgun with an accessory rail to be quickly modified into a personal defense weapon or carbine style firearm. Regardless of the brand, most pistols equipped with an accessory rail can be mounted to the ACP without the need for modification to the base gun. ACP will accept most railed guns with barrels up to 5"" in length. This basic model allows for fast, easy conversion and works with most railed pistols, equipped with a QD sling mount. Fabricated from solid aircraft-grade aluminum, the ACP sports M1913 rails at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions with a full-length top rail at the 12 o’clock position. Compatible accessories such as lights, red dot sights and lasers can be mounted for additional functionality. The ACP brings Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) features to almost any handgun.

 200-2000 pcs will cost 12.65 to ship.
 1500-4000 pcs will cost 16.50 to ship.

 Your welcome to mix and match any quantity of any size. Example:
 500 pcs each of, 9mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP = 1500 pcs and would ship for 12.65.

 If you reload several sizes, than you will do well here, You can mix your numbers any way you want.

 Payment: I prefer PAY-PAL, but I have a store front business and take credit card orders over the phone every day but Sunday and if need be will take a money order. If you prefer a personal check that is fine also, but it will delay your shipment till it clears the bank.

 Please note: You can use any full size or compact handgun with a rail. It does not have to be a Sig Sauer in order to operate this awesone platform.......The SIG SAUER® Standard Adaptive Carbine Platform (ACP) allows any handgun with an accessory rail to be quickly modified into a personal defense weapon or carbine style firearm. Regardless of the brand, most pistols equipped with an accessory rail can be mounted to the ACP without the need for modification to the base gun. ACP will accept most railed guns with barrels up to 5"" in length. This basic model allows for fast, easy conversion and works with most railed pistols, equipped with a QD sling mount. Fabricated from solid aircraft-grade aluminum, the ACP sports M1913 rails at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions with a full-length top rail at the 12 o’clock position. Compatible accessories such as lights, red dot sights and lasers can be mounted for additional functionality. The ACP brings Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) features to almost any handgun.

A reproduction of the 1873 Single Action. This model is one of the most accurate in appearance while reproducing the Old West tradition of the classic sixgun chambered for rimfire cartridges! While maintaining the true to form classic design, our Single Action revolver is a hybrid of modern technology and manufacturing with the feel of the Old West. This revolver is crafted with a steel rifled barrel, with most of the mechanism and components constructed from a special formulated alloy that offers greater ductility and flexibility assuring long lasting reliability and durability. Black plastic chequered grips give feel and balance, while a manual locking safety provides additional protection with a highly visible red indicator showing when it’s ready to shoot. This great little pistol is available in .22 LR and .22 Win Mag., and at a price that will fit any shooters budget without sacrificing quality."

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A."

It has almost perfect Parkerizing, under the action and trigger it looks as good as new. 
It's got Harrington & Richardson receiver, Springfield Armory bolt and mostly HR parts. 
 I checked the serial number years ago and it was made in '53-55 I think. The barrel date stamp is 4-55.

  I have the certificate of authenticity as well.
Included with it is an ammo can with bandoliers and only missing 1 round,  as I've shot it one time when I got it just to see. It's been kept in a climate controlled safe and rarely taken out.

I would consider trades for a quality .45 such as Kimber, Colt Gold Cup, Springfield Armory or a Glock plus you put up some cash or enough ammo to be of equal value. 

Don't pay any attention to the caliber listed as I can't get it to change when I posted this. It's a caliber .30 and the ammo is M2 ball. 

I had it on here for $1300 but I decided to lower the price to $900.

The manual lever safety and slide stop lever are both ambidextrous while the magazine release button is reversible. The Bruniton non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion and wear.

This is a custom shop Speed Six with EVERY available option in near mint condition.  Was presented to NRA Director Jeanne E Bray in 1976 by the VP of Ruger, and I have a stack of documents proving authenticity as well as the original red box.  Never carried, probably never even fired by Ms Bray as she passed away shortly after receipt.  The dealer who purchased this from her state fired 6 rounds through it to test function and accuracy, and I fired 12 through it myself.  18 rounds total down the pipe.  Like New condition.

Options include: stainless steel, concealment grips, custom 2.5"" barrel, bobbed and checkered hammer with no spur for DA/SA shooting, internals stoned and polished with trigger pull lightened.  All modifications done at Ruger custom hop.  SMOOTHEST, lightest DA trigger I've ever experienced.  All in a heavy duty revolver that can easily handle a constant diet of magnum strength +P+ Treasury loads.  I fired standard pressure FMJ through this and it was like shooting an airgun.  Zero recoil.   

Why am I selling the BEST snubnosed 38 ever made?  I could use the extra cash, and it is a bit heavier than I'm comfortably with.  Great for a nightstand, purse, belt holster, or shoulder holster, but certainly not a pocket gun.

Asking only $700 with box and paperwork.  Will not ship unless you're willing to pay 800 via USPS MO sent Priority Mail but I really do not want to ship.  Prefer to meet in or near Denver.  CASH ONLY.  Possible partial trades include: alloy P230, nickel M37, pre-lock 342, pre-lock 442 and that is it.  ZERO interest in any other trades.  Will accept Pemington Golden Saber, Winchester Silvertip, or Federal NyClad 38 Special ammo towards purchase at current retail prices.  ZERO interest in any other ammo.

No tirekickers.  Gun looks better than pics and will not disappoint.  Serious buyers please put telephone number in reply.  Must be willing to meet near Denver and have no legal restrictions pertaining to owning this gun.  Thanks."

Looking to buy a Smith and Wesson model 29 44 magnum blued or black with the 8"" barrel. I don't care what model it is as far as how old it was made, but gun must be able to be shot or made to do so. I do not want a pristine display item, I'm looking for a good-great condition gun i can actually take to the range and shoot, not hang on my wall. No other models wanted, no short barrel and no chrome or nickel finishes wanted either!! Original wood grips preferred but not required!

I have valid IL DL and FOID card, looking and preferring for FTF transaction somewhere reasonably close to Chicago...but will drive or meet for right deal!! I will gladly follow all laws concerning your sale of handgun to me, no problem.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.
