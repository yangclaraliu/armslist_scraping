*NOTICE: PMAG 20LR COMPATIBILITY WITH LMT MWS RIFLE
A potential compatibility issue has come to Magpul's attention regarding the PMAG 20LR magazine when used in a limited number of 7.62 NATO caliber LMT MWS weapon systems. When the PMAG 20LR is inserted into the magazine well, some MWS rifles exhibit interference between the bolt catch and the rear of the magazine. This can cause partial engagement of the bolt catch and result in unintentional contact between the bolt carrier group and the bolt catch during normal weapon operation. Although this issue has only been reported by a very limited number of end users, Magpul has introduced a slight modification to all new production PMAG 20LR magazines to eliminate any potential for bolt catch interference, effective 5/18/2011."

It stands 5 feet tall, its 6 feet long and 30 inches wide. It weighs a few hundred pounds. It disassembles into two pieces. Cleaning out the trap I found 9mm, 40, 45, deer slugs, and some caliber of rifle bullets. I was told marysville police used the indoor range for target practice with pistols and shot guns. 
it's in pretty good shape.

This would be great to put in a basement or barn to practice all year long

asking 500 OBO you will have to look at it in my garage. And it will take 2 or 3 guys to break it down and load."

Also anyone got any 380 ammo for the other Makarov I have  LOL I don't have any 380 to shoot in them, sigh this ammo scare sucks! 
Anyway

Caliber is 380, Yes a few Makarovs in 380 made it in the USA, the 380acp is much more common on the shelf in America than Russian 9x18 and has better personal defense selections in hollow points. It is my understanding that the 9x18 mags also work for it.

It is Single stack 8+1 rounds, and would make a decent IWB concealed carry. Included is 2 grips. 

$350 or may trade for a Ruger lcp and mags.
