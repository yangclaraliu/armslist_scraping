(#280) ***NEW IN BOX*** BERETTA PX4 STORM 9MM with two 17-round magazines and adjustable grips. 

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 

The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction). 

Other Features: Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block, 2-Dot Sight System, Ambidextrous Safety, External Hammer Design, Individual Size Grips, Reversible Magazine Release, Simple Field Stripping, Light Technopolymer Frame

Stock # MSH252109DJ. Serial # 12. One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is also one of over 80 Lugers we currently have for sale. What you have here is a rare opportunity for the Collector to obtain a very early Model 1900 Luger with the amazing low serial # 12 (This is not the original serial #, added later to make it legal, as the 3 was lost in polishing for plating), a Luger that, if it had not been re-finished, would cost THOUSANDS of Dollars, but is now priced at a very low price! This is a 1900 Luger, chambered for .30 Luger caliber, and made by DWM. The pistol has the early dished toggle, grip safety, no stock lug, and 4” tapered barrel. It has correct wooden checkered grips, and a wood-based magazine. This Luger has been chrome-plated, probably by a WWII GI (although the gun pre-dates WWI). The chrome plating has obscured all the markings, however the “DWM” toggle mark is still faintly visible, and serial # 12 is quite crisp 0n the front if the receiver, although all other serial numbers are not visible. There are NO importers markings anywhere on the gun. The chrome finish is worn a bit and tiny parts are flaking off, the original wooden grips and the magazine are quite worn, overall condition is about 80%. The bore is still somewhat crisp with visible, albeit weak, rifling. The toggle assembly and grip safety operate and function smoothly. We challenge you to find another 1900 Luger ANYWHERE at this price! You might want to look into restoration of this gun, restoration could possibly greatly increase the value of this gun.

I may entertaine a trade for an 5.7 x 28 FNH PS-90, or five-seven. 
The PMR_30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat shooting .22 Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked breech system. This operation systems allows for the use of a widw variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation. It uses a double stack magazine of a new desogn that holds 30 rounds and fits in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with over travel stop. Manual safety is thumb activated and ambidextrous. The slide locks back after the last round and has a manual slide loak. Fiber optic sights on the PMR-30 is ideal for accurate target. 
More from Kel tec site: Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release are reinforced Nylon(Zytel) The PMR-30 dissaembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.
Now, from my experience with my black one, the PMR-30 is very accurate. I fired a full magazine to the back of the range (150) feet with an 5-6 inch pattern. No bullet drop either as the hot round at over 2,000 fps. I tried three different ammunition and all were flawless in operation. I did have one round, due to being an Rim Fire that failed, But not the PMR;s fault. It was the remington, varmit round."

Here is a Rossi 20 Gauge Coach Gun in excellent condition. It has 20"" barrels, has the original Rossi butt plate. The gun is nice and tight. The 20 gauge Rossis are especially nice because the frame of the gun is actually sized for a 20 gauge instead of just having 20 gauge barrels mounted on a 12 gauge frame. This is a very nice gun.

These Rossi shotguns are great because they are solid and reliable, and there are no extra safeties like the unnecessary tang safety that you find on currently manufactured hammered shotguns.

OVERVIEW:
Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary new SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. That means enhanced confidence on the first shot and smoother, faster follow-ups.
KEY FEATURES:
•	Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable 
•	Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces 
•	SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% 
•	Our softest-shooting pump gun ever 
•	Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics 
•	Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably 
•	Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels 
•	28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes 
•	Sling swivel studs built-in 
•	Includes Modified Rem Choke"

 The Sig Sauer P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as Sig's entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy Seals, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full size pistol easy to handle. In 9mm, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy."
