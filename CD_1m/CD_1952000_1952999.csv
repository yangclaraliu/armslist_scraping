The HK45 Compact Tactical builds on the tough, military lineage of the Heckler & Koch HK45 series of handguns to devise the ultimate operator's pistol. The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HK's American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit. The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 8-round magazine, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences. The HK45 pistol series were originally developed as candidates for the U.S. military's next generation handgun competition so there is little wonder that the HK45 CT is so well-suited for military, law enforcement, and security use. Each HK45 CT comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter's hand. Variant 1 Double action/single action with ""SAFE position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame.

Comes with 2 10rd Mags, manual, lock, grip panels and O-Rings.

The HK45 Tactical builds on the tough, military lineage of the Heckler & Koch HK45 series of handguns to devise the ultimate operator's pistol. The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HK's American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit. The HK45 Tactical is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10 round magazine, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences. The HK45 pistol series were originally developed as candidates for the U.S. military's next generation handgun competition so there is little wonder that the HK45 is so well-suited for military, law enforcement, and security use. Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter's hand. Variant 1 Double action/single action with ""SAFE position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame.

Comes with hard case, lock, manual, extra O-rings and two 12rd mags.

The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!

The Mark 23 is available in .45 ACP

Comes with two 15rd Magazines, manual, lock and hard case.


Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

Features:

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever

The P2000 was designed specifically with improved ergonomic characteristics; it has features that reduce the handling related stresses, while at the same time increasing user handling and shooter comfort.

A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike. The 3.66"" Cold Hammer-Forged barrel has a polygonal profile while the slide is made from a solid bar of nitro-carburized steel and hosts night sights. Following recent trends in modern pistol designs, the P2000 makes extensive use of impact-resistant polymers to reduce weight, including the accessory railed frame.

Comes with a hard case, manual, lock, grip panels and two 15rd Magazines.


A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.
Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.
Key Features:

Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates
MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

The Christensen Arms CA-10 is built on the AR-10 platform. Christensen has created an incredibly lightweight AR-10 that gives the shooter a new level of long range precision in a rapid-fire semi-automatic rifle. The CA-10 is built with a carbon-wrapped, match-grade barrel and is tipped with a titanium flash-hider or muzzle-brake. The hand-guard is constructed out of carbon fiber to lighten the front-end and create exceptional overall balance. It has a 24” barrel with a 1/10 twist. The rifle is equipped with a Magpul STR stock. It is a direct gas-impingement system in an AR platform. The full-length Picatinny top-rail makes it easy to mount any optics and accessories you want to add to your rifle. The bolt carrier group is nickel-boron, and this rifle accepts DPMS-style magazines. The CA-10 is unbelievably lightweight and easy to carry, weighing in at just over 7 lbs. 

FROM CHRISTENSEN:

CA-10 Recon Carbon Barrel

The CA-10 is Christensen Arms™ large-caliber AR-style firearm that weighs several pounds less than other guns of this type. The Carbon Barrel is available from SBR to 24” lengths. The nickel-boron coated bolt carrier acts as a protective finish, polishing the receiver each time it cycles. A perfect match for precision shooting, tactical drills, or hunting, the CA-10 comes in configurations to suit your specific needs.

The Christensen Arms CA-10 is built on the AR-10 platform. Christensen has created an incredibly lightweight AR-10 that gives the shooter a new level of long range precision in a rapid-fire semi-automatic rifle. The CA-10 is built with a carbon-wrapped, match-grade barrel and is tipped with a titanium flash-hider or muzzle-brake. The hand-guard is constructed out of carbon fiber to lighten the front-end and create exceptional overall balance. It has a 24” barrel with a 1/10 twist. The rifle is equipped with a Magpul STR stock. It is a direct gas-impingement system in an AR platform. The full-length Picatinny top-rail makes it easy to mount any optics and accessories you want to add to your rifle. The bolt carrier group is nickel-boron, and this rifle accepts DPMS-style magazines. The CA-10 is unbelievably lightweight and easy to carry, weighing in at just over 7 lbs. 

FROM CHRISTENSEN:

CA-10 Recon Carbon Barrel

The CA-10 is Christensen Arms™ large-caliber AR-style firearm that weighs several pounds less than other guns of this type. The Carbon Barrel is available from SBR to 24” lengths. The nickel-boron coated bolt carrier acts as a protective finish, polishing the receiver each time it cycles. A perfect match for precision shooting, tactical drills, or hunting, the CA-10 comes in configurations to suit your specific needs.

Destined to become the standard that all 1911 pistols are compared against, the Taurus 1911 offers you the most accurate and feature-laden model on the market today. Starting with our own hammer-forged -not cast - ordnance grade steel frames, slides and barrels, we machine each and every part to tolerance levels that surpass even today's industry standards. Our skilled pistol smiths hand-fit and tune each gun with the 19 standard features seen below, using quality parts that are built 100% in our state-of-the-art factory. Then they mark the slide, barrel and frame with matching serial numbers. Available in the powerful .45 ACP, this aggressive, rock-solid firearm is ready to go right out of the box. The Taurus 1911 is an unbeatable gun that is also an unbeatable value. Includes pistol, 2 magazines, Taurus security system, barrel bushing tool, bore cleaning brush, manuals, and hard case.

The 2013 Gun Buyer guide list the Taurus PT 1911 B1 w/ rail MSRP for $853.

FEATURES

Taurus Security System (TSS)s: Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Destined to become the standard that all 1911 pistols are compared against, the Taurus 1911 offers you the most accurate and feature-laden model on the market today. Starting with our own hammer-forged -not cast - ordnance grade steel frames, slides and barrels, we machine each and every part to tolerance levels that surpass even today's industry standards. Our skilled pistol smiths hand-fit and tune each gun with the 19 standard features seen below, using quality parts that are built 100% in our state-of-the-art factory. Then they mark the slide, barrel and frame with matching serial numbers. Available in the powerful .45 ACP, this aggressive, rock-solid firearm is ready to go right out of the box. The Taurus 1911 is an unbeatable gun that is also an unbeatable value. Includes pistol, 2 magazines, Taurus security system, barrel bushing tool, bore cleaning brush, manuals, and hard case.

FEATURES

Taurus Security System (TSS)s: Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

The Christensen Arms CA-10 is built on the AR-10 platform. Christensen has created an incredibly lightweight AR-10 that gives the shooter a new level of long range precision in a rapid-fire semi-automatic rifle. The CA-10 is built with a carbon-wrapped, match-grade barrel and is tipped with a titanium flash-hider or muzzle-brake. The hand-guard is constructed out of carbon fiber to lighten the front-end and create exceptional overall balance. It has a 24” barrel with a 1/10 twist. The rifle is equipped with a Magpul STR stock. It is a direct gas-impingement system in an AR platform. The full-length Picatinny top-rail makes it easy to mount any optics and accessories you want to add to your rifle. The bolt carrier group is nickel-boron, and this rifle accepts DPMS-style magazines. The CA-10 is unbelievably lightweight and easy to carry, weighing in at just over 7 lbs. 

FROM CHRISTENSEN:

CA-10 Recon Carbon Barrel

The CA-10 is Christensen Arms™ large-caliber AR-style firearm that weighs several pounds less than other guns of this type. The Carbon Barrel is available from SBR to 24” lengths. The nickel-boron coated bolt carrier acts as a protective finish, polishing the receiver each time it cycles. A perfect match for precision shooting, tactical drills, or hunting, the CA-10 comes in configurations to suit your specific needs.

First, a Lone Wolf stainless steel, standard length, match grade .45 ACP barrel. This barrel not only allows you to shoot lead bullets (can’t do that with a factory barrel), but offers improved accuracy over a factory barrel.  This barrel has had roughly 250 rounds through it, and was cleaned after every use.  Second, a Lone Wolf stainless steel guide rod with an ISMI recoil spring set at factory spec.  This provides a longer life, flex free guide rod with the ability to install a lighter or heavier recoil spring.  This assembly has only been used for approximately 100 rounds & is in excellent condition.  Third, a Blackhawk adjustable paddle holster with level 2 retention system.

The SIG 556R is a SIG carbine chambered in 7.62x39 -  These rifles uses standard AK mags and ammunition (with the exception of US Palm mags which don't seem to fit without some tweaking). More accurate than production AK47's, with better ergonomics and SIG quality, this carbine is a leap forward in this kind of rifle, while
retaining the wide availability of inexpensive 7.62x39 ammunition.

Manufactured May 25, 2013 this carbine was bought new by me and is in absolutely mint condition with 30 flawless rounds fired and no issues or problems. It is more accurate than any AK47 I've fired, and seems to be a softer shooter with the same ammunition.

Included with the carbine is the original box and includes all the original accessories (docs including warranty card, mounting rails for attaching accessories to the forearm, 1 30 round magazine, lock, a little tube of lube, and the optic that SIG ships with these. Not a red dot but an illuminated black/red/green BDC crosshair type optic.)"

Integrating patented 2011 technology with classic 1911 design, the STI International Edge is a high capacity pistol that carries John Browning’s design into the 21st Century.

Since its introduction in late 1997, the STI Edge has become the undisputed standard for USPSA/IPSC Limited Division competition shooting as demonstrated by Michael Voigt and Frank Garcia finishing one/two as they led the US IPSC Limited Team to victory at World Shoot XII. It has been adopted by SWAT teams, HRT teams, street cops, and law enforcement training sites. It has been embraced by almost all other shooting disciplines.

Built on the patented modular steel frame with polymer grip, the Edge delivers the traditional features of a 1911 and allows the added benefit of high capacity magazines. The innovative frame design preserves the 17° angle of the grip in relation to the slide, original to the 1911. The essential design element for high capacity, the polymer grip, allows for double stack magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip, which remains comparatively the same as the circumference of a 1911.

True to 1911 tradition, the Edge has a unique full length slide with front and rear cocking serrations, STI dovetail front sight and STI adjustable rear sight. The Edge comes standard with features such as a stainless steel STI knuckle relief hi-ride grip safety and stainless steel STI ambi-thumb safeties. It comes with an STI stainless steel fully supported, ramped bull barrel.

Im looking to trade my Kahr CM9. The CM9 is the smallest 9mm you can buy that still is capable of shooting +P rounds. Small enough for pocket carry, which is how I carry it most of the time. It disappears easily in an IWB holster as well.
The gun is in EXCELLENT condition, not a scratch on it. It will eat anything you feed it and it operates flawlessly. The only reason Im trading it is that I got a new carry gun and don’t need two. 
Comes with:
Hogue Handall Jr grip sleeve
Two 6 round mags, one with pinky extension one with flat floor plate

It comes with the two original mags, plus an aftermarket one that I picked up at a gun show.  I will include a JIT Slide holster from Don Hume Leathergoods, it's a great OWB holster for the money.  It keeps the gun high and very secure, with easy access to the grip. 

I also have a Galco shoulder harness for it that I am selling separately, but we can talk about a deal if you're interested.  It's got the original Jackass rig (Galco bought or merged with the Jackass Leather company somewhere along the way), and I believe the gun holster is the Miami classic, and the double mag holder is the Miami classic II.  I'm not 100% sure on the names of the individual components, but it's all from Galco, super comfortable, completely adjustable, interchangeable (you could buy just the holster and use this rig to carry your other handguns) and I've got almost $150 into the setup.  

Emails and texts are preferred because I'm usually away from a phone, but you can call if that's your thing.  Be sure to leave a message and I should return your call within an hour.

The CX4 comes with a hard carry case, two 11 round magazines(I have brand new 17 round mags available), cleaning kit, an additional mounting rail, and manuals. The rifle is very clean and shows little to no wear at all. I just ultrasonically cleaned it so it's ready to rock and roll. 

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. 

This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol.

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

Gun fires great, have only put about 300 rounds through since I purchased it about 2 years ago. Very accurate and light shooting gun. Recoil is more of a snap, than a kick. Both single and double action, can be carried both Cocked and Locked (ala 1911) or hammer down with a loaded chamber safely, due to it's internal hammer block. The hammer will not go forward and contact the firing pin, unless the trigger is fully pulled to the rear.

This was my carry gun, however I have just recently purchased a CZ75 and have thought about selling this one.

Gun comes with 4 Magazines. All drop free and feed reliably. Comes with a dual magazine carrier, since this was my carry gun, I needed one of those to carry spare magazines. Also comes with 50 rounds of standard Brown Bear FMJ 9x18mm Mak ammo. I will also throw in a Used (but in great condition) KHolster. The holster has a transferable lifetime warranty.

$400 for everything and the holster.

This unique firearm features a telescopic bolt design encased in a tubular upper receiver with a forged steel frame, button rifled match barrels, and a 16 round hi-cap magazine standard.

In 1990, Claridge Hi-Tec, Inc. was created by Joe and Gail Claridge who incorporated Claridge Hi-Tec, Inc. in Northridge, CA. In 1993 Claridge Hi-Tec was forced to cease operations due to the Government out lawing the guns in the state of California.

The lower receiver/frame is a one-piece machined design integral with the pistol grip and trigger guard. It houses all the firing components and the safety mechanism. The magazine is fed through the pistol grip. 16, 20 and 30 round magazines were made for the weapon, but since 1993 none have been produced. However, re-notched Beretta 92F magazines can be used, and many of those found on the market today are in fact modified Beretta or SIG magazines.

The upper receiver is a one-piece tube with a screwed in match barrel.  All Claridge Hi-Tec firearms utilize match barrels manufactured in-house that are button-rifled.

The S9 was a model marketed as a ""sub-compact"" (although this is misleading as it is far from being subcompact) with a 5"" threaded barrel capable of receiving various attachments. These include a threaded barrel protector, a smooth 3"" barrel extension, a ribbed 3"" barrel extension, and a shrouded extension. Ostensibly, a silencer could also be attached, but there are none available for the thread type.

Due to its unique ""space gun"" appearance the Hi-Tec pistols have been used in several movies produced by the major Hollywood studios.
Arnold Schwarzenegger used the GS-9 variant in Total Recall
Mick Jagger used a modified GA-9 in Freejack
Mark Wahlberg used the Goncz High-Tech in Planet of the Apes
A rifle-version was also used by Antonio Banderas in the movie Assassins (1995).
Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer fitted one or more Claridge Hi-Tec 9mm pistols into the War Machine suit in Iron Man 2

There is no documentation to support this particular pistol was actually used in any of those movies only the type of pistol was. $650"

Core 15 Rifle Systems are a Florida based AR manufacturer that has gone above and beyond what we have come to expect in the Black Rifle market. The first big difference from other companies is their profound dedication to better than mil-spec tolerances. Their slogan is ""Core 15 Rifle Systems .... Where mil-spec is just a starting point"" and they mean it. Their barrels are held to two times tighter tolerances than the mil-spec requirement. They test fire and inspect every single one of their products as compared to the military required 10%. These guys have some great components on their rifles including an extremely durable coating, over sized trigger guard, billet charging handle and much more. This rifle includes a hard carrying case, cable lock, manuals, and CORE's NO BS Lifetime Warranty.

The 2013 Gun Buyers guide lists the Core 15 – M4 TAC ULTRA LIGHT at an MSRP of $1129.99.

Adjustable front and rear sights.  Walnut Grips.  Came off the production line in 1965.  This gun is not collector quality, if it was it would sell for $250+.  Gun has some rust on barrel, orig. bluing is in fair condition, grips are well worn.  NO Mag. Cyllinder, the orig. .22 Cal. LR only.  No original box.    

This gun shoots great and all mechanisms function perfectly.  This gun has been used as a gun: to shoot and have fun with...it has not been left in a box and only looked at.  As a result it shows some age and is not a collector quality piece, though you can be happy knowing it is still an old model Ruger Single Six.  

This is still a real nice gun to take to the range.  A great, easy shooter for kids and ladies too.  The action is just like the old Colt revolvers in the day---lots of fun.  Hoping it finds a good home.

By far the best and nicest I have shot. This is no cheap firearm all stainless construction. Info from website: 

The P220® Carry Elite Stainless is an 8+1 capacity carry-sized pistol with a full-size frame. Chambered in .45ACP, the P220 Carry Elite Stainless features the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The new SRT was designed by SIG SAUER® to deliver the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset 60% shorter than the standard DA/SA. This short reset provides for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting making it ideal for competitive shooting. With its enhanced ergonomic features of a beavertail grip, front strap checkering and front cocking serrations, the P220 Carry Elite is an excellent choice as a big bore carry pistol. Its beavertail grip allows the shooter to obtain his or her grip quickly and with confidence even under stress. Each P220 Carry Elite Stainless comes equipped with SIGLITE® Night Sights and the all-stainless construction provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long.

These guns are discontinued by HK, and the date code on this is KK, that's 1999 manufactured. For it being 14 years old, the guns in excellent shape and has maybe 150rounds through the gun, which for any gun is NOTHING.
