It doesn't have a scratch or a defect on it. The gun was made in 2012 and is a 7-round capacity pistol. It has a lightweight alloy frame, stainless steel ""Nitron"" coated slide with SigLite Night Sights that are very bright. It came with only one 6-round mag but I'm adding a second, brand new 6-round magazine for the sale. It has the G-10 grips and the front strap and back strap are textured from the factory, giving an excellent hold on the gun when firing. It is amazing accurate from 25 yards which is not typical of these smaller guns. Sig Sauer did it right.

Edit to Add: I am throwing in for free these two Desantis holsters ($80.00 value) which are made for the Sig P938.

Text for questions:REDACTED
From Mystery Ranch:

Using every trick Dana has up his sleeve, the Kodiak is truly a beast of a pack with the ability to carry 7000 cubic inches of gear weighing up to 120 pounds. The Overkill Guide Frame combines the added stability of the Overkill Yoke and the comfort and weight transferring ability of the Five Segmented Lumbar Wrap with the absolute best internal framing. A classic top loading design with dual draw cord shroud increases weather resistance and allows for upward expansion. The Daypack Lid separates top load into two compartments for better organization and load control. Built-in shoulder straps convert the lid into a day pack complete with ports for a hydration reservoir. The SpeedZip sleeping bag compartment can handle the largest winter bags while remaining easy to close. Plus it can be sucked flat to reduce the size of the packs volume for smaller loads. Side zippers provide great access into the pack. From backpack hunting in Alaska to extended missions and expeditions all over the world, one word describes the Kodiak- overkill.

It is a Bushmaster XM15 lower reciever with a 223/5.56 Compass Lake upper receiver. It has a heavily fluted 20"" barrel with a lathe turned muzzle brake on it that does come off, but is put on so perfectly that you can't see the seam between the brake and the barrel. The barrel is a heavy contour under the Nordic Components hand guard, but fluted well to balance it. After the gas block it is .750 to the muzzle. 
The lower has been reworked by Compass Lake with their 2 stage match trigger and it is light and smooth as can be with a very clean break. It has a Magpul MOE fixed stock, which offers a shorter length of pull and better cheek weld than the A2 stock. 
I will include the Leupold single piece mount designed specifically for ARs to bring the scope up and forward allowing correct eye relief and head positioning, and the SWFA SS fixed 10X scope. Also I will include the Bipod and 4 20 round PMAGS, which fit better than the 30 rounders in the prone.
I am asking $1600, no trades please, for this setup and am not willing to sell the scope, mount or bipod separately unless the rifle sells first. I would like to do face to face in the FT Lewis area of Washington. I will meet you halfway from me to anywhere in the state for a full price offer.

It's a great rifle made with good parts and has been test fired with a couple mags of ammo threw it. Decided to go a different direction. 

Here is my price list on parts (pre crazies)
Lower $250
Complete upper wi CMMG Bolt $550
New YHM rifle length rail $110
4 20rd MetalForm and 2 10rd mags $160
Sights $40
Magpul goods $100
For grip $20
LPK and misc parts $130
Buffer and spring $50
Promag mag block $40

That's $1450 not including the tax or shipping. I'm going to ask $1400 That's going to be OBO with partial trades considered. Not interested in cheap junk guns, looking for a nice pistol or rifle plus cash. No black powder, shot guns, or crap. 


Pistol light pictured not included. I can pull my rail, put on a railed gas block and std hand guards for minus $150.

Forgot some details on the gun. The lower is one of the Made in Oklahoma Billet lowers Cold Hand put out. LPK is a double star, buffer and spring is a Rock River. Metal Form is who makes Colts mags. Barrel is a 16"" 1 in 10"" twist. 

I will listen to all offers, mainly gun / cash related. The ONLY non gun related trade I am looking for right now is a nice metal lathe. By nice I mean a non wore out, non older than dirt metal lathe. Looking for something that either runs on standard 220 or a decent sized 110v lathe."
423,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1707423,For Sale:  Thompson Machine Poseidon 9mm suppressor,"Beebe, White County, Arkansas, United States",$ 375,"Listed On: Sunday, June 2, 2013",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Thompson Machine Poseidon micro-9mm suppressor is truly one of the most advanced sound suppressors currently on the market.  At only 4.125” long by 1.25” in diameter and weighing in at a feather-light 3.8oz, the Poseidon offers sound suppression comparable to industry-leading silencers that are twice its size and weight.  Using artificial environment and wipe technology along with a proprietary mono-baffle stack, the Poseidon features a unique design that seals in the end-user’s ablative medium of choice until the suppressor is used; thus eliminating a major downside of wet suppressors.  In other words, your ablative medium won’t run out in your pocket or evaporate!  As an added selling point, the Thompson Machine Poseidon is also a true multi-caliber suppressor, and is very quiet on .22lr, .25acp, .32acp, 9×18mm, and .380acp host weapons.  The Poseidon easily and fully disassembles for cleaning, and includes the necessary take-down tools at no extra charge.

it. This suppressor can be ""dipped"" ultrasonically, sand blasted, or soaked in harsh solvents without fear of damage to the unit.

Did I mention that is also full auto rated? Well it is!!!

We also decided to make it adaptable to other makers mounting devices as well, like the Multimount adapters as well as TROS 
boosters too. We also make an adapter ring to mount the Triad three lug mount to the Mystic as well. These features make this the 
perfect transition suppressor for sealed aluminium suppressor owners. Since all the mounts will work with the Mystic, this saves the 
end-user considerable money when it comes to buying mounts.

There has been a lot of interest in using this unit on 223 rifles as well as the intended caliber. It can be used on 223 under limited 
conditions. Low rates of fire with cooling periods and no mirage covers. The use of a mirage cover will hide the obvious indicator of 
the unit getting hot by producing mirage.  This is a great indicator to let the shooter know that the can needs to cool off.  Also, in 223 
the barrel must be at least 16"" in length.

This suppressor comes with Suppressor, suppressor pouch, core driver tool, 1/2""x28 booster & 5/8""x24 fixed barrel mount for .300 blackout/whisper & .308 subsonic.

All NFA rules apply.

Its no mistake that they seem to always have it for sale!! Go get yours before they do and let's stop these over priced idiots from ripping you off!!! If they are getting it SO CAN YOU!!! The ONLY reason they are getting away with reselling ammo at these prices is because YOU keep buying from them!!

The rifle has been converted with a tapco trigger group, railed for end and ATI folding stock. I've also duracoated it in warrior desert tan.  I've also installed a dogleg rail by Texas Weapon Systems after I took these pictures( if your not familiar with this I recommend researching it as this is the most solid rail system for an ak pattern rifle in my opinion.) I am also including over a hundred rounds of 308.  This rifle has probably 200 rounds through it and let me tell you this rifle is accurate!  I have routinely gotten sub moa groups from this rifle.  The scope pictured is not included unless we can come up with an understanding or you feel you have significant upgrade...ie a tavor or equivalent.  The scope is a Burris mtac 1-4/fast fire/pepr mount combo ($600 dollar value.)

Not real picky on the make of the AR, but I'm looking for something decent with at least two spare mags.  Some ammo to go with it is a nice to have.

Purchased the pair as a project to make one solid running ATV with spare parts, but ran out of time and space to finish the project out. My loss is your gain I guess.

The two quads could easily be used to make one complete unit, with plenty of spares; or with a little TLC and googling you could have two running four wheelers. 

Installed on one chassis is a rebuilt engine from a Yamaha Bearcat (most parts are compatible).

Second unit is missing seat, headlight bezels (but the wiring is still there), and other odds and ends stuff, but is a rolling chassis with running longblock, transmission, etc.

I bought the 10/22 new in December to build with all new parts.  It has a E.R.

The rifle rest is a Winchester.  Using cci mini mags you can run one jagged whole at 50 yards and under 3/4"" at 75 yards.  I have not tried any match grade ammo.  Groups are likely to be even tighter with match ammo.  I have used minimags, RWS subsonic, interceptors, and a few federals.  No function problems of any kind.  Due to the target chamber, no stinger ammo should be used (Ruger's manual also states that stingers should not be used).  I also have the original box and paperwork that came with the rifle when I bought it new.  I have over 650 invested, make cash offer.  Thanks for looking"

907,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1707907,"For Sale:  CZ P-07 DUTY 9MM 3.8"" BLK POLY 16RD NIB","SW, Portland, Oregon",$ 509,"Listed On: Sunday, June 2, 2013",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is brand new and still in the box from the manufacturer.

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty. The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

16+1 9mm, 12+1 .40 S&W 
Convertible, safety or decocker 
New Omega trigger system
