This rifle is an antique, and it shows it's age. The rifle belongs to my father in law, who doesn't have access to the internet, so I'm selling for him. He originally received the rifle from his father, and it was passed down throughout time in their family.

A little history about this weapon...The Fusil Gras Modèle 1874 M80 was a French service rifle of the 19th century. This rifle had a caliber of 11 mm and used black powder centerfire cartridges that weighed 25 grams. It was a robust and hard-hitting weapon, but had no magazine and so could only fire one shot after loading. It also had a triangular-shaped sword bayonet, known as the Model 1874 ""Gras"" Sword Bayonet. The Greek Army adopted the Gras in 1877, and it was used in all conflicts up until the Second World War. 

This particular rifle definitely shows its age. It's missing the ramrod, and I'm pretty sure that the trigger guard has been replaced. The stock is also missing a little ""chunk"" out of it. The trigger mechanism still works, and the bolt seems to still have a very smooth action, though I've never actually fired the rifle. 

The price is certainly negotiable, so let me know what offers you have. No trades, cash only, and I will meet in the Butts, Monroe, Henry County area...maybe a little further if necessary. The rifle will also come with the softshell case that's pictured.

The grip angle is right so that when it is drawn the sites are naturally level and on target.  External finish is 100% and internally the only wear on the finish is on the rails... As to be expected.  I don't think this pistol has had many rounds through it and it has never been carried (no holster wear marks at all.)  

I really like this pistol but I've standardized on 9mm on all other pistols... that's the only reason i want to get rid of it."

He passed about 3 years ago and I have only fired the gun twice. It was extremely accurate and fun to shoot, but I just dont have the time to shoot anymore. I have done some research and the gun appears to be very rare, a simillar Underwood line out I saw sold for $1100. The manufacturer listed on the receiver is Underwood with a line through it SN 2758335. The barrel is buffalo (9-1943) but is also stamped with the underwood flaming bomb. It has the flip saftey and the magazine release marked M. It also has the bayonet lug, I used to have the bayonet, but unfortunately lost it during a move. I am also including 4 WWII era magazine hodlers marked from 1943 - 1944 each with 2 magazines from the same time. I have seen the holders with magazines sell from $100 a piece. The gun is in overall good condition for being 70 years old. It does have a few small scrathes in the wood and normal wear showing on the barrel/receiver, but nothing substantial. No cracks. Text me for more pictures/details @ 6147323299 I am asking $1,200 and from the research I have done that appears to be fair and quite possibly a steal. If you feel differently, let me know your offer and why it is fair.

LOWER:
-Quality Arms (local in Rigby) lower with DPMS SSA trigger clean break around 4 lbs
-Multicaliber lower
-It will have a standard grip (not the one pictured)
-6 position stock (mil-spec buffer tube)
-The roll stamps can be high lighted in white or any other color (as pictured) or left black

UPPER:
-14.5"" barrel with a Yankee Hill Machine (YHM) phantom flash hider (pinned for legal 16"")
-5.56x45 barrel with a 1 in 9 twist
-YHM gas block  with folding M4 style sight with bayonet lug
-Knights Armament Co. (KAC) carbine length quad rail system (military version with multiple panel covers). The difference between this one and the civilian model is price (300-500 dollars), and the ability to remove the lower half quickly to attach the M203 launcher
-KAC micro folding sight 200-600m (military as well)
-Only 10 rounds through the BCG (bolt carrier group)
-Vertical grip with a spring loaded bi-pod

The reason why I'm selling this is I'm thinning the collection, it functions just fine. I have several Quality Arms lowers (including a few that are SBRed) and have never had a problem. Jim, owner, will repair any problems with it if you encounter any! I will include a single Magpul PMAG 30 round gen 2 magazine with the dust cover. 

The flash hider has been pinned and welded into place to make the 14.5"" barrel the legal length of 16"". This way you get the shortest barrel legally possible without registering it with the ATF and doing all that paperwork. I paid almost 400 just for the rail system. My loss, your gain.

It looks like the rail isn't straight in the third picture, but it is...just a weird camera angle/glitch. I'm open to cash offers, toss them out! I'd like to sell it relatively quick as it's just taking up precious space for other weapons :)"

King Tuk IWB Holster

Looking to sell my Glock 26 Gen 3 with 2 original 10 round mags and other accessories (lock, brush, manuals, factory fired casing). It has been fired very little, maybe a couple hundred rounds. There is holster wear on the slide release, but that is all. No dummy marks, dings, sratches, etc. 

I will also include a King Tuk IWB (inside the waistband) holster that is amazing. These are the only style holsters I use. They are extremely comfortable, and conceal the pistol very well. This has been a carry holster so it has wear. 

This is a fair price and you don't have to pay tax, shipping or deal with a FFL. Buyer must not be a felon. 

If you have any questions, please ask. Thank you for your time."

The union of advanced design, quality materials and proper construction makes Kahr's CM9 the smallest, thinnest, most reliable full power compact pistol, a value that can't be matched. The CM9 weighs in at only about 14 ounces, but its built to be extremely durable. Its black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a safe-cam action and an unbelievably smooth double-action-only trigger stroke, making the CM9 fast to fire in critical defensive situations. The CM9 also features drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights. Each pistol ships with one 6-round magazine.

Was part of a short lived build - successfully test fired for a test of an upper with just 20 rounds before disassembly and complete bench strip of all parts.  Extremely lightweight polymer receiver (think Glock and M&P pistols).

This normally sells for about 150-180 with a stock, FCG, and hand grip. Because this is stripped it is available here for only $90.

Ohio sales only to 18yo or older with valid OH State ID -- and other sales including in state shipments require FFL and payment of any applicable fees.  As I am sure your aware an AR-14 receiver has the serial number stamped on it and it is considered a firearms transfer when buying/selling.

Looking to sell my Remington 870 Express Magnum 12ga pump shotgun.  The shotgun has an aftermarket Hastings barrel (French mfg) with two choke tubes, IC and Modified.

The finish is good, no major scratches or dings, mainly just use.  The gun has had some rounds through it I would presume, maybe 500-1000 rounds.  

Great gun, a reliable and accurate shotgun that would be great for a kid's first 12ga shotgun, or as a home defense base gun, or anything and everything a shotgun CAN be.

I'm asking $250 plus shipping to your FFL, or best offer.

I take Paypal or cashier's check.  Paypal at [email]REDACTED[/email]

Most varmint guns are easily recognized by their heavy barrels, bipod mounting studs and long range scopes, but they are far from being equal. The new Winchester Coyote Light is the rifle to take along for varmint and target shooting fun. It has been carefully trimmed of any unnecessary bulk but is no lightweight when it comes to performance. The matte-blued receiver and medium-heavy fluted barrel mount into a skeletonized aluminum bedding block that is set in a lightweight carbon fiber/fiberglass composite Bell and Carlson stock for superb accuracy. Flow-through vents on the fore-end reduce weight and help cool the barrel during long strings of fire. A Pachmayr Decelerator pad helps soak up recoil.

The Model 700 SPS puts legendary Model 700 accuracy and reliability within reach of most avid enthusiasts. It's a no-frills, tack-driving game-dropping machine built with everything you love about the Model 700, including a hammer-forged barrel, externally adjustable X-Mark Pro trigger, SuperCell recoil pad and, of course, hair-splitting precision, straight out of the box. At the core of the Model 700 SPS Tactical AAC-SD is the machined solid-steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design, ensuring uniformity, strength, and solid bedding area. It features an ultra-rugged, ergonomically designed synthetic stock for superior weather resistance and handling.

Rifle has an 20"" inch, heavy-contour clean barrel threaded to accept AAC and all 5/8 x 24 threaded flash hiders, muzzle brakes, and suppressors. The tactical-style carbon steel, hammer-forged barrel is the perfect balance between handling in tight spots and delivering pinpoint accuracy. With a twist rate of one in ten inches, this rifle is optimized for accuracy. These specialty, bolt-action rifles are shipped with a thread protector installed. The rock-solid barreled action is bedded in a Hogue OverMolded, Ghillie Green, pillar-bedded, synthetic stock with a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability. The soft-touch, sure-grip stock is extremely comfortable for extended, long range shooting and assures a positive grip in both stressful situations and inclement weather. The dual point pillar-bedding guarantees a solid interface between the action and stock to help insure cold bore accuracy and prevent point-of-impact shifts. Add Remington's X-Mark Pro externally-adjustable trigger, designed to break-like-glass and set at 3.5 pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical accuracy."

701,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1724701,For Sale:  1841 Remington Contract Percussion Musket,"Denver, Denver, Colorado","$ 1,200","Listed On: Thursday, June 6, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Model 1841 Remington Contract ""Mississippi"" Rifle - rifling is faint but is the 7-groove rifling. Flayderman Guide grades this gun as Fair condition.

M1841 ""Mississippis"" saw heavy usage by both Confederates and Union soldiers in the early part of the Civil War--usually by state units--but their popularity declined as more 1861 Springfields were manufactured and issued.

The rear notch sight is intact, and all brass furniture, including barrelbands, triggerguard, sideplate and butt box are intact as is the front sight. Ramrod is of the Civil-War era full-iron replacement variety, as many of the brass-headed ramrods were removed due to metal separation issues in battle. Butt-mounted brass patchbox lid hinge is sturdy, patchbox has a compartment for bullet patches, nipple wrench/screwdriver tool, worm and spare percussion nipple. Brown barrel lacquering (original) is evident in large places along the 33 inch barrel.

Stamped marks on the brass buttstock read ""J"" over top of a ""13"". There are two oval cartouches stamped into the wood on the opposite side from the lock to the rear of the brass curled lockplate on that side. To the rear of the hammer on the lock is stamped ""US 1849"", and in front of the hammer, a very faint ""Remington's"" with some unintelligible stamping below that.

I believe that the very front of of the stock - muzzle end - of the rifle is a piece of replacement wood, although it looks to be a period replacement - this piece is approximately 11 inches long. Front brass barrel band is slightly loose due to the lack of humidity in Colorado (rifle is originally from Pennsylvania, and was from the Cooper collection out of Baltimore, MD...it was said to be an Antietam battlefield recovery).

Asking $1200 due to condition and piece of replacement wood (I believe) in stock, or best reasonable offer. Face-to-face, cash transactions only. 

Rifle can be seen at my pub (Scruffy Murphy's Irish Pub, 2030 Larimer Street) by appointment only - please email me through Craigslist to set up a time."

One of the issues I had when I acquired the LCP was the low profile sites that were almost non functional for the accuracy that the LCP was capable of delivering so I had the slide dovetailed and fitted for better profile sights including a front tritium night sight. This is something Ruger decided to deliver with the new LC 380 pistol except that the new pistol is significantly heavier, nearly twice the weight. The LCP weights 9oz, one of the lightest .380's made. In addition, the feeding ramp has been highly polished  to increase reliability. The gun has 200-300 rounds through it to break it in for reliability and I have test fired a broad range of ammo without any malfunction. After the break-in and ramp polishing, this been absolutely reliable. The gun is also fitted with a Crimson trace laser and the gun is sighted dead on with both night sights and the CT laser for 15-30 feet combat distance. I have also fitted the gun with a techna clip, belt clip and a home-made trigger block safety of my own making for IWB carry. The trigger block safety I crafted is easy to activate, you just push it out to the left or right as you place your finger on the trigger, yet adds a level of security to enable carrying a round in the chamber. I got the idea for a product I saw for glocks.  I have carried this gun for nearly a year and it disappears; you don't feel it at all in your WB. I have also used a pocket holster and it disappears in your pocket and is included along with a IWB holster. It is incredibly light for a .380; a great summer carry gun. This gun is capable for excellent accuracy for its size, shooting 2-3"" groups at 7 yards in fast fire mode for me. The offering comes with the original box, documents, locks, soft case, etc. It also comes with a book hide out I created which holds the gun and two magazines with a dust jacket for a book called 'Forgotten Valor' - see photos.

This firearm is easily converted to left-hand use by simply changing the bolt and moving the block-off plate from the left to the right. Installing the Trigger Tamer is a 10 to 15 minute operation that results in a trigger pull of about 2/3rds the regular weight.

MSAR is now taking pre-orders for their .300 Blackout barrel. Changing barrels takes less than 2 or 3 minutes and since .300BLK uses the same bolt and mags you can carry one gun to shoot both calibers!

Available, but not included in the price, is a matching EOTech 553 and Sneaky Bags 30” Covert Rifle Bag that I will include for an additional $700. This is a $700 holographic sight and $150 pack that are both new as well. The Sneaky Bag looks more like a skateboard backpack than a carbine pack.

I currently live in Wisconsin but would like to move back to Alaska.  I don't have much cash and will probably need most of it for moving me and my family, but I do have some extras in my safe.  I'm looking for someplace that either is either buildable or has a domicile in place already.  It also must be accessible by vehicle, not plane or boat.  Other than that I'm open to just about anything at fair market value.

The Guns:
1.  Bushmaster XM-15 (not the cheap Carbon model - this one has a chromed barrel and guts) with two Bushmaster 30 round mags (comes with 1 in store).  MSRP $1,391.48
2.  DPMS Panther Oracle with Magpul furniture and flip up sights (front and rear, not installed yet), Hogue pistol grip, 30 round Pmag with window, and 30 round DPMS mag.  Also includes a Magpul verticle foregrip (not installed) that attaches to the hand guard.  Base model (without Magpul extras) is around $1,000 from dealers
All rifles come with manuals, paperwork, locks, and whatever other accessories normally come with them (i.e. rail risers for Bushmaster, etc).

The Accessories:
- Black Midway USA padded zippered rifle bag with room for 4 30-round mags, a velcro pocket, and a zippered pocket on the outside.  Has a carry handle and shoulder strap on the back.
- Green NCStar padded zippered rifle bag with outside pockets for 4 30-round mags covered by a velcro flap.  Has a carry handle on the side and a shoulder strap on the other.
- 4 Tapco 30-round magazines for the AR-15's
- CAA 30-round magazine
- CAA triple rail system to mount to standard AR 15 hand guard
- Laser/flashlight combination with rail mounting system and remote pressure switches.  Flashlight has a red flip-cap filter to preserve night vision.
- BSA red dot sight scope with built-in sun shade (42 mm)
- UTG CQB reticle intensified red/green dot scope sight (30 mm) (used once on one of my other rifles, but comes with battery, soft case, tool, etc)
- 2 stacking 45 MTM ammo cans with rubber gaskets
- 2 M-16 bayonet's with leather sheathes
- 1160 rounds of 5.56 and .223 ammunition (only available if I deliver it)

By now you should be aware that our elected officials have voted to criminalize the private sale of firearms. That basically means that it will be a FELONY to sell a gun to a friend or anyone else unless you go to a dealer and pay fees, background check, etc. This bill WILL become law unless Gov. Sandoval vetos it, so PLEASE:

Governor Sandoval has set up a hotline for us to vote on whether or not he should veto SB 221. It is extremely important that you and everyone you know calls and votes against this gun grabber bill. The number is REDACTED. When prompted, simply press 2 to vote against SB 221.  It’s easy to do and needs to be done.

Every gun grabber across the country will be calling to support it, so it is extremely important that we out number them.

The FNH FNAR is a semi-automatic tactical rifle chambered in .308 Win. or 7.62 NATO.

The FNAR has three sub-models: standard, heavy and standard 16”, but they all use the same action.

The FNAR is made out of a lightweight aircraft grade aluminum alloy. It has a cold hammer forged barrel, which means a machine carefully rifled it and it will shoot straight for a long time. On the tip of the barrel is a target crown, which helps maintain barrel harmonics so the rifle doesn’t vibrate too much and throw off the trajectory of the round. It has an ambidextrous magazine release. The upper receiver is forged with a Picatinny rail and three rails on the sides and bottom of the fore-end for easy mounting of scopes, sights, lights, lasers, or grips.

FNH recommends the FNAR for leisure, sport and competitive shooting."

The ammo that I have is Russian milsurp and it has extraordinarily hard primers. As a result this AK experiences occasional light strikes with this particular ammo. It probably needs a stronger hammer spring to reliably run the surplus stuff.

Included in the price is:

The Bulgarian AK-74
2 30 round polymer mags.
520 rounds of Russian surplus 5.45x39mm
A modified Tapco tactical six position stock. The modification is intended to lengthen the pull of the trigger for people with large hands like myself.

It has only had about 150 rounds shot through it. It has a Galloway Precision trigger job that reduces the trigger pull by half and also has lighter trigger springs form Galloway Precision also that eliminates the stacking at the end of the LC9 trigger pull by reducing the spring power of the firing pin blocker spring and the lifter arm spring. It also has a set of Traction Grips installed on it. They can be removed easily at anytime but I think they help a lot in gripping the gun. I also removed the magazine safety so that the gun will fire with the magazine removed. I still have the stock trigger springs and the magazine safety plate and spring.   I have also polished the whole barrel as the bluing was coming off after shooting the gun. The gun still looks like new with no scratches or blemishes. I have also painted the dots on the sights. The front dot is orange and the rear dots are green. This helps a lot with aiming. It comes with the stock soft case, one magazine with both base plates (flat plate and pinky extension plate), the stock Ruger lock, manuals/ paper work,, box, and the take-down tool.

Description on trigger upgrade from Galloway's site:

The early break trigger system upgrade for the LC9 is the solution for the long heavy false reset of the stock trigger. Our modification to YOUR SUPPLIED hammer and trigger bar will shorten the stroke by half the stock pull length and break at the half way point of the stock travel, all while maintaining the factory safeties. This will allow faster follow up shots and better accuracy due to shorter pull. Expect around a pound reduction in trigger pull weight."

It's a Kentucky percussion rifle, 36in. Looks and shoots great, has a couple small marks but over all it's in great condition, no rust, good bluing, very nice wood. These guns are super fun to shoot, but I have two and need some room in my safe. I was at Basspro last week and they had everything you need for black powder shooting in stock, balls, caps, wads, powder, everything; it was about  the only thing they did have.

This gun has been inscribed, the side plate reads ""Vincere Vel Mori"" (05-15-86) Denver Colorado. It means ""Conquer or Die"". The patch storage brass on the butt stock reads- Serial number 29561 Kentucky Rifle - made for- D.A. Duncan-esg .45cal and has two symbols next to that. It's my guess that someone got this for one of his vet buddies and engraved it for him. It's not professional work but does add some charm to the gun, it looks pretty good and I think it adds something to it. I don't think it helps the value, but I don't think it hurts it either. $150 is a great price for this gun, it's in very good shape."
