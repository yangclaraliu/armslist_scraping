Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, 
whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when 
it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces 
rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. 
This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its 
receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

This comes with a life time replacement warranty, if it cant be replaced it will be repaired.

With its AK heritage, you can rest assured that you can drag it through hell and back as a daily excursion and it will keep on tickin'--you cannot kill this weapon. The Vepr 12 was also designed with an auto gas regulator (unlike its little brother, the Saiga) meaning that you can reliably feed ANY 2 3/4 or 3 inch shells you can find without manual adjustment from birdshot to buckshot, low to high brass. Unlike the Saiga, the Vepr 12 was based on the RPK instead of the standard AK, which means that the receiver has a hinged dust cover, a thicker receiver, and a polymer rail on top. Also included in the design is an auto-bolt hold open and a magwell which allows for AR-15 style magazine changes instead of rock and lock.

Instead of explaining every new intricacy, watch this great video by the Military Arms Channel on youtube to get an idea of all of its features.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMfzN5LZc3o

I have added a Magpul rail to the lower handguard, as well as a vertical foregrip. Additionally, I have replaced the standard wooden stock with a sturdy clubfoot. The Vepr would come with two 10 round SGM magazines and 1 original Russian 5 round.

I've sent roughly 150 shells down the tube and I am QUITE fond of my deadly new toy. Please dont hesitate to send any questions that you may have--im sure that I didnt answer every question you might have in this ad. Im a gun enthusiast though and I am constantly buying/selling/trading so show me what you have in trade. Thanks for looking!"

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate hand guard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

This S.T.I Spartan III is a compact 1911 chambered in 9x19 (9mm luger). 

Gun accepts a single stack 8 round mag. the grips that came with the gun are s.t.i wood grips and are not pictured. currently has black rubberized grips. I've shot 40 rounds exactly out of it (5 fully loaded Magazines) no failures, but it's not broken in yet. 

I really wanted to carry a compact 1911 but After much thought on the issue and being new to carrying I'm more comfortable with a double action trigger.

The design incorporates a 5-round box magazine that is placed within the pistol grip. This, along with the research showing that standard 12 gauge cartridges provide more than adequate stopping power at the close ranges for which the weapon was designed, led to the use of a special 12 gauge cartridge measuring 2.36 inch (60 mm) in length. The use of the MAG-7 with these cartridges yields an effective range of 45 yards (41.1 m), although they have a proven lethality to 90 yards (82 m).[1] The MAG-7 also has a detachable, top-folding sheet metal stock. There were two models initially manufactured—the original MAG-7, and civilian-legal model, called the MAG-7 M1, which features a longer barrel and fixed wooden stock to comply with the requirements of the National Firearms Act, and of the gun laws of many countries other than the United States of America, of a barrel length of 18 inches (457 mm) or more and an overall length of 26 inches (660 mm) or more. In this non-NFA configuration, however, the original concept of the weapon as an extremely compact hard-hitting tool for CQB and backup is defeated."

When the hammer is back, you can push it forward putting it in Triple Action mode. This allows you to make the gun ready, and then holster it without touching the trigger. Then, when you pull the gun, you touch the trigger to move the hammer back into single action mode. This works great with a two stage holster.

The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

First rifle is a savage 111 chambered in 30-06 with the accutrigger and original simmons 3-9x40 scope.  It has exactly 50 rounds through it all of them are 165 core lockt rounds.  Just looking to see whats out there on trade as this just sits in the safe.  

2nd gun is a 1916 Spanish Mauser in 308 with inverted bolt to ensure cycling when a scope is mounted and is per tapped for original style side mount scope.  Good shape, bore is clean and no pitting, stock in pretty good shape, no cracks or gouges and has a smooth action.

3rd rifle is a marlin per war model A1 .22. This thing is in great shape given that these were made in the 20's and 30's and its tough to tell what year because they have no serial number.  Only thing that tells per war is the takedown screw is in front of the trigger guard not behind it.

These guns can be traded together or separate depending on what you want to trade. Just let me know and we'll try and work something out.  More pictures upon request.  Feel free to ask any questions about the guns"

The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

We will cover multiple scenarios that could occur in your everyday life and how to appropriately respond (an intruder in your home, carjacking in a parking lot, purse snatching, assaults, targets advancing on you, moving targets, etc).  These scenarios will be in a live fire environment where you will be improving your skills and techniques involved in drawing your concealed weapon and engaging a target.  This is a vital aspect of carrying concealed that is rarely addressed, and without practice or knowing how to respond, the delay in decision making can mean the difference between success or failure.  You will be enhancing your skills in drawing from concealment, point shooting, tactical positioning, firing while moving, firing from a vehicle, flash sight picture, shooting from cover, and moving after shooting. 

The purpose of this class is to build your skills as a Concealed Weapons permit holder and practicing the skills needed to use your gun in a defensive confrontation.  Additionally, we will cover aspects of carrying concealed that are not discussed in the basic CWP class such as; identifying potentially dangerous persons/situations, awareness, how to react in adverse situations, and practical exercises related to everyday situations. Being prepared and ready for a confrontation is the first step to winning.  Through practical experience on the range, skill building, and being prepared you will lessen the probability of becoming the target of criminals.

We will cover multiple scenarios that could occur in your everyday life and how to appropriately respond (an intruder in your home, carjacking in a parking lot, purse snatching, assaults, targets advancing on you, moving targets, etc).  These scenarios will be in a live fire environment where you will be improving your skills and techniques involved in drawing your concealed weapon and engaging a target.  This is a vital aspect of carrying concealed that is rarely addressed, and without practice or knowing how to respond, the delay in decision making can mean the difference between success or failure.  You will be enhancing your skills in drawing from concealment, point shooting, tactical positioning, firing while moving, firing from a vehicle, flash sight picture, shooting from cover, and moving after shooting. 

The purpose of this class is to build your skills as a Concealed Weapons permit holder and practicing the skills needed to use your gun in a defensive confrontation.  Additionally, we will cover aspects of carrying concealed that are not discussed in the basic CWP class such as; identifying potentially dangerous persons/situations, awareness, how to react in adverse situations, and practical exercises related to everyday situations. Being prepared and ready for a confrontation is the first step to winning.  Through practical experience on the range, skill building, and being prepared you will lessen the probability of becoming the target of criminals.    

A large portion of the course will be on the range. At least 200-300 rounds will be fired. You are encouraged to bring the firearm you carry to the class along with your concealed carry holster.  This will allow you to make better decisions on how to carry your handgun based on your physical size and method of carry.  If you desire to use one of our guns to get a feel for a different style we will have the appropriate ammunition for the gun (price varies per caliber).

Cost- $100
Prerequisites are:
   1) Successful completion of a SC CWP course, a basic firearms course, or one basic training/familiarization session with Shooting Solutions.

We will cover multiple scenarios that could occur in your everyday life and how to appropriately respond (an intruder in your home, carjacking in a parking lot, purse snatching, assaults, targets advancing on you, moving targets, etc).  These scenarios will be in a live fire environment where you will be improving your skills and techniques involved in drawing your concealed weapon and engaging a target.  This is a vital aspect of carrying concealed that is rarely addressed, and without practice or knowing how to respond, the delay in decision making can mean the difference between success or failure.  You will be enhancing your skills in drawing from concealment, point shooting, tactical positioning, firing while moving, firing from a vehicle, flash sight picture, shooting from cover, and moving after shooting. 

The purpose of this class is to build your skills as a Concealed Weapons permit holder and practicing the skills needed to use your gun in a defensive confrontation.  Additionally, we will cover aspects of carrying concealed that are not discussed in the basic CWP class such as; identifying potentially dangerous persons/situations, awareness, how to react in adverse situations, and practical exercises related to everyday situations. Being prepared and ready for a confrontation is the first step to winning.  Through practical experience on the range, skill building, and being prepared you will lessen the probability of becoming the target of criminals.    

A large portion of the course will be on the range. At least 200-300 rounds will be fired. You are encouraged to bring the firearm you carry to the class along with your concealed carry holster.  This will allow you to make better decisions on how to carry your handgun based on your physical size and method of carry.  If you desire to use one of our guns to get a feel for a different style we will have the appropriate ammunition for the gun (price varies per caliber).

Cost- $100
Prerequisites are:
   1) Successful completion of a SC CWP course, a basic firearms course, or one basic training/familiarization session with Shooting Solutions.

Barrel is 12-flute design and will eat absolutely ANYTHING you put through, not like older PTR models. Roller-locked delayed blowback system makes malfunctions virtually unheard of with just the most basic common maintenance. I have had zero malfunctions with this rifle. Bolt gap is good to go (an issue with HK-style rifles).

Rifle is enhanced with an HK low-profile picatinnny optics rail, HK21E heavy recoil buttpad, wide and super comfortable, really tames the wallop of the .308 round into a gentle push rather than a hard kick. Stock set is a beautiful deep-green German surplus slimline design, and am also including an HK original wide green forearm, bipod ready. The polymer Navy lower, while reducing the overall weight, left some ergonomics to be desired and so I have enhanced the grip with a Pachmayer universal. The balance is perfect now. 

EXTRAS! 

400 rounds of .308 ammo. 
Yes. 400 rounds of .308 ammo.

Complete combat chest rig. Extremely comfortable, custom-built, fully-adjustable to any body size, virtually indestructible. This rig is built for and used in combat operations in Afghanistan. This is an 8 mag center combat load vehicle operator's model, covered in PALS webbing for unlimited customization options, an M249 drum/mag dump pouch, and a padded GP (general purpose) pouch. Mag loadout is also easily convertible to 4 mags in just seconds. Simply adjust and refit the retention flaps and you can shed half the ammo weight while keeping the mags snug and tight during rapid movement on a mission or situation that calls for speed and maneuverability. 

Fifteen (15) 20-round .308/7.62 mags. All in excellent shape. 13 are aluminum and show almost zero wear. Still clean, dark black. Two steel mags show age but not abuse. Included in the aluminums are two sets of coupled mags that will double your ammo to forty rounds attached to the weapon. 

If you're in the market for a complete, combat-ready SHTF rig complete with world-proven battle rifle, combat chest rig and enough ammo to deck out your next handful of trips to the range, ready to be picked up and rocked straight out of the box, this is it, look no further."

This quality replacement magazine for a Glock .40 firearm is constructed from steel and polymer just like the factory Glock mags. Each will work with all generations of Glock's including those with ambidextrous magazine releases & can be rebuilt using factory magazine parts.

Like many new magazines, these have an extremely stiff springs from the factory. It may not be possible to initially load them to full capacity. Loading half of the listed capacity and leaving it loaded overnight before the first use will ease future loadings. These do take some break in time to get these to work in some cases.

Please note: This item is sold as is since it is an aftermarket Korean magazine and not a Glock factory OEM magazine. They are priced to sell no longer available and to most people are worth taking the plunge.

This is practically a new gun because I have only taken it to a range twice since I bought it in May of 2012. It even still has a little bit of factory grease on it! The 1911 feel while only shooting .22lr's is great for practice and not wasting those expensive .45 rounds! CASH TALKS!

Known as the ""Baby Glock,"" the Glock 26 in 9x19mm has been the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994 - a market once dominated by the 5-round snubnose revolver. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds is standard, and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain why the G26 is the mainstay backup option among security personnel and agencies worldwide. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".


The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.


GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.


This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case.

The EXPS3-4 offers true 2 eyes open shooting, a transversly mounted lithium 123 battery, 7 mm raised base offering iron sight access, and easy to adjust side buttons.

The factory rear sight (the small ones that originally come with the gun) is a bit damaged.  I bought it this way and then added the rail system and new sights.

It's got plenty of rail space for flashlights, foregrips, scopes, lasers, etc.

Please call with questions REDACTED
Taurus’ PT 1911s are built on a hammer-forged, ordnance-grade steel slide, frame, and barrel. All three components are hand-fitted for reliable operation and accuracy. Then they’re marked with matching serial numbers to ensure that the hard work isn’t negated with a parts mix-up.
The full-length slide houses its five-inch, stainless barrel and full-length guide rod. The ejection port is lowered and flared, and wide grasping grooves fore and aft facilitate slide manipulation in high-stress situations. Low-profile Hienie sights are dovetailed into the slide. The serrated rear sight has a single white dot below the generous notch. The front also has a white dot, which sits atop the rear sight’s dot in Heinie’s “Straight 8” pattern.

The frame has a beveled magazine well for fast, sure reloads. The front strap and flat mainspring housing are checkered at 30 lines-per-inch for a better grip. The underside of the trigger guard is similarly-checkered. Thin, black plastic grips provide additional traction.

A nicely-fitted beavertail grip safety with a bump looks good and is easy to engage, even with a less-than-perfect grip. The ambidextrous thumb safety engages smoothly and positively. The extended magazine release is checkered, and the slide release has three wide grooves.

Fit and finish were very good, the barrel was fitted nicely and I particularly liked the Heinie sights. But the proof is in the shooting, so I grabbed 350 rounds and headed for the range to see if there was any steak to go with all that Brazilian sizzle.
I started out at the seven yard line, where I fired four magazines to get a feel for the trigger and check the sights (which were regulated perfectly). Next, I moved back to the 25-yard line to shoot groups. My test pistol shot very well, and was phenomenally accurate with Federal’s 230-grain Hydra Shok and Hornady’s 200-grain XTP +P. I then returned to the seven-yard line for some reliability testing. My friend, Deputy Lance Bertolino, and I ran through another 220 rounds as fast as we could. As expected, the pistol ran flawlessly. It was also easy to control thanks to the front- and back-strap checkering. A cleaner trigger would have made our job easier, but overall, the new Taurus impressed.

Taurus claims the PT 1911 is street ready right out of the box. With features, accuracy and reliability to rival many high-end 1911s, I have to agree."

Comes with everything from the factory (case, paddle holster, mag holster, lock, paperwork, 2 5rd mags) plus 2 extended grip 7rd mags and 2 holsters. Only 1 of the extended mags has been used, the other 1 hasn't even been loaded. One holster is a leather IWB made by Cobra Gunskin and the other is a hybrid leather/carbon fiber kydex IWB by Foxx Holsters. The hybrid isn't even broken in yet, I wore it for 3 days - it can be used as either a standard left handed holster or as a right handed small of the back holster.

I am asking $750 for everything which is reasonable when you total up the going rate on everything individually - 650 for the gun, 60 for each extra mag, 60 per holster.

Comes with the original 10 round mag and an extra Ruger 25rd banana mag. Slight wear on stock from not having kept it in a cover (pictured), but nothing mechanically wrong. This gun his great for someone who wants to take this to the range quite often and practice using iron sights or any beginner. Ruger 10/22's are well respected at the club level and are usually found in college marksmanship organizations.
