This is a 1941 Pistole 08 military gun manufactured by Mauser. This piece is a 4 inch (98 mm) 9mm Parabellum.  To conceal production a series of alphabetical/numbers were assigned to Mauser in 1939 to identify their production in addition to the date code over the chamber to indicate the year of production. In February 1941 Mauser changed from the 42 code to byf.   ''41"" dates are representative of the Luger contract production accepted by the German military in 1941.
This is a standard 1934 Model gun designated by collectors as the ""Black Widow"" 41/42 Mauser. This Luger has all matching numbers.

The finish is 96% Blued and no straw blue on this model and model has a hold open latch and stock lug..

The first toggle link is marked with the ""42"" Mauser code.  There is the ""V"" rear sight on the rear toggle link and the last two digits of the serial number appear.

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. 

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.

Had a trade agreement for this rifle set to take place this morning, however the gentleman I was trading with decided to cancel as his firearms [apparently] had sentimental value to him. Been in the situation before and I'm glad he pulled out rather than regretting his trade.

I'm willing to sell for cash but want to review all trade offers first.

It is a Colt M4 Carbine AR15 weapon chambered in .22lr.
I actually think it makes a GREAT defense weapon, one that my wife feels very comfortable handling. 
However its purpose is to familiarize yourself with ar15 combat. 

.223/5.56 ammo is drying up and nobody can afford to blow through their stock pile at the range.
However if you expect to be confident handling your weapon you need to spend lots of time shooting it, 1000 rnds downrange or more.

This Colt M4 shoots .22lr - the only ammunition you can find reliably and costs about 10x's less than .223 (I think you can still buy 550rnd value packs at walmart for under $20)

It is the exact same size and weight of a Colt M4 chambered for .223. 

One of the reasons I feel this makes a good defense weapon is the .22lr round's tendency to 'roll' or 'tumble' when it enters a target (take a zig-zag path through a body, often ricocheting off bone and hard tissue finding its way through vital organs) 

Colt comes with tactical forearm, adjustable stock and 30rnd magazine."

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. 

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.

The Lee Deluxe Rifle 3 Die set is perfect for the beginning or experienced reloader. The set is made of steel and includes a full length sizing die, collet neck sizing die and bullet seating die. Use the full length sizing die to produce ammunition to factory-new specifications using cases fired in other guns. The collet neck sizing die will allow you to produce ammunition that is fire-formed to the chamber of one rifle.

Lee Precision has been producing some of the highest quality reloading equipment for over 50 years. Their Deluxe 3-Die Sets for rifle cartridges are no different. They are made to tight tolerances to help reloaders make consistent and accurate ammunition. These die sets are perfect for both beginning and seasoned reloaders. Each die is made of steel and the set comes with a full length sizing die, collet neck sizing die and bullet seating die. Reloaders use the full length sizing die to produce ammunition to factory-new specifications using new brass or brass cases that were fired in other guns. Full length sizing dies are also great for the reloader who wants to ensure each round loaded will chamber in their rifle with ease. The collet neck sizing die allows reloaders to product ammunition that has been fire-formed to the chamber of that rifle. Since only the neck is sized more force may be required to get each round to chamber but brass life is extended and a lot of reloaders see an increase in accuracy. This set also includes a bullet seating die, shellholder, powder dipper, storage box and load data.

The Ruger 10/22 Takedown (model 11100) is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachments points for the padded, single-shoulder strap offer different carrying options. The Ruger 10/22 Takedown: A New Twist on the Legendary Ruger 10/22 Readily separated into two halves, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate as every Ruger 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side. The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and butt stock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly.

Care was taken to work up the load and I found that this particular round, loaded to the design limits of my Taurus 9mm all metal gun, works extremely well.  Shots are quick and powderful, yet the barrell immediately falls back to it's aim position. 

All loads were carefully weighed on an analytical balance to be even more accurate than any +/- 0.1 grain scale you can buy. 

Calculated muzzle energy is more than 412 ft-lbs.

Bullets are Hornady XTP. They are hollow point.

OAL = 1.120"" nominal and each cartridge was checked.

Primers = Remington 1 1/2 small pistol.

The brass is twice fired R & P - Remington with no defects, save for maybe a scratch or two on some rounds (hardly noticeable if present.)

Loaded with a Lee Die set with the factory crimp tool being employed. 

Price per round is $2.00 (Do not tell me this is too much. These are SHTF personal defense rounds with a calculated muzzle energy of more than 412 ft-lbs. Each round was  loaded with meticulous care, by me. They at least have this much value.)

I will meet in the Saint Louis area for quantities of 8 or more. Remember, you can shoot these at the range but that would be a waste. They are meant for personal defense, if and when you need them.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular rifles in the world. It has proven itself in the field and on target ranges as a durable, dependable, accurate rifle and is worthy of a quality scope and mounting system.

Many shooters prefer smaller scopes on this carbine because of their light weight and smaller profile. This 3X to 9X variable power mini-scope meets those qualifications and includes the features of a dual illuminated (Green or Blue) reticle with range estimating mil-dots.

The unique Picatinny rail scope mount has multiple mounting slots which provide a wide range of mounting options. Mini-scopes can be mounted further back for precise eye relief adjustments, however, this mount is perfectly adaptable for use with red dot, hollogram and full size scopes.

This scope, mount and rings kit is compact, lightweight and very functional for shooters who normally hunt at closer ranges, yet need the extra magnification to reach out to targets at extreme rimfire ranges.

Per Sig's Website: The SIG516 Patrol OD comes with a Magpul MOE stock, MOE pistol grip and a Pmag in Olive Drab. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, the OD Green uses the SIG SAUER innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. This system, along with the SIG SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO’s “Over the Beach” test. A 16” chrome-lined barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating M1913 quad rail. The top rail is optic-ready and includes SIG SAUER flip-up iron sights."

Gold Dot JHP's for sale.  If you don't know what .45 Super is, it's a wildcat round that was invented to be run through normal .45ACP guns.  This ammo capitalizes on the massive case volume that the .45ACP round has by thickening the web area of the casing to withstand much much higher pressures translating into much higher velocities and kinetic energy than any .45ACP +P rounds can produce.  I was running this ammo through my Glock 36 with upgraded 23lb. springs.  I never had a single malfunction in the 200 rounds of .45 Super I ran through it.  I wouldn't suggest this ammo for lower end .45ACP's (i.e. Taurus, cheaper 1911's, Hi Points, etc.) as these cheaper guns likely don't have the case head support for this increased pressure.  All that to say, this ammo is the ultimate .45 defensive ammo that you can run without getting a custom barrel or putting a compensator on your gun.
