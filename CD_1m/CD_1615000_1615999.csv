The serial number identifies it as the first variation that was made somewhere between 1921 and 1924. It is nickel plated. I'm not sure if it is the original nickel or if it's been replated. The finish looks a lot better in hand than it does in the pictures. There is some light loss to the plating. I have shot it, and it functioned just fine. The rifling is nearly worn smooth, but is still lightly visible. The grip medallions have been replaced with small rubber discs. I'm not sure why this was done. I do not see any screws attaching the grips, so I suspect they may be glued on, or they are under the rubber discs. The grips have pulled away slightly from the frame at the bottom. It comes with three magazines, two of which are original, the other is aftermarket (I think). This pistol is being sold as a collectible only. If you decide to shoot it, you do so at your own risk. I am asking $225 for this pistol, plus $15 shipping to your FFL or C&R. I can do PayPal, postal money order, or meet face to face in Southern Indiana. Thanks!"

So few of these fine pistols came into the United States, there’s just not much written about them. I will write what I know about this one, including its measurements, and maybe someone will cough us up a good Wiki or High Road article on them. Manufacturer, is Vincenzo Bernardelli, Gardone, VT, Italy; and that company folded its equipment and moved to Turkey beginning around 2002. This specimen of the PO 18S has an Italian B D date code, manufactured 1994. The PO 18 was briefly imported into the US in severely limited quantities from 1985 until 1995, all the last ones being 10 shot. Type is a traditional double action automatic; it will fire double action safety off only from a resting hammer position. It will also engage on safe carry single action, cocked and locked. Every shot after the first shot is single action from a cocked hammer; the only truly safe way to decock is to remove the magazine, eject the chamber round, and let the hammer down with the trigger. The cocked-and-locked position is appealing to many of us, and that is the main reason, apart from Israeli familiarity with Bernardelli quality, that this pistol served and protected our Israeli friends from its issue date until fairly recently with the Mishteret Y’Israel, the Israeli Civilian Police in the Jerusalem District. The hard satin chrome finish is strong throughout with a few small scours on the grip frame and almost no amount of darkening anywhere. Anodized rear sight and safety lever. I rate this P One as Excellent, 95 percent vicinity by my estimate. It is Excellent shape mechanically. Bore, chamber and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent. Three CZ-75 16 Shot Magazines are included with this pistol. Construction is all steel including the grip frame that is serrated fore and aft. Note also that the slide is XSE style serrated fore and aft as well. Weight empty is 32.2 ounces with magazine in battery. Barrel length is 4 inches; overall length is 7 9/16 inches from muzzle to rear frame strut; height measures 5 inches from the butt of the grip frame to the top of the rear sight; slide thickness is .957 at its widest; and frame thickness measures .721 at the wide flats above the trigger guard next to the slide. This pistol sold new for $1400. I am selling it for the first $600 takes it. Text James at REDACTED."

For over 150 years Smith and Wesson has been one of the leading innovators in firearms technology. Through their cutting-edge designs and superb quality they have arguably become the most iconic firearms manufacturer in the United States. In 2006 Smith and Wesson entered into the AR market with their M&P15 Series of ""modern sporting rifles"". They quickly became one of the most sought after rifles for both law enforcement and civilian shooting applications. The optics ready model that you are bidding on remedies one of the common complaints regarding M4 type carbines. With the advent of the flattop upper receiver and so many shooters choosing to mount a magnified or redt dot sight the fixed front sight often interferes with the shootes sight picture. On this rifle S&W has replaced the fixed front sight with a railed gas block. Unlike the gas block found on many rifles the rail on this model is the same height as the upper received, allowing standard folding or fixed detachable iron sights to be installed. This features makes this rifle the perfect host for a low - medium power scope for hunting or target shooting. This rifle features a 1:9 twist, chrome-lined barrel. While many shooters desire a 1:7 twist barrel, 1:9 barrels often perform better with the light 55gr bullet that is commonly used for hunting and target shooting. This barrel can also stabilize up to a 69 grain bullet for shooters interested in long range ballistics and increased stopping power. Whether you are a hunter, target shooter or looking for a versatile home defense rifle, this gun is perfect for you."

Barrel Dimensions: Point A = 1.255"" and Point B = .790

Fit my 1941 Mosin 91/31 almost perfect without me having to shim at all. 
Looking to do a 700 sps aac project so I'm selling this stock.

The FT's design is a synthesis of design elements requested by you, the customer, for a thumbhole design. With a large rollover cheek piece for scope usage and straight comb design to minimize cheek slap when shooting, the hand conforming thumbhole allows for increased accuracy while distributing the recoil among the palm and shoulder thus minimizing muzzle jump and felt recoil. The forend is proportioned to complement barrels from 21 inches to 25 inches in length nicely and will accommodate barreled actions with standard sporter contour barrels, and larger barrels up to a tapered varmint design can be inlet in these stocks. The forend also has side vents which permit the free floating barrel to cool efficiently for those long days at the range. The FT's are available in a wide range of inlettings to accommodate most barreled actions. It must be noted that due to the variations among models and tolerances that factories may or may not routinely adhere to, some minor fitting may be required, even on our fully finished drop in parts, to achieve that perfect fit to your action. 

Featherweight Thumbhole Features: 

•Made of Stratabond Laminate for stability, strength and beauty
 •Internal material of the forend and butt have been removed to reduce weight
 •1/2"" Leather-look rubber recoil pad for non-slip shouldering
 •Reinforcing screws installed for added strength
 •Tight tolerance of wood to metal fit to ensure accuracy
 •Finished and Unfinished parts come with Swivel Studs Installed - 2 front, 1 rear
 •Overall length is approximately 32""
 •The length of pull on this item is 13 3/4""
 •The weight is approximately 2.3 - 2.5 Lbs.
 •Stocks are inlet for standard factory sporter contours. The barrel channel on these stocks can be opened up to Magnum factory contours as well as Factory Varmint Contours by you or a gunsmith, BUT the forends are not wide enough for bull barrel contours (straight contours of .875 or larger)."

Henry Golden Boy .22 rifle  
Model Number H004 
Action Type Lever Action Repeating 
Caliber .22 
Capacity 16 rounds .22 LR, 21 rounds .22 Short 
Length 38.5"" 
Barrel Length 20"" 
Weight 6.75 lbs. 
Stock American Walnut 
Sights Adjustable Buckhorn rear, beaded front 
Finish Brasslite receiver, brass buttplate and blued barrel and and Brasslite barrel band 
M.S.R.P.* $515.00
The gun is the .22 Long Rifle (which will also accept .22 Long and .22 Short). The tubular magazine mounted below the barrel holds 16 rounds of .22 LR, 18 rounds of .22 Long or 20 rounds of .22 Short. The magazine tube, barrel, bolt, lever, trigger and hammer are steel; the receiver is something called Brasslite; and the buttplate is solid brass. The receiver and buttplate are brightly polished, while the steel parts are blued and, of those, the octagonal barrel receives a high polish. On the right side of the barrel just in front of the receiver, gold letters designate the caliber, and on the other side of the barrel, also in gold letters, appear the words “Henry Repeating Arms, Bklyn NY.”
The Golden Boy’s stocks are eye-catching satin-finished American walnut that is very nicely grained as befits a presentation piece, while a brass barrel band retains the fore-end. The rifle is 38 1/2 inches in overall length and weighs 6 3/4 pounds, while the 20-inch octagonal barrel adds a bit of heft up front."

Federal Premium® Ammunition and CCI® Allocate 20 Million Rounds of .22 LR Ammunition for Youth Shooting Sports Programs

Federal Premium® Ammunition and CCI® Allocate 20 Million Rounds of .22 LR Ammunition for Youth Shooting Sports Programs

The current market and environment has caused a higher than usual demand for ammunition across the industry. One area hit particularly hard is rimfire ammunition. Many youth organizations, events and camps rely on the popular and affordable .22 LR for training, practice and recreational shooting. In order to ensure that essential educational shooting programs can go on according to plan, Federal Premium Ammunition® and CCI® have set aside 20 million rounds of .22 LR for approved youth shooting sports programs. This limited program will support well-known organizations such as the 4-H Shooting Sports, Boy Scouts of America and others associated with the Youth Shooting Sports Alliance. 

ANOKA, Minn. - May 2, 2013 - Federal Premium® Ammunition and sister company CCI® have dedicated 20 million rounds of rimfire ammunition to youth shooting sports programs. The Boy Scouts of America will receive 10 million .22 LR shells, and another 10 million will be sent to other organizations. This product sold at a discounted price will ship directly to the Boys Scouts of America, 4-H Shooting Sports and other qualified youth organizations. The ammunition distribution process was in cooperation with the Youth Shooting Sports Alliance (YSSA). Delivery is expected in May and will help ensure that many camps, shooting programs and trainings can occur over the summer.

The consumer demand for ammunition over the last several months has put a strain on manufacturers across the country. Both Federal Premium and CCI continue to run their plants 24 hours a day, seven days a week—as they have for years. Despite the best efforts of over 2,000 employees working around the clock, customers are having trouble finding ammunition.

“We work very closely with several youth organizations who promote the youth shooting sports,” said Federal Premium Conservation Manager Ryan Bronson. 

“Their efforts are very important to us, and always have been. Many of them rely on rimfire ammunition to educate and teach tomorrow’s hunters and shooting sports enthusiasts. The current demand has put a strain on their ability to continue to operate. We hope this special allocation will ease some of the pressure, and keep our young people doing what they love—shooting and hunting.”

Federal Premium and CCI took applications and requests until April 30. Through a regimented process all 20 million rounds have been allocated. The recipients of this ammunition include notable organizations like the 4-H Shooting Sports, Boy Scouts of America, Scholastic Steel Challenge and other friends of the Youth Shootings Sports Alliance. All participants in this program have been vetted and are well-documented supporters of the youth shooting sports. 

Federal Premium and CCI have been dedicated to conservation and youth outreach programs for decades. The latest allocation of 20 Million .22 LR rounds supports the need for affordable and reliable ammunition.

Federal Premium® Ammunition and CCI® Allocate 20 Million Rounds of .22 LR Ammunition for Youth Shooting Sports Programs

The current market and environment has caused a higher than usual demand for ammunition across the industry. One area hit particularly hard is rimfire ammunition. Many youth organizations, events and camps rely on the popular and affordable .22 LR for training, practice and recreational shooting. In order to ensure that essential educational shooting programs can go on according to plan, Federal Premium Ammunition® and CCI® have set aside 20 million rounds of .22 LR for approved youth shooting sports programs. This limited program will support well-known organizations such as the 4-H Shooting Sports, Boy Scouts of America and others associated with the Youth Shooting Sports Alliance. 

ANOKA, Minn. - May 2, 2013 - Federal Premium® Ammunition and sister company CCI® have dedicated 20 million rounds of rimfire ammunition to youth shooting sports programs. The Boy Scouts of America will receive 10 million .22 LR shells, and another 10 million will be sent to other organizations. This product sold at a discounted price will ship directly to the Boys Scouts of America, 4-H Shooting Sports and other qualified youth organizations. The ammunition distribution process was in cooperation with the Youth Shooting Sports Alliance (YSSA). Delivery is expected in May and will help ensure that many camps, shooting programs and trainings can occur over the summer.

The consumer demand for ammunition over the last several months has put a strain on manufacturers across the country. Both Federal Premium and CCI continue to run their plants 24 hours a day, seven days a week—as they have for years. Despite the best efforts of over 2,000 employees working around the clock, customers are having trouble finding ammunition.

“We work very closely with several youth organizations who promote the youth shooting sports,” said Federal Premium Conservation Manager Ryan Bronson. 

“Their efforts are very important to us, and always have been. Many of them rely on rimfire ammunition to educate and teach tomorrow’s hunters and shooting sports enthusiasts. The current demand has put a strain on their ability to continue to operate. We hope this special allocation will ease some of the pressure, and keep our young people doing what they love—shooting and hunting.”

Federal Premium and CCI took applications and requests until April 30. Through a regimented process all 20 million rounds have been allocated. The recipients of this ammunition include notable organizations like the 4-H Shooting Sports, Boy Scouts of America, Scholastic Steel Challenge and other friends of the Youth Shootings Sports Alliance. All participants in this program have been vetted and are well-documented supporters of the youth shooting sports. 

Federal Premium and CCI have been dedicated to conservation and youth outreach programs for decades. The latest allocation of 20 Million .22 LR rounds supports the need for affordable and reliable ammunition.
