This has been shot, though the exact shot count is uncertain. I feel it is accurate to say it has been shot <25 times.

It is a great carry weapon, being light (under 1 pound loaded), small and simple to operate.
That being said, some say this weapon has considerable kick when firing .357 loads so using .38 may be a better choice for you. Whichever you choose, you DO have a choice of .38, .38 +P and .357.

Face to face only, in my county. This means I will not travel to NY, CA or some other place outside NC. In fact, it means in person where I can look you in the eye (Skype does not count). Furthermore, it does not mean I will ship it to you, because I will not. 
If you are still uncertain about what face to face means, I suggest you ask someone who can better explain it than I.

No trades considered.

I have been asked what my ""best price"" is. If you like, I can raise it $100 as that is ""best"" for me.

I am not giving this weapon away. If that is what you are looking for, you might try going to Mexico where I understand the US government is pretty much giving away guns, though that program may have stopped."

New factory loads, no reloads or ""once fired"" brass. This is better ammo than Federal or Lake City. Buy them all and get them for $85, thats only $12 per box. PMC XTAC is a big step up from the standard PMC bronze and is well known to be very accurate, consistent, and clean shooting ammo. Reloaders love XTAC because the brass is thicker and high quality, suitable for being reloaded many times over. Read some reviews yourself, XTAC is some of the best liked ammo out there. I guarantee there is not one single place locally or even online that has it available and is selling it for this low a price. If I am wrong please let me know where it is in stock and for what price and I will change my listing. Cheapest I have seen XTAC for sale anywhere is $15.99 per box, then you will also pay tax or shipping on top of that. The first $85 cash gets the all 7 boxes.

The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. This impressive long-range rifle system is equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod. From its shooter-adaptable design to its unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in actionEven the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it's not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting. Its straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide.

MUR-1s (deflector only) showing the right side. Standard AR15 Ejection Port Cover door are used on the MUR-1S.
The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly. Made in the USA.

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door."

These guns are as new and Unfired and would be impossible to upgrade. The First is a very rare model 55 automatic open bolt .22 single shot which were only manufactured in 1955 with only 10,000 being manufactured. Everything is perfect on the rifle with the exception of minor storage and handling marks from being stored in the winchester safe room for 50 plus years. Price is $300 The next rifle is a model 77 semi automatic with the rare tubular magazine. Only 10 percent of total production rolled of the assembly line with the tube mags all others had detachable 5 round mags.

It is in excellent condition with about 250 rounds fired (no malfunctions of any kind). I'm selling because I'm moving away from .308 to standardize on calibers. Features are as follows: 1. Rifle was built on one of the first batch of STG-58 rifle parts kits (Austrian-metric style) imported into the United States. The parts kit used to build this rifle was graded “excellent” to “very good” condition. The Austrian STG-58 rifle kits are generally regarded as one of the best manufactured FN-FAL designs. 2. Bolt and bolt carrier serial numbers match. Other serial numbers are close but do not exactly match. 3. Finish is parkerized and all original-mostly excellent condition, with a few scratches. Exception is the metal barrel/piston covers, which have been coated with black ""tuff stuff"" paint. 4. The barrel shines and land/grooves are sharp-it is virtually new. Barrel is marked with various arsenal markings, including ""7.62x51 VCL 140"". 5. Receiver is the “gear wheel” Imbel type, which has been properly heat treated and machined to original FAL specs (purchased from Dealer’s Warehouse). Top of receiver has some finish wear (I had a scope mount there and in sliding it off some of the parkerized finish wore down). 6. Long gas tube design. 7. Bipod has been removed (no longer have it). 8. The rifle has been properly headspaced and the barrel is properly timed. 9. The rifle has been sighted in using .308 surplus ammunition 10. Original Sling included (I dyed it black). Buttstock and pistol grip are US made aftermarket. 11. One magazine included. Certified  check from a major bank only please. I will ship to your FFL dealer’s address only (the dealer must fax/email me signed copy of his FFL license). Buyer to pay shipping and insurance of $25. Thanks for looking."

If you are unfamiliar with this rifle or manufacturer, I suggest doing a little reading up on them. They are known as one of the highest quality AK/Kalashnikov makers on the market today. With their heavy duty RPK style receivers, and top level manufacturing specs, you can't do much better than a VEPR. This rifle is unique in that, while being based on Kalashnikov's time tested design, it has many features of a regular hunting rifle. It has a push button safety (also the bolt hold open button), and a full length Russian walnut stock, rather than the standard two piece AK design. The beauty of the stock itself must be seen in person. It has a built in muzzle brake on the fluted barrel, and the trigger group in this rifle is far superior to that of a standard AK. It also comes with a serial number matched side rail scope mount. I am including a Nikon Prostaff scope with Butler Creek flip up covers and rings which has just been boresighted. The scope is under 1 year old (with original receipt) and the rifle is under 2 years old. I took it to the range a few times and it has been in the safe since. The gun is amazingly accurate. I have another VEPR in 7.62 so I am having trouble reconciling the idea of why I need two. The rifle has less than 200 rounds through it and is in PERFECT shape. It is like a brand new rifle. It comes with the original manual and cleaning kit, and two 5 round mags. Centerfire systems usually has these for around 13 hundred bucks (excluding taxes and background fees), but they appear to be out of them now. I am incuding a link to the Molot website so you can see how much they are asking when they are in stock, which they aren't at the moment. I will include the scope, mount, rings, sling, 150 rounds of Bulgarian surplus ammo, and a nice case for the asking price of $1200 FIRM. Please respect my asking price and do not contact me with lowball offers. I am not in financial straits and do not need to sell it. I will ONLY sell it for the right price. The only trades I would consider would be for a QUALITY American made guitar like a Gibson Les Paul or a vintage American Strat. I would also trade for a quality tube amp and/or 4X12 cabinets like those made by Orange, Marshall, or Mesa Boogie. If I am uninterested I will not respond. Please do not take offense. Cash is most likely going to be king on this transaction. You may call or text 8 five 0 - six three 7 - two 9 eight 5 with any questions or concerns or reply via REDACTED. Thank you for your consideration.

492,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1646492,For Sale:  NIB Benelli M4 Tactical 12ga,"colorado, Colorado, United States","$ 1,400","Listed On: Monday, May 20, 2013",Shotguns,no type,no type,no type,Shotgun,"Factory New Benelli M4 Tactical 12 gauge shotgun. Benelli has long been renowned for their world class sporting shotguns. Their attention to detail, craftsmanship and innovative recoil system make them some of the most desired guns on the market. In the early 90s Benelli released a ""Tactical"" version of their popular M1 Super 90 shotgun. While this gun was exceedingly light and functioned flawlessly in it's stock configuration it did have some short comings. During military evaluation of the M1 Super 90 it was determined that Benelli's standard Inertia system has cycling issues when large amount of weight (such as a night vision optic) was added to the system. Benelli's answer to this problem is the M4 Tactical. This shotgun utilizes their revolutionary A.R.G.O. short stroke gas piston system. This operating system employs 2 short stroke gas pistons as opposed to the 1 long stroke gas piston found in a typical Browning design. This change provides reduced bolt wear, greatly increased reliability and longer time between cleanings. This operating system is also self regulating and self cleaning, virtually eliminating gas system maintenance. The M4 Tactical features ghost ring style sights and a factory installed picatinny optics rail. It's 18.5 inch barrel features interchangeable choke tubes and is cryogenically treated to ensure the tightest and most consistent groups possible. The M4 comes standard with a fixed buttstock featuring a pistol grip. This allows one handed manipulation of the firearm in the event that the shooters support hand needs to be used to perform other tasks. This feature is especially useful in home defense situations where the possibility of doors being opened and children being carried exists.NO TRADE"

Students should bring a modern functioning handgun with 50 rounds of factory new ammunition and appropriate cleaning supplies for the firearm. Don’t have a handgun, ammo, or supplies? No worries! Get in touch with me and we can work out the details. There is also a $60 fee divided between the state and local police that is normally paid 2-3 weeks after the completion of the course. A criminal background check will be done by the Kentucky State Police after the completion of the course.

Whether it is industry leading sound reduction on a 45ACP handgun or durability on submachine guns and subsonic rifles, the Octane 45 performs.

I also have a tactical sling for it but not the front adaptor so I will sell that separately if you are interested.  It shots great, the reason I am selling it is because I just got a benelli tac shotgun and I don't need two."

This is beautiful Vintage Mossberg 151K semi-auto 22 LR which comes with 
the Original Mossberg M4D scope complete with scope Eye Cup

This model rifle was only made for 2 years, 1950-1951 and hard scare to find
quite often especially in this condition.  I have taken the rifle completely down 
and given it a complete cleaning.  Rifle internals are like new, and the bore is 
VG plus or better.

The finish is 98-99%  the rifle doesn't appear to have been fired much at all.
the Scope optics are good, with intact cross hairs, I have notice a couple of dust
spots on the lens, but does not interfere with the optics at least for me it doesn't
could use a cleaning.  Rubber eye cup is also with the scope which all too often
these are missing from the scope and are most impossible to find that are original
mossberg. I have test fired the rifle and it performs and functions properly with out
any problems and is a sweet shooter.

Rifle also comes with the Mossberg Factory hang tag with rifle instruction sheet
Scope sheet and even a old advertisement sheet. These tags are usually not found
with the rifle. Note: Sling is included with rifle

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market.

Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

It is less than an inch wide (hence the name of the gun, ""Slim""), and is very easily concealed. 

It comes just as I bought it, in a cardboard Taurus gun box with one 7 Round magazine,
a key that is used to adjust the sights and to lock the gun, and the gun manual. 

I can also throw in 50 rounds of Winchester 9mm ammo + a Blackhawk Sportster belt holster that fits this gun like a glove for $20 more making the total $370.

I have had 0 jams, 0 fails to fire, 0 stovepipes, etc. I have had 0 problems with this gun whatsoever. It's really awesome, has barely any noticeable recoil, and is very easy to conceal due to it's size, and yet it isn't too small. Great for serious owners or first time buyers looking for something compact that doesn't kick like a horse.
Overall this is a great 9mm handgun if you're interested in concealed carry or for a home defense gun.

Bought this new a few months ago along with an extra retractable stock (pictured) and an extra 100rd helical magazine. Also added a very nice Phoebus flashlight/red laser combo and some rail covers. I never got a chance to fire it and now need some money so it is up for sale. This is the best of the Calico carbines in that it is the tactical version with 4 picatinny rail foregrip. It is very lightweight with very little recoil. The original stock (not pictured) is more like an RPK style butt, is made of polymer, and like the one pictured on the rifle, is mounted on sliding rails for retractability. Rifle is new/never fired and comes with both stocks, 50rd and 100rd mags, flashlight/laser and railcovers as pictured, and box and manual as new.

Yes, I know all the BIG BOX stores (Sportco, Cabela's, etc.) sell these for about $9, but:
1.  They charge sales tax
2.  They don't deliver for free (unless you want 50 of them)
3.  They won't cut you a deal on a higher quantity
4.  They don't care about how much gas/time you used getting there
5.  They don't have them listed on their website for shipping deals

I'm willing to work with you on ALL of these points, so is it REALLY worth 2-3 hours of your time to save about $1 a mag?

YOU are responsible for whether you can have them where you are or not (if you can't have them or are afraid of getting caught, don't order them).  E-mail for better price if you want more than 2.

Two years ago I took it to a gun range bachelor party and went through 360 rounds, so call the total 500. Conditin will bear out little shooting occurred in this rifle's life.

It is 1 of the best US made clones of the original H&K SP89. It features a 6"" 3-lug, ½x28 RH threaded PDW barrel. It was refinished by Metaloy Industries in their Silver ""TactiKote"". This was done in 2006 & the finish is showing some wear from handling & changing accessories over the years. The Trijicon nightsights are pretty dim now, as they're through about half of their lifespan. See the list below for all of the German parts that were installed. The front sling eyelet was removed by Vector Arms when I sent them the gun & the 4-position grip frame to be clipped. This left a hole where the eyelet was installed (I didn't think to ask them to weld it over), but allows using more forends, such as the B&T railed forend, which would not fit with the eyelet installed. The pictured aftermarket MP5-A1 receiver end cap is included, but was split on the top seam when installed on a Vector Arms V93 pistol. It does not have a buffer installed. I'm only including it as I will have no use for it anymore. The receiver extension allows installing an A2 fixed stock, or even an A3 or MP5-F A3 stock, as the receiver does not have the plates welded over the channels on the sides of the receiver.

The previous owner carried it on his hip, so it has some of the blueing rubbed off.  He had a Fobus left hand paddle holster, a frontline IWB left hand leather holster and a left leg holster.  I bought a right handed Fobus paddle holster which I'd be willing to toss in for an extra 30 dollars.  I also have some ammo.  I've got 100 winchester target rounds that I'd sell for 40 bucks.

if you're interested in pictures, I can text some.  The pictures I've got included are stock pics from the internet.  I'm sad to let go of her, as I've loved her lots.

It's in good condition and was purchased new less than 4 months ago.  I am selling it because I am getting the new 17 WSM.  It's a great gun.  It's very accurate and fun to shoot crows or other varmints with.  I have 160 rounds that go with it.  It has a 22"" bull barrel with the new XT Pro-Fire Adjustable Trigger.  It has a factory mounted 3-9x32mm scope that I have sighted in for 100yds.  It comes with a 7 rd clip and also a 4 rd clip.  I live near Winfield, about 40 minutes south of Wichita and would be willing to meet if interested.  Thanks, Seth REDACTED.  Call, text, or email."
