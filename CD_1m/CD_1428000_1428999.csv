The event will be held at the Advocates For Justice Building, 1312 Annapolis Dr, Raleigh, NC. Participants will discuss various gun control related issues that are facing our society today and how these issues affect not only our society as a whole, but how they also affect our rights as gun owners.

Participants include:

    Paul Valone, President, Grass Roots North Carolina
    Carlos Mahoney, National ACLU Board Member and National ACLU Gun Control Board Member
    Earl Woodham, United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE)
    Gail Neely, North Carolinians Against Gun Violence


Local media organizations will be covering the event and as you can see above, the deck is stacked against those of us who believe that the right to protect our lives should not be infringed. The topics will include the ACLU's policy-making decision process for gun control, the current gun laws and how they are enforced at the Federal level, as well as opposing views of the issues by Paul Valone and Gail Neely.

Make plans to attend!

We need your support! If at all possible, make plans to attend the event and show your unwavering support for our rights. We cannot sit idly by while political forces with seemingly bottomless pockets continue their assault on the Second Amendment. As President Obama and political forces across the country continue their assault on our rights as gun owners, the support we give for those defending our freedoms must be just as strong."

 It has a receiver mount rail with a Red Dot on it right now, also included is the original (and questionable quality) Norinco scope and sling it was imported with.

 Not much else to say. Its an SKS. Shoot it as is or use the action to build up a tactical rifle. Either way its a solid weapon.

 Some reasonable amount of ammo can be supplied at pre-panic prices with the rifle purchase if you happen to need some.

 Price is somewhat negotiable, and might consider some trades, but really not looking for much right now."

Surefire HS2ABK HS2 Minimus Tactical Light 123A Black 100

The Minimus headlamp features a high-efficiency LED that provides a brilliant white light, adjustable in output from zero to 100 lumens via the knurled no-slip right-hand output control knob. The proprietary refractive optic produces a wide beam optimized for your natural field of view, and an included red filter gives you the option of low-signature light that also preserves dark-adapted vision. A valuable safety feature: a setting for a long-running SOS beacon. The Minimus runs on a single 123A battery contained within the tilt-control knob, and the battery access cap has a short leash to prevent dropping or loss. The fine-weave headband is strong but comfortable, and features a moisture-wicking Breathe-O-Prene forehead pad. Built from tough polymer and hard-anodized aerospace aluminum, the Minimus is lightweight, yet like its siblings the Minimus Vision, the Minimus Tactical, and the Minimus AA, it's tough enough for the rigors of combat, caving, and mountaineering, and is submersible to 3 feet for up to thirty minutes. Variable light-output dial controls levels from 0 to 100 lumens. Proprietary refractive optic produces a smooth, wide beam optimized for your field of vision. Built-in SOS beacon can run for days on end. Light housing can be rotated up or down 90 degrees. Red filter (included) for low light signature and/or preserving dark-adapted vision. High-strength aerospace aluminum body, Mil-Spec hard-anodized for extreme durability. Submersible to 3 feet for thirty minutes. Headband provides comfort, durability, and a secure fit with or without a helmet. Compact integral compartment holds one 123A lithium battery. Includes high-energy 123A battery with 10-year shelf life. Available in black and tan models.

This is a beautiful Springfield TRP. I am not the original owner and purchased this just the way it sits. According to the previous owner the round count is ""way under"" 500. TRP Armory Kote, Night Sights dated 09 (still bright), Wilson FLGR, Wilson extended slide release. Wilson Shock Buff, Wilson G10 Grips. All original parts included. (except grips). 2 mags and box with holster and mag holder. Excellent condition. Cash price $1375 in Evansville. Trade options will pretty much be limited to nice 1911s. 9mm or 45. Not really looking for an officer model unless it is an STI 9mm or EMP 9. I may also be interested in an upper end Sig P229, 226, 239. Will also accept ammo and extras as a partial trade.

Please no lowball offers. Trades must be in excellent condition. FTF in the Evansville area only. Must have LTCH.

One specific gun I have been eying is a Kimber Tactical Pro in 9mm. The Colt carry model or a Remington R1 Carry. Would also trade for Ruger SR1911. A full size and a commander would be great. Prefer 1911s without the firing pin safety but not a deal killer. +/- cash for the right deal. Open to multiple gun trades."

I have the original Rock river iron sights as well. Lastly I have eight 30rd magazines that will come with the gun as well as the factory hard case. Let me know if you are interested or would like to make an offer. It has a few other mods that came with the gun that I would be happy to tell you about if your seriously interested. I am in no rush to get rid of the gun but I do have to sell it within a few months so please do not low ball me. The current waiting time for my gun from rockriver is 9 months.

The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters.

Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA).

I bought this gun new in 2002 and have probably put around 2000 rounds through it. To be honest, I love this gun and a soft spot for it, but it hasn't always been ultra reliable. It fires about 98% of the time. To its credit, I usually run target grade ammo through it, so it could be an ammo issue. But for proper disclaimer, if I go to the range with 100 rounds, it will generally fail to fire 2 or 3 of them. Some ammo seems better, some worse. Sometimes I can go to the range and run 100 rounds with zero FTF, it really just seems like an ammo-picky gun. If you want a range gun, it's a good gun. I'm not sure I'd depend on it with my life - hence why km selling it.

It originally came with one mag, but I've picked up a couple more over the years so now it comes with 3. All of the Mags are 10-rounders, although I think our can get 12 or maybe 13 rounders if you want.

On the bright side, it is probably the most comfortable and coolest looking gun around. It's a beauty, and I hate to get rid of it.

Comes with factory carry case, lock, three 10-rd factory mags, manual, a soft brush and a wire brush.

I dont like the magazines that come with the Hi-Point handguns. I think they are big and bulky and down right ugly.  I had a friend who works in a machine shop cut of the bottom and weld it so that the end of the magazine is flush with the end of the pistol grip.

For the gun and the one magazine that I had modified, I will take $175.  Or for an extra $60 I will throw in the case and 30 rounds of range ammo.  I paid $50 for the case and it is in brand new condition.

The Spike’s Tactical Dynacomp is a 5.56 muzzle device designed to reduce recoil impulse and muzzle climb to provide faster follow up shots. The Dynacomp's accomplish this by balancing the direction of the blast along the vertical (upward) and perpendicular planes of the muzzle to lower muzzle rise, while the end of the device restricts forward energy to reduce parallel recoil.

Charging Handle - BCM Gunfighter w/ Mod 4 Medium Latch :

The BCM GUNFIGHTER™ MOD 3 Charging Handle is a drop in replacement for your standard Mil-Spec charging handle. The big difference between the Gunfighter and other charging handles with extended latches is that the Gunfighter’s latch features internal redesigns that take the force of racking the rifle off of the roll pin and evenly distributes that force back into the body of the charging handle when doing support hand only manipulations that are popular today. This new and improved design features a built in backstop that’s engineered into the extended latch and also into the charging handle itself."
