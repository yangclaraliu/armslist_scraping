These were designed and manufactured in Israel specifically for the Tavor, but they function flawlessly in any gun designed to accept AR style magazines.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have over 200 rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

Please note, I have Thermold 30 rounders coming in shortly as well!

Thermold Magazines started in the 1960's as a molded plastics injection manufacturer that served the automotive industry. It's founder, William Howard, was well known in his hometown of Wilson, N.C. as an innovative thinker who held many patents. Mr. Howard was also a big game hunter for whom making firearms more reliable was both a passion and a necessity.

 Using a nylon resin called Zytel, developed by DuPont after World War II to replace metal in large-scale manufacturing, Thermold began producing weapons magazines that resisted heat and corrosion, and functioned with extreme reliability. Thermold magazines rapidly became the product of choice among military personnel, law enforcement officers and sport shooters around the world.

The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent. It appears that this revolver remains unfired since original factory test fire. It comes in the wood grain Colt box (the box is an unusual light color but shows age and some tape reinforcements)...the box end label is decidedly hand made. Included are an instruction booklet, the original ""Handling the Handgun"" guide, congratulations letter, hang tag and sight adjustment tool. Also included is the original layaway receipt, dated January, 1976! This is a very nice example of a highly collectible Colt revolver."

My agency got these from Sig when they first began making the P229 with a rail (as I've been told).  I have left the serial number visible so you can check the date code if that sort of thing interests you.  German frame, NH slide. I believe the gun is around 10 years old.  The night sights still glow, albeit a little dim.  

As you can see, there is fairly significant finish wear to the slide, however, the rails, barrel, etc do not show significant signs of use.  I was issued this in its present condition in the fall of 2011.  My agency was given a great deal on new E2-gripped P229Rs with SRT triggers, hence the switch.

I have not experienced a malfunction.  The DA pull is extrememly smooth and the SA pull is light and crisp.  Pistol comes with 3 12-round magazines, plastic grips and the Hogue grips pictured.  If you are looking for a Cerakote candidate, or appreciate the well used look, look no further.

When you reside in a state that has a concealed carry law and you exercise your right to do so, the gun you choose to carry is very important. Most people want a handgun that has sufficient power for any dangerous situation, and the venerable 45acp has proven to be the cartridge of choice.

Another important factor to consider is comfort and concealment. Large and thick firearms are very hard to conceal, especially in Summer months when you normally wear less clothing. This is where the T3 Thin comes into its own. With the reduced size of the Officer sized frame, the single stack of 230 grain fight stoppers. and the new thin T3 grips, you have all the attributes of the regular T3 in a lighter, easier to conceal package.

The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles add to the looks, and the tapered cut allows you to easily remove a stuck magazine. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius.

Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally serrated to match. The top of the slide is serrated to reduce glare. The lightweight aluminum trigger that has been blacked-out and breaks between 3.5 and 4 lbs.

Freedom Munitions ""like-new"" manufacturing process provides like-new ammo performance.

Freedom Munitions inspects all cartridge cases for defects. the scharch range master machines are fully automated and cases are checked for any debris and pressure tested for any splits or cracks. primers are removed, flash holes are cleared, and primer pockets are reamed to accept new primers.

Freedom Munitions then washes cases in an acid wash specially designed to remove all remaining burnt powder from the flash hole and interior of the case which tumbling doesn't remove. then cases are tumbled in a dryer for a factory look and finish.

Freedom Munitions roll sizes all cases on our own designed machines to meet s.a.a.m.i.specification. this method is the industry standard for commercial sizing, insuring the case wall is sized down to the rim which insures new component performance.

Freedom Munitions then loads these processed components on the same fiber optic-controlled ammo load machines as our premium new ammo. these are the same machines used by some of the largest manufacturers in the industry. these machines assure s.a.a.m.i. specifications for priming depth, pressure and overall cartridge length.

Freedom Munitions ""like-new"" manufacturing process with the new projectile, powder and primer assures factory ammo performance that discriminating shooters expect.

404,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1439404,For Sale/Trade:  WTT: S&W 642 Airweight with custom grips for STEEL framed revolver,"Denver, Denver, Colorado",$ 600,"Listed On: Thursday, April 11, 2013",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,38 S&W Special                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"Up for your consideration is the finest concealed carry piece ever made: the Smith & Wesson 642 Centennial Airweight.  This revolver weighs a hair under 14 ounces with the Eagle Secret Service smooth rosewood grips and has the smoothest trigger I've ever experienced on a J-frame.  The Centennial is a ""hammerless"" DAO design with a no-snag internal hammer for a smooth draw from the pocket, and is completely sealed against debris, grit, and lint.  5 rounds of +P ,38 Special ammo at your disposal in a gun that will never jam and is light as air . . . disappears in a jacket pocket and carries easily in a front pant pocket without sagging.

Exactly 20 rounds down the pipe over the years.  Very tight lockup, smooth trigger, comes with the original box and papers . . . this is practically a brand new gun, with a set of beautiful custom grips that fit the hand perfectly and make it even lighter.

I would like to trade this LNIB Airweight with custom grips for something that is a bit more pleasant to shoot at the range . . . the tradeoff with an Airweight is that while it is very easy to carry, recoil from +P rounds is somewhat harsh.  Ideally, I would like the STEEL framed version of this gun, the S&W 640 . . . although I would also consider a model 442 which is the same gun with a black rather than satin finish.  I also would be open to a Ruger snubnose with a 2.25 barrel -- preferably one of the old Six series, although I'd also consider a SP-101.  I might also consider a Ruger Six series or GP-100 with a 6"" barrel (no interest in 4"").

CASH price is $600, and I'm fairly firm considering the Excellent+ condition, smooth action, accuracy, grips, and original box/papers.  FTF near greater Denver area.  Buyer will need to show CO ID to verify residency and state that they are not a prohibited person.  Will NOT ship.  No bad guys.  I reserve the right to refuse to sell to anyone for any reason, or withdraw this item from sale.  File photo used to illustrate model and grip style."

He called me  and he and I got into a long drawn out verbal confrontation over his trying to do a story relative to private gun sales and as a result he beleives that it is a violation of the ATF Rule of ""Engaging in Business"" to sell as a private sale and make a living from it which is not what the rule says.  The Rule in essence talks about the FFL engaged in business on a regular basis with the objective of Livelihood and profit.  It excludes the occasional sale of the private seller. This guy is a real Liberal Jack -ss and he could not answer my questions as to why it is OK for Politicians and Entertainers to be able to carry concealed  hand guns or to have armed body guards protect their children but it is not OK for the average American Citizen to be able to protect themself and family in the same manner.  He then got into the Liberal Talking Points about no-one is talking abount gun confiscation and I gave him a history lesson about how Hitler started to disarm the German people the same way with National Registration- Then came Gun Confiscation.  These Liberals are all the same and they really piss me off. All this from the same State New York that has a law that  baned  more then 7 round mags and baned 16 oz soft drinks. The New York???

Has functioned well in Beretta 92, Beretta CX4 Storm, Sig P6, Sig 226, Walther PPQ, Glock 17, 19, 26, 34, Taurus PT111 and M&P9. Accuracy great to 10 yards and good to 25 yards. No recoil and builds muscle memory by simulating fail to extract issues.

Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's."

Since its introduction in late 1997, the STI Edge has become the undisputed standard for USPSA/IPSC Limited Division competition shooting as demonstrated by Michael Voigt and Frank Garcia finishing one/two as they led the US IPSC Limited Team to victory at World Shoot XII. It has been adopted by SWAT teams, HRT teams, street cops, and law enforcement training sites. It has been embraced by almost all other shooting disciplines.

Built on the patented modular steel frame with polymer grip, the Edge delivers the traditional features of a 1911 and allows the added benefit of high capacity magazines. The innovative frame design preserves the 17° angle of the grip in relation to the slide, original to the 1911. The essential design element for high capacity, the polymer grip, allows for double stack magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip, which remains comparatively the same as the circumference of a 1911.

True to 1911 tradition, the Edge has a unique full length slide with front and rear cocking serrations, STI dovetail front sight and STI adjustable rear sight. The Edge comes standard with features such as a stainless steel STI knuckle relief hi-ride grip safety and stainless steel STI ambi-thumb safeties. It comes with an STI stainless steel fully supported, ramped bull barrel. You can add custom serial numbers, colored grips and triggers, hard chrome, engraving inlays and fiber optic or tritium sights. Not only is it the most accurate and reliable handgun on the market, it can now be one of the most beautiful. The Edge ships with one 126mm magazine.
