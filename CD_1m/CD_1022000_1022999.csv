GET YOURS WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!! The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

• Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines
• Reliable functioning due to mechanical simplicity and high-quality non-binding coil springs—no lubricants required

Complete parts guns are hard to find, and do not include barrels. This is a complete parts kit mounted on a Philadelphia Ordnance 80% machined receiver. Barrel is marked 'NE-7' over the flaming ordnance bomb, and the month of barrel manufacture, 7-43. New England Arms Corp. was the rarest of the WWII BAR manufacturers. Receiver is not a ""dummy"", but is completed to 80% of the machine operations needed to operate. All external machining is done, as is much of the internal as it accepts the buttstock and buffer, cocking handle, etc., which are already mounted on it. This is the best BAR receiver made, machined from 8620 steel plate. Currently classified as a ""non-gun"" by ATF, but can be finished into a shooter. I have had estimates of $500-$700 to complete it as a semi-auto rifle. Properly licensed individuals could complete the receiver as a full-auto. However, it is a ""non-gun"" in it's current state which makes it legal to ship to any state. The rest of the rifle is shown in the pics. Includes repro leather BAR sling and Technical Manual. Display it as is, complete the machining or hire someone to do it, and save a bunch of money off what these sell for. I will provide buyer with contact info of company that can complete this as a semi-auto. I will include the ATF letter, Info sheet from Philadelphia Ordnance, and BAR receiver machinist drawings. I can include a few BAR magazines if you need them and are paying my asking price. I may trade for a current manufactured Colt, Armalite, Windham Weaponry, older Colt SP1, or other well made AR-15 type rifle plus cash. This is a good deal, as these are rare, and do not often include WWII barrels. Display or complete, either way a great addition to a WWII collection."

 This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.Ambidextrous 3-Position Safety

Classic firearm still works like new, unfired within the last 5 years.  The Model 37 was notable for its bottom-eject repeater design, which cycles spent cartridges out of the bottom of the receiver instead of a side-port.  This makes the Model 37 ideal for left-handed shooters, or people who just don't like throwing their spent shells everywhere!

Will include leather reproduction M1907 type leather sling. 
 Non-import rifle purchased from CMP several years ago.This was originally a pre-WWI 1903 rifle, with the old style script nomenclature on the receiver. This rifle was part of the historically significant WWII 1903A1 rebuild program, when the Army wanted their 1903 rifles rebuilt as 1903A1 rifles, with the addition of the pistol grip, or ""c"" stock. The stock alone is very desirable, as it is pre-WWII and still has the drawing number visible on it. The firing proof 'P' is present, as is the Rock Island rebuild cartouche. The stock has the usual dings, but is decent as-is, or easily steamed out or refinished. Personally, I have left it alone as it is part of the history of the rifle. Very nice rifling present, with a shiny bore. Muzzle Wear, or MW, is 1 on the CMP guage. Basically brand new.
 May consider a good quality SP1, Colt, Windham, or other AR-15 in trade. I have other items to make up the difference if yours is truly worth more. Would trade this rifle with accessories, for a NIB Colt 6920 M4. Can add a few non-firearm period military items to make up the difference.
$1100.00 or shoot me an offer/trade.
READ THIS PLEASE:

Purchaser must live in a city/county/state where the purchase of this item is legal. I will not break any laws in order to sell this. I am not desperate for money. I do not live beyond my means. MO residents must show proof of residency and sign a bill of sale.

Out of state residents must provide a copy of their own or their dealer’s FFL. I will ship this through a FFL dealer local to me, to your FFL, ONLY. 

ATF/MIAC/OTHER trolls, pls take your trolling elsewhere, as I will not mail a firearm to your home, I will not sell to you locally if you are from out of state, or any of the other tired ploys you guys have tried.

Other firearm owners: Beware, they are trying to build a case against private transfers of firearms, in state, or out of state through FFL dealers, as well as trying to gather dirt on Armslist in general."

385,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1022385,For Sale:  M1C Sniper Garand,"South, Springfield, Missouri","$ 2,700","Listed On: Monday, February 25, 2013",Rifles,Springfield                                                                                ,30-06 Springfield                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is the rarest of the M1 Garand variants. This rifle is a WWII produced M1C Garand sniper rifle. I purchased this from a CMP auction in 2006, and it will come with the certificate of authenticity from CMP identifying it as a genuine M1C rifle, as well as a letter of authenticity from the nation's leading M1C expert. There are no import marks. It is still a legitimate M1C as identified by serious collectors, as the holes for the scope bracket have merely been filled. Though the actual amount of WWII M1Cs converted in this manner are unknown, it is thought to be near 4 thousand that were converted. Many of these were destroyed during the Carter/Clinton years by ""Captain Crunch"", making this the rarest of the M1 variants. 
My recommendation to any buyer would be to leave the rifle as it currently is, as it is a rare variant. However, there are several reputable M1 gunsmiths who can restore this at a very reasonable cost. I will include a scope bracket that I believe to be an original parkerized replacement. The bracket has machine marks, indicating it is not cast. There are no serial numbers on this bracket, as it has never been mounted to a rifle. Value of this alone is 300-500. The screws and taper pins are still available from the original WWII/Korean War maker of the sniper component items, Griffen and Howe. Many of the M1C rifles you will see are fakes made from regular rifles, with repro or newly made scope brackets installed. They will not pass the scrutiny of collectors for several reasons. 
During the Korean War Armory level rebuild program, this WWII sniper rifle,serial #359xxxx, was rebuilt, and returned to normal M1 configuration, though the holes on the left side of the receiver for the screws and pins that hold the bracket are clearly visible, another 100% sign that this is a legitimate M1C.  Finish appears to be original, definitely not ugly Greek black parkerizing which most of the M1Cs bear today, as those are more recent CMP sales rifles returned from Greece.  Chamber is in the white. The Muzzle Wear, or MW of this rifle is near new, just over 2, indicating this was not fired much. Several new old stock barrels wil guage at or near what this will. Barrel is dated 1-53, correct for the SA-52 rebuild timeframe which ran from approximately from July '51 to June '53. Barrel is marked correctly, SA D6535448, with date of 1 53. Wood is nice USGI walnut, not current repro. Has a slight gouge in stock just behind the DAS cartouche, and two dings on the rear handguard, front handguard has a barely noticeable ding as well. Has serifed firing proof 'P' and 1/2"" DAS cartouche strongly present.  Operating Rod is marked D35382. Bolt is 2828712-SA, with heat lot code of W10B. Trigger housing is D28290-12-SA, with -5 SA hammer and -6 SA safety. Stamped trigger guard. Rear sight elevation is SA, windage is BME. Gas cylinder is wide base with much original finish, lock is WWII type. Screw is late, P followed by octogon symbol. Front sight is SA with late type screw. Other parts not mentioned are late type, though the follower is early. I inspected the M1C rifles at the CMP south store last August, and few looked as nice as this rifle. One would have to get their highest grade, at a cost of $3000.00, and still not match the quality of this rifle. Most of the M1Cs there with similar barrel quality did not have USGI wood and had the ugly Greek black parkerizing on them, ruining the value as a US martial collectible. With original scope, mount, cheekpiece, and flash hider these sell for $6500.00-$7500.00 on the collector market. Restore this rifle to original configuration, or leave it as the most rare variant of the M1. I would consider a partial trade plus cash of a good AR-15 rifle by Windham Weaponry, Colt, Armalite, or an older Colt SP1. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have more questions or would like to see more pictures. Thank you."

ENVIS (Evader’s Night Vision Imaging System) is a rugged handheld night vision system for operators who must be prepared for covert night movement. Night movement is the best choice for evasive movement, but it is generally discouraged because of difficulty navigating in the dark. The ENVIS is the survival tool of choice, designed specifically to overcome obstacles and hazards when moving at night and successfully evade hostile territory. The ENVIS is USAF approved for flight survival vests. It is a lightweight night vision pocketscope that fits in one hand for direct viewing. It can easily convert a standard still or video camera into a high quality night vision recording device. It attaches to the objective lens threads of most cameras for temporary nighttime applications. The removable objective lens can be replaced with any C-Mount Type lens for increased range and magnification.

Less then 200 Rounds have been shot through this pistol, it was purchased in late December so the gun is barely even used. It is my ccw, but need something smaller and more compact. The pistol comes with original case, two mags that are full with hollow points from federal ammo, a new blackhawk carbon fiber fitment holster for right handed shooters..others can adjust. It also comes with a .40 cal bore snake which is the best and most ideal way to clean your pistol. And if you know sigs like i do they rarely need maintaing, just a quick nice clean up after shooting it. This pistol is very accurate and easy to disassemble. Serious Inquires only, don't waste my time and low ball me. I am prior military and have experience with plenty of weapons, so i treat mine like its the last one ill own. If you can't afford the sig then don't offer to buy it. These are high quality pistols and hold their value when properly maintained. If you would like to reach me at REDACTED i am usually around my phone most of the time."

These have never even been installed. I am asking only what I have into them.

Once you BUY/OWN a Lancer AWF Mag....you will throw away your PMAGS!

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

Do some homework and you will figure out this is the BEST MAG MADE!

German WWII 38H by Sauer. This was the desired handgun of the Nazi paratroops. Very advanced for it's time. This is a very nice early example with the safety, (later models did not have this), all matching numbers, original finish, correct Nazi waffenampt markings, and original unbroken grips. .32 ACP. Includes WWII marked holster, Two early military magazines, and a concealed carry holster I had made by local leather gurus Matt and Tim Gaunt of Gaunt leatherworks here in Springfield. I never carried it though, as it is just too nice! I can include one box of ammo, and have a couple more I will sell reasonably to the buyer. May trade plus cash for ar-15 complete SP1, or good quality AR-15 by Colt, Windham, other. I have other items to make up the difference. Would trade this pistol and the 1903A1 Springfield rifle I have for sale here for a NIB Colt 6920 M4. Thank you for looking.
READ THIS PLEASE:

Purchaser must live in a city/county/state where the purchase of this item is legal. I will not break any laws in order to sell this. I am not desperate for money. I do not live beyond my means. MO residents must show proof of residency and sign a bill of sale.

Out of state residents must provide a copy of their own or their dealer’s FFL. I will ship this through a FFL dealer local to me, to your FFL, ONLY. 

ATF/MIAC/OTHER trolls, pls take your trolling elsewhere, as I will not mail a firearm to your home, I will not sell to you locally if you are from out of state, or any of the other tired ploys you guys have tried.

I am a retired Army Officer for Pete’s sake, GO AFTER THE REAL CRIMINALS, NOT PRIVATE CITIZENS WHO PAY YOUR SALARIES!

Other firearm owners: Beware, they are trying to build a case against private transfers of firearms, in state, or out of state through FFL dealers, as well as trying to gather dirt on Armslist in general."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

Only twenty rounds have been put through the barrel to ensure accuracy and functionality. 

IMPORTANT NOTE! You must go through an FFL (even if local) which means an additional $30 paid to the FFL for the background check. I do have an FFL in Black Forest that I trust who can do this transfer, or we can use yours if you have one. If you are not local and we are shipping, you must send me your FFL's license information because I can only send to them.

The Bushmaster Carbon 15 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AR-15's or for veteran gun owners. This line of rifles is among the first to come stock with polymer receiver, making it 40% lighter and more shock resistant than a standard aluminum receiver. The slim pencil style barrel, low profile gas block, and CAR-15 style stock only enhance what is already one of the lightest and most maneuverable AR's on the market. The included red dot scope is light, simple and reliable while the sight allows the user to quickly aim the weapon in any situation. 

Package includes:
-Bushmaster Carbon 15
-Standard 30 round magazine 
-Two piece drop in quad rail
-Magpul AFG 2 in dark earth
-22 Larue Tactical index clips 
-Magpul flip up MBUS sights in dark earth 
-Bushnell Trophy red dot scope

This rifle was born when our Fed gov’t decided in Regulation ATF 922R that any new firearm could not have more than 10 imported parts in it. At the time the Heckler and Koch model 91 chambered in 7.62 NATO was one of the most popular rifles around and for good reason…

They run like tanks and are very accurate!

This is the civilian version of the German G3 design that has been used by their military since the 1950’s. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_G3

After the ban on imports, JLD industries bought the engineering and machining from HK to manufacture the model 91 here in the states. These rifles have had several evolutions since the original offering and are rock solid performers. here is the current model listing:
http://www.ptr91.com/rifles
Here are the specs for this particular variation:

18” Button-rifled heavy target barrel in 1 in 12 right hand twist
Semi-auto recoil operated
20 rd box magazine fed
Rotary diopter rear sight with bullet drop compensation set for 100,200,300 and 400 yards
The rifle comes with 15 Magazines, a Brugger and Thomet Picatinny rail mount for optics mount (150 bucks on its own), hard case, sight tool and manual

Bolt and trigger group are manufactured by HK, all other parts are JLD
The trigger is pretty darned good for a rifle of this type
Rifle has about 1000 rounds put down the pipe in its lifetime

THis is a serious rifle for serious shooters,  you can have a 5.56 mousegun or a 7.62 MBR.  Take your pick!  Price on this rifle is firm.  If no serious takers appear, it goes on gunbroker where they are going for the price I've quoted WITHOUT the mags!"

The wood is near perfect, two visible dings just behind the horn on the left side, the butt is virtually untouched, all bluing is sharp and true color.

As you can see in the photos, it is not perfect. It does have wear on the bluing - most of which I put on it myself using it as a carry gun. It does have an unusual wearing in the bluing on a small part of the cylinder (see photo). 

On the other hand - the performance of this revolver is unlike any other S&W I have ever held. The trigger is absolute butter (in both single and double action). I have never felt a smoother trigger in any other S&W revolver I have ever held. It is also an extremely accurate pistol with a very strong bore.

I think this would make an excellent candidate to take advantage of S&W's re-bluing services. If this was done, it would be an absolutely perfect gun. I've done some unofficial research on this revolver and it's serial number puts it being made sometime in 1968. Smith & Wesson simply doesn't make revolvers the way they made these back in the day.

It is the stock, scope mount, scope, and bipod from an Israel modified US M14 rifle. A Sringfield Armory, Fulton Armory, Norinco, Polyteck, Smith Enterprize, or LRB M1A will work with these parts. The parts were imported by Springfield Armory and I bought them at Camp Perry during the Nationals in the 80's. The Israeli Defense Force modified US M14 Rifles for sniper use.The issue M14 fiberglass stock Had a high comb, rubber recoil pad, side swivels, and a sling stud added. The comb put riflemans eye in line with the scope. The IDF soldier did not have to duck tape foam padding to stocks as was done with a lot of US M21 sniper rifles. Recoil pad was not slippery like the M14 butt plate.The side swivels made for ease of sling carry. They also positioned sling for ease to grasp sling and support rifle on forearm during crawl. The addition of sling stud provided a mounting point for the Harris bipod. The bipod used is a commercial Harris. The IDF designed a heavy duty steel one point anchor scope mount like the first generation US M14 mount. There unique mounting screw locking mechanism stayed tight. The steel ""t"" slot ribs that engage the grooves in the receiver did not wear and distort under recoil like on our aluminum M14 mounts. The IDF mounts locked securely and maintain zero as compared to first generation US mounts. The scope in this kit is the Israeli ""NIMROD"" 6X40 with range finding reticle and bullet drop compensator for the US M118 Match Ammunition. The IDF did not bed the actions like our M21 rifles. This stock could easily be bedded to your rifle or left original. Springfield Armory built rifles with these parts. If you do an internet search you can find info on these rifles. I saw pictures were the stocks had been painted with krinkle coat paint and looked very good. The stock is good condition as is. The Harris bipod { not an import copy] is in good condition. The scope mount is in good condition. It has integral 26MM rings. The scope is in good condition with good optics. There are some nicks in the paint. I have not test ed the scope. From what I have read they are a hardy scope built for military service. The Kahles ZF 69 6X42 was also used by the IDF. No FFL required as listing is for parts only. Us sales to US citizens and buyer must insure you can legally own these parts. Thanks for checking this listing. Insured shipping will be $20.00 for CONUS."

he 93R17 rifles has the AccuTrigger, a revolutionary design that will forever change the way shooters expect triggers to function. The AccuTrigger gives the shooter the flexibility to set the trigger pull to individual preference without have to pay a gunsmith to adjust it. Also, even when adjusted to its lowest setting, the AccuTrigger is completely safe and cannot accidentally discharge during normal use from being jarred or dropped when maintained and adjusted as intended. A newly designed teardrop safety is an additional feature on rifles with the AccuTrigger. It provides for better acquisition of the safety button and operates more smoothly and quietly. Enhanced accuracy is another benefit of the Savage AccuTrigger, is the crisp, clean light trigger pull allows the shooter to maximize the accuracy potential of the rifle.
