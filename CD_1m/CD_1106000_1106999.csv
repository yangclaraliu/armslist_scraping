This is a 9mm carbine that was imported and converted by TNW.  The barrel shroud and barrel remove with the simple turning of a latch and rotation of the two pieces.  This makes cleaning a breeze.

Included with the rifle are two stick magazines.  These each hold 36 rounds.  I am also including three drum magazines that each hold 71 rounds.  I also have two pouches that hold the drum magazines nicely. 

This thing is a tad on the heavy side compared to modern rifles, but it has the recoil of a .22 and is a blast to shoot.  I have only put about 50 rounds down the pipe on this one.

Based on the Finnish Military Rifle, this is a historic rebuild of the Finnish M31 Suomi. Designed by Aimo Johannes Lahti in the late 1920s, the Suomi was instrumental in defending Finland against the Soviet invasion during the Winter War of 1939-40 and Continuation War from 1941-44.

Features a new US made 16.25in barrel, parkerized finish, and a wooden stock. The firearm is made from a mix of original used Finnish parts, and new US made parts.

Price is OBO, but is fairly firm.  I am open to trades plus cash as well.  FOID related trades only please.

Chambered for the 9x19mm cartridge, the VP70 was the first commercially available handgun with a polymer frame, predating the more successful Glock 17 by over a decade. The VP70 came in two variants, the VP70Z and VP70M. The VP70Z was a civilian model that could only fire in semiautomatic mode. The VP70M was made for military forces and had a three-round burst fire mode, as well as a detachable butt stock. Production ended in 1989 and the VP70 was later replaced by the USP in the early 1990s. The pistol comes in a H&K box (not original box) and comes with seven 18 round original magazines. It will also come with a reduced pull trigger spring that reduces the pull by approx 5 lbs"

Walther PPQ, 9mm
4 months old. Excellent condition!!
Additional pics on request.
Comes with all paperwork in box. 
TWO - 15 Round Mags
If you are looking at this, then you KNOW that this is fast becomming a collectors item.
These were only made for 2 years and have absolutely THE BEST TRIGGER of the polymer framed pistols. In addition to a clean crisp trigger, these have a very short reset trigger for fast repeat shots. The grip is amazing, and has 3 different size backstraps, if you think a CZ feels good in the hand - you should feel one of these !!
These were hard to come by before they discontinued, now they will only get more difficult to find as you will not find these on the shelves any more.

The ONLY TRADE I might consider working out would be STI Trojan 9mm , STI Guardian 45, Dan Wesson BOB style commander 45 or CZ Shadow SP01 9mm.

Chambered for the 9x19mm cartridge, the VP70 was the first commercially available handgun with a polymer frame, predating the more successful Glock 17 by over a decade. The VP70 came in two variants, the VP70Z and VP70M. The VP70Z was a civilian model that could only fire in semiautomatic mode. The VP70M was made for military forces and had a three-round burst fire mode, as well as a detachable butt stock. Production ended in 1989 and the VP70 was later replaced by the USP in the early 1990s. The pistol comes in a H&K box (not original box) and comes with seven 18 round original magazines. It will also come with a reduced pull trigger spring that reduces the pull by approx 5 lbs"

**Please note---this is a KCI (Korean) copy of the Beta C, not the real thing---supposedly they work pretty well, but I don't want anybody confused about what they're getting.  Real Betas are going for around $600 so this is a bargain in today's environment.  Also, the rifle and ammo in the pics is NOT included in the sale LOL!"

This is not your DPMS or Carbon-15 AR15. The fit and finish of this gun is incredible and the accuracy and dependability is proven. Offical AR15 of the DEA and many other law enforcement agencies. Must have ID and or CHL. No expenses have been saved making this AR15 my own. I am the original owner purchasing it new with around 500 Rounds down the barrel. Very accurate and comfortable gun to shoot, this is the perfect mid-range AR15 with QUALITY add-on's."
