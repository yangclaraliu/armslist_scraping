This energy is optimized through mass weight retention, a top-secret tip-skiving process and superior bullet integrity. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

This gun is a late model, manufactured in 1975, making it one of the highest-quality and most reliable Commandos out there. It uses 30-round M3 Grease Gun mags, which are still cheap and plentiful on GunBroker - much cheaper than actual Thompson 20-round stick mags. The receiver, 16-inch barrel, compensator, and magazine have been recently refinished in DuPont Teflon black at a cost of $250, and look excellent. It also has the highly-desirable vertical foregrip. It has been thoroughly cleaned and lubed, and only 5 rounds have been fired since the refinish to ensure proper function. 

I am also including a spare lower receiver, which I had planned to refinish and convert to use a genuine Thompson wooden handgrip and trigger, as well as the mechanism required to convert the stock to a push-button release, again emulating a genuine Thompson. The wooden buttstock can be easily removed with two screws, and the gun is quite fun to shoot without the stock. I am also including two spare firing pins and two firing pin springs, very hard-to-get parts when you need them, and a spare ejector, ejector pin, and ejector spring. It has the rock-solid feel and fun of a Thompson to shoot, at a significantly lower cost. 

33rd-edition of the Blue Book of Gun Values places the value of this rifle in good condition at $825, which does not include the spare parts (firing pins are $25 each). I am willing to accept offers in the neighborhood of $725. Full and partial trade offers will be considered, but I am most in need of the cash. As much as I don't want to admit it, it may not be possible to sell this gun (or mag) without a costly FFL transfer in Colorado soon, so this is a good opportunity to pick this gun up before that nonsense goes into effect. 

I am in need of funds quickly, so I would like to sell this today or tomorrow. For this reason, please call me on my cell phone at 720-987-4060 to arrange a meeting."

I have a numbers matching norinco SKS that I'm an looking to sell. It's got a factory 30rd magazine/clip. Runs great, cycles awesome, never had so much as a hiccup. It's completely stock beside the aftermarket 'tech sight' that I added. It's a wonderful looking and performing rifle. It's chambered in 7.63x39 which as you all know is the same as an AK-47. I was going to add a ""tactical"" stock to it with a pistol grip, but I'm not going to get around to it. Basically if one were to do that, you'd just about have an AK with a much more robust reciever. Please e-mail me if you're interested. I'm looking to get $550 for it. Thanks for looking. I'm interested in a FACE TO FACE deal only... Not really looking to drive too far from the northwest suburbs. Also, not particularly interested in and trades... FTF only. Would like to sell today."

292,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1113292,For Sale:  AR15 Familiarization Course,"Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States",$ 65,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 20, 2013",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This course is for those who have bought an AR15 (or any other AR-type rifle), but know nothing on how to use it or maintain it. Per my time in the US Marine Corps I will be more than happy to teach you how to effectively and safely use your AR, as well as how to properly maintain it.
The course will go as long as needed by the individual student (up to 8 hours), and covers the following in order:
1) Nomenclature, fieldstripping, and proper maintenance procedures
2) Effective ranges, sight usage, and proper shooting fundamentals as well as combat mindset
3) Basic hand to hand combat techniques and dealing with jams
4) Legalities
5) Live fire practical application (optional)

By the end of this course you should be able to: field strip, clean, and lubricate your AR; properly use iron sights and other optics; use proper shooting fundamentals and techniques to fire with accuracy; know and perform basic hand to hand techniques using your AR; basic techniques to deal with jams; have an idea of your combat mindset and levels of force; and much more!

PLEASE READ! Do note that while I am offering this course I will screen any and all potential students beforehand, and if I do not feel warm and fuzzy with teaching any student: I have the right to refuse to teach that student this course! This is effective from the prescreening to any time in the course. Teaching bad guys isn't my style; never was and never will be. 
This course is made especially for those who intend to use their ARs as a home/self defense tool as well as a fun gun to plink with at the local range.


Since I am also a full-time college student the best day that I can do classes is on Sundays. I cannot do any live-fire during the course until a local range opens up on the weekends again which likely won't be for another month or two. Until then I'm open to doing the course without live fire. Also: ammunition is to be paid for at your own expense, especially if it's an oddball caliber (6.5 Grendel for instance). AR15 ammo in general (5.56mm and .223 Rem) is pretty hard to find and between my college schedule and everything else I do I simply don't have the time to go find ammunition for you (however I can provide online sources where I've last seen ammo for under $1 per round). I apologize for this and hopefully things will get better and ammo availability will be somewhat back to normal in the future without gouged prices."

I love it, but it's my only .38. Not looking to spend more money on a caliber I have next to nothing of.  Not a scratch on it and smooth action, hardly no kick back.

This is over $800 in extras. If you want to purchase my rifle, I'm looking to get $3500 for it. Willing to negotiate. If you can't afford it, I'm willing to sell just the rifle alone plus 2 mags, no attachments, no ammo for $2800.

Haven't seen another FS2000 at Bills, Frontiersman, Gander, Cabelas or any other shops around here. You can always purchase one from out of state and that's IF the seller is willing to even ship it to YOU! Then you can go through the hoops of acquiring it through your FFL and then deal with the new gun policies being implemented. Good luck. 

I'm in no rush to get rid of my rifle. Just don't have time to enjoy it at the range due to kids. I'd rather trade it for something my family can enjoy.

*This is a NEW, NEVER FIRED, Glock 23 Gen 3 in FDE (LITERALLY)...as in it still has the gold factory lube. I have not shot or chambered any rounds other than what was shot at the Glock Factory. The collection date on spent shell casing is 9-11-12. This Glock is equipped with a brand new pair of Trijicon night sights professionally installed and laser aligned in standard 3 dot green, and date stamped 2012 on the sights. Included with the G23 are two 13-round magazines, speed loader, bore brush and rod, and manuals.

! ! ! PLEASE READ ! ! ! 

I am not in a hurry to sell or trade this G23. I know there is a lot of controversy over currently and previously listed Glocks on sites like these due to them being in the $700+ range. I agree, and know that I can pick up a new standard black Glock virtually anywhere new in the $500's range if I wanted to...I am only looking to recover money spent. Again, this is not a ""LNIB"" that has had several hundred rounds through it. It is truly brand new, with no rounds down the pipe as if you had just purchased it from your local dealer, so I cannot justify selling it for any less. If the price is too high for your preference, please just move on. No low balling.

It's inexpensive enough to take it to the range and blow through a few hundred rounds and lethal enough to carry it with you when you exit the range into the masses.  This is a great benefit in itself.  No longer will you worry about a potential feed or ejection issue because the price allows you to know exactly how and where your 45 is going to shoot in the event of an encounter.  This is brass cased and reloadable.  Extremely reliable priming and a great feeding round.

It's a short bed regular cab, truck is in great condition and drives really well. The truck always starts and runs great. It drives straight down the road and brakes as it should. Truck has great power. This truck is my daily driver and is rarely used as a truck. It is well taken care of and always been well loved. The truck is proudly displaying 214.xxx miles. 4x4 works great but takes a couple seconds to activate, Seat is in great condition but it does have a minor rip in it. Both passenger and drivers side door jam switches are worn out but that only mean that the interior lights don't always come on. The dash has a light out, one of the cargo lights is out, one of the reverse lights is out, one of the tag lights is out, and one of the side marker lights is out. Heat works great but the A/C needs to be charged. The truck leaks a small amount of coolant, I fill it up every three weeks or so but I think it is just the water pump. The front and rear bumpers both have minor damage. The latch for the sliding rear window is broken but the window still stays closed, the truck has a newer radio with Ipod/Mp3 hookup. It has 32/11.50/15 Bfg tires. It has Very nice Eagle Alloys black wheels with chrome center caps, lug nuts and valve stem covers. Truck has dual flowmaster exhaust and bed mat. Overall it is in great shape. That is the most honest review that I can give, even though the truck needs a few small things it is a beautiful truck and is something that you can be very proud of. Make me a cash offer and we will work something out. If you are seriously interested in the truck then please do not hesitate to ask me any questions. Send me an email or text 828- seven - seven - eight - 4889.

The bore is bright and shiny, and it has the side-plate replacement to take a scope mount---I have a brand-new one available for an additional charge at my cost ($39), it's never been installed and is still in the plastic.  I will offer this gun for sale with 2 20rd magazines---I have more available as well as some 30 rd mags, so if you want to work something else out let me know.  One unusual thing about this rifle is that it has the police-issue V rear sight as opposed to the more usual rear peep sight---I'm not the original owner so I don't know if it came this way from the factory or if somebody changed it after buying, but it's a Ruger sight and it's more unusual than the normal peep, so I take it as an extra, not a detractor---according to Ruger, only by special order or a few police agencies did this sight get shipped as factory original.

As listed I want $1200 cash, or I'd be interested in trades for other slightly unusual/not everyday guns in great shape.  If you want to talk about other mags, etc please send me an offer, but don't waste my time with lowballs---regular wood stock Minis are bringing over $1000 now, and this is a lot more collectible, a lot cooler and a lot more fun to shoot and show you friends!"

Trijicon TR222G Accupoint 2.5-10x 56mm 37.6-10.1ft@100yds 30mm Tube Blk Mil-Dot

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

Now I know how these things looked fresh out of the factory! Absolutely no cosmoline on the rifle but just a light coat of oil. Only the oil can has cosmoline on it but the tools do not. I am not saying that it was never fired but it appears unfired because of the condition of the bolt. It is like brand new and the barrel rifling it the best I have ever seen.  The metal is perfect, stock is great condition and all matching serial numbers.  In my opinion will never find an M44 in better condition, except for the other one I have. LOL 

Includes folding bayonet, tool kit with pouch and oiler. Also a small book all in Russian, which appears to be the inspection book when this was removed from storage and has the serial number of the rifle in it.

MUST PRESENT A VALID ID AND MUST BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A HANDGUN LEGALLY IN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA.

This pistol is in excellent condition with only 76 rounds fired. There is a tiny scratch on the end of the recoil spring guide pin. Comes complete with the case and all original components. Also comes with two flat magazine floor plates to change out with the originals as desired.

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floor plates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

    Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame

Old brass military surplus ammo, mixed headstamps, loose in ammo cans. Not bright and shiny, not sorted, not new, but it all goes bang. Mostly 1980's headstamps from a variety of exotic places, none of which you would ever want to visit. Brass cases, and the ammo was imported long enough ago that magnets stick to some of the bullets, not to others, for those of you that are interested in such things and what that might mean. Have fun sorting.
 You want to sit down and sort all of it by type and polish it, feel free. At this cheap of price, I am not doing it for you. Probably be well worth it, make some money at the next gun show bagging them up in matched lots. Not for me though. I just shoot it as-is because I have never had a failure to fire, no SKS or AK I have run it through particularly cares its from mixed lots. Boxes it came in were happily marked 'non-corrosive'. Considering its a bunch of different stuff and the boxes looked homemade, I take that with a grain of salt, though so far it seems to shoot clean enough that it probably actually is.

 Well, there you have it. Old random ammo. Couple thousand rounds worth. What will you give me for it? Can take whatever amount - a hundred or all of it, will trade as well for the right firearms.

Brand new in box! Up for sale is one Smith and Wesson M&P 15 .223/5.56 AR-15/M4 with Adjustable Post/Adjustable dual apperature Military style sights.

This rifle comes with three (3) PMAG 30s!  (It normally comes with one, but I'm throwing in 2 more!!)

It is brand new and comes in original factory box with gun lock, plastic chamber safey tool, and owner's manual.

Price is $1400 firm.  Cash, Certified checks and USPS money orders are accepted.
(***I'd also consider a trade for an M1A Springfield 308 in excellent condition***)

For cost comparison purposes:  The NORMAL MSRP on this model is $1249.  Recently I've seen a couple cheaper versions like the M&P Optics Ready sell for $1400 within a 36 hours of listing here in Stafford/Fredericksburg and those models do not have any sights.  The M&P Optics Ready would NORMALLY retail for $200 less with an MSRP of $1,069.  If you're comparing rifles also remember that the M&P ""Sport"" is the less expensive, entry level weapon with doesn't have a forward assist, ejection port door (dust cover) or chrome-lined barrel.

I live in North Stafford.  Call me risk adverse, but I will only sell this to someone through an FFL with officical background check. (I know the law allows me to sell direct to a VA resident with proper IDs, but I'm not interested in inadvertantly selling to a felon or other unauthorized person).  Because of this I will meet you at the FFL of your choice (I know several) within 20 miles of I95 exit 140 and I WILL PAY FOR YOUR BACKGROUND CHECK AND THE TRANSFER FEE IF YOU ARE APPROVED (If you're not approved I don't pay...for a ""delay status"" we will figure it out). Thanks for the understanding!
