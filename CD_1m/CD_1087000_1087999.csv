It's like new in box. Comes with the original box, all original paperwork, and one magazine. I believe I even have a box of .25 ammo I'd include. It's a stainless model with simulated pearl grips.

I was the first person to fire a round through it. I've fired one box of 50 through it. The very first shot, the grip on the left side cracked, but it looks to be easily repairable. It's a small crack at the grip screw. From a Google search, I hear it was a common thing with these pistols. There's a set of original grips on Ebay for cheap, if a person wanted to go that route.

This is a very collectible pistol. You just don't see them become available very often. It's an exact copy of the legendary Baby Browning. It would make an excellent purse gun for someones wife, or a pocket pistol to carry around your property, as it's very small. 

A FOID will be required and a bill of sale of the transaction will need to be signed. All Illinois laws will be followed and the standard waiting period applies to this sale.

It's much nicer than it looks in these crappy pictures."

This rifle is in excellent shape mechanically and the function is flawless.. The stock had a few rubs, marks and dings, so I sprayed it with a very light coat of automotive black finish. It turned out looking new, but you can still see the marks, they're just all black now. I did no refinishing on the metal. It was cleaned and wiped with an oily rag. That's all.

This is the last of my Wilson's I'm going to move to accommodate some new guns that just finished being made. This is one I didn't want to part with but I've got to drum up some cash. This is a Wilson Combat Stealth (SDS) in .45ACP that was built in 10/2011. Even though this gun was built in 2011 it was purchased from Indiana Gun Club and has only be fired 65 times. I fired approx. 50 WWB and 15 Federal HSTs through it before it was retired in the safe. It's never been carried and has been a safe queen. This gun is all steel and the combination with the heavy coned flanged cone barrel makes this gun incredible to shoot. The recoil is very reduced for a compact 4' 1911. This gun shows absolutely no wear with the exception of a tiny, tiny spot on the ejection port. These guns are rare to find and only a handful per year are built per year from my understanding, most of the time they come up for sale they sale over MSRP. This gun comes with all of the original paperwork including the test target, build sheet, dog tag, bag etc. 

MSRP on these guns are 3535.00. 

Looking for $2900 + 50.00 (if required and not FTF) for shipping to your FFL from an individual so please ensure that your FFL will accept from me. Also, please no ban states."

This shotgun is New and in the original factory box, never been fired, oiled and ready to go and it must be seen to appreciate.  Not a dealer so there is no registration fees, no tax and no wait.  This is the perfect home defense weapon.  If the sound of you cocking it doesn't stop them then ta blast of buck shot will.  This gun is the minimum legal length and very maneuverable for home defense.  4 rounds in the tube and 1 in the barrel should keep you from missing any target.  It should be one blast and the fight is over.  Here are some of the specs on this weapon.  The grips are perfect and the pattern makes it easy to hold with a short easy stroke on the pump action.  A gun that every household should have.  Buy it now, it won't last long.

H&R's home-defense model rigged with an 18 ½"" cylinder bore barrel for quick maneuvering in tight quarters. Offered in a plain black synthetic stock. It has a grooved fore-end with sling swivel studs installed. Comes in 12 gauge with a 2 ¾"" and 3"" chamber.

It has the carry handle and a 6 position adjustable stock.  It comes with the stock OEM 10 round magazine in addition to (4) genuine Mossberg 25 round magazines.

I ran about 50 to 100 rounds through the gun using the 10 round magazine before I bought the high capacity magazines.  I also ran one full magazine from each of the 25 rounders through it last time we went out.  

This gun was purchased for my kids to have fun with instead of having them shoot the real AR15 at 40 to 50 cents per round (now it is getting closer to $1 a round).  The .22 ammo for this gun goes for 4 to 7 cents a round.  But since it is so hard to find any ammo these days, I will throw in 650 rounds to get you started.

So, here is what you get:

1. Mossberg 715t AR style rifle with carry handle sight
2. (1) Mossberg 10 round magazine
3. (4) Mossberg 25 round magazines
4. Speed loader
5. Cable lock
6. 650 rounds of .22 ammo

Before I get the crazy questions, NO it is a not a Type 1 or 2 GI or SA made NM garand, if it was it would be a ALOT higher. I had this gun built about 22 years ago while I was in the USMC stationed at Quantico, VA. It was built in the USMC Precision Weapons shop by a 2112 Master Gunny who built M14s for the USMC Rifle Team and had built M1s for the team before that. It is a quality built gun and shoots MOA with LC ammo if you do your end. The gun is n really nice shape as can be seen in the pictures. The receiver is SA, the barrel is 65 SA that gauges 0.5 on the throat and 1 at the muzzle, NEW and is perfect and shinny. The barrel was new in the tube when it was put on, and I have only shot about 400-500 rounds through it. The bolt is an SA and was picked out of about 20 bolts to give the tightest, but still in spec, headspace on USGI match headspace gauges. The gas port is great and the contact area of the barrel with the gas cylinder has been splined/grooved in a super professional looking way to assure that the gas cylinder has a tight fit, which it does. No rattling which really helps the accuracy, takes a rubber mallet to tap into place. The gas cylinder lock is timed right for a prefect tight fit to hold on the gas cylinder tight. It has a NM operating rod that is in great shape. It has a USMC rifle team spec NM front sight that they made in the Precision Weapons shop. The front handguards are NM unitized for accuracy and no rattling. The stock is glass bedded at the receiver and on the bottom trigger guard. Both the receiver and the trigger group are a TIGHT and perfect fit, big help to accuracy. It has a NM trigger job and is smooth and clean. Only thing I did not NM was the rear sight, as they were hard to find then and I would not use one of the cheap commercial copies you see out now, also with my glasses the NM peep was to small, I needed the standard. Finish is original Usgi.  This gun is great, but I am moving and could use the money. Comes with a 400 round can of USGI LC 3006 Match ammo, this alone is worth about $500 and a nice leather NM sling. I need no trades. I am asking $1,600 with ammo and sling.  I will meet FTF at Basspro in the city, Academy in Edmond, Dicks in Edmond or halfway at the Mcdonalds on the Turnpike for you Tulsa guys.   For the gun alone $1200.

The Advanced M26 Series TASER® is one of the most effective non-lethal weapons available today. Using Electro-Muscular Disruption technology, the TASER® has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun. The M18 shoots 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire. 50,000 volts travel over the wires and over-ride the central nervous system of the attacker. The electric current is released in a pre-timed sequence to make sure the assailant is unable to recover quickly enough to remove the darts.




Product Review - Advanced Taser M26

By Sgt. Charles ""Yoda"" Humes, Jr.
Toledo Police Department, Ohio

If you’re like me, you’ve watched countless Star Trek reruns and witnessed their ""phasers"" (set on stun, of course), harmlessly subdue the bad guy. He falls like a sack of potatoes, instantly incapacitated; but completely unharmed. If you’re like me, you’ve often thought of how great it would have been to actually have such a device in your last violent encounter.

Unfortunately, current technology isn’t quite there yet. However, it’s extremely close, and deserves serious consideration by all law enforcement agencies. I recently attended an instructor’s school that impressed me more than any other school I’ve ever attended. I do not give such an endorsement lightly, nor does it come without a great deal of experience to back it up. When it comes to the police use of force and the Martial Arts, I’ve been around the block. I’ve been either Instructor, or Trainer of Instructors certified, in most of the law enforcement self-defense/subject control systems available. In my younger years, I was certified as a Black Belt Instructor in three different styles of Karate, and I dabbled in several others Karate systems as well as Akido, Judo, and jiu-jitsu.

During my training, I‘ve always been a ""show me, don’t tell me how effective this is"" type of student. I’ve been knocked down, knocked out, choked out, punched, kicked, and body slammed. I’ve been thrown, pulled, pushed, tear gassed, maced, paintballed and hit with just about every known strike, joint lock, and non-lethal weapon known to man. I‘m also what you would categorize as a very goal oriented combatant. I can fight through the effects of mace and tear gas with enough gusto to be a serious problem, if I was on the other side of the law.

When Hans Marrero and the folks from Taser International showed up for an instructor’s certification school on that cold January morning, I went in with the ""show me"" person attitude. When Hans asked the class if anyone wanted to be shot with the M26 Taser and take the full ""ride."" Only my hand and three or four other ""show me’s"" hands went up out of a class of about thirty officers.

I wanted to see the full and complete effects of the M26 Taser. I took my shirt off to expose bare skin and was shot in the back with it. From a distance of about 12 –15 feet, one dart hit me in the upper shoulder, the other landed right on my belt line.

It’s an amazing experience. I really thought I was going to able to fight the M26 Taser’s effects at least momentarily, as I’ve been able to do to other less-lethal toys. I got into my best, most aggressive mindset possible, and Hans fired. It was like standing on the beach expecting to get struck in the face with a pail of water from your young offspring, and then getting hit by a Tsunami Tidal wave that blows you right off of the beach.

The M26 Taser floods your body with electrical impulses that are almost identical to the impulses sent by your own brain that generates movement in your muscles. While the brain sends specific impulses for specific muscles to move, the M26 Taser sends out a general signal telling every muscle to move at once. The result is, for lack of a better description; almost all of your muscles simultaneously contract against each other. Your body locks up almost instantly, you go down to the ground with inappreciable damage, and you are no longer a threat to anyone. I have never, ever, experienced such complete, instant incapacitation as being hit with the M26 Taser.

After the M26 Taser ran its' full five-second cycle, everything was fine. Other than a minor blister from one of the probes on my bare skin, which healed just fine; and some temporary muscle soreness from my muscle’s sudden contractions, I suffered no other ill effects. When compared to the serious injures a baton, a sap, or even a punch can inflict, this is definitely a logical and court defendable tradeoff. If I had kept my shirt on, the blister would not have occurred.

Taser International has a very informative website includes in-depth technical and medical information, as well as numerous videos of actual field uses of the M26 Taser. I would encourage all law enforcement officers and agencies to take a serious look at this incredible control tool. It can prevent countless injuries to officers and suspects, as well as mountains of paperwork and years of litigation. I wholeheartedly give it my highest possible recommendation."

This pistol has properly matching serial numbered parts (frame, slide and barrel) and is NOT import marked. The major components are all marked with a ""circled H"" proof indicating Belgian military inspection/acceptance. This pistol features the Type I 500-meter tangent rear sight, of the type used when the pistol was originally issued with the detachable board stock which attached to the slotted back strap. The barrel has the ""square cam"" profile which was introduced in 1938. Overall condition is very good and much of the original factory blue finish remains. There is some scattered surface rust and a small amount of light pitting at the muzzle. The grips are the original/correct type...checkered French walnut with red painted backs. The grips show some wear including an abrasion to the checkering at the top of the right panel. Mechanically excellent with a bore that rates about ""very good"" with strong/sharp rifling that is mostly bright but showing light frost in the grooves. Neither of the 13-round magazines are period correct/original...both having black plastic followers. The pistol comes with a WWII era Nazi marked brown leather holster that is in good condition but with a few loose stitches at the belt loop and flap closure. This pistol was likely manufactured in about 1939 and subsequently captured by the German forces that invaded Belgium in 1940. This is in a good condition am selling because i need money urgently for a personal reason."

It had been and still is (in more or less modified form) manufactured in dozens of countries, and used in hundreds of countries and conflicts since its introduction. The total number of the AK-type rifles made worldwide during the last 60 years is estimated at 90+ millions. This is a true legendary weapon, known for its extreme ruggedness, simplicity of operation and maintenance, and unsurpassed reliability even in worst conditions possible. It is used not only as a military weapon, but also as a platform for numerous sporting civilian rifles and shotguns (see   Saiga semiautomatic shotguns, for example). The AK is an amalgam of previously known features and solutions, combined in the most effective way. The effectiveness, however, depends on the criteria used to measure it, and the key criteria for any and every Soviet and Russian military arm are: Reliability, Simplicity of operation and maintenance, Suitability for mass production. There never was any significant demand for good ergonomics or superb accuracy, though."

The M&P-15 was a hard weapon to find prior to the weapons run that has been going on the past couple of months, now its even harder, so here is your chance.  I sat on a waiting list for this items for almost 3 months; the only reason I am selling it is I came across a Colt optics AR that I want to keep, so I do not need this.  Smith raised their prices in the past month or two; so between what I paid for it, tax, the cash I had tied up while on the waiting list, and traveling clear across town to facilitate the sale, I am selling it for just about what I have into it.  Great chance to pick up a hard to find Smith AR at a good price.

This isnt the sport model, this is the full AR; forward assist, ejection port cover

SKS, commerical grade with very few rounds down the tube. Excellent condition.
These are much better than AK47's with their cheap production methods.  The SKS has a milled receiver not sheet metal stamped, pinned barrels, and simple dis-assembly for cleaning. 
I know from Nam the VC never worried about dirt in their weapons like we did w/ M16's.

This SKS has a factory scope mount, gunsmith installed compensator for recoil reduction, 30 round mag., and poly stock.  The recoil is light enough for a small woman or pre-teen. 
The perfect weapon for home defense, hunting, or plinking for fun.  Ammo is still available and a lot cheaper than .223.  I also have some ammo that can be added to the deal.
Sell for $650 or reasonable offer.  Only reason for selling is to fund new project."

It comes with a side-mount scope rail, and a top-mount rail (have to remove the rear peep sight to mount it), the original 5 round magazine, a 30 round magazine, and a brand new box of 100 rounds of Remington .223 (not the cheap TulAmmo everyone else is trying to sell).  I don't want to sell it, but the wife won't let me buy another rifle until I get rid of one.  This fires flawlessly and accurately (unlike the earlier Mini 14's which had accuracy issues), and ejects brass to the side, not up like earlier models, so it won't ding your scope or accessories.  Please, no low-ball offers, or e-mails asking if I still have it for sale - if it's posted, I still have it.  I'm ready to sell this now but I'm not desperate to sell it, so remember there's a difference between negotiating and throwing out an obscenely low price.  I may consider trades for an AK or AR, but cash talks loudest.  I may be willing to travel a little distance for a good offer or if you're coming from far away."

May trade towards a .223 AR,.223 AK rifle, or a Ruger Mini-14 (Will pay difference depending on how much your asking for the rifle) And depending on the condition of the Glock or what extras you may have with it, I may include cash with the trade.

Keep in mind that gun hoarders now have an interest in keeping prices high and will do so by spreading misinformation. High prices are doing more to keep guns out of the hands of everyday hard working honest law abiding citizens than  anything the lib-dems can do. It is shameful. One last thing...for every gun/ammo purchase I make, i calculate 10% of that sale and donate that money to NRA...they are on the front lines fighting for  the 2nd Amendment and against gun control for all of us...even non-members.

Beginning of copied text:
How many ads have the words ""Get em' before they are banned"" or ""On the Ban List"" while trying to use fear mongering as justification for selling $10 magazines for $60+ or $500 rifles for $2,000 or more?Now don't get me wrong I am not against somebody trying to make a few bucks but some of these listings are getting ridiculous and since most people are more worried about profiteering on the big gun ban scare (refer back to 08' when Obama first got elected and after his re-election then the Newtown incident) than actually being proactive in fighting for our rights. Well here is a little tid bit that anybody posting these type of comments on their posts either doesn't know or they do not want you to know if they do know..Dianne Feinstein's Draconian ""Assault Weapons"" ban is so ludicrous she HAS NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO GET ENOUGH SUPPORT FROM HER FELLOW DEMOCRATS TO GET IT THROUGH..And there is the often repeated statement ""well if it doesn't pass then Obama will just sign an Executive Order""..Yeah, okay and if he does that there will be another war on American soil and if that happens no amount of AR-15's or AK-47's are going to be able to protect you from a drone,air strike,or a tank or other heavy armor/artillery and if you are so worried about the Government coming to take your guns then why are you buying them in the first place? There are to many Sheriff's,Politicians, and other figures holding true to the oath's they swore when taking their office and stating outright they WILL NOT ENFORCE ANY UNCONSTITUTIONAL GUN LAWS/BANS especially those signed by Executive Order and any Federal Agents trying to enforce such laws in their states will be arrested and put on trial so there is still hope.The reason prices are the way they are right now is because people are scared and think the Government is coming for their guns and this is nothing new. Communist sympathizers within our Government have wanted the American public disarmed for much longer than most people realize and absolutely hate the Constitution and everything it stands for. But ask yourself this. If they come for your guns what are you going to do? How many of you are organized or are proactive with groups like Oath Keepers, etc? If everybody would calm down and stop buying everything they can and paying ridiculous prices on items that can be had for way less if you do enough searching and hoarding ammo/mags etc. then the companies would be able to manufacture and restock faster and you could be buying your ammo,firearms,mags and accessories for a lot cheaper than can be had on here and still make the weekend trips to the gun range without breaking the bank..Calm down people and let off the panic button a little..It will benefit all of us..Unless you like paying a $1 or more per round of 5.56 or paying $30 for a $5 box of 7.62x39"
