In addition to the C.R.O.S., DeSomma (founder of POF) implemented a two-piece Moular Railed Receiver (M.R.R.) with an oversized heat-sink barrel nut on the P415. Theses two systems  dissipate heat away from the working parts of the gun reducing the main cause for malfunctions—heat.       Everything in the photos is included in this premium AR package-  Viktor stock, Ergo grip, Bushnell red dot optic (sighted in) over a UTG riser, tactical rail mounted flashlight, 8 pMag 30rnd magazines with window, Grip-pod bipod w/ military grade steel, Troy sling and soft carrying case.

The top of Savage's line of firearms. 26"" fluted stainless steel barrel, stainless steel receiver, Accu-trigger, oversized bolt handle, Laminated stock with beaver-tail forend. 

I have put about 50 rounds through it. It is clean and the metal finish is flawless. The stock is flawless except for a 3/16"" X 1/32"" dent in the underside of the wrist (where your fingers wrap around). The owners manual and trigger adjustment tool are included. I do not have the box. If you want the lock that came with it, I'll throw that in too.

The 12 currently is sporting a Seals 8-32 X 50 mm, 30mm tube scope with red & blue illuminated range finding reticle, side focus (parallax adjustment) and target knobs (1/8"" adjustments). It's mounted with Leupold standard rings and bases. The rifle is zeroed for 100 yds. It is capable of shooting sub - 1/2"" groups repeatedly. I know, I've seen me do it...

New, this rifle sold for $1100.00 retail. The scope sells for $450.00. Ring and bases retail at around $80.00. That would be a $1630 investment. If you'd like it as is, with the optics, the price is $1100.00. If you'd prefer to mount your own optics, the price would be $750.00 for the rifle alone. Shipping is $35.00 (It's heavy!)."

I thought this was a community of ""friends"" selling trading and swapping but its turned more into the ""craigslist"" of guns. Iv turned my back on MANY shops and people because of gouging prices.

Original buyer bought the rifle and a case of Lake City 5.56 XM855 together and only fired a few rounds from the case. I counted all the rounds and it adds up to 986 putting the round count at 14 (approximate). Add to all this ten (10) brand new Brownells metal 30 round magazines still in the original plastic. This is a sweet deal. Yes the photos only show five Brownells magazines but the deal is for ten (10) Brownells magazines.

For more photos or questions email me and I will try to get back to you as fast as I can.

Buyer is responsible for the rules and regulations for their area. Check with your FFL to make sure you can own this rifle. Will only ship to an FFL! Still working out the details on shipping but UPS will be the carrier due to the ammunition. Buyer pays shipping.

Dye Witness Chemical Identifier Self-Protection Foam/Spray Brand New In Box FDA Approved Legal In 50 States! An estimated 80% of criminals are never apprehended. When they are, most are not prosecuted due to a lack of evidence and vague descriptions offered by victims and witnesses. The need to prevent an attack and to mark the attacker at the scene of the crime has become increasingly important. The DYEWitness Criminal Identifier is a powerful, aqua-foam solution that temporarily blocks vision to stop a potential attack and dyes the skin green for up to eight days to assist in the identification, arrest and prosecution of the perpetrator. DYEWitness is fast, effective, practical and discreet. The FDA-approved solution contains no harmful chemicals, is non-toxic, requires no permits, and is legal in all 50 states! This spray canister is a variation of mace and was designed for the purpose of identifying and prosecuting assailants who are rebuffed during an attack. It sprays a foaming dark green dye up to 7 feet. It has approximately seven seconds of spray inside it and upon contact foams all over the object it sticks to. The manufacturer claims, ""it will obscure an assailant's vision and assist in the user's ability to escape."" The manufacturer also claims the green foam ""leaves a trail from the scene as well as a green stain on the assailant's skin for up to seven days."" The point is to make the assailant easily identifiable and unable to mingle among others without raising suspicion. The outcome is to allow law enforcement officers to place the assailant at the scene of the crime, which is often one of the most difficult tasks in the criminal prosecution process.

I have a Smith & Wesson 29-3 .44 magnum in mint condition and very low round count. The revolver has a 6"" barrel and two sets of grips, but no box.
I also have a Glock 26 with box and 3 magazines for trade....2 standard base and 1 extension.
I have a SIG P232 that I can sub instead of the Smith or Glock as well.
Not looking for optics, magazines or ammo...just another AR.

The Benelli Performance Shop SuperSport is the ultimate in speed for shooters looking for a fast trap shotgun, competition shotgun, or sporting clays shotgun.  Fine-tuned to achieve outstanding handling characteristics and superior performance, it’s fast and easy to handle with extremely effective patterning. Features lengthened forcing cones for a polished taper between the chamber and barrel that ensures enhanced, consistent patterning and reduces felt recoil. The barrel on the 12-gauge is back-bored to .733 inches to reduce back-pressure. Every SuperSport is fitted with Briley’s EZ bolt release mechanism and an enlarged, ergonomic bolt-operating handle.

The trigger assemblies have been seer-honed for crisp pull and unexcelled performance. Completing the package is a 6-ounce weighted forend cap for greater balance and smoother swing. The Performance Shop SuperSport features Benelli’s proven ComforTech® recoil reduction system with gel recoil pads and comb inserts as well as AirTouch™ checkering on the stock and forend for a firm, slip-resistant grip. Benelli Crio® barrels combined with Briley’s color-coded Spectrum choke tubes yield denser, more uniform shot patterns."

It will also come with the Henry Model Cantilever scope mount. Henry doesn't drill and tap nor do they cut scope grooves in the brass receiver of the Golden Boy, so they make and sell their own scope mount just for this rifle. The scope mount attaches to the top of the barrel by removing the rear site and bolting scope mount to top of barrel with the included screws. It's all new, it's all Henry. I intended on putting a scope on here, that's why I ordered their scope mount. I went through some pictures of Henry Golden Boys with scopes installed and found the scope that looks great on this cowboy rifle...it looks right- so I ordered it. It will likely be here after the rifle is sold. I'll put it on something else I guess. The wood is very dark and is beautiful on this rifle. I have the regular Henry also, the ""blued"" .22 lever rifle and the wood on this Golden model is so much nicer. I have never had anything like this rifle; the lever action is smooth like butter, the brass gleams all over like it's made of gold...it will be hard for someone to shoot it because it is so incredible looking. It came with a velvet ""sock"" wrapped around the brass receiver, Henry shipped it that way. It's a piece of art. It's not cheap, but there's nothing else like it.
I've got $695.00 in it, with the scope mount... I want $600.00 for all of it, to sell it. It is a little tough to find one of these right now. Henry Manufacturing experienced a Hurricane and then a fire at the plant over the last 10 months and production halted. That has made Henry .22's a little hard to get. But either way, I drove for a 5 hour round trip to get this one. Then ordered the scope mount from Henry. All total I've spent 695.00, I need 600.00 of it back or I won't sell it. I need to sell it or at least trade it, but I won't give it away. The pictures are with the Henry scope mount installed. You can see how it sits over top the receiver without touching the receiver. It's ready for a scope. The box for the Henry mount is in the picture too. I will take the mount off if you want...and put the site back on if you like. Or leave it the way it is and give you the rear site in a ziplock. However you like. Email if you want 10 or so more pictures.
The pics don't do the brass justice...not at all. It's perfect. I'll also give you 200 rounds of ammo just in case you have none. Will trade for:
I want cash, but if you can come up with 300.00 - 350.00 in cash, I would think about trading on the rest. I would trade for anything if I liked it. If you want to JUST trade, it has to be something that I just can't say ""no"" to. I'll consider most anything. I bought this rifle for my wife's birthday, it's too big and heavy for her, she is small, so I went right back out and bought the regular ""blued"" Henry .22 just 4 days later. Which she can handle better. This one has to go, I have too much invested in .22 rifles. I originally posted this for 650.00, then reposted it for 600.00 the next day because I don't want it to take long to sell. I bought her another Henry, so now I've got 700.00 just sitting here in a box, I'd like to convert it to something else."

The receiver has been fully engraved by the late master engraver Virgil Graham, Jr. of Savannah, Ga.

Should be able to see in the picture all the information you need. There is a Box of GoldDots on the top and the green boxes are frangibles. Any other questions, feel free to ask. I'm not trying to make a profit I'm just liquidating all the calibers I don't shoot anymore. 

I would be willing to trade one for one on 9mm even though I'd be trading down(unless its steel than that would be a negative)



Sticker was average of $35 per box of 50(GoldDots were $45)and $50 for the 100 round boxes.

So basicly what I paid except you don't have to pay sales tax on it. If you want to purchase all of it at once I will make you a little bit better deal. I can meet in South Austin near the Airport but prefer to meet around Bastrop.

Just to review here:



6----50 rnd boxes at $35 each

1----50 rnd box GoldDots at $45 each

3----100 rnd box at $50 each

Like I said above, if you want all of it I will certainly be willing to make you a deal.

You tell me what it's worth ... make an offer.

This commercial quality bouy washed up on the beach and needs a home. It appears to be marked as a swim area marker but some of lable is warn and I don't know that much about it. I have seen these used near personal docks, and in yards as nautical art. It would be ideal to mark your dock, or swim area to keep other boats away and still has the eyelet on the bottom to connect the anchor rope.

See this web site, you can get the industrial marking film/sticker to make this whatever you want. This picture is from their web site. It is like the tall skinny marker and is self-righting about 4 or 5 feet tall, out of the water.

I just never shoot the shotgun and I love shooting.  I got it for home defense, but always have my 9 or 45 by my bed.  Next the 1911-22 my son shoots but he is 11 and finds it to be too heavy and we are looking to get something lighter.  SR22 or M&P 22 at some point here.  So here is what I have for trade and do not offer me something that does not work back.  These two guns may not be top of the line name but they operate as new and are in top of the line shape.  I have a Mossberg Maverick 88 with 18.5 inch barrel here with only 10 rounds through it.  It has right around $500 dollars out into it trade value including the ammo and the soft case.  The extras on the gun are an ATI length Adjustable & foldable recoil reducing stock & pistol grip, a forend with rails, and a forend grip that also folds.  Also 35 rounds of ammo 5 being slugs and 5 being buck shot for home defense.  I also have the original grip and forend if you ever want to switch back for any reason (hunting etc.) Next I have a Chiappa Puma 1911-22 It has around 500 rounds through it max  if that and comes with two magazines.  It shoots flawless.  it is very accurate, and comes with 200 rounds of 22LR.  I have right around 300 in this with the gun and ammo what I paid.  If you base it on finding 22LR lol who knows what that is worth but all in all I have total over $800 dollars spent here and none of it was over inflated pricing on what I bought. The extras in the Maverick upgrades brought the price up in it.  Call or text REDACTED.  I do have an Ohio CCW and prefer to trade with others who do.  Any trade will require a valid ohio ID, a bill of transfer with serial numbers from my name to yours and your name to mine with OHIO DL numbers on them.  This is for my protection and yours showing we are not trading stolen guns to each other.  Just something to keep for your records and myself.  I do this with any transfer I ever make."

It did come with a wood stock, but swapped it for the synthetic hogue on my other rifle. Also upgraded the barely usable factory sights, still have the originals. Rear sight screws down where rear of scope rail would have. I have a cut down rail on the front mounting point, had a red dot on it. Still have the small screws for the holes. It comes with 5 25 rd hot lips mags. Very little use, bought for my older rifle but the tight match chamber didn't like being fed that fast.
