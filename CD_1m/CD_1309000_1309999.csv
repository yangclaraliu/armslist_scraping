 Product Information

These improved C Products Defense 10-Round AR-15 Magazines feature a 2-Piece Stainless Steel Body that is snapped together and mechanically locked before welding, ensuring a straight-walled, highly consistent product that reliably drops free from variously sized magazine wells and allows for smooth movement of the follower during its travel. The magazines are further enhanced by the use of a Chrome Silicon Spring and Bright Orange Anti-Tilt Follower. The finish is a durable matte black coating that is resistant to the elements and slightly self-lubricating. In addition to being perfect for shooters in states with magazine capacity restrictions or for hunting purposes, the low profile of these 10-round magazines also makes them ideal for use when firing from the prone position.

Awesome home defense weapon holing 30 rounds with fiber optic sights.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

I bought the gun on impulse mainly for the shotgun to shoot snakes with, but I never ended up using it for that. It just sits around so I would rather sell it to someone who will actually use it. I have shot approximately 10 rounds through each barrel. It comes with a little sling i made out of paracord to carry it with. 

Price is $175 FIRM. The gun sells around this price normally for just the shotgun barrel with this style stock. I have both barrels for $175.

ONE INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1 inch Formed Door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength  and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM (patent pending):
The Force Deflector Locking System prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

MAX LOCKING BOLTS:
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. The MAX Locking Bolts found only on the Pro Series line of safes, have up to 12 times more surface area to engage the stout door frame, making them 4 times stronger than traditional bolts.

PRY STOP END BOLTS:
Superior to other bolt designs which allow the locking bolt support bar to bend. Pry-Stop Corner End Bolts are over 2.5 times longer and attach to a high-strength steel angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom locking bolts on the door side secure the critical door corners.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degrees for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever.  This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables.  Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on the Pinnacle Series.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use ½ inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by ½ inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING:
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK STANDARD
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

SECURAM BIOMETRIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The SecuRam Biometric Lock uses the uniqueness of an individual fingerprint as the combination in this advanced security solution. The lock opens with either a fingerprint or a multi-digit code. It is highly secure and operates very quickly. Simple programming instructions. LCD Screen.

Here's a rough list of the high demand ammo they had on the shelf:

-Apprx. 100 boxes of Wolf 7.62 x 39 (20rnd boxes, $6.99)

-3 boxes of .40 (watchdog? watchguard? HD stuff not sure on price)

-Apprx. 40 boxes of .22lr (50rnd boxes, Was federal competition grade stuff for $24.99, yes that's correct  I know it's absolutely absurd but that what is was)

-Apprx. 50 boxes of .17hmr

-Apprx 150 boxes of 7.62x54 (Various brands, boxes of 20 I believe)

-Apprx 10 boxes of .38special (Federal, didn't look at price)

-Plenty of birdshot/varmint .22 and couple boxes of shorts

- they also had a Ruger 10/22 takedown model in the pistol case for $350, look out for gougers trying to get $500-600 for these, but there was someone talking to a rep about it (If you are interested I would call first and check if it's still there) Rep said 10/22's are rarely on the shelf for more than a day.

-Plenty of shotgun ammo too as there is everywhere

Just an FYI to all other gun-toting, law-abiding, ammo-slinging, redneck, sportsman out there. :D

No sense in paying the BS prices on here, shop around and do your homework, it's out there folks. Just got to be at the right place at the right time. .22lr is not worth 10+ cents a round nor is steel cased .223 worth a buck a pop!!!

From their website:

This ammo contains the 3rd generation of the Black Talon bullet. It is basically the same bullet as the original Black Talon, except for that it is not black, which was a Lubaloy coating. This ammo still has the reverse taper bullet and expands out the talon petals upon impact. When the Talon petals expand out they are as sharp as a razor and then the bullet will spin inside the target and the talon petals will cut anything in the bullets way. It is not only the best defense ammo available, it is a great investment, It will only continue to go up in price as the availability decreases. It comes packed in 50rd boxes, 500rds. per case

ONE INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1 inch Formed Door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength  and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM (patent pending):
The Force Deflector Locking System prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

MAX LOCKING BOLTS:
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. The MAX Locking Bolts found only on the Pro Series line of safes, have up to 12 times more surface area to engage the stout door frame, making them 4 times stronger than traditional bolts.

PRY STOP END BOLTS:
Superior to other bolt designs which allow the locking bolt support bar to bend. Pry-Stop Corner End Bolts are over 2.5 times longer and attach to a high-strength steel angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom locking bolts on the door side secure the critical door corners.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degrees for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever.  This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables.  Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on the Pinnacle Series.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use ½ inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by ½ inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING:
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK STANDARD
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

SECURAM BIOMETRIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The SecuRam Biometric Lock uses the uniqueness of an individual fingerprint as the combination in this advanced security solution. The lock opens with either a fingerprint or a multi-digit code. It is highly secure and operates very quickly. Simple programming instructions. LCD Screen.

ONE INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1 inch Formed Door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength  and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM (patent pending):
The Force Deflector Locking System prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

MAX LOCKING BOLTS:
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. The MAX Locking Bolts found only on the Pro Series line of safes, have up to 12 times more surface area to engage the stout door frame, making them 4 times stronger than traditional bolts.

PRY STOP END BOLTS:
Superior to other bolt designs which allow the locking bolt support bar to bend. Pry-Stop Corner End Bolts are over 2.5 times longer and attach to a high-strength steel angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom locking bolts on the door side secure the critical door corners.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degrees for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever.  This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables.  Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on the Pinnacle Series.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use ½ inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by ½ inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING:
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK STANDARD
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

SECURAM BIOMETRIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The SecuRam Biometric Lock uses the uniqueness of an individual fingerprint as the combination in this advanced security solution. The lock opens with either a fingerprint or a multi-digit code. It is highly secure and operates very quickly. Simple programming instructions. LCD Screen.

ONE INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1 inch Formed Door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength  and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM (patent pending):
The Force Deflector Locking System prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

MAX LOCKING BOLTS:
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. The MAX Locking Bolts found only on the Pro Series line of safes, have up to 12 times more surface area to engage the stout door frame, making them 4 times stronger than traditional bolts.

PRY STOP END BOLTS:
Superior to other bolt designs which allow the locking bolt support bar to bend. Pry-Stop Corner End Bolts are over 2.5 times longer and attach to a high-strength steel angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom locking bolts on the door side secure the critical door corners.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degrees for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever.  This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables.  Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on the Pinnacle Series.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use ½ inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by ½ inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING:
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK STANDARD
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

SECURAM BIOMETRIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The SecuRam Biometric Lock uses the uniqueness of an individual fingerprint as the combination in this advanced security solution. The lock opens with either a fingerprint or a multi-digit code. It is highly secure and operates very quickly. Simple programming instructions. LCD Screen.

Our Assessment: The Model 1890 was produced until 1919, when the model name changed to 90. It would prove to be the most successful repeating rim fire rifle for general all around shooting ever made by Winchester. Approximately 849,000 Model 1890/90 rifles were produced between 1890 and 1932. This rifle will shoot the .22 Short, Long and Long Rifle rounds, which are abundant and cheap. With the condition of the barrel, this rifle is of value to shooters and collectors. This is a beautiful rifle, and from the curios and collectible very late period of 1890 production."

DUO-FORMED DOOR:
The best Browning ProSteel safe door is formed from multiple layers of steel, carefully formed together to provide superior strength, pry-resistance and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. Door face is 1 5/16 inches thick.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM (patent pending):
The Force Deflector Locking System prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

MAX LOCKING BOLTS:
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. The MAX Locking Bolts found only on the Pro Series line of safes, have up to 12 times more surface area to engage the stout door frame, making them 4 times stronger than traditional bolts.

PRY STOP END BOLTS:
Superior to other bolt designs which allow the locking bolt support bar to bend. Pry-Stop Corner End Bolts are over 2.5 times longer and attach to a high-strength steel angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom locking bolts on the door side secure the critical door corners.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degrees for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever.  This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables.  Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on the Pinnacle Series.

DPX SCOPE SAVER (patent pending): 
Found exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, this new addition aces the optics mounted on your long guns inside the space in the door. The Scope Saver protects scoped firearms from adjacent firearms and other contents in the safe, ensuring that time spent sighting-in isn’t wasted. In addition, the space that would be taken up by a scope in a traditional safe is now freed up for another firearm. While other safes will store your guns, no other safe will protect them and keep them ready for you to use like a Browning ProSteel Safe. Any way you look at it, a scoped long gun takes up the same space of two guns in your safe, except with the DPX Scope Saver. The Scope Saver takes advantage of space no other manufacturer has ever thought of using (the space in the door) to fit a scope. With the scope recessed in the door, the scoped gun takes up no more space than an un-scoped long gun. And because the Scope Saver is integrated into the DPX door panel, your scoped long guns are right at your fingertips, easy to access as soon as the door swings open.

AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVING (patent pending):
A safe is capable of securing more than firearms. Jewelry, documents, cameras, coin collections and other valuables — plus shooting gear — can easily fit inside a safe. The trick is maximizing storage capacity to accommodate many different items of varying size. Browning ProSteel Safes have led the industry for years in terms of safe storage solutions, now we take the concept to the highest level yet with our innovative Axis Adjustable Shelving. Unlike shelves in other safes that are either fixed in position or only offer vertical adjustment, Axis shelves can be adjusted both vertically and horizontally to accommodate nearly any size item while working around long guns. The new Axis Adjustable Shelving comes standard on new Premium Series safes. Check it out today and see how much more you can store in your Browning ProSteel safe.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use ½ inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by ½ inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING:
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G MECHANICAL STANDARD

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

SECURAM BIOMETRIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The SecuRam Biometric Lock uses the uniqueness of an individual fingerprint as the combination in this advanced security solution. The lock opens with either a fingerprint or a multi-digit code. It is highly secure and operates very quickly. Simple programming instructions. LCD Screen.

DUO-FORMED DOOR:
The best Browning ProSteel safe door is formed from multiple layers of steel, carefully formed together to provide superior strength, pry-resistance and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. Door face is 1 5/16 inches thick.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM (patent pending):
The Force Deflector Locking System prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

MAX LOCKING BOLTS:
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. The MAX Locking Bolts found only on the Pro Series line of safes, have up to 12 times more surface area to engage the stout door frame, making them 4 times stronger than traditional bolts.

PRY STOP END BOLTS:
Superior to other bolt designs which allow the locking bolt support bar to bend. Pry-Stop Corner End Bolts are over 2.5 times longer and attach to a high-strength steel angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom locking bolts on the door side secure the critical door corners.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degrees for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever.  This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables.  Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on the Pinnacle Series.

DPX SCOPE SAVER (patent pending): 
Found exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, this new addition aces the optics mounted on your long guns inside the space in the door. The Scope Saver protects scoped firearms from adjacent firearms and other contents in the safe, ensuring that time spent sighting-in isn’t wasted. In addition, the space that would be taken up by a scope in a traditional safe is now freed up for another firearm. While other safes will store your guns, no other safe will protect them and keep them ready for you to use like a Browning ProSteel Safe. Any way you look at it, a scoped long gun takes up the same space of two guns in your safe, except with the DPX Scope Saver. The Scope Saver takes advantage of space no other manufacturer has ever thought of using (the space in the door) to fit a scope. With the scope recessed in the door, the scoped gun takes up no more space than an un-scoped long gun. And because the Scope Saver is integrated into the DPX door panel, your scoped long guns are right at your fingertips, easy to access as soon as the door swings open.

AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVING (patent pending):
A safe is capable of securing more than firearms. Jewelry, documents, cameras, coin collections and other valuables — plus shooting gear — can easily fit inside a safe. The trick is maximizing storage capacity to accommodate many different items of varying size. Browning ProSteel Safes have led the industry for years in terms of safe storage solutions, now we take the concept to the highest level yet with our innovative Axis Adjustable Shelving. Unlike shelves in other safes that are either fixed in position or only offer vertical adjustment, Axis shelves can be adjusted both vertically and horizontally to accommodate nearly any size item while working around long guns. The new Axis Adjustable Shelving comes standard on new Premium Series safes. Check it out today and see how much more you can store in your Browning ProSteel safe.
Watch the Axis Shelving System in Action!--

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use ½ inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by ½ inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING:
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G MECHANICAL STANDARD

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

SECURAM BIOMETRIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*

DUO-FORMED DOOR:
The best Browning ProSteel safe door is formed from multiple layers of steel, carefully formed together to provide superior strength, pry-resistance and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. Door face is 1 5/16 inches thick.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM (patent pending):
The Force Deflector Locking System prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

MAX LOCKING BOLTS:
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. The MAX Locking Bolts found only on the Pro Series line of safes, have up to 12 times more surface area to engage the stout door frame, making them 4 times stronger than traditional bolts.

PRY STOP END BOLTS:
Superior to other bolt designs which allow the locking bolt support bar to bend. Pry-Stop Corner End Bolts are over 2.5 times longer and attach to a high-strength steel angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom locking bolts on the door side secure the critical door corners.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degrees for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever.  This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables.  Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on the Pinnacle Series.

DPX SCOPE SAVER (patent pending): 
Found exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, this new addition aces the optics mounted on your long guns inside the space in the door. The Scope Saver protects scoped firearms from adjacent firearms and other contents in the safe, ensuring that time spent sighting-in isn’t wasted. In addition, the space that would be taken up by a scope in a traditional safe is now freed up for another firearm. While other safes will store your guns, no other safe will protect them and keep them ready for you to use like a Browning ProSteel Safe. Any way you look at it, a scoped long gun takes up the same space of two guns in your safe, except with the DPX Scope Saver. The Scope Saver takes advantage of space no other manufacturer has ever thought of using (the space in the door) to fit a scope. With the scope recessed in the door, the scoped gun takes up no more space than an un-scoped long gun. And because the Scope Saver is integrated into the DPX door panel, your scoped long guns are right at your fingertips, easy to access as soon as the door swings open.

AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVING (patent pending):
A safe is capable of securing more than firearms. Jewelry, documents, cameras, coin collections and other valuables — plus shooting gear — can easily fit inside a safe. The trick is maximizing storage capacity to accommodate many different items of varying size. Browning ProSteel Safes have led the industry for years in terms of safe storage solutions, now we take the concept to the highest level yet with our innovative Axis Adjustable Shelving. Unlike shelves in other safes that are either fixed in position or only offer vertical adjustment, Axis shelves can be adjusted both vertically and horizontally to accommodate nearly any size item while working around long guns. The new Axis Adjustable Shelving comes standard on new Premium Series safes. Check it out today and see how much more you can store in your Browning ProSteel safe.
Watch the Axis Shelving System in Action!--
http://youtu.be/VRCHMbMZy_k

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use ½ inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by ½ inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING:
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G MECHANICAL STANDARD

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.
