 CLICK on this Link http://www.grippod.com/gsp-02-military
The GPS-02 Grip Pod Exceeds Military Drop Test Specifications.

 The Grip Pod System™ (GPA™) is a revolutionary new vertical fore-grip integrated with a strong and stable bipod. The Grip Pod's legs deploy at the push of a button - instantly!

 It offers a combination of advantages never before available in a single accessory.

 We consider the Grip Pod™ to be an enhanced target acquisition system (ETAS).

 Using the Grip Pod System™ an operator can go from a standing CQB position to a prone firing position, and have a stable bi-pod for aimed firing in place before hitting the ground.

 Say goodbye to cumbersome bipods that have to be manually clipped on or folded into position.

 The GPA™ is manufactured from aerospace materials to exceed military specifications for construction and finish. It mounts directly to Picatinny rail systems, and additional mounting options will be available soon.

 The GPA™ is currently in worldwide use by many Military and Law Enforcement units including: US Navy Seals, US Army Special Forces, US Army, USMC, British Army, Canadian Army, FBI HRT, Secret Service, Federal / State / Local Law Enforcement, and several unmentionable government entities. The Grip Pod™ has been selected for use on US Army Designated Marksman rifles. Patents are pending.

 * This vertical fore-grip is widely known throughout the military and tactical communities of the world to enhance control, accuracy, and speed of long and short range shooting (to include Close Quarter Battle (CQB) target acquisition). This is true for soldiers utilizing all types of small arms (rifles, submachine guns, and light machine guns).

WARNING - Don't be fooled by Cheap Chinese Knockoff Grip Pods!

 There are lots of Chinese manufacturers that are making CHEAP and DANGEROUS Copies of the Grip Pod Systems Grip Pod, but use poor manufacturing methods / unskilled labor / cheap materials to make them.

Trijicon is the first to market with its unique dark earth brown color, a definite factor to concealment- directly contributing to the safety of the operator, who is often in harm’s way. This dual-sighting system gives the shooter a distinct tactical advantage with the option of either the Trijicon ACOG or the RMR Sight. With the quick target acquisition of the RMR Sight or the precise aiming capabilities provided by the magnified 4 power Trijicon ACOG- the shooter has the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand- truly the best of both worlds. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the ECOS also features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.

Product Description


Why settle for a sloppy trigger which can cause a good rifle to shoot badly? Now shooters can replace creepy two-stage triggers with one that is smooth and breaks crisp. The trigger is factory preset with a pull weight of either 3 or 4 pounds. Installation is quick and no adjustments are necessary, 100% true drop-in trigger. The trigger module installs using your rifle’s original hammer/trigger pins and the proprietary design eliminates pin rotation and walkout. Since it was founded in 1946, Timney Manufacturing has built a reputation based on the quality of its products. Because of the precision machining and workmanship that goes into each and every Timney product they are often referred to as “The World’s Finest Triggers” and they are used exclusively by some of the world’s best custom gun manufacturers. Made in the USA."

123,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1441123,For Sale:  Mauser Model 66 .308 Winchester caliber,"North of Kansas City above the MO River, Missouri, United States","$ 1,100","Listed On: Thursday, April 11, 2013",Rifles,Mauser                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a double set trigger Mauser 66 in 95% condition. I have owned it for 10 years or better and shot it maybe 20 times. It came with a front scope mount that was customized for it, but no rear mount.  I never got around to getting that rear mount. I'd actually suggest that the front mount be removed and the scope mounts designed for this rifle be acquired. The previous owner had the stock glass bedded which didn't allow the rear of the received to fit precisely where it was pre-bedding. I've had the stock off and it would take a little shaving with a Dremel tool to do this, but I'll leave that to the next owner. The walnut on this rifle is spectacular...as is the checkering. If you've done your homework or know this rifle you will understand that barrels are interchangeable with such calibers as .243, etc. I do not have extra barrels but they too are out there. If you check such sites as Gunbroker or Guns International you'lll find that my price is darn good. And a bonus?  I will toss in another bolt that will fit this rifle from a previous one I owned which was stolen. That bolt alone is worth $250. If you want a high end rifle in excellent condition, look no further."

100 rounds of Tanner gun show reloads, by some guys who always do a really good job for me.  These are defensive rounds, 165 gr jacketed hollow point, REALLY good stuff.

100 rounds of BVAC (Bitter Valley Ammunition Company)  factory reloads, meaning they've been reloaded in once-used brass down a factory assembly line.  Pleasure to shoot.  Good for target, but coud be used for defense. 180 gr hollow point.  

50 rounds Russian Wolf ammunition.  180 gr steel cased, lead bullets.  I've put these through my Sigs for target practice, and never had a problem.

Many anti-gun bills are scheduled to be heard in committee next Monday and Tuesday.  Call AND e-mail your state legislators urging them to OPPOSE the bills listed below.

With a money order or cashiers check you are 100% at mercy of the seller, they can cash your money order without any proof or record or identity and never mail the gun and you wont be able to even find out who they are. 

With a personal check you can at least see who cashed the check and the names must match from them to cash it. Much better for preventing fraud/scams as in the recent FN herstal 5.7x28 fake seller who stole $1650 from a guy.

Or paypal where you can at least dispute the transaction if you have any issues and someone from paypal with review the evidence.  

and if your a seller, just make sure you document the transaction and you shouldn't have any problems with paypal. I never have. the only way you would is if the seller decided to be a dick...

anyways.... I come from the car forum world where Paypal is used without question and usually without issue and involves shipping very expensive items long distances to buyers. ($2k turbos etc..) so I don't understand what the hang up is with all these gun people/gunbroker people."

A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

NEW OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE BUYER!!!!

- I can sell everything but the ammo for $2,000.
- I am open to trades for FTF.
- I can sell the ammo separately if I have a buyer for the rifle and accessories first.

I can also reduce the cost by removing some of the ammo as well.  So if you know you are interested in this rifle and set up, I can be flexible in the price to meet your budgetary constraints per removing ammo.


We can talk or meet FTF.  Either way works but this is not a scam.  It is just a good deal on a nice rifle, accessories, and ammunition."
