I have standard 100 round winchester from walmart.

I'm looking for a fair trade here, not this BS price gouging others are doing. 
40 and 45 cost between $40 and $50 per 100. 
A 500 round brick of 22 runs about $20-25. 
So 2 bricks of 22 will get you a 100 round box of 40 or 45, your choice. 
Let me know what kind you have. My 22 prefers Remington Golden, but it will eat most blazers, winchester, or federal.

This stun gun utilizes the unique features of the Phazzer brand products integrated for ease of use and safety.


PhaZZer® Titan Multi-Function Drive Stun Gun



The PhaZZer Titan is a security grade Multi-Function High Voltage Contact Drive Stun Gun.  The PhaZZer Titan features a 3 function slide toggle to easily select the �Shock� position, ""Blinding LED Light"" position, or �130 decibel Siren Distress Alarm�.  For operator safety, we incorporated an On/Off toggle switch on the bottom of the unit that deactivates all function capability with the exception of the Circuit Disconnect Rip Cord activation of the siren alarm. Dislodging the Circuit Disconnect Rip Cord will automatically render the Titan useless preventing an assailant from using the ""stun"" function against the owner. The 130 decibel siren alarm can also be activated manually through the use of the toggle function position switch. The Blinding LED light may be used to cause temporary blindness if properly shined in the eyes of an attacker to cause a distraction for an easier get away.  The charging system is self-contained (A/C charger prongs built in) and uses a rechargeable Grade-A NiMH battery which provides a longer battery lifespan of over 5 years if suggested charging instructions are followed.

The PhaZZer Titan could potentially save a person�s life or allow you to get out of harm�s way in a number of different ways.  We have had countless emails, blogs, and letters from customers who have explained appreciative success stories from the usage of this product.  Some of the best feedback has come from females attending colleges who live in dorms or on campus where such criminal behavior may take place.

This gentlemen, Mr. Tackett, responded to an ad I posted seeking 22 ammo. He advised he had 1350 of ammo, from three different manufacturers, in bulk, other than two 100 round boxes of CCI ammo.
He stated a price, I countered with a different price, he countered with a price delivered to a place along I-70. I declined the offer.
He then emailed me back with a slightly lower price, delivered to the point along I-70. I responded advising I would take the ammo, and a meet time was agreed upon.
Then just hours before the agreed time, he emailed me and backed out of the per-arrangement stating his concern for gas prices and snow flurries.(he drives a SUV)
He then lowered the price a little on the condition that I drive to Columbus to meet him near his home. Once again, I agreed to his terms, and met him on the out skirts of Columbus.
After the deal was done and I returned home I decided to count all the bulk ammo, and to no great surprise found the actual quantities less than what he stated, by 125 rounds.
I informed him of the error which he promptly replied that his son had done the counting, and suggesting the error was not his responsibility. He of course said he would make it good, but of course, the 125 rounds was not worth another drive to Columbus.

Long story short, I would suggest extreme caution to anyone thinking of dealing with this guy, especially when it comes to bulk ammo.

The citizens of Gonzales realized that the intent of the move was to disarm possible rebels, and so the request was denied.

Ugartechea then sent dragoons under Captain Francisco Castaneda to demand the cannon unconditionally. As word of the conflict spread, the Texan force grew to over 200 armed men and the town was fortified. The cannon was mounted on a wagon, and blacksmiths hammered iron scrap and chains inth the cannonballs.

Two ladies of the town, Cynthia Burns and Evaline DeWitt, painted a flag on cotton cloth, depicting the cannon, the lone star of Texas and a clear challenge to the enemy.

The Mexican troops moved north to ford the river and approach Gonzales. The Texans decided that they had to attack before Mexican reinforcements arrived. They crossed the river at dusk, formed their battle lines at night and surprised the Mexicans at dawn on October 2nd.

The battle that followed was brief; when the Texans opened fire, the Mexicans withdrew, abandoning their supplies. Stephen F. Austin joined the army as commander on October 10th, and the other Texans, under the command of James Collingsworth, took the Goliad the next day. On October 12th, the march on San Antonio began.

I don't know the manufacturer of this piece, but someone mentioned Caspian. If you know please inform me. I'm no expert with these.  Got it on trade and would like to do the same.
I'm guessing (see that, like I said NOT an expert) trade value of around 150-200 is fair.
I was going to build it but don't really care about a .45 at this time. However, if I can't find anything I'll just hold onto it. 

I had it posted earlier and kept getting cash offers for it. And while I appreciate it, I'm not really looking to let it go for less than what a fun day at the range with a .22 might cost in ammo.

I don't believe I'm gouging with the number I've proposed as an 80% frame is going for that much. And a new one would be closer to 300.

This is the last of a 500 round case I bought a few years ago so I've shot a lot of it and it really is accurate for military style ammo. The other thing I noticed about this ammo was that it seemed to penetrate better than other American FMJ I've shot and I'm not sure why?? It may have some steel Inside, or perhaps Norinco just loads it hotter?? I was going to give it the magnet test before I listed it but can't find a magnet in the house. No matter what it's hard hitting deep penetrating ammo. Price is $70 for the 100 rounds and I won't split  it up. FTF and must be 21. Thank You"

With a drift adjustable style rear  sight and threaded muzzle, the finish of the Government version is Black. The Citadel M-1911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The Citadel M-1911 .22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Citadel M-1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring Hogue grips. The G.I. Model has all the same features along with G.I. style hammer, sites… all the way down to the lanyard loop.  If even feels perfect in your hand.  It is the perfect gun for target practice, personal defense, concealed carry or even for the lady.  It is very easy to handle and an easy pull to chamber a round.  Anyone can handle this gun.

Selling a Mossberg MVP Predator, 20"" bbl, chambered 5.56/.223. This thing is a tack driver (MOA/sub-MOA), but I managed to break off a piece of the magazine well. Magazines still lock, but the mag release lever needs to be rigged up to prevent vertical play. I've tried contacting Mossberg unsuccessfully thus far, and I do not feel like sending the whole rifle off and waiting around. Especially if HB1224 passes and goes into effect, I don't want to risk Mossberg being backed up and I can't receive the rifle due to the whole maintaining possession of a rifle readily capable of holding some many rounds. Politics aside, I think it would be a relatively easy fix for someone skilled at this type of work, but I don't want the rifle anymore.

Purchased new in Jan. 2013, and I've fired 60 rounds.

I have a Nikon Monarch 2.5-10x42 w/Nikoplex, Weaver scope rings, Blackhawk 9""-13"" bipod, leather sling & sling swivels. All purchased around the time I bought the rifle. Includes all orignal packaging for the rifle and scope (1 10 rd magazine, paperwork, lock, etc.)

The stock has been refinished by a previous owner.

Metal finish is approximately 90% and original based on the bright chamber and crispness of the machining marks throughout. All of the moving parts shows similar wear patterns indicating these parts have lived together for a while and have not been changed around anytime recently.

The barrel has the correct upside down S-A-10-42 marking and P with punch mark.  The narrow base front sight still has the lead seal on the sight screw.  All revision numbers are correct for late 1942 production; -3 curve sided op rod (uncut), -8 trigger housing, -3 hammer, -9 safety, -11 follower, short fork riveted follower rod, round nose clip latch, grooved lower HG clip. The short pinion rear sight has a checkered elevation cap and knurled windage cap with flush nut.  Both with closed arrows per SA manufacture. Of special note is that many of the small parts were left unfinished.  The gas screw, firing pin, ejector, hammer spring guide, sear, follower slide, bullet guide and accelerator are all in the white.

The previous owner purchased this rifle in its current condition in the 1970's with the glossy refinished stock.  Unfortunately all cartouches were removed, only a partial remnant of the circled P with serifs remains on the pistol grip.  However the stock is an early WW2 stock with scooped latch cutout, long chanel front and stamped type stock ferrule with small hole.  The stock has not been sanded excessively as there is no proud metal anywhere.

While this rifle is a bit late in 1942 for a flush nut sight, however it is well documented that a SA used leftover parts as needed during 1942 and 1943.  A number of known original rifles have been documented with earlier type sights during the mid war period. I believe this sight is original to this rifle.  

The long channel stock is also out of sequence and I believe has been exchanged from an earlier rifle.

A very good quality early WW2 rifle."
