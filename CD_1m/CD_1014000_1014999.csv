If you would like to see the quality of the lugs, the single lug (flat head) can be seen from this link (http://www.egodrumsupply.com/flattopse.html). The lugs have been custom made into tube lugs on ALL shells.The bass drum legs referred to as ""Kick Stand"" by Ego are at this link, (http://www.egodrumsupply.com/kickstand.html)...

 This is one box containing 10 sleeves of 100 each for 1,000 total. kept in ammo box in temperature controlled room.
 Here is information about #41 primers from CCI: 
Military-style semi-auto rifles seldom have firing pin retraction springs. If care is not used in assembling ammunition, a ""slam-fire"" can occur before the bolt locks. The military arsenals prevent this using different techniques and components - including different primer sensitivity specifications - from their commercial counterparts. CCI makes rifle primers for commercial sale that matches military sensitivity specifications that reduce the chance of a ""slam-fire"" when other factors go out of control*. If you're reloading for a military semi-auto, Look to CCI military primers. 
* Effective slam-fire prevention requires more than special primers. Headspace, chamber condition, firing pin shape and protrusion, bolt velocity, cartridge case condition, and other factors can affect slam-fire potential.

P245 is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses a typical Browning-style cam operated barrel, which locks into the ejection window in the slide. The slide is made from stamped steel, and has a separate breechblock held within the slide by the cross-pin. The frame is made from aluminum. The trigger is double action, with external hammer and a decocking lever on the left side of the frame. There's no manual safety, but P245 is provided with automatic firing pin safety."

It has a smooth action, and all numbers match.  Grips are original bakelite and very good to excellent, with no cracks.  Finish is 95%. Barrel is excellent.  Lanyard ring is original and intact.  

This is an excellent example of the standard issue firearm for British Army Officers and R.A.F. Pilots during WWII.

It is marked ""War Finish"" and the serial number 1314XX which would indicate manufacture perhaps late 1940 or early 1941.  This was a carry-back from WWII and has no import markings, only the original Proof Stamps.

Webley had been very proud of the high polish and superb finish applied to their commercial guns and hated the idea that it was not possible to maintain those standards under wartime conditions, so they expressed both their feelings and their apologies by marking the guns as ""War Finish"" so no one would think such work was up to their usual quality.

Price includes revolver, original holster, and 3 (old) boxes of ammo.

This is a rare opportunity to own a collector grade Webley at a giveaway price."

lessee here, we got nine 30 round AR mags, mostly brownells, orange followers. they have one green follower in there. They pass gauging, but there is some wear from being in nylon carriers. five of them have tape and 550 cord homemade magpuls on them, but the cord is outside the floorplate. call them $20 dollars apiece.
BULLWINKLE. AR MAGS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE?

AR mags are not worth more than that with wear marks. I am not scalping, and I only posted to help some of you all out. Scalpers are d#%$&. 

OH. THANKS. YOU ARE A NICE GUY. YOU MENTIONED GLOCK .40 MAGS?

Yeah. I got a pair of 28 round glock magazines. they are the oversized, crazy big ones, and they are not factory mags. one has a 2 round extension on it, the other has no extension. they are 25 dollars apiece. They work, but they will not drop free when they are fully loaded. the sides expand just enough to force you to yank them out of the pistol. these are still metal lined, and I should mention that they are Gen 3 manufacture. if you have a Gen 4, and you switched the mag release to the lefty side, they wont work.

I HAVE AN EXACTO KNIFE, MY NEW BEST FRIEND. I CAN MOD THEM IF I HAVE TO. WHY ARE YOU SELLING THESE SO CHEAP?

I havent used them in months, and people are hurting for mags. I can get more later.

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.
 
T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.
 
USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.
 
Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.
 
Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.
 
Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.
 
5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.
 
Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.
 
Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.
 
HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

Some background info from manufacturers website:


-------------


http://www.wolf-arms.com/vepr_rifles.html


The VEPR Rifle in 7.62x39 is the top of the line in Kalashnikov action semi-automatic rifles. With features such as; Hammer forged heavy barrel, (including a chrome lined barrel bore, chamber, gas block and gas piston), 1.5mm thick receiver, RPK front trunnion, spring loaded firing pin, side scope mount, hand made walnut thumbhole stock and the Wolf Lifetime Warranty. The VEPR is simply the highest quality rifle based on the Kalashnikov design. The VEPR Rifles and Carbines are sporting arms based on the famous Soviet designed RPK. VEPR rifles are manufactured at the historic Vyatskie Polyany Machine Building Plant (a.k.a. ""MOLOT""). Molot has been building excellence into their firearms for over 50 years.


^^^ Note the $900 MSRP, and that's from before the panic.


Those rifles were selling for 700+ before Newton, when all the WASRs and Saigas people now sell for $1000-1500 were selling for half the price of a VEPR.


-------------


Now the real facts from me examining this specific rifle (its NIB but I plan to test fire it this weekend, to make sure it works 100% and I won't sell someone a lemon):


- Note: the rifle pictured is not the one for sale. I'll take pictures of the actual rifle once I attach the accessories mentioned below.


- Trigger pull is a bit gritty but with a good clean break. With some breaking in and possibly a bit of polish should be very nice, currently somewhat better than other AKs I've had.


- Overall the rifle feels relatively light for such a beefy firearm, somewhere under 9 pounds. The 16"" barrel looks a bit short but makes the rifle balanced (the longer barrel versions are somewhat front-heavy reportedly).


- The wood stock is very comfortable and quite handy for all shooting positions. Does not look very ""tactical"". If scaring paper targets is your thing, you can get the full ""evil black rifle"" stockset made for the Vepr somewhere under $200:


http://shop.roninsgrips.com/images/DSC_0015%283 %29.jpg


Or get the receiver block for $15 and mount any AK stock you want - even those abominable collapsible AR stocks.


- My other VEPR shoots about as good as my Russian SKS, which is far better than I can. These and one of my ex-sniper Mosins are the most accurate Combloc weapons I own. As I said, I've yet to test fire this one but I see no reason why it would be different.


- As all newly imported rifles, these rifles do not have a bullet guide. SGM Tactical released VEPR 30 round mags, I will include two with the rifle.


If you want to use vanilla AK47 highcap mags, you will need to put in a bullet guide, which takes about half an hour of work. I have the thing in the mail. It costs less than $20 bucks, there are Youtube videos, its literally one screw. You have to make the rifle 922r compliant to use non-US highcaps of course but with VEPRs only having 14 parts it's as easy as swapping either trigger or furniture or mag parts.


--------------


Accessories:


Will come with box&all factory accessories, 2x10 round mags, 2x30 round SGM mags (or Yugo mags if that's your thing), basic sling (your choice of AK, VZ58, G3, Mosin types; depending on what you do I recommend either more robust G3 or thicker but weaker Mosin dog collar type), 100 rounds of ammo on strippers (FTF sale only obviously), Yugo bayonet (the rifle has no lug but hey you can hang the frog on your belt), barrel Weaver short mount with a bipod, scope mount.


I also have a lot of 7.62x39 ammo at a slight discount for the buyer, both surplus and commercial, but please don't insult my intelligence by offering to buy it separately at pre-panic prices. If ammo costs 60-75c/round online now (if and when they ship), I will do 50c/round but not 25c. 


If you make me a real good offer I'll throw in a POSP 4x24 scope with a cool paintjob and a nice QD mount as well, and I can dig up quite a bit of tactical gear too if that's your thing (mag pouches, vests, scope mounts, extra slings, more mags, heck I even have a kevlar helmet laying around).


--------------


Price:


I just poked around Florida ads and I didn't see a single AK type for less than a grand, even WASRs, heck some people want 2500. With that in mind, I'll put the asking price at 1250 FTF, I think that's fair for such a nice rifle. If I have to drive far from Gainesville or ship, you pay the gas/shipping. FL DL a must obviously, CWP or C&R strongly preferred. I'll show FL DL and CWP of my own of course, we can do a BOS if you want."

Designed specifically for the most demanding military, law enforcement, and recreational users, the XCR-L offers a level of reliability offered by few other rifles.

 XCR-L incorporates heavy duty components such as a sturdy oprod, a beefy three-lug bolt, a locking extractor, and a fixed ejector.  These elements and others ensure reliable performance with minimal maintenance.


The XCR-L is the most ergonomic rifle available anywhere.  Professoinal users report that the XCR has the fastest magazine change and clearing times of any rifle. 

Whether the rifle is supported by the right or left hand, the operator can manipulate all the controls while keeping his eyes on target and index finger near the trigger.

Our new Fully Adjustable Stock not only folds but is adjustable for length and height ensuring unparalleled shooting comfort.

Many rifles claim to be modular weapon systems just because they have a 1913 standard rail system used to attach accessories.  The XCR-L is truly modular.

With one XCR-L Lower Receiver (the serialized part), the operator can configure the XCR as a shorty for close quarters combat, a light weight carbine, or a longer marksman's rifle.

The XCR-L's quick change barrel system is unmatched in terms of ease of use and repeatability.  Barrel and caliber changes can be made in less than 5 minutes.

Armorers who are familiar with the XCR-L find it the easiest rifle to inspect, maintain, and service resulting in lower overall maintenance costs

The true beauty of the XCR-L is the simplicity of design and durability of its parts."

If you are not local and we are shipping, you must send me your FFL's license information because I can only send to them.


The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

On the top half of the case is a Stag Arms 6.8 upper and lower. The lower has an ambidextrous single point sling adapter and a single point sling. The upper has the free float forend, and a nickel boron bolt carrier group. I pulled it out in the pic so you can see how clean they keep. They dont get any carbon build up on them at all. The optics is a 3-9x50 basic scope zeroed in at 200yds. Its not a super high end scope, but ARs dont kick like mules either. It has been holding up to the 6.8 recoil for around 200 rounds that Ive put down it. It comes with 2 magazines stamped 6.8 and 1 box of Hornady 6.8 ammo.
The lower half of the gun case is a DPMS 5.56/.223 upper with 1:9 twist. It has quad rail forend with all the rail adapters to put over the rails if you want to use them. Also comes with a fold down foregrip attached to it. Standard bolt carrier in it also. The light is a surefire millenium universal ($350) with the M93 mounting base $175(quick release) and the KM3 light head $250 on it (switches between white light and infrared). It comes with a NcStar 4x32 (not pictured) scope that has a red laser on it as well and has the quick detach/attach lever. I have 2 new in the box GI style mags, 2 used mags, 3x20rd boxes of ammo, and a bag of loose reloaded ammo leftover from a box I got at a gun show last year.
The 5.56 upper will mount to the 6.8 lower perfectly and will take the 5.56 mags as well. Basically 2 uppers and 1 lower to make 2 different caliber rifles. I target shoot here and there with the 5.56 and used the 6.8 to hunt hogs in TX, although I did drop a doe with it a few weeks ago.
The entire set up was almost $2500 BEFORE the stupid rise in value of these 'assault' rifles. The surefire alone was over $500. So that being said, NO, $2000 will not come close. $3100 obo

This pistol was adopted by Imperial Japanese Army and widely used during all S-E Asia campaigns and through the World War 2 as a standard Army sidearm. This example is in excellent condition with the service wear you would expect but no signs of pitting, damage or repair. it is an early war example, made at the Nagoya arsenal with the small trigger guard and the markings ` 13.9` date it to 1938. This may have been to Manchuria and thereafter used throughout WW2 until captured. It has the correct 8 round magazine, lanyard ring and a good original finish. It dry fires as it should. Based originally on the Luger it has the same `stay open` feature when the magazine is empty. This is an excellent example of an increasingly difficult to find pistol.The magazine does not match the weapons serial number. Mag number is ( 248 )."
