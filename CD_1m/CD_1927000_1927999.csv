The rifle was made by Howa in Japan for Arma-Lite. This was offered as an alternative to the M-16 back in 1963 but wasn't picked up by the military. When the contract didn't come through, they converted some of the original rifles (AR-18) into semi auto versions known as the AR-180 and sold them to the public. This one is in excellent condition with what appears to be the original furniture. It also has the original and the more desirable 180 degree selector switch, and since it was manufactured by Howa it's one of the rarest and arguably best made ones that were imported. This gun is extremely clean, I bought it from a gentleman as an investment who had kept it as a safe queen and I personally never fired it. The butt stock folds to the side, and has what appears to be the original scope mount. The scope that you see mounted on it comes with it. It comes with a OD green canvas sling, two original Arma-Lite AR-18 20 round magazines, two 30 round polymer magazines, a manual and a hard rifle case. I am needing to sell it and am looking to sell it this weekend for $1500, or $90 face value in pre 1965 US silver coins."

This gun has been blued, which I would say is currently at about 96%. In an effort to improve the trigger, the magazine disconnect has been removed and several factory springs have been replaced with lighter brownell's springs. The feed ramp and all of the internal trigger surfaces have been polished, so suffice it to say, the trigger is really nice at this point! Furthermore, I have also replaced the factory grips with some sleek but very functional checkered black grips as you can see in the photo(s) below. Last but not least, the gun has a cylinder and slide extended thumb safety installed which makes a world of difference from the factory safety believe the round count is somewhere in the range of 200-250 rounds.

The package includes all the original parts, box, manual and warranty card. These are pretty darn tough guns and will last a lifetime if properly cared for and is one of the most accurate and reliable 9mms out there, not to mention good looking! I have two myself but I need to raise some funds for some boat related stuff, If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask me. I really do not want to trade and yes the price that is listed is what I would like to receive for the gun. I may ship but I much rather do a face to face deal.

Folks get comfortable with a certain manufacturer and tend to stick with it. I know guys who would never consider any other shotgun than a Winchester because that’s the gun grandpa used to teach them to hunt rabbits.

Law enforcement and military veterans also fall into this category. They may have spent years, decades even, carrying a particular handgun. So when the time comes to purchase one, they naturally gravitate toward the familiar make and model. (For a gallery of photos of the CM9, go here.) 

During the past few years, interest in personal protection, particularly concealed carry, has spiked tremendously. Many citizens looking to purchase a concealed-carry handgun don’t have a longtime favorite; they are simply looking for the best combination of power and concealment—and, of course, value. 

Kahr pistols have been slowly but surely making headway against the established brands made popular by law enforcement agencies and the military. They function reliably, shoot well and in the case of the CM9, outperform expectations. 



Lightweight and compact for concealed carry, the Kahr CM9 has self-defense-oriented features that are also designed to save you money. 

Although the company has a full line of all stainless steel handguns, some of the most popular Kahr pistols are polymer-frame versions. One of the newest models in that line is the CM9, which is essentially Kahr’s attempt to offer a more price-point-friendly pistol. Though it is similar to the Kahr PM9, the CM9 includes cost-saving features such as a pinned versus dovetailed front sight, conventional versus polygonal rifling and a more streamlined slide. Also, the CM9 ships with only one stainless steel magazine instead of two. 

By pinning the front sight instead of using a dovetail cut, Kahr reduces the machining time on the slide, thereby reducing cost. The same thought process goes into the barrel. Using conventional rifling rather than polygonal also reduces machine time. Will the shooter notice a difference? It depends on how often they visit the range. Most concealed-carry guns are carried a lot but shot very little. It’s up to the consumer. 

Metal injection molding (MIM) enables a manufacturer to produce parts and components from a powdered metal blended with a bonding agent. This reduces the cost of making small parts over more traditional machining or investment casting. If you desire a 100-percent machined firearm, you must be willing to pay the additional cost. 



Despite its subcompact size, the Kahr CM9 has a capacity of six-plus-one rounds 

This polymer-frame 9 mm pistol has a stainless steel slide and barrel group and was built with concealed carry in mind. Its empty weight is only 14 ounces. As a compact pistol, the CM9 is only 4 inches high and has an overall length of 5.42 inches. It is rather slim as well, at only .9 inch wide. Aside from the fixed front sight atop the slide, Kahr installed a drift-adjustable rear sight. The front sight has a white dot and the rear has a white bar at the base. A single-column magazine feeds the pistol and holds six rounds. Larger, single-column 9 mm Kahr magazines will work in the gun, but they protrude from the base of the frame. 

Manual controls on the CM9 include the double-action-only trigger, the magazine-release button and the slide lock. Kahr uses what it calls a “safe-cam action,” which ensures a positive, consistent trigger stroke. The trigger is a smooth/non-serrated design. 

The company’s safe-cam action is akin to traditional double-action triggers, but eliminates the heavy stacking at the end of the trigger stroke many older models experienced. This feature provides a much cleaner break than most double-action-only pistols. It’s something you really have to feel in order to appreciate. 

To give the new CM9 a thorough workout, I took along six different 9 mm loads from three manufacturers. Both controlled-expansion projectiles and full-metal-jacket bullets were represented. As some subcompact pistols tend to be finicky eaters, particularly when it comes to bullet weight, I made sure the spectrum was covered. From fast-moving 115-grain loads all the way up to the slower and heavier 147-grain offerings. 



The windage-adjustable rear sight has a white bar that indexes quickly. 

From a 3-inch barrel, I wasn’t expecting earth-shattering velocities. Those posted were on par with what you might expect from a subcompact pistol. The heavier 147-grain loads were in the 800 fps range, and the lighter 115-grain rounds exceeded 1,000 fps. 

The standard 25-yard benchmark seemed a bit impractical for testing the accuracy of a subcompact pistol with fixed sights, so I tested it at 10 yards. While a double-action-only trigger might not be the first choice for competitive shooters, for a compact, personal-protection handgun it is just right. I must admit I was impressed by the smooth, deliberate stroke of the trigger. No creep or heavy stacking was noticed. Each group was fired using a fully loaded six-round magazine. As mentioned earlier, the safe-cam trigger is one that truly must be tried to be appreciated. I’m not an engineer, but I’m a shooter who can tell the engineers responsible for this gun’s design got it right. 

As far as the CM9’s accuracy, the vast majority of rounds impacted the center of the 10 ring. A couple of the loads wanted to strike a bit high and left, but the difference was less than 2 inches. Essentially, the sights were right on from the factory. 

Regardless of bullet weight or style tested, groups averaged less than 1.5 inches. Most of them bested the 1-inch mark. For a relatively small, lightweight pistol with a long double-action-only trigger stroke, those results are indeed impressive. The gun will put the rounds where they need to be as long as the shooter does his part. 

Pinpoint accuracy is worthless if your pistol won’t cycle reliably. By the time I was ready to run drills, I’d already put somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 rounds through the gun. I hadn’t experienced any malfunctions at that the point. 

Keeping with the CM9’s concealed-carry mission, I used a Crossbreed Mini-Tuck so I could run some presentation drills. 



Kahr’s safe-cam action provides the pistol with smooth and consistent trigger pull without the burden of stacking. 

As most folks will want to carry the CM9 with a full, six-plus-one rounds of ammunition, I began every drill by loading the gun with seven. Some compact pistol’s won’t function reliably when topped off, so this is an important litmus test for any carry gun. 

Drill number one was simply to draw and engage a silhouette from 7 yards using a two-handed hold. Moving and shooting until the gun ran dry, I found it was 100-percent reliable. Primary loads for this test were the Federal American Eagle 115-grain FMJ and Cor-Bon 147-grain FMJ Match. 

Next, I ran through some strong-hand shooting drills using my right hand only before transitioning to my left hand. There is no doubt a 14-ounce 9 mm handgun is going to bounce a bit when held in only one hand. Be that as it may, the CM9 was still controllable and I was able to get back on target quickly. Most importantly, the pistol cycled reliably and I didn’t experience any stoppages. The slide consistently locked back on an empty magazine. 

One issue about which new or novice shooters need to be aware is the fact the CM9’s recoil spring is stout—it has to be to account for the slide’s short travel while absorbing the recoil impulse. New or inexperienced shooters often struggle with guns that have such short slides and strong springs. 

The Kahr CM9 gets high marks for accuracy and reliability. It is lightweight and easy to conceal. Kahr’s use of price-cutting features did not seem to affect the performance of the pistol. The CM9 is not a competition or race gun. It’s a self-defense pistol, and for its intended purpose, the CM9 holds its own. Decide whether you want to spend the extra money for more features, or save the cash. In the end, that’s another type of freedom we as gun owners celebrate.

The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.
The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.
The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap.
The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.
Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.

The Safe Action trigger system teams a trigger safety, trigger bar, and firing pin lock that automatically deactivate one after another as the trigger engages.  GLOCK barrels feature rounded interior profiles for easier cleaning and longer lasting precision. Loaded chamber indicator. Double action. Black finish. Fixed sights. Weight: 19.75 oz.

Love the gun. Not in too much of a hurry to part with it. Fell in love with it the day I held it at Shooter's Supply and have fallen in love with every model I've held since. Just looking for something in particular that I've had my eye on.

Gun has had maybe 200 rounds through it. Wouldn't be able to tell looking at it though. I have used Frog Lube on it since I first brought it home and that, Hoppe's Bore Cleaner and a Bore Snake along I've kept it sparkly clean since the beginning.

Serial # CS 033XX (as new, virgin other than 90 rounds fired in joy, in original numbered box with 3 full magazines) an original pre-ban AKS (AK-47) rifle purchased new by seller on Valentines day 1989 ( what honey, you wanted CHOCOLATES?). Super RARE, thumb button release, side folding metal stock assembly. This rifle features the scarce and very desireable red fiberglass furniture and hidden cleaning tools concealed inside stock. Chrome bore. This style of AKS was one of the last versions imported by Poly-Tech prior to the 1994 assault rifle ban and is much RARER than the Poly-Tech Legend or Norinco versions of AK rifles. It is estimated that less than 400 total of this model were ever imported into the US prior to the ban, which disallowed several features, one of them being the folding stock. These rifles were all manufactured by the Poly-Tech company which was the commercial side of the Chinese State Arms factory which produced the very best AKS rifles. It is reported that these rifles were imported in two groups; with approximately 250 in the first shipment,the distinguishing feature being the shape of the pistol grip. This rifle marked- ""MODEL AKS-762/ CAL. 7.62x39mm"" with ""POLY-TECH, BEIJING CHINA"" near right side rear on the receiver. The under side of the receiver is correctly marked ""IMPORTED BY K.F.S. ATLANTA""""MADE IN CHINA"" Which represented ""Keng's Firearms"", which was the only Chinese Government authorized importer of this style of rifle. As noted this rifle has the RARE molded all red plastic/fiberglass stock components; top handguard, forend, pistol grip and side plates for the folding stock. It is complete with the original numbered matching shipping box, three original ""Poly"" marked 30 round magazines (conveniently prefilled), canvas sling, cleaning kit and oiler. Includes the original under-barrel cleaning rod. Made with threaded muzzle, but without the bayonet lug like the milled ""Legend"" versions. A rare chance to get a premium, highly collectible, pre-ban AKS."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano is extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.The gun Is still like brand new never been fired.Comes with case,lock,2 mags 1 6 rnd and 1 8rnd And gun.asking $375.00 or best offer need to sell.Call or txt REDACTED

USMC Medium coyote brown IBA OTV armor vest in excellent to new condition with all level IIIA soft armor inserts. As seen from the photos these aren't 10x12 IIIA plate backers or some inserts from another vest pieced together with a carrier they don't belong in, like some other sellers do. These inserts are made to fit this vest. These are genuine US Military issue. You are also getting 2 brand new First Choice Armor (Diamondback Tactical) 10X12 level IV (4) ceramic Esapi plates. These are rated to stop armor piercing 30.06 Black tip ammo or Apm2. These are what our soldiers wear. They are not and steel plates and they are multi hit. There is a reason our troops wear ceramic Esapi plates. This is top notch gear and it is excellent to brand new condition. Before you purchase body armor please read and inform yourselves. Many sellers are just throwing lvl IIIA plate backers or different cut/shape inserts into carriers and calling it (X NAME OR BRAND) armor vest with inserts. The problem with this is you loose soft armor protection the original carrier was designed to do or the inserts arn't cut/shaped to fit the vest in the first place. The last picture shows 10X12 plates backers up to a set of medium inserts for reference, the plate backers are not included in this auction. Vests have specific shapes or cut armor inserts to fit them so they do not flop around loosely inside the carrier. Please know what you are buying or do some research and inform yourselves.
