A reproduction of the 1873 Single Action. This model is one of the most accurate in appearance while reproducing the Old West tradition of the classic sixgun chambered for rimfire cartridges! While maintaining the true to form classic design, our Single Action revolver is a hybrid of modern technology and manufacturing with the feel of the Old West. This revolver is crafted with a steel rifled barrel, with most of the mechanism and components constructed from a special formulated alloy that offers greater ductility and flexibility assuring long lasting reliability and durability. Black plastic chequered grips give feel and balance, while a manual locking safety provides additional protection with a highly visible red indicator showing when it's ready to shoot. This great little pistol is available in .22 LR and .22 Win Mag., and at a price that will fit any shooters budget without sacrificing quality. http://www.chiappafirearms.com/product/1517

I've owned this gun for a little over a year, and it has given me great service. I carry it almost every day, and I open carry everywhere I go. However, I have decided to sell it to help with the purchase cost of another gun. I'm including all the magazines and holsters, so you don't have to go through the pain of shopping for what may work. I didn't include my Desantis ProStealth, because I can't find it. If I can find it, you can have it. It was my holster of choice for concealed carry, because it fits the laser and holds an extra magazine.

This is not an extensive review about the LCP design; if you're interested in this gun, I'd be glad to go into detail about manual of arms, philosophy of use, etc. However, I will tell you a few particulars about this gun. This gun works best when shot like a gun. What I mean is, shoot it like you mean it. Also, use quality ammo. I've NEVER had a malfunction with any hollow point, but some steel case or cheap FMJ ammo will cause problems. Use quality ammo, and it works just fine."

The 5.45x39 Carbine Base 16"" Upper comes complete and ready to go onto any mil-spec AR 15 lower. This upper is built with the Adams Arms proprietary piston system. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The bolt and bolt carrier have also been protected by using an ion bond finish. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surp ammo without fear of the parts being unduly worn out. Each upper also comes with a 30 round magazine and a Wolff extra power hammer spring to ignite the older hardened primers.

I have posted some photos taken a few days ago for reference on PhotoBucket...(http://s269.photobucket.com/user/Raiderftbl/library/Sig%20Sauer%20P220R-45-%20BSS%20SIGLITE?sort=3&page=1). I would be able to throw in (3) 7 round magazines (purchased slightly used on GunBroker) and a 10 round extended mag that came new with the pistol. I paid $865 for the pistol, $103 for the magazines and $119 Rosewood grips. I cut the the Sig tag to put the new grips on the pistol. Lastly, included is a voucher for Sig Sauer for a free magazine with 10% off for a purchase from the Sig Sauer store due to the back order issue with magazines. With all that said; I know most dealers mark up the guns 15-20% and then I'd maybe lose another 10% for the pistol not being ""new"" so I have really lowered the price for this listing. Will only ship to an FFL if not local. Also, I play by the rules, so Please have a FOID permit before inquiring. The pistol is brand new and has never been fired... Everything listed and in photos is included in price. Thank you for checking it out!

The gun has had a trigger undercut performed. This procedure includes removing <1mm of material from under the trigger guard in front of the magazine release. The since such a small amount of the frame was removed, the structural strength of the frame has not been affected. The only thing this procedure does, is allow for greater shooter comfort which allows the shooter to shoot more accurately and grip this tiny gun a lot more confidently. Its a very small modification that provides a large improvement over stock. Glocks should come from the factory like this....

I picked this gun up at Tri-State in Lewiston 2 days ago (on 5/23) on an impulse because it is practically as rare as a unicorn and they happened to have it in stock. Took it to the range in Lewiston and put 1 box of 9mm through it (exactly 50 rounds) and it is as smooth as the reviews out there say. I realized that this does not serve a role that my G19 does not, so I have decided to shop it around a bit to see what I might be able to get for it. 

This is truly a sweet gun, but I just cannot justify keeping it at this time. Check out some of the youtube reviews on the PPQ. 

I am looking to get $650 out of it, but I am willing to deal. Or trade for a new(er) S&W M&P 9mm full size. I am looking for one of the M&Ps with the revised trigger mechanism that they began putting in late last year. I am also looking for a Ruger or S&W .357 revolver (not a j-frame though). 
Price: ~$650
Trades: M&P 9 full size; Ruger .357; S&W .357

Otherwise, let me know what you have and I am happy to deal. 

I am located in Moscow, ID so an FFL would be necessary for sale to WA resident. Would prefer to deal locally, but would not be against making a short trip for the right deal.

PMC ammunition is manufactured in South Korea by the Poongsan Corporation (ISO certified) which produces cartridges ranging from small arms ammunition to large howitzer rounds for the S. Korean military. The Poongsan Corporation dates back to 1968 and since its founding it has grown to become on one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of ammunition. The Poongsan Corporation's primary mission is to make South Korea fully self-reliant for their ammunition needs. Taking advantage of their high standards required through the military's reliance on their ammunition, their excess capacity is highly sought after throughout the world's commercial markets. In the United States, their reliable range ammo has become a standard for excellence and consistency.

In addition loading cartridges, PMC also manufactures all of their own components from raw materials. This complete control over the supply chain allows for PMC to control the quality of each component providing for greater consistency than ammunition loaders that source their materials from a variety of suppliers.

This precision manufactured ammunition is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, and reloadable."

This is a brand new gun. just got it in.

The  is one of the best tactical rifle values on the market today. Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level carbine features a 16"" light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with a Picatinny Rail, and heat-dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications, while the Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter. 30 + 1 capacity.

For the first 10 years or so, it was my primary carry gun, and saw a great deal of action. Primarily, I fired 38Spl from it, because I was never very good with magnums in it.

Since then, it has mostly chilled in various nightstands and storage rooms, with occasional trips to the range, or a run around town. I would estimate the round count is no more than 5k - 99% of it was 38Spl.

The hammer was bobbed early in its life, back when Ruger didn't make a spurless SP. I think the gunsmith contoured it very nicely to preserve as much hammer mass and thickness as possible.

Just recently, I had the HiViz sight put on it, which is great. The springs are all original, and over the years, the action has become lighter and smoother with use, but not as light as Wolff.

Somewhere over the years, the little pin Ruger gave to use for disassembly got away, but I always liked using a little nail more for that anyway.

*The holster is a custom-fit Milt Sparks IWB. I think they called it the ""Summer Comfort"" model or something. 
*The speedloaders are Safariland push-release, which are PERFECT for quick reloads. *The holders are also Safariland, and are like new. 
*The spare grip is Hogue Monogrip.
 More pics availabe upon request. I have the manual, but the box was cardboard back then, and I discarded it.

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users' body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail.

Far as nice I mean a arsenal milled ak, arsenal underfolder ak, Pollytec, I'd even do a yugo underfolder or polish underfolder  or any ak built on a superb parts and maker. I'd consider stamped recievers but again it depends on what you are wanting out of my beowulf package and what you are offering. I take 7.62x39 ammo on a trade as well. Really like brass ammo too.  I'd also trade for a rpd, rpk, mp40, maybe a five seven, if you have something listed above but your value lower then my whole package and you want the whole package I'd take sks, mosin, 54r ammo, ak74, makerov, 1911, Thompson new remakes of corse, ar15 in any caliber. Use your head, I'm wanting a nice ak47 and I lost the love for my beowulf. Do the math and anything mentioned I'd trade for. I can sell/trade the whole package or just the upper ect.

I unfortunately have to sell my pride and joy.  It is a Springfield XDM 9mm 4.5"" barrel ""holstered"" in a Sig Sauer Adaptive Carbine Platform.

The XDM magazines (2 included) hold 19 rounds.  The pistol itself is a very smooth shooter and includes two safeties (trigger and palm rest), a match grade barrel, and night sights. 

The ACP not only works with this pistol, but also with any other non-compact model as well as some compacts (no subcompacts to my knowledge).  It has 5 picatinny rails for attachments, accepts almost all suppressors, and is made of lightweight aircraft aluminum. Included accessories (as long as the price is right) are: 
     Laser/light with pistol grip initiator (laser and light work simultaneously if desired)
     Holographic sight with 3/8 picatinny riser (4 choices of reticles, 3 reticle sizes, and 2 color options: red or green)

The set has been fired around 150 times.  The pistol has fired around 500 rounds total.  Both are in great condition and have been well maintained.  If you have any questions, please call.
