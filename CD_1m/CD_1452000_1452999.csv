This auction is for a brand new FNH SCAR 17s in FDE (everything from the factory - paperwork, lock, FDE mag) w/ four (4) extra mags and two hundred and fifty (250) rounds of quality .308 ammunition.

As you can see in the pictures this batch of anodizing gave the upper a beautiful shade of Olive Green which has been a bit harder to find than the lighter anodized colors.

This has only been taken out of the box to verify the serial number and to take these pictures. The serial number has been blurred in the pictures. Unfortunately the 4 extra mags are black but you can easily trade them, paint them yourself, or have them cera/durakoted - the plus side is that all 5 mags are 20 rounders which have been relatively hard to find but keep popping up here and there if you're lucky. The ammunition is split into 3 50 count boxes of Magtech M80 and 5 20 count boxes of Winchester.

I would prefer FTF w/ FL ID & CWP but will ship at buyer's expense to any FFL where this is 100% legal to own.

Up for grabs is a custom PLR-16. This is NOT BY ANY MEANS a stock PLR. It is completely decked out, and rigged for complete control and added accuracy. It has been cleanly stippled. (Don't mistake this stippling for a bunch of these bad mistakes of garbage stippling) it was done from FERAL CHILD GUNWORKS. It has a barrel shroud and magpul HORIZONTAL grip added for better control and when combined with the single point makes a strong platform and can easily be ""bump-fired"". ( it's legal because its not vertical) it has a decent red-dot sight on it(it allows for a fast sight picture for speed, and with it being compact and light is great for close quarters training). A single point sling mount was added, also included is a single point para-chord sling( super strong and is about 100-150 ft survivor rope). A birdcage flash suppressor was added to improve accuracy , Comes with a stippled P-mag, tactical style case, and 2 boxes of ammo. I have it consigned a a new gun shop downtown KYLE for $1300 (it's well under what all is done to the PLR and what comes with it, as you can see if you are not new to this it is far from a stock PLR and is a bargain in today's market) .

Many state police and agencies have switched or are switching to this model for the stopping power of a .45 but the light weight and manageable recoil of a 9mm.  This gun was built for thousands of rounds with an indestructable frame and internal mechanism.  It is the same size as the Glock 17 and 22 but packs a lot more punch. 
Also included is the orignal Glock hard case, 4 boxes of range ammo, 1 box of Federal Premium Defense hollow points, loading assist, and 2 - 10 round magazines.

This is one of the most accurate, flat shooting pistols I have ever owned.  You will not be disappointed.

As you can see there is no bayonet lug, an A2 full length stock and a compensator instead of a flash suppressor at the muzzle. The barrel is a medium weight 16"" with I believe a 1 in 9 twist so it will accomodate 55 to 63 grn ammunition. The carbine has a really nice feel to it, swings easily and mounts to your shoulder very comfortably due to the A2 buttstock. The carbine is lightly used and in truly great condition even though it is probably at least 10 years old. I've shot approx 100 rounds through it and it is very accurate. The carbine will be shipped in a hard case with one 30 round magazine."

The P-01 9mm was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.

The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ's Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.

Reliability:  The U.S. Army ""Mean Rounds Between Failure"" (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!

For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN.

NIJ LEVEL I:

This armor protects against .22 caliber Long Rifle Lead Round Nose (LR LRN) bullets with nominal masses of 2.6 g (40 gr) impacting at a minimum velocity of 320 m/s (1050 ft/s) or less and 380 ACP Full Metal Jacketed Round Nose (FMJ RN) bullets with nominal masses of 6.2 g (95 gr) impacting at a minimum velocity of 312 m/s (1025 ft/s) or less.

(.44 Magnum; Submachine Gun 9mm). This armor protects against .44 Magnum, Semi Jacketed Hollow Point (SJHP) bullets with nominal masses of 15.55 g (240 gr.) impacting at a velocity of 426 m/s (1,400 ft/s) or less and against 9mm full-metal jacketed bullets with nominal masses of 8.0 g (124 gr.) impacting at a velocity of 426 m/s (1,400 ft/s) or less.

The Gewehr (rifle) M-98 was adopted by all branches of the German military in April of 1898 and it served as standard issue for the Imperial German Army until at least 1924, when a shortened Karabiner 98b was introduced. There are many anecdotal accounts of the weapon�s reliability under extreme conditions, such as cold, mud and rain in the World War I trenches, but there were also some criticisms.

The M-98 was so good that the U.S., after having been roughed-up by the Mauser equipped Spanish in Cuba when our Krag-Jorgensen service rifles were found wanting due to the inability of our troops to rapidly reload them (due to not having a stripper clip feed system), decided to build their own �98� style service rifle. Our resulting 1903 Springfield was so similar that Mauser sued the U.S. government over patent infringements and the U.S. ended up paying a royalty to Mauser for each rifle produced until our entry into the war in April 1917.

For Sale or Trade  you tell me what you have for trade I just might consider it.
Going price of this weapon is between $850 and 2 grand

It has maybe 150 rounds through it. The barrel has been has been polished with David Tubb's final finish making it very easy to clean the bore. It has a Bell and Carlson medalist stock and is very light weight. The BOSS has a muzzle break version for decreased recoil or non-muzzle break version for regular recoil but reduces the noise level vs. the muzzle break version. This makes it easy to shoot on the range with the muzzle break and easy on the ears when using it for hunting or without hearing protection. The BOSS makes it so you can tune the rifle to be extremely accurate with any load. It comes with 40 rounds of hand loaded ammunition and scope rings. I will throw in the RCBS dies for it and around 150-200 casings  for an additional $50. I also have about 2.5 lbs of H4831 sc powder if you are interested. If you have a hornady progressive press I will include a shell plate holder for a good price. Text me if you have any questions REDACTED.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.
Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability."

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."
