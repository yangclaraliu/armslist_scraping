The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

Be aware that Julie Hayden and Josh Bernstein are using this site to set up meetings with honest gun owners. I was almost scammed by them. Luckily I recognized Julie and told her she was attempting a straw purchase of my rifle (using her producer's money along with a fake name and address).

They went by the names Chris and Cheryl when they met with me. They tried to buy 30 round magazines just outside Denver claiming they were legal residents of Clear Creek County. They broke SEVERAL laws while trying to make ME out to be the bad guy.

Just be aware that they are out there. If anything smells funny walk away...or point out the illegality of their activities.

Integrating patented 2011 technology with classic 1911 design, the STI Apeiro double stack is a high capacity pistol that carries John Browning’s design into the 21st Century.

Utilizing the legendary Schuemann “Island” barrel and built on the patented modular steel frame with polymer grip, the Apeiro 2011 delivers the traditional features of a 1911 and allows the added benefit of high capacity magazines. The innovative frame design preserves the 17° angle of the grip in relation to the slide, original to the 1911. The essential design element for high capacity, the polymer grip, allows for double stack magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip, which remains comparatively the same as the circumference of a 1911.

The Apeiro 2011 couples STI’s patented receiver with all the most desirable accessories in a factory firearm to produce a pistol that is as beautiful as it is reliable. The controls are STI International’s stainless steel ambidextrous thumb safeties and knuckle relief high-rise beavertail grip safety.

The full length stainless steel bar stock slide features STI’s unique sabertooth rear cocking serrations and is cut to match the Schuemann barrel. The barrel is a 5.0"" fully ramped, fully supported “island” bull barrel, with the sight milled in to allow faster recovery to point of aim.

This pistol comes standard with an STI square hammer, patented STI trigger system, STI S-7 sear, and titanium strut for smooth, reliable function. The Apeiro 2011 has custom engravings on the polished sides of the (blued) stainless steel slide, stainless steel magwell, STI adjustable rear sight, Dawson fiber optic front sight, and a blued frame.

Each set includes: 1 Selector Lock, 1 Selector shaft, 1 Selector Pin, and 1 Sear Release. I am asking $35 shipped for each one of these sets. These sets are used, and therefor will show expected finish wear but nothing out of the ordinary. Other than that, there is no major rust or pitting. As far as I know these are 100% legal to own (atleast where I'm at with NO special stamps/taxes/paperwork/licenses). They are commonly used to make ""Dummy Kits"" which attach to the stock and give the M1A a more authentic appearance. These are recognized as simply gun parts, and are not subject to any special federal regulation. ***Make sure there are no Local/State laws or other restrictions that would prohibit you from puchasing/owning/possessing these where YOU are located!***

- 4 Factory 50 round magazines


I can ship to an FFL or meet FTF.  For face to face, I can do $2,900....Otherwise, it will be $3,000 shipped to your FFL.  I can separate the ammo for FTF and if the cost is right, otherwise it will be in the package.


My price isn't set in stone but when comparing other listings, it seems this package would add 1,000 rounds of ammo for $400 more than some of the other listings for new PS90's....and that is a good deal.


Email for any questions by responding to the ad, Thanks!

*****************************UPDATES********************************
NEW OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE BUYER!!!!

- I can sell everything but the ammo for $2,000.
- I am open to trades for FTF.
- I can sell the ammo separately if I have a buyer for the rifle and accessories first.

I can also reduce the cost by removing some of the ammo as well.  So if you know you are interested in this rifle and set up, I can be flexible in the price to meet your budgetary constraints per removing ammo.


We can talk or meet FTF.  Either way works but this is not a scam.  It is just a good deal on a nice rifle, accessories, and ammunition.

FROM THE RUGER PRESS ROOM
RUGER INTRODUCES NEW PLATFORM IN RUGER GUNSITE SCOUT RIFLE
December 29, 2010

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) is proud to announce the Ruger® Gunsite Scout Rifle, the ideal ""fighting carbine"" in .308 Winchester that is a credible rendition of Col. Jeff Cooper's Scout Rifle concept. Cooper called for a relatively lightweight, hard hitting, do-all rifle that in the hands of an accomplished shooter was able to place accurate, sustained fire out to long ranges, yet was quick-handling and light enough for all-day carry.

Developed in conjunction with Gunsite instructor Ed Head, the Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle is a new platform in the Ruger M77® family. While the Scout Rifle has M77 features such as controlled round feed and integral scope mounts (scope rings included), the 10-round detachable box magazine is the first clue this isn't your grandfather's Ruger rifle.

""Ruger has taken an in depth look at the intended purpose of a Scout Rifle and developed a full-featured rifle designed to meet the Scout Rifle criteria of hunt, fight, defend,"" says Head. ""This firearm offers outstanding features in an affordable, versatile and reliable rifle designed to deliver .308 Winchester performance in a variety of situations. It is compact, lightweight, offers 10-round box magazines, can be fit to the individual shooter, and accommodates a host of optics. It is a serious rifle for those serious about rifles.""

The Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle has a 16.5"" medium contour, cold hammer-forged, alloy steel barrel with a Mini-14® protected non-glare post front sight and receiver mounted, adjustable ghost ring rear sight for out-of-the-box usability. A forward mounted Picatinny rail offers options in mounting an assortment of optics - including Scout Scopes available from Burris® and Leupold®, for ""both eyes open"" sighting and super-fast target acquisition.

A Mini-14/SR-556® flash suppressor is effective on reducing the muzzle flash that may be present on some .308 Winchester loads when fired out of the short (16.5"") barrel. The 5/8-24 muzzle threads allow most standard .30 caliber muzzle accessories - flash suppressors, muzzle brakes, and sound suppressors - to be installed.

The Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle features a matte black oxide alloy steel barrel and receiver on a black laminate stock with sling swivel studs and checkered grip and forearm. A soft rubber recoil pad, with three 1/2"" spacers allows the length of pull to be adjusted and allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or to give the shooter the proper fit with outerwear or defensive gear of varying thickness. With its compact size and weighing in at just under seven pounds, the Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle combines ease of carry and shooting for the serious Scout Rifle enthusiast.

The rifle's trigger guard and magazine well are formed with glass-reinforced nylon. The magazine release is a push-forward Mini-14 paddle just ahead of the trigger guard. ""Gunsite Scout Rifle"" is engraved on the grip cap of the laminated, weather resistant stock, and the receiver is roll-marked ""Ruger Gunsite Scout"", commemorating the collaboration of Ruger with Gunsite Academy, America's oldest private firearms training facility.

As they say, beware the man with one gun, for he probably knows how to use it. Never has this been more true than with the Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle, the one rifle to have if you could only have one. It is the perfect lightweight, hard-hitting, do-it-all bolt-action rifle - where rugged, reliable Ruger meets the practical, tactical."

Iv shot 300 rounds through it, it has fed flawlessly and never given me a hiccup. I really like it, but I've been bitten by the 1911 bug and I dont think Ill be satisfied until I buy one. So I've decided to try and trade out my xdm for a Kimber. I bought this on the 1st of the year, taken it shooting twice, fed it a variety of ammo, no FTF or malfunctions. 
Im looking to sell the whole setup; gun, with the standard kit that comes from Springfield, the 243 rounds I have on hand, and the extra 16 round mag Iv bought for it.
So that covers 223 rounds of fmj (a few different brands), 20 rounds of jhp (remington), two 16 round mags, one 11 round mag, speed loader, paddle holster, case, lock, two mag holster, mag extensions and different sized back straps.
The gun is in perfect condition, looks like it just came out of the box. This is the closest you will get to a new gun.
The only thing Iv done is hand polished the feed ramp, that's all.

So heres what I spent.
$650 for the gun
$45 for the extra mag
$120 for the ammo.

$815 total price.

Ill entertain the closest offers to that number.
I have no need to sell it, but Im trying to fill the 1911 lust. 
I would be willing to entertain trade offers for a decent 1911, preferably a Kimber.

As far as splitting it all up; Ill sell the gun and extra mag without the ammo for $700. Ill sell the ammo for $120 but only if the gun is already gone."

The little pistols were equipped with a 2 inch barrel, fixed sights, checkered hard rubber grips on early models and walnut on later, or factory pearl grips, could be finished in either blue or nickel, and were chambered in .25 ACP.  This 1916 vintage Model 1908 is blue finished and has the factory pearl grips with silver Colt medallions.  It is a very nice example of the smallest of the Colt autos.  This gun retains 95%+ plus of its original blue finish, has a great bore and the pearl grips are perfect and show no wear.  The bright color case-hardening on the trigger, thumb safety and grip safety is about 98 to 99%.  This is a beautiful example of its type and is 100% untouched and original.  Included with the gun is its original box, and even though it is in tattered condition, it does number to the gun.  A great little Model 1908, especially attractive with the pearl grips.

Sig Sauer Mosquito .22 Digital Desert Camouflage with 2 mags and threaded adapter as the title states. 

There are light signs of wear ion the top of the chamber where the slide rubs the blued metal, (light) and there are light signs of wear where regrettably the slide rubbed during disassembly and reassembly for cleaning. I did this after every time it was fired. You must be careful during this process so you do not mar the finish. This damage was there when I got the pistol, but I did make it a little worse getting in a hurry once. You can see the pictures to see the extent of the wear.

The pistol shoots great and looks awesome. I love it, it feels like you have a real pistol in your hand not a toy, and it is an accurate shooter... but alas I need funds for other projects, so nothing gained without sacrifice. I am asking $425.00 for what I have in to it. It has 1 spare magazine with threaded adapter.

The nickel finish on the cylinder has some freckling and the hammer and trigger have most of their original color case-hardening.  The grips are in very nice condition with only some minor handling marks.  The bore is bright (looks like a new one) and the action is tight, functioning smoothly and precisely.  A very handsome looking revolver."

A little about the FN FAL design:
The Fusil Automatique Léger (""Light Automatic Rifle"") or FAL is a self-loading, selective fire battle rifle produced by the Belgian armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN). During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by over 90 countries

The FAL was predominantly chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO round, and because of its prevalence and widespread use among the armed forces of many NATO countries during the Cold War it was nicknamed ""The right arm of the Free World"""
