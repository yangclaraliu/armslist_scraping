Might want to buy ahead of the much-discussed assault weapon ban, because if it goes into effect as written this version of the venerable SIG556 will no longer be available!

I have only fired around 100 rounds through this rifle since I bought it new. This rifle features a collapsible folding stock, a flip-up rear sight and I have also installed the Sig Sauer Red-Dot sight, which co-witnesses perfectly with the fixed sights.  I have also installed a Grip-Pod fore-grip that converts to a bi-pod with the push of a button.  

Everything you see in the photos goes with the rifle, including the SIG hard case, lock, and owner’s manual.

You can’t find any SIG556s on the shelves right now, and if the ban passes there may not be any more available. Get it while you still can!

Let me know if you have any questions. CASH only, not interested in any trades – FTF with valid ODL.

Here are the factory specs:
“The SIG556 is chambered in .223/5.56mm and accepts any of the many available standard M16-type magazines. 

From the Manufacturer's site:
( http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/sig556-er.aspx )

SIG556® ER features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The flash suppressor uses a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The forearm housing the gas operating system is a vented non-slip polymer featuring the SIG TriRail design with three integrated Picatinny rails for mounting accessories. The optional flip up front combat sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. The Picatinny rail equipped receiver is made of high strength steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron® finish. The Picatinny rail features an optional flip up rear sight that works in concert with the optional front combat sight, providing iron sight performance and a back up sight option for optics. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The rifle comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR magazines. A 30-round magazine is supplied with each rifle. The collapsible buttstock features a rubber butt pad, multiple sling attachment points, and a waterproof battery compartment. The ergonomically designed pistol grip features an integrated storage compartment. Select versions feature a folding stock with the ability to collapse, providing the best of both worlds.”"

It's carpet lined and has four steel shelves that will hold the weight of anything.

It's 35 X 20 X 60 inches, with places for 9 long guns and lots of room for handguns, ammo and accessories.

It takes an ordinary padlock, but it has a hooded latch pocket to protect the lock and latch. There are holes in the back for anchoring the safe to wall studs.

I guess the main body is made of at least 1/8 inch plate.  I didn't build it.  I did mic the exposed edges and found that the latch hood is made of .130 inch steel, bent and welded; the long vertical of the shelves is .140, the shelves themselves seemed to be .129 to .134.  The side guards were pretty consistent at .134.  The hasp or locking bar is 1/4"" with a hole big enough for a 5/16"" padlock. The designer strengthened the common weak points of home safes.   All edges are doubled, and the door overlaps and pockets the safe opening by 1.5 inches.  The hinges are completely covered and protected against prying or punching.

Bring a come-along, a buddy or winch to load it.

$425 or best offer means that I am accepting offers on this safe, but before you lowball me, come and see it.

If you're reading this, then I still have the safe available for sale."

The Lee Deluxe Rifle 3 Die set is perfect for the beginning or experienced reloader. The set is made of steel and includes a full length sizing die, collet neck sizing die and bullet seating die. Use the full length sizing die to produce ammunition to factory-new specifications using cases fired in other guns. The collet neck sizing die will allow you to produce ammunition that is fire-formed to the chamber of one rifle.

Lee Precision has been producing some of the highest quality reloading equipment for over 50 years. Their Deluxe 3-Die Sets for rifle cartridges are no different. They are made to tight tolerances to help reloaders make consistent and accurate ammunition. These die sets are perfect for both beginning and seasoned reloaders. Each die is made of steel and the set comes with a full length sizing die, collet neck sizing die and bullet seating die. Reloaders use the full length sizing die to produce ammunition to factory-new specifications using new brass or brass cases that were fired in other guns. Full length sizing dies are also great for the reloader who wants to ensure each round loaded will chamber in their rifle with ease. The collet neck sizing die allows reloaders to product ammunition that has been fire-formed to the chamber of that rifle. Since only the neck is sized more force may be required to get each round to chamber but brass life is extended and a lot of reloaders see an increase in accuracy. This set also includes a bullet seating die, shellholder, powder dipper, storage box and load data.

These are BRAND NEW to the market. They are loaded loaded by Fiocchi using Fiocchi brass (and I would assume other components as well) and are branded for Tula (box is marked ""Made in Italy""). Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 2 boxes available (100 rounds total). Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush. 

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

Original box and a single 9-round speed loader.  Bought it new in 1982 and might have put 50 rounds through it decades ago.  The heavy barrel feels very good in your hands and I've read where some said it felt like it was a .38 instead of a .22 in heft.  As you can see in the pix it has adjustable sights.  It has a heavy double action trigger pull (probably caused by liability lawyers) but the single action let off is good.  The cylinder is notched so you can dry fire it without damaging the firing pin.

If you don't know about this rifle and what makes it amazing, look up the videos on youtube or read the reviews from websites that have actually fired it. It also won an award as rifle of the year in 2009 (I believe). Long story short, it has an innovative system that basically makes it a mix between an AR and AK. You can fire this rifle with the stock folded, and it already has all of the features on it that often gets added in the aftermarket (rails, collapsible stock, pistol grip). This will also go up in value as Para has stopped producing rifles. 

This is probably one of the few AR's you can find anywhere right now that is being sold for what it is actually worth. The MSRP on this is $2500.

I have owned handguns and shotguns before, but never a rifle. I wanted this to be my first, since I know it will also go up in value, but now I'm realizing that I'm not a rifle guy. I don't have time to learn proper technique, or try to join a club just so I can shoot it outside. 

$2800 if you take everything listed. I would be willing to take cash, trades, or combinations such as:

- A combination of NEW firearms and accessories
- NEW firearms, accessories and cash

I'm looking for handguns and shotguns. Will also take accessories such as lasers for a Glock, ammo, etc.

I'll be including two of the polymer 30rd mags. This is a great rifle, and everything is straight on it. The finish is good but not perfect. There are some of the expected handling marks on the finish. I have installed a dragunov style stock. It has been caringly broken in just enough to operate perfectly smooth and reliably, but certainly not worn out or abused. The bolt and trigger surfaces have been polished to insure that everything travels very smoothly. The double-hook trigger on these is superb. I have no problem maintaining a 3"" group at 100-150 yards with cheap Wolf ammo. I did install a new complete recoil spring assembly last month. I have/had many different AK's and the Norinco models are among my very favorite. Unlike many other variants, the Chinese AK's haven't been imported since it was banned in 1994. There are a lot of them out there, but it does serve to make them more desirable and collectible than many other variants. Also, please be clear that the MAK-90 stands head and shoulders above any cheap Romanian, or any cheap piece of junk you've ever seen from Century Arms or IO. I also have 500 rounds of wolf non-corrosive ammo that I'll be selling separately for $250. It is sealed in plastic and in 20ct boxes.

MAKs are better than most AKs presently on the market in the U.S. because:

1) It is not a ""parts"" gun. It is 100% assembled in a foreign arsenal that has been making AKs for decades. This means no canted front sights or other shoddy workmanship. 2) It has a 1.5 mm stamped receiver where most AKs have a 1 mm. This means less heat fatigue in the weapon under hard use. 3) The barrel is thicker than most AKs. How much? Not exactly sure but the difference is visible to the naked eye. 4) The chamber and barrel are chrome lined. Why would anyone want a fighting rifle with out this vital combat feature? 5) The trigger is a double hook. This means a much smoother trigger pull than a single hook. There is no trigger slap. 6) It is selling for a lot less than the fancy Vegas Arsenal with comparable quality in everything but finish and cosmetics. 7) They were imported by the hundreds of thousands. You will be able to find plenty of parts and upgrades/accessories.

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

Might want to buy ahead of the much-discussed assault weapon ban, because if it goes into effect as written this version of the venerable SIG556 will no longer be available!

I have only fired around 100 rounds through this rifle since I bought it new. This rifle features a collapsible folding stock, a flip-up rear sight and I have also installed the Sig Sauer Red-Dot sight, which co-witnesses perfectly with the fixed sights. I have also installed a Grip-Pod fore-grip that converts to a bi-pod with the push of a button. 

Everything you see in the photos goes with the rifle, including the SIG hard case, lock, and owner’s manual.

You can’t find any SIG556s on the shelves right now, and if the ban passes there may not be any more available. Get it while you still can!

Let me know if you have any questions. CASH only, not interested in any trades – FTF with valid ODL.

Here are the factory specs:
 “The SIG556 is chambered in .223/5.56mm and accepts any of the many available standard M16-type magazines. 

From the Manufacturer's site:
 ( http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/sig556-er.aspx )

SIG556® ER features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The flash suppressor uses a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The forearm housing the gas operating system is a vented non-slip polymer featuring the SIG TriRail design with three integrated Picatinny rails for mounting accessories. The optional flip up front combat sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. The Picatinny rail equipped receiver is made of high strength steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron® finish. The Picatinny rail features an optional flip up rear sight that works in concert with the optional front combat sight, providing iron sight performance and a back up sight option for optics. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The rifle comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR magazines. A 30-round magazine is supplied with each rifle. The collapsible buttstock features a rubber butt pad, multiple sling attachment points, and a waterproof battery compartment. The ergonomically designed pistol grip features an integrated storage compartment. Select versions feature a folding stock with the ability to collapse, providing the best of both worlds.”"

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

This gun is based on the Ruger Ranch Rifle design but uses a rotary magazine instead of the staggered box magazine of the Ranch rifle and Mini-14 rifles. This is a great gun and shoots reliably. Scope rings are included.

The basic specifications of the Ruger Deerfield carbine, taken from the 2006 Strum, Ruger catalog, read as follows:

Caliber: .44 Remington Magnum; Finish: Blued; Stock: hardwood; Sight: gold bead front, adjustable flip up rear sight ; Barrel length: 18.5""; Overall length: 37""; Weight: 6.25 lbs.; Suggested MSRP price in 2006 was $702.00. This is a great brushgun, home defence carbine or for hunting deer from a tree stand. It is chambered in 44 magnum and packs a punch for a carbine. Touch a round off from this rifle and burglars lose interest in your home.

It has one small scratch near butt plate.  See pic.

Offered with the barrel is 150 rounds of 357 Sig. 100 Ranger T-series and 50 Winchester target loads- all 125 grain. If you've been curious about this caliber and considering giving it a try, this is a good opportunity. The barrel has had 50 rounds fired through it.

I'm pricing $85 for the barrel, $25 per box of Ranger, and $20 for the box of target loads. Might separate. 

Sorry no shipping, must meet in Tulsa or Broken Arrow. Thanks!"
