Colorado Magazine Ban to be Heard in Committee Tuesday

Let Your Voice Be Heard and Oppose HB13-1224
HB13-1224 is proposed legislation that prohibits the sale, transfer, or possession of an ammunition feeding device capable of accepting, or that can be converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition or more than 5 shotgun shells. A hearing on this bill will be held before the House Judiciary Committee this Tuesday, Feb. 12.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation is urging all sportsmen, hunters and gun owners to attend Tuesday's public hearing to be held at the State Capitol building in the Old Supreme Court Chambers which could be adjourned as early as 9 am. NSSF urges Colorado citizens to contact their state representative, senator and all members of the House Judiciary Committee immediately, urging them to oppose this magazine ban.

This Tuesday might be the only chance for your voice to be heard before legislators push through legislation that will seriously affect not only your Second Amendment rights, but also the magazines you use in your rifles and handguns. Colorado manufacturers will be directly affected, as well, resulting in the loss of good paying jobs and badly needed tax revenue to the state.

If this bill passes, law-abiding gun owners, retailers and manufacturers will be the only ones to comply since criminals won't abide by a magazine restriction. Arbitrarily limiting magazine capacity and threatening law-abiding gun owners with possible confiscation and felony charges represents serious legislative overreach. As part of the 1994 ""Assault Weapons"" ban, the production of higher capacity magazines was halted. A comprehensive study by the Centers for Disease Control looked at the full panoply of gun-control measures, including this ban, and concluded that none could be proven to reduce crime. Another study, commissioned by Congress, found that bans were not effective since ""the banned weapons and magazines were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders.""

MUST USE A ZEISS VARIPOINT WITH CORESPONDING IC CONTROL. YOUR CHOICE OF SIDEPLATES ( SHOWN BELOW ) THIS IS THE NEW R8 MODEL FROM BLASER. ALL OF THE GREAT BLASER FEATURES PLUS MORE. YOUR CHOICE OF SIDEPLATES. A New Era of Perfection ""The beginning of a new era of perfection"", is how Blaser CEO Bernhard Knoebel has named the launch of the new Blaser bolt action rifle R8 in his preface of the brand-new catalog. For the past five years, there has been one lingering question for the hunters and engineers at Blaser, regarding the Blaser bolt action rifle R93: How can this technically superior concept be taken to the next level? In order to answer this question the Blaser engineers, most of them passionate hunters themselves, kept a close connection to hunters around the world in order to respond to their requests. Detachable Magazine When the development of the R8 actually started the detachable magazine was right at the top of the optimization list. Blaser found an ergonomically superior solution that essentially supports fast and intuitive handling. Magazine and trigger unit merged into one compact module. The magazine buttons are positioned right above the trigger guard. Thus, the magazine can be released blindly and within a split second. When removing the magazine, the R8 automatically de-cocks and once the magazine is removed, the cocking slide cannot engage anymore. Today, this is a very important safety feature securing the rifle against misuse by unauthorized persons. Blaser Precision Trigger The detachable magazine is just one of a multitude of innovations that turn the R8 into the new worldwide benchmark when it comes to bolt action rifles. Enhancing the reliable and precise performance of the trigger posed a very special engineering challenge that has been brilliantly mastered. The new Blaser Precision Trigger breaks crisp as glass at a trigger pull of 750 gram / 1 5/8 lbs. Thanks to its extremely short release time it turns the shooter’s thought impulse immediately into an accurate shot. The innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing, which marks the next leap in rifle technology. The desmodromic trigger mechanism offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Perfect Stock In order to make shooting with the R8 as comfortable and safe as possible, Blaser attached immense importance to optimizing the stock, reaching a new level of perfection here, too. Different from traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. This results in increased muzzle stability and a substantial reduction of felt recoil. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Design Besides achieving maximum performance, Blaser gave particular attention to superior style and design. Concave and convex lines discreetly shape the rifles appearance. Contours of stock, action, mount and bolt handle blend perfectly, giving the R8 a dynamic and unequaled elegance"

Is catching up, and allowing the gun to fire single shot . Has to be re cocked every time u shoot a round. I would personally buy a new block for the magazine cover soon, because I think that's part of the problem . I took this gun on trade, and would live to keep it but I need the money right now . my buddy that I buy most of my firearm accessories said it would cost approx 135 out the door to get it operating smoothly . You will also need to buy new magazines . Gun comes without magazine . It takes an Uzi type magazine and are not hard to find online . This gun is worth a lot more than I'm asking, the lower alone is worth 799 so for what I'd like to get for the rifle your gettin a great deal. Sold as-is . Spring issue in upper, and I think it's because it hangin up on the block in the magazine compartment or somethin. All I know is its a simple fix for some one that know these guns . And rock river lower alone is worth a good amount. The upper is dpms to the best my knowledge ."

Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

T/C Omega .50 caliber muzzle loader with black synthetic stock and blued barrel... Also has a Nikon Omega 3-9x40 scope with BDC reticle on it that is made specifically for this gun. 

Getting rid of it because it is taking up space and just have not really gotten into muzzle loader season... I bought it a few years ago and have maybe shot it a total of 8 to 10 times... just enough to sight it in and make sure its still 'on' about once a year.  Has been fairly well cleaned after every time shot. 

However, due to whatever residue that has gotten left behind, the bore is in questionable shape. Everything besides the bore (rest of gun and scope) is 99%.  I do not have any experience with cleaning up guns in this kind of shape, therefore I do not really know what to ask or if it will still be a good shooter.  I have cleaned it up considerably but it still needs some work.  So I encourage you to take a look at it before making any decisions and let me know what you think. 

Because of this, I am willing to let it go pretty cheap. The gun could be cleaned up and be just fine or it might not... like I said, I don't really know.  Kind of a gamble.  I am open to any offers/suggestions for this gun since I do not use it and it has possible issues.  Let me know what you think.  Just to throw a number out there... I was thinking $300 for the gun/scope.  I will sell the scope by itself if you want it for $200 and throw in the rings and bases if they work for you. The scope is Like New with all original packaging. $120 for gun alone.

This is a Nickle Plated with a checkered stock an fourarm, first made by savage, then in the mid 40's it became the savage-steavens 322-h the last series ran.  Savage did not call this shotgun a coach gun, but a home defense weapon.  Take my word it is a great home defense shotgun with two full choke barrels.  It does have a slight kick to it, but it is not that bad that is if you are use to shotguns.  This is one of most intimidating shot guns that an entruder would ever face.

345,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1043345,For Sale:  HK USP 40 aka H&K .40 aWeSoMe,"North, Colorado Springs, Colorado","$ 1,000","Listed On: Sunday, February 10, 2013",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"I will trade for compact 1911 or 2 Glocks.

The Heckler & Koch USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) is the first HK pistol designed especially for the demanding needs of the American shooter. Features favored by US civilian, law enforcement, and military users provided the design criteria for the USP. Its controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous and successful designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. And like the Model 1911, the USP can be safely carried ""cocked and locked"". 

 The control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible; unlike the slide mounted safeties common on many pistols. The USP control lever has a positive stop and returns to the ""fire"" position after decocking.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special HK recoil reduction system (patent pending), the USP is built to take the punishment of the most powerful .40 caliber loads. And unlike most other .40 caliber pistols, the HK USP was designed as a ""forty"" -- it was never ""scaled up"" from an existing 9mm pistol model.

The polymer frame of the USP was designed using technical experience gained by HK engineers in the development of the world's first composite material pistols, the VP70Z and P9S. This same high-stregth/corrosion free material is used in the .45 ACP handgun designed by Heckler & Koch for the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in 1992. 

 Major metal components on the USP are also corrosion resistant. Outside metal surfaces are protected by an extremely hard, nitro-gas carburized black oxide finish. Internal metal parts are coated with a special Dow Corning anti-corrosion process the reduces friction and wear. The HK USP is presently available in calibers .45 ACP, .40 S&W and 9mm Parabellum. Other calibers will be available in the future.

The design characteritics of the HK USP provide a wide range of flexibility for users. The 9mm model of the USP carries sixteen cartridges, fifteen in the magazine, plus one in the chamber. The .40 caliber model holds a total of fourteen of .40 S&W cartridges, thirteen in the magazine plus one in the chamber.

By using a modular opproach to the internal components, the control lever function of the HK USP can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger/firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action Note: Trigger/firing mode conversion can only be made by a HK certified armorer.

I would like $1000 or best offer.

Cash $275 FIRM or TRADE: we add small ""cash boot"" for Ruger MkII, Ruger SR-22, Walther P22, Sig Mosquito, or Browning Buckmark.

This is our Kel-Tec P32 light handgun.  This was purchased new for a lady to pass her concealed carry permit test.  This Keltec performed flawlessly.  The total round count on this pistol is less than 120 and we believe the EXACT round count is 114.  This perfect carry pistol will come with original case w/trigger lock and manual, one magazine, canvas holster, and TWO boxes of Federal Premium Personal Defense 65-grain Hydra-Shok JHP (Jacketed Hollow-Point).  Note, the boxes are 20-count, though one box has 19 rounds as we fired one hollow-point to ensure the pistol would cycle Hydra-Shok - it performed flawlessly.  We are selling as the lady recently acquired a Sig P238.

We are in Copperhill and prefer to meet FTF at ""The Pig"" aka the Piggly-Wiggly in Ducktown (far SE Tennessee - 70 miles east of Chatanooga).

Please, if you are a Felon or prohibited person - refer to Title 18 United States Code Section 922(g)&(n) - do not contact us, period!

Cash price is exactly $275 FIRM.  (This ""fair market value"" is derived by the statistical average of 18 similar Kel-Tec P-32s listed nationally on Armslist at an average price of $275.55 - without ammo; the Hydra-Shok ammo costs $26/box, the holster was about $20.  The MSRP of this pistol new is in the low $300's).  OUR CASH PRICE IS FIRM.

TRADE OPTIONS: We add cash boot for .22 Target or Tactical Pistol.  Bull barrel target pistol a plus.  We will respond to all RESPECTFUL inquires.  Please first contact via email then telephone; we are TOO OLD to text.

THE TECHNICAL DETAILS:
The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.  The firing mechanism is double action only.  The magazine has a 7 round capacity.  The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made (about 1/2-pound fully loaded).  With its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger pistols.  The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, a police ""bootgun,"" or for concealed carry by licensed citizens.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Caliber:  32 AUTO
Weight unloaded:  6.6 oz.
Loaded magazine:  2.8 oz.
Length:  5.1""
Height:  3.5""
Width:  .75""
Barrel Length:  2.7""
Sight radius:  3.8""
Muzzle Energy Max:  200ft-lbs
Capacity:  7 + 1 rounds
Trigger Pull:  5 lbs

The P-32 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

Hey guys I have a brand new Saiga-12 with a 20rd drum and 5rd mag that has exactly 10 shells through it, also I have a door breacher flash suppresser on it. All in all i spent well over a grand for all of it and the value of these shotguns has gone up considerably. Now these shotguns are very hot right now I dont think I need to explain how cool these are.......If there are any questions i'd be happy to answer and of course send pics. I also know several smith's to convert it and for a really reasonable price as well if that is what you intend to do. The price is listed as 1400.00 however it should be 1200.00 im not sure why it wont correctly list that........thanks and hope we all can stand united against the possible attacks on our 2nd amendment."

I am not looking to price gouge anyone, I simply would like to sell the pistol by itself for the $520 that I purchased it for before WA sales tax.  I'll eat the $40 sales tax I paid as well as any paid sales tax on accessories.  I have all my original receipts to support the details of this gun as well as accessories, I simply want for it/them what I paid.

I have all receipts to support these fair and honest prices, I just don't want to go too far backwards if I can avoid it.  

the pistol sale/trade is my first priority, any and all additional listed accessories are either part of the pistol deal or sold after the pistol is sold separately, but not before.

I am willing to make a fair deal if you are interested in purchasing or trading for the entire listing.  This would set a guy up with a great new - conceal and carry pistol, several additional magazines and a swath of ammo all in one shot!

Transaction MUST be a certified Cashiers check or an agreed upon fair trade.  I reserve the right to require a completed bill of sale and or use of an FFL dealer if necessary.

GET IT BEFORE THE BAN!  THIS IS A TRUE M4 & NOT AN M4-GERY!  Designed specifically for lightweight mobility, speed of target acquisition, and potent firepower capability - the Colt® Law Enforcement Carbine delivers. This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military Colt M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30.5 in (77.5 cm) in length and weighs only 6.8 lb (3.08 kg).  Colt's Law Enforcement Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. The handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection, while the muzzle compensator reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures.

The upper has all of the standard features such as a forward assist, shell deflector and dust cover over the ejection port. More notable is the detachable carry handle—complete with A2 sights—and the 1913 rail giving you the option to mount optics or rear-sights.  

Additional specs that differentiate this AR from the others-16 inch government profile barrel with M203 notch, 4150 chromoly vanadium steel, A2 bird cage flash hider, 1/7 inch twist ratio, M4 feed ramps, individual magnetic particle inspected bolt and not batch tested, individual high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected barrel, H marked buffer, F marked front sight base, Mil-spec buffer tube, mil-std 1913 picatinny top rail.

I personally traced the serial number back to 1888 which makes this a early model(early=rare=$$$$$$). As is, this gun is in firing condition, and looks good enough to hang over your fireplace.

 Caliber: 38 S&W (Not to be confused with 38 special)

 Item Description: Known as the 38 safety hammerless or ""lemon squeezer""

 FUNCTIONAL INFO:
 The gun itself is in excellent conditon. It doesn't appear to have been fired a whole lot. 

The rifling is strong. Cylinder lock-up is excellent with no play. The top-latch is tight with no wiggle. 

DETAIL INFO:
 Took a trip by S&W forum and they tell me nickel finish has either been redone or someone finished the parts that are not nickel finished stock i.e. the trigger and top break latch. They also informed me that it is a safety hammerless fourth model which basically means it is more of a shooter and not ""ultra collectable"" like a safety hammerless first model would be. The fact that its a shooter is why the price is as such because if it was a first model they tend to demand more of a premium."

I was originally looking for a S&W 15-22, but settled for this instead. I recently found a good deal on a 15-22, so I dont need this one anymore. Never had a chance to take it to the range, so it has never been fired. Build date on box of December 6, 2012.

When I got it, it didnt have any sights included, so I had to order a set from Sig for $80+ shipping (http://sigsauer.com/SigStore/522-sight-set-397.aspx). I had a local gunsmith install them, and he managed a few scratches under/around the front sight post, but except for that, its in pristine condition (as I said, never made it to the range). It also includes an extra Black Dog machine 25 round magazine (2 25 round magazines total).

The price is simply what I put into it, with the original purchase price plus the extra magazine and sights. Not interested in any trades, thanks."

This has been a fantastic rifle for me. Anyone who is familiar with these two brands knows the quality and craftsmanship associated with them. The upper is an Land Warfare Resources Co. (LWRC) piston operated system. The LMT lower features a BCM medium charging handle, teflon-coated 6-position mil-spec buffer tube with an H-2 buffer (VLTOR buttstock). The trigger is a mil-spec rounded hammer control group. 

I put an OD green coat of DuraCoat on it and it has served me well. Some of the DuraCoat is wearing off. This can be easily covered up with another coat of OD or even FDE DuraCoat or even Cerekote. Personally, I never liked showing up to the range looking like my rifle was straight out of the box anyway. 

The gun is spectacularly clean and runs FLAWLESSLY. It will eat any ammo you put through its ultra-reliable and clean piston system. I have taken two carbine courses with it and I have never had any issues. The only reason I am selling is that I just bought another LWRC and I want to buy a can for it... turns out shooting is an expensive hobby.
