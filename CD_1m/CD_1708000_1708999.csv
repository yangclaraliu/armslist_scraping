Has no excessive abuse marks for a gun this age. I have shot this gun and it is extremely accurate. It will surprise you. For shooting at long distances it is awesome.

Hornady 9mm 135 Grain FlexLock Critical Duty Ammunition - a - 50 Rounds per Box

Introducing the most consistent and reliable barrier ammo on the market.

1) FLEXLOCK® BULLET incorporates two revolutionary Hornady features: the patented Flex Tip® that initiates consistent expansion every single time while preventing any clogging, and the heavy duty InterLock® band that locks the jacket and core together.

2) CANNELURED BULLET WITH CRIMPED CASE ensures no bullet setback during feeding.

3) INTERLOCK® BAND works to keep the bullet and core from separating for maximum weight retention and proven terminal performance through all FBI test barriers.

4) CORE is made of high-antimony lead making it extremely tough, delivering controlled expansion for unparalleled terminal performance consistency through all FBI test barriers. It’s also more economical than similar bonded bullets.

5) NICKEL-PLATED CASES resist corrosion and greatly enhance low-light chamber checks.

Critical DUTY®

Law enforcement and tactical professionals now have a truly advanced, 21st century handgun ammunition solution that delivers the most consistent and reliable urban barrier performance ever created!

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Chambers and triggers are also match grade. They are easier to carry and conceal, and are perfectly balanced.

Like some full-size Kimber pistols, both Pro Carry RL models have an integral Picatinny rail for light mounting. Along with TLE and designated night sight models, they also have Meprolight® night sights. 

All Kimber pistols have slide serrations with beveled edges that will not snag clothing or holsters. Serrations are deep and wide to ensure positive grip even with wet or cold hands.

Kimber mid-size pistols are an ideal compromise of size and weight. With a variety of options and features, they cover every need from duty and concealed carry to home defense. More importantly, these pistols do not compromise quality or dependability. The Tacoma, Washington, P.D. extensively tested Pro Carry models, finding them to be the most dependable firearm put through the paces in over 20 years. They checked the records, comparing Kimber not only with other pistols, but rifles and shotguns as well. 

When you carry a Kimber, you carry with absolute confidence.

The GLOCK 26 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""BABY GLOCK""-the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

Lasergrips promote faster shooting, positive target acquisition and are tremendous training aids.

Custom touches include a recessed slide stop pin and elegant two-tone non-reflective finish. Crimson Carry frames are machined from solid bricks of premium aluminum-dramatically reducing weight for easier carry. Match grade triggers break crisp and clean. 

Little things make a big difference in performance. Kimber pistols are enhanced with custom features like an extended thumb safety lever with deep serrations for positive grip and Commander-style hammers that will not cut or snag.

Having confidence in a carry pistol is critical. Dependability and accuracy proven through repeated practice increases confdence. Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a bright red dot downrange, an important aid in training. Reading the dot immediately shows the advantage of proper grip and trigger control, which can dramatically improve accuracy and reduce time between shots for any level of shooter. Crimson Carry pistols come with Crimson Trace Lasergrips; the finest laser sight available today. Combining that advantage with Kimber quality makes Crimson Carry pistols an unbeatable value. Offered in three sizes, they are ideal for law enforcement, home defense or concealed carry.

All slides and frames are paired in the early stages of production and travel through the factory together, ensuring optimum fitting of every part. This is one reason Kimber pistols have unequaled performance and dependability.

Custom features like high ride beavertail grip safety, extended thumb safety and Commander-style hammer are part of every Kimber pistol. All parts are made inside the Kimber factory, ensuring quality control.

The Kimber Custom sets the performance standard for production 1911 pistols. Models are offered with a choice of fixed, adjustable or night sights, and in matte or polished finishes. Both carbon steel and stainless steel versions are available. Common features include the Kimber Firing Pin Safety™, designated by “II” in the model name, along with rounded and blended edges for comfortable carry. Barrels, barrel bushings, chambers and triggers are all machined to exacting match grade dimensions. Ejection ports are lowered and flared, and sights are mounted in dovetails machined into the slide. 

Pistols in the TLE and Warrior families feature three dot (green) Meprolight® night sights. TLE pistols have the sleek Kimber Low Profile Combat™ sights, while the Warriors have the Tactical Wedge™ design

Warrior and Desert Warrior pistols have Kimber G-10 grip panels and a traditional lanyard loop. Other standard Warrior features include a short or military-length guide rod, along with a bumped and grooved beavertail grip safety.

Warrior and Desert Warrior pistols wear the KimPro II® finish. Both tough and self-lubricating, KimPro II has outstanding resistance to chemicals, moisture, salt and UV light that can break down other finishes.

TLE and Warrior models are more than line extensions. Each pistol was created in cooperation with law enforcement and military professionals who insisted on a Kimber Custom with specialized features. The TLE – Tactical Law Enforcement – represents the ideal 1911 for duty, carry or personal protection. Both carbon steel and stainless steel versions are available, each with the option of a Kimber Tactical Rail. Warrior and Desert Warrior models go a step further, adding the KimPro II finish and Tactical Wedge night sights, along with traditional military features like short guide rod and lanyard ring. Naturally, TLE and Warrior models are all chambered in .45 ACP.

This beautiful rifle was just manufactured last month and is brand new. These rifles, particularly in this color are awesome and very rare to come by. RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit.The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. **	Action: Semi-Automatic **	Caliber: 308 Winchester **	Barrel Length: 18"" **	Capacity: 20+1 **	Trigger: Standard **	Safety: Lever **	OAL: 32"" ** Weight: 8.1 lbs **	Stock: Synthetic **	Finish: Parkerized The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included. Barrels on this model is 18"" long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber."

Well taken care of. I have always cleaned it after every use. I bought it off of armslist from a man that bought it brand new privately, so it has never been registered but it is still legal due to no registration private sales laws in WA. I will not require registration but I would like to see ID and I would prefer a CPL.

$1200 FIRM so dont bother offering less, unless you offer a trade of a black SR9C, then I will accept the trade and $900... Thanks"

Been in the family for a long time...by looking at the inside of barrel it appears to barely ever been shot.  From the serial number I believe it to be made in 1958  which is good cause all the parts were hand made.  A little nicer quality.  I have also been told due to the decoration on the stock it is an anniversary edition.  I anyone else knows anything about this gun I appreciate the knowledge.  I was told the value is 600-800......
