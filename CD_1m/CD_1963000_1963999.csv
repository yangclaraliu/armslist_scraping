I believe that my dear departed father rarely, maybe even never, fired this shotgun. It had sat in his gun case since the early eighties. (he liked to buy stuff, but not use it much, if at all) 
Minor light surface wear from handling. Minimal slide wear. NOTHING in the receiver. 
The slide racks like it is all floating on ball bearings.
Like new bluing. (I am not kidding) 
Knurling on takedown knob is extremely sharp and unworn.

Speer's Gold Dot Hollow Point duty ammunition is the standard that all other duty ammunition is compared to. This load is tailored specifically for the law enforcement community and it is great for home defense as well! Featuring Speer's bonded core technology, this round performs great in the FBI tests.

Speer's bonded core bullets are ideally suited for barrier penetration as the jacket is bonded to the lead core of the bullet. This prevents core/jacket separation which in self-defense situations would represent bullet failure. In self-defense situations, bullet weight retention is necessary to achieve the desired 12-18"" of penetration. This bonded technology is designed to retain its weight through various FBI barriers such as the front windshield of a car to deliver the desired penetration.


This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable nickel-plated brass cases."

Our 357 mag. ammo adds more power than ever before to the 357 mag. This ammo is safe to shoot in ANY all steel 357 revolver - this includes J frames. This ammo is no harder on your gun than any other normal 357 ammo. Please don't phone us and ask if this ammo is safe in your gun. It is, providing your gun is in safe condition for use with any normal 357 ammo.

We don't recommend this ammo to be fired in super light alloy revolvers as bullets may jump crimp under recoil, but the ammo itself wont hurt these super light weight revolvers. These revolvers are simply so light that the recoil is severe enough to cause crimp jump.

The below velocities are offered so that you can see what guns/barrel lengths give what velocities with this new 357 mag. ammo. You'll notice that new S&W revolvers with short barrels are often shooting faster than older S&W revolvers with longer barrels. The new S&W revolvers are very good and are made with equipment that makes them more consistent and faster than the S&W revolvers of yesteryear.

The Benelli Cordoba is a lightning-fast 12-gauge shotgun or 20-gauge shotgun, especially built for hunting. Inspired by the high volume of dove shooting found around Cordoba, Argentina, the designers of Benelli shotguns engineered this one with all the advanced features of a serious sporting clays model. Incorporated into the Cordoba is the 10-mm tapered sporting rib favored by competition shooters and porting to keep barrel climb to a minimum
The ComforTech® stock cushions the blow when ammo isn’t measured in boxes, but by cases in an afternoon. The ComforTech® system also helps reduce barrel climb and puts the shooter back on target 69% faster, so that the Cordoba just may be the fastest field gun ever built. A Crio® barrel and extended Crio® choke tubes put more pellets on target. And the whole package is finished in matte black GripTight® coating or Realtree MAX-4®, so a reflected flash won’t give you away."

- duracoated in combat black (muzzle break, gas tube)
- wood handguard has been removed from gas tube to facilitate cooling
- fitted into the famous SG Works bullpup stock kit w/front rails & quick mag release tab

I've owned this rifle since brand new, the serial number indicates it was manufactured in 1974. It has the optional and famously durable gold plated trigger. This is the original 18 shot version with the full length magazine and 22"" barrel.  It has the optional checkering and engraving on the stock.  Probably has about 500-1000 rounds thru it. Spent a lot of time in the safe.

The 16 groove ""Micro-Groove"" technology and precision crowned muzzle made the rifle very accurate out of the box.

My research indicates that it is a Type 38 out of the Koishikawa (Tokyo) factory where they were made through 1935.  I'm guessing it was made around 1935 because of the high serial number (2022466).  The markings on the receiver are very clear (see pictures).  Please note that this rifle is missing the safety, firing pin, the cleaning rod and the lower tang. I'm relatively sure my grandfather removed the safety and firing pin for safety reasons, but unfortunately, these parts are missing. I can only assume the cleaning rod and lower tang are missing due to damage during use in action. 

This would be a good project gun for an enthusiast.  As it is a bring-back gun, I'm sure all of the parts are original.

This pistol functions great with round nose or the Remington golden sabers I use. I never tried another brand. You can see how nice the bluing is for its age and it's factory. The only flaw is one of the berettea medalions fell off while shooting it one day. It didn't matter to me but if you desire you can buy them and glue one back on. It has the more expensive wood grips which are also a little thicker for bigger hands. The photos tell the story. I will only sell this through my FFL dealer so don't ask me to sell it directly to you. We will each pay the $25.00 fee for the transfer.

2 mosin nagant carbines, both the T53 Chinese variant.  7.62 x 54r.  Both are complete except for the darker brown stock rifle which is missing the rear barrel band spring.  Both rifles have pitting and rust.  Both rifles have pitting on the outside of the barrel and possible pitting in the bore (have not cleaned bores well enough to know if they will shine up but they both appear dark).  Darker stock rifle had rust in trigger area and the lighter stock rifle has rust on the cocking knob.  Both rifles are dirty with cosmoline in various places.  Look elsewhere for a completely refurbished or like new rifle.

BOTH RIFLES SOLD AS IS.  Obviously either rifle would need to be inspected by a competent gunsmith prior to firing.

Both rifles still have a bunch of good parts and both stocks are in fair shape with no major cracks (stocks have dings and scratches typical for T53).  

Serious buyers only.  I don't have time to answer 50 questions about the rifles.  These were graded fair condition by the importer (century).... I would grade them poor.  Would make good wall hangers, good source of parts, or for someone with skill a refurb project.
