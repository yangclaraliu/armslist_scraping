Unlike other bedside racks on the market, this set-up utilizes generous cradles, designed specifically for modded defensive shotguns.

I WAS using a rack with rubber coated cradles, and it was fine, until a “fox in the hen-house” scenario. The cradles had molded to my shotgun, and when I tried to grab it, they were stuck to my weapon! I had to actually shake them off… It was an eye opener.

Formed from .090 aluminum with rounded edges, and powder-coated with an extra thick silver hammertone finish, this TAC-RACK is easy on the eyes and easy on your weapons finish. And you will have NO problem removing YOUR weapon from these cradles!

It’s also easy on your wallet, $30.00 with FREE shipping in the continental U.S.A.

FACTORY NEW IN BOX!!!!!! 








Description: Up for auction is a factory new in box Colt LE6940 rifle. Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength. Specifications: Action: Semi-Automatic Caliber: 223 Remington/5.56 NATO Bbl Length: 16.1"" Capacity: 30+1 Trigger: Direct Safety: Lever OAL: 35.25"" Weight: 6.6 lbs Stock: 4-Position Collapsible Finish: Black"

I am the original owner, purchased new in November 2012. I have run exactly eight (8) 15-round mags through the gun, or a total of 120 rounds. It has been cleaned and lubed in strict accordance with the Glock Armorer's Manual. I was using it as my CCW gun, but recently acquired a G27, which is much easier to conceal (obviously), and no longer need the G22, even though I would still like to keep it. It will come with the original factory mags -- 2x 15-round and 1x 10-round, as well as the ""Tupperware"" case and cleaning brush. 

I could lie and say this gun is brand new and has never been fired -- it's that perfect. I have also installed a Talon grip (rubber), which is easily removed to expose the factory grip if, for some reason, you're not a fan. There is absolutely no wear on this gun, and it works flawlessly, as every new Glock should.

This would make an excellent duty weapon for any LEO out there looking for a nice, full-size .40 S&W. It has sat unused in the case, nice and lubed, waiting for an owner that will give it some love. I am happy to meet up anywhere within 30 minutes of Boaz, and I'd be happy to provide a bill-of-sale for any buyer who wants one.

Prefer to sell to CCW holder or LEO. At the very least I will require a valid AL driver's license. Cash only, no trades, as I am swimming in everything else I need.

Email your contact details, and I will reply with my phone / contact info. Thanks.

The photo is NOT mine! It's a stock image, but is identical to my G22. If you don't know what a new G22 and magazines look like, this probably isn't for you."

This handgun features a grip safety similar to the 1911, and is known for being a very safe as well as practical firearm. Instead of having the grip safety at the palm of your hands it is at your finger tips which in my opinion is an awesome feature.

This model has been used by police and military forces all over the world, the gun in specific has issue branding of the Military Police of the Bundeswehr, both on the lower and upper of the gun.

I can include 30 rd steel mags &/or ammo to even up the deal if your rifle is that much nicer than mine.

This one somehow escaped the modernization plans of the young Soviet republic, which converted most of the M91 rifles to the M91/30 configuration in an effort to standardize the arms of the Soviet Union. As such it bears the Imperial Arshin rear sight and early style barrel bands. It even bears a Spanish sling hanger indicating it likely saw use during the Spanish civil war! It ranks 8 out of 10 (10 being the rarest) on the Mosin rarity scale at http://62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinRarity.htm . This rifle is clean lacking import marks making it a true collector! Cleaning rod while not shown in the pictures is included with the rifle.

Condition overall is very good. Tula Arsenal markings are clearly stamped on barrel. The Soviet stamp is also visible on the hex receiver. Blueing and finish is about 90% intact. Wood has no splits or cracks, minor scratches are present on left side visible in pictures. Bore is dark, as is common with these guns having fired corrosive ammunition for most of their lives. However the rifling is still strong and passes the ""bullet test"". Bolt operates smoothly and trigger pull is smooth as well. Bolt and magazine are non-matching, also common as these rifles were often rebuilt at some point in their lives. Rear sight leaf spring is broken, replacement is inbound. The buttplate has some rust, however overall this rifle is in very good condition considering it is 85 years old!

$375 OBO Can meet for a FTF deal in Lincoln county, or ship at your expense. I can ship to your door if you're in Nebraska (yes, this is completely legal under state and federal law) but I will need a copy an 01 or 03 FFL to ship to if out of state. Trade interests include ammunition (5.56mm, 7.62x39mm, .308, 6.8SPC, 9mm, 45acp), a .357 magnum revolver or lever action, or other pistols/rifles. Let me know what you got, the worst I'll do is politely decline.

Introducing the most consistent and reliable barrier ammo on the market.  The only ammunition known to SURPASS all stringent FBI barrier penetration and expansion tests.  Can penetrate windshields, drywall, plywood and still maintain bullet integrity.

2) CANNELURED BULLET WITH CRIMPED CASE ensures no bullet setback during feeding.

3) INTERLOCK® BAND works to keep the bullet and core from separating for maximum weight retention and proven terminal performance through all FBI test barriers.

4) CORE is made of high-antimony lead making it extremely tough, delivering controlled expansion for unparalleled terminal performance consistency through all FBI test barriers. It’s also more economical than similar bonded bullets.

5) NICKEL-PLATED CASES resist corrosion and greatly enhance low-light chamber checks.

I priced these to move so prices are 100% firm. Many of these I have priced at or below my cost. If and only if someone takes the entire lot at once will I consider a discount. 

Terms are face to face on west side of Madison, cash only. I will not meet unless you take at least 100 rounds to make it worth my while. By buying this ammo, you agree that you are legal to purchase and own ammo in the state of Wisconsin without restrictions, and that the ammo is being bought as is. 

Thanks for looking.  **THE ENTIRE LOT IS SOLD** Thanks"

Started off with 20, and this is the last of my stock.  These are complete high quality light lowers.  Don't miss out on these low intro prices.  Everything is completely done for you.  All you need is an upper.

 These are made by a new company called US Arms LLC. The owner was a investor in Plum Crazy Firearms and is making a poly lower with metal LPK and a poly buffer tube. 

 From the manufacturers web site: Welcome to the All-American by Americans AR-15 manufacturer. That’s right, all of our parts are made right here in the U.S.A. The revolutionary U.S. Arms Patriot-15™ is among the strongest, lightest, most durable AR-15 polymer composite lower on the market today. Say goodbye to the 1960’s same ol’ square, boring, offensive style composite Ar-15 lower. Compare these outdated lowers to our new and improved AR-15 lower that represents this century. 

 U.S. Arms, (through a subsidiary company) was the main investor of the first composite AR-15 lower company that hit the market 3 years ago. Yes, the name was a little out there, some would say Plumcrazy, but the product was exceptional, functional and long lasting. We now have an updated product that is comprised of an even stronger, reinforced, longer lasting material that is far superior than anything either past or present. Top it off with an industry first POLYMER BUFFER TUBE!!!!!!


 U.S. Arms offers a price point that anyone can afford and followed it up with a customer satisfaction guarantee for all of our products. Where could the citizens of the United States of America go wrong? You can’t with the Patriot-15. BUY AMERICAN, BUY PRIDE, BUY U.S. ARMS! Stay tuned for more 100% American-made products that are in the works. ASK US ABOUT OUR BUY-BACK PROGRAM FOR COMPOSITE AR-15 LOWERS.

Couple things to save everyone's time.  I'm in southern VT,  let's make sure the distance is workable before making a deal.  I'm NOT looking for a museum piece,  just something that will look classic, but won't hurt if it gets a scratch.  This is not a semi-auto,  hi-cap firearm,  I'll pay fair market price,  but I don't need one bad enough to pay through the nose.  Thanks for your time."
