Modified internal and external geometry provides greater compatibility and function with a wide range of non-AR15/M16 platform weapons. A re-designed bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine allows increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the PMAG 30 M3 will not over-insert on compatible weapons, including the AR15/M16, HK 416, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN SCAR MK 16/16S, and others. In addition to the expanded feature set and compatibility, the PMAG 30 M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes that have been engineered to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. By improving strength and durability in critical areas, the PMAG 30 M3 increases overall reliability and lifespan, while decreasing total lifecycle cost."

Manufactured in Romania, the 7.62x39 mm GP WASR-10 is imported as a single stack rifle that accepts single column 30-round magazines. After arriving in the U.S., the rifles are disassembled, the magazine wells machined out to accept double stack magazines, and the requisite number of U.S. made parts are installed for BATF compliance. These rifles come supplied with two 30-round magazines and a bayonet lug.

This purchase will include over 12 tapco 30 round magazines with around 4,000 rounds of 7.62x39 ammunition that has been stored in military ammo cans in controlled temperature. There will be no trades considered and price is what it is so don't bother to low ball. Actually, come to think of it I will trade for a very nice hot tub worth around $4-5k with delivery included on your end. This rifle will last longer than your lifetime with minimal care. Good luck finding this nice WASR-10 with the amount of ammo for this price. I will delete immediately with first cash purchase. With current pricing on Cheaper Than Dirt this combo would cost over $5-6k+. My price is bottom line as I am not a pawn shop and have priced as low as I can to deliver to a good home."

Weedfish,

If you don't like the prices I am setting than maybe you should wait in line every night at walmarts around town and sell it at reasonable prices online. If you spend as much time as I do trying to find a good deal on ammo for my personal stock then you would consider selling some of it to at least make your time reasonable.

Go ahead and bitch but the people that are paying the prices that I am charging are paying for a service. They either don't have time to go down to Walmart or don't have the drive to actually spend time looking for ammo. So I will let you in on a secret, they will still pay the prices I am charging. 

You're probably some Obama loving commy by not believing in a free market economy. Take an econ class and learn about supply and demand. Get off your high horse and quit being such a whiny bitch.

Thanks,
Someone who actually spends time looking for deals

The sum of all parts if you wanted to order them new would come out to well over $5,000 and a very long wait. I don't really want to sell this as it has a lot of sentiment with me but I don't get a chance to shoot it and need cash for hunting rifles for me and my boy. The sale includes: Springfield armory barreled receiver in .308 (shoots both .308 and 7.62), unitized gas cylinder. Springfield armory trigger group, cleaned up and frog lubed. Factory LBs, breaks like glass. Sadlak Industries 82nd airborne mount. Rock solid steel 3 points of contact on receiver. Irons sights can be used and ran up to 1K setting underneath the mount. SWFA SS10x42M With butler creek flip ups and long sunshade. Shoots the box like a champ. Chosen for its consistency and durability. Was contracted by the Navy for their 50 cals because of its ruggedness and submersibility in salt water. Burris Xtreme tactical medium rings. JAE Gen 2 Dark Green stock Like new not even marks from the gun safe. Stock was designed to squeeze the most accuracy and consistancy out of M1A and M-14 style rifles. Full aluminum bedded for accuracy. Additional factory options included: Barrel tensioner (Allows to be tuned for accuracy, counteracts accuracy lost from barrel heat during rapid fire), grip rest, front bottom rail for bipod, adjustable cheek rest with spacers, off hand grip with rail for mono pod, QD cups all over the place for quick disconnect sling mounts, 2 quick disconnect sling mounts, butt pad, and monopod (I believe the monopod is made by accushot and supplied to JAE.) These are all JAE parts and can be found on their website. Harris bipod, with horizontal swivel. All rifle metal has been treated with frog lube so that the rifle does not need to be constantly broken down for cleaning and re-zeroed. 1 20 rd Springfield steel mag 7 20 rd ProMag steel mags 1 20 rd polymer mag. 1 Springfield armory 5 or 10 round mag, can't remember which. 1 Black handguard. Brownells chamber brush. A ton of paperwork and books on m1a's. Only has superficial marks in finish at the rear sight and the handguard from installation and fitting. They are visible in the pictures. Has had 210 rounds fired. Very accurate, sub MOA with tensioner adjusted, ammo and shooter dependent. Ships to FFL only. Buyer pays shipping and FFL fees. I would like a money order or certified check but am flexible with payment. Thanks for the consideration,"

-	PALMETTO STATE BUFFER
-	DUAL COLOR MAGPUL MIAD GRIP
o	The MIAD (MIssion ADaptable) Grip is a drop-in replacement for the standard AR15/M16/M4 pistol grip, designed to improve weapon ergonomics. Interchangeable front and rear straps, as well as a range of storage core options allow the end user to adjust the grip for hand size as well as dynamic mission requirements. All mounting hardware is included.
-	DUAL COLOR MAGPUL UBR STOCK
o	The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

-	MAGPUL BAD LEVER
o	Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.
o	Made from milspec-anodized aluminum, the B.A.D. Lever attaches to the standard AR15/M16 bolt release without permanent modification to the weapon. Functional for both left and right-handed shooters, the B.A.D. Lever also allows traditional bolt catch manipulation according to the AR15/M16 manual of arms. All mounting hardware included.

o	The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.
o	Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

-	MAGPUL GEN2 MBUS FRONT & REAR SIGHT
o	The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque-limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always-ready sight. Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year personal use warranty.

This rifle is based off of the AR-15 platform and has a lot of interchangable parts!

The magazines for this rifle are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient.

This amazing arsinal operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

Most parts are easily interchangable and resemble ar-15 models.

This is a cash and carry by individual seller.

4.5 XDM 40S&W W/ Black Finish

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

XDM Features

XDM DESIGN

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.






(M)odel Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.





(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.










(M)ega-Lock Texture

The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 

The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.






XDM TECHNOLOGY

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.






(M)elonite

Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 

The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M)is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.





(M)atch Grade Barrel

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry










(M)inimal Reset Trigger

The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.




XDM INNOVATIONS

The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD is now captured in the all new XD(M) line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.






(M)inimal Error Disassembly


Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.





(M)aximum Reach Mag Release


The modified contour of the new XD(M)grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.










(M)ega Capacity Magazine


The new XD(M) Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR Mag 
X-Tension (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
.40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.




XDM PERSONALIZATION

Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M), you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.






(M)ould-Tru Backstraps


With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.





(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System


A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. 










(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case


Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.





(M)agazine X-Tensions


With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORYhas added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)




XDM STANDARDS

In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD polymer pistol, they did just that….






Loaded Chamber Indicator

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.





Striker Status Indicator

The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. 










USA Trigger System

The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

A fairly recent (2009) production gun, this Lightweight Commander, chambered for the very hot and desirable .38 Super, has a lot of custom and tactical features that you would pay a lot more for on a “custom” 1911, such as ring hammer, adjustable trigger, ambi-safety, beavertail grip safety, Colt 3-dot sighting system, front cocking serrations, etc. The 4” barreled 1911 was designed for concealed carry, it has the lightweight receiver. The Matte Stainless factory finish contrasts very nicely with the wooden checkered double-diamond grips on the gun (these may be aftermarket, but they are top-of-the line, and very nice!). The pistol has a stainless Colt-marked factory magazine (it does not come with any extra mags). The pistol was someone’s carry gun, and it has lots of service marks on the finish, and one very notable spot of finish wear on the left slide of the slide. The grips look brand new (they may be new), and overall the pistol rates about 90% condition. The pistol has a very shiny bore with strong rifling, trigger pull is very smooth. If you want a .38 Super carry gun, it would be pretty difficult to top this original Colt Lightweight Commander for both quality and value."

The S&W Model 469 is a semi-automatic pistol, chambered for the 9mm cartridge. It is an early model in Smith and Wesson's well-regarded 69-series, envisioned as pistols that could be easily concealed, but possessed sufficient firepower to serve as service weapons as well. It was a traditional double-action weapon with a 3.5-inch barrel, equipped with a slide-mounted safety/decocker. Magazine capacity was 12 rounds, but it could accept magazines from 59-series pistols, which held 14 or more rounds"

I have 2 Khukuri for sale. These were purchased from Khukuri House.  This company is in Nepal and run by retires Gurkas, so they sell the real thing. I am interested in sale or trade. I would be willing to trade into a Mosin Nagant (rifle or carbine) and/or a 22 caliber firearm.

What I've got:

1) 12"" Khukuri. This knife has been used in the field, so while it does remain in excellent shape, does show sharpening marks, and limited signs of use. It has a sheath of water buffalo and wood.  The knife itself is full tang, approximately a half inch spine. I have literally cut down small trees in a single cut.  Weighs approximately 3lbs.  Any questions, please feel free to email me. Asking $75

2) 8"" Khukuri. Like the one above, it has been used in the field, but remains in excellent shape. This also comes with the water buffalo and wood sheath. I carried this knife on my belt.  This is just a great knife. Asking $50

I do prefer to trade, so if you've got something good lets talk. I am a grad student, and that takes up a lot of my time, so face to face is nice, but it would have to be closer to me than farther away.

It says on the package ""Heavy Duty Spring & Anti-Tilt Follower"" & ""Lifetime Guarantee"". 922r Compliant. There is also a metal plate on bottom of these.

I have two that are ""Dark Earth"" and two that are ""Orange"" - the colors look cool - providing your AK with a fresh look, other than black - which EVERYONE has. Plus, I think these colors are more difficult to find than black, plus you can use different color mags for different types of ammo. For example, ""Orange"" for Tulammo and ""Dark Earth"" for Wolf, and ""Black"" for uh - well - you get the idea.

I'm asking $75 total and that you buy all four of them. I'm firm on the price and qty.

I'm selling these because I want to buy the other Tapco ""Smooth Side"" mags instead. Please no trades. Cash only.

I'm in Great Bridge near Cedar & Dominion. I am available to meet face to face & willing to drive a few miles to meet you halfway (No SHIPPING). 

I am asking that you be 18+ and a resident of either VA or another State w/out mag restrictions.

So, first $75 cash (firm) gets all four of them.

I paid well over $3600 for what is listed/shown in pics....best offer for this package deal gets it all (I am expecting to take a sizeable loss on this). Reply with a cash amount you are willing to offer...worst I can do is say ""no thanks"" if your offer is too low for me. I simply need the money to fund a motorcycle project. 

I will only sell to CO ID card holders or military w/orders (CO Concealed Handgun Permit holders preferred). You must be willing to sign a bill of sale for my records that states by signing it you are legal to own a firearm in CO. This is a cash only deal, I need the $$ not your trade. Thanks for looking! If you have questions or would like more pics, please respond and I will get back to you ASAP."

This is not an Olympic Arms polymer pistol.

This is an original Whitney Wolverine .22 Cal. LR pistol manufactured by Whitney Firearms, Inc. in Jun. 1956. It is in the 24XXX Serial Number range and has “Wolverine” imprinted on the right side.

There were fewer than 13,500 of these pistols ever manufactured. Only the first 2,000 were inscribed with “Wolverine” on the right side. It is a very futuristic design and a 1950’s collectible. That makes this example scarce and very collectible.

It is in good mechanical condition and shoots fine. The cosmetic condition is average. It has a few scuffs and scratches and places that look like they may have been touched up, but then it is over 50 years old.

This rifle uses PX4 magazines. 

You can convert this rifle to use 92/96 mags with a $50 parts kit, BUT since Sandy Hook its been nearly impossible to buy one of these parts kits. I have one backordered and if you buy this gun I'll happily sell you the parts kit when it comes in at my exact cost. 

I am a private seller. I'm happy to sell for cash to any legal Wisconsin resident. I will ask to see your driver's license to prove residency and age.  

Happy to ship the gun to any FFL holder in the country. I charge $30 to ship a long gun via Fedex insured and trackable.  

""The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.

A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 

This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol."""

I'm only selling to finance some repairs to my Jeep before Wheeling season gets going.  A beautiful gun that's overall length is SEVERAL INCHES SHORTER than any of my AR-15's.  However, because of the bullpup design you don't have to sacrifice any muzzle velocity.

$2475 - Denver metro area, face to face, must meet all legal requirements, have I.D., etc. etc.    Will also ship to your FFL if you pay for the actual shipping costs.  In that case I'll accept discreet pay-pal or postal money order.  

Also, I have a brand new AIMPOINT H-1 Micro that perfectly co-witnesses with the included backup iron sites.  I will include this for an additional $500 (which is cheaper than you can find it anywhere online).  If you don't want the reddot that's fine too.

Chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO/223 Remington, the FS2000 CQB is a 
variant of the proven F2000 selective-fire bullpup carbine that offers an integrated MIL-STD 1913 top and bottom mounting rails and emergency backup folding sights. The FS2000 carbine is piston gas-operated and uses a rotating bolt lockup for reliability and greater accuracy. Its 17.44"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is fitted with a muzzle brake. Fired cases are ejected through a forward port away from the operator. The matte black thumbhole design polymer stock is ambidextrous.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.

This model is different from a gsg-522. German Sports Guns was sued by Heckler and Koch over the design of the GSG-5. It's design was too similar to the mp-5. After this law suit GSG created the GSG-522, a different design from the GSG-5.

Inluded in this trade offer is:
Gun (new costed $600) I judge it in good used condition and value it at $500 (original box, manual, and mulitool included)

I have over $1000 invested in this gun. Obviously all these items are used and I don't expect to get $1000. I'm not one of those guys on this site trying to mark everything up to make a profit. I realistically value this package in a $700-$800 dollar range. This gun performs well and is a blast to shoot. I'm looking for a new toy, and have no cash to buy one. So i'm trading one of my old toys."
