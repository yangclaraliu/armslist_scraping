50,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1284050,"For Sale:  New SpecOps AR15 Upper or Rifle, Like Spikes, Magpul, DD","West Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 600,"Listed On: Monday, April 1, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand new unfired 16"" mid-length Spec Ops Tactical .223 / 5.56 AR15 M4 complete upper receiver assembly. This is a great high quality with a Daniel Defense chrome lined barrel and Magpul MOE handguards. It has the more desirable mid-length gas system which has many benefits over the standard carbine length gas system. They have a longer sight radius for better accuracy, plus run cooler, shoot softer, and are smoother cycling due to the extra length and lower pressures of the gas tube, meaning less wear and tear on your rifle. The longer handguards of a mid-length system offer more room for hand placement and accessory mounting and give the rifle a more balanced feel and appearance. The vented Magpul MOE handguards are designed to accept accessories and rail sections in a variety of lengths and positions to suit your needs. I will sell the new upper separately, or with a brand new milspec lower as a complete rifle (see below). If interested please include a phone number to contact you on in your reply, thanks

Spec Ops Tactical is a company out of Florida started up by Garret Potter formerly of Spikes Tactical, and their products are very comparable. Spikes is widely considered some of the best stuff out there and based on the reviews of customers Spec Ops are already becoming known for the same level of high quality craftsmanship and accuracy. They use all milspec components and the upper assembly is complete and ready to drop on your lower using your existing bcg and charging handle. If you do not have those, I have a new set of them available as well.  

Spec Ops Tactical AR15 .223 / 5.56 mid-length upper w 16"" DD barrel & Magpul $600
Add brand new milspec M16 BCG and charging handle (only for sale with upper) $275

I also have a complete brand new unfired Palmetto State Armory lower, all milspec, with a nice trigger pull and 6 position collapsable stock for $550. Buy it plus the upper with BCG and CH and have a very well built and highly accurate complete rifle for the same price people are wanting for the cheap Walmart rifles

Upper $600 / + BCG and CH $275 / + Complete Milspec Lower $550 = Complete Rifle for $1425
*I have another purchase I would like to make and need funds for so I am willing to sell this awesome complete rifle as a total package today for only $1350. Please no offers of less, this is the bottom dollar and it's a great deal on a true quality milspec AR15

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. Four 20 round magazines is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle.

This rifle has been thoroughly cleaned and lubricated. All signs of cosmoline have been removed and all parts tested. This rifle is the real thing. It is not one of those shiney new rifles that has never saw any action.  This rifle is battle tested and ready to go.  If it could only talk, the history would be amazing. This semi-automatic rifle has been arguably considered one of the fathers of all modern semi-automatic rifles. It was one of the first weapons chambered for the 7.62x39mm M43 round, which was also used later in the AK-47.   It was used extensively by the Russian army during WWII. The SKS has a conventional carbine layout, with a wooden stock and no pistol grip. The SKS is a gas-operated weapon that has a spring-loaded operating rod and a gas piston rod that work the action via gas pressure pushing against them. Also, it has a ""tilting bolt"" action locking system.  The SKS's ten-round box magazine is fed from a stripper clip and rounds stored in the magazine can be removed by depressing a magazine catch located forward of the trigger guard (thus opening the ""floor"" of the magazine and allowing the rounds to fall out). In typical military use the stripper clips are disposable. If necessary they can be reloaded multiple times and reused. the barrel is chrome-lined for increased wear and heat tolerance from sustained fire and to resist corrosion from chlorate-primed corrosive ammunition, as well as to facilitate cleaning.  The front sight has a hooded post. ""The rear sight is an open notch type which is adjustable for elevation from 100 meters to 1000 meters (110–1100 yards). There is also an all purpose ""battle"" setting on the sight ladder (marked ""П""), set for 300 meters (330 yards). This is attained by moving the elevation slide to the rear of the ladder as far as it will go.""  All military SKSs have a bayonet attached to the underside of the barrel, which is extended and retracted via a spring-loaded hinge.  The SKS is easily field stripped and reassembled without any tools other than an unfired cartridge.  The rifle comes with a cleaning rod running under the barrel, in the same style as the AK-47. 


There are some scuffs, dings, and scratches in the wood, but that is the history of this remarkable weapon! All parts match and fit nicely together. The action is very smooth. Here is your chance to own a piece of history and relive the life of the soldiers who have trusted their life to this historical weapon.  Own a piece of history today! $375"

The ADCOR Defense BEAR (Brown Enhanced Automatic Rifle) is a very nifty new piston-operated AR-15 carbine. The piston is permanently attached to the bolt carrier (think AK-47) and it travels through a machined boss in the upper receiver, which prevents the problem of carrier tilt. The BEAR includes both the standard AR-15 rear charging handle and a forward, folding and non-reciprocating charging handle.

Saiga self-loading hunting carbines

The ""Saiga"" carbines are based on the venerable АК Kalashnikov assault rifle and may come in the following versions: 
•""Saiga"" is chambered for 7.62х39 and .223 Rem cartridges; 
•""Saiga-M"", ""Saiga-М3"", ""Saiga-MK"" are chambered for 7.62х39 and .223 Rem cartridges; 
•""Saiga-5.6"", ""Saiga-5.6S"" are chambered for 5.6х39 cartridge; 
•""Saiga-308"" is chambered for 7.62х51 (.308Win) cartridge; 
•""Saiga-9"" is chambered for 9x53R cartridge. 

The specifications of the used cartridges are given in the Table. Use only the certified cartridges for safe firing. The carbines are reloaded automatically due to the energy of the powder combustion gases, bled from the barrel bore and the energy of the return spring as well. The barrel bore is locked on turning the bolt round its axis whilst the bolt support slides lengthwise. The trigger and firing mechanism of a hammer type allows it to deliver single-shot fire and to set the carbines at safe. 

The safety of a lever type is sited on the right side of the receiver. The barrel bore and chamber are chrome-plated. The magazines of a different capacity are made of the impact-resistant polymer or wood (walnut, beech, birch). To make firing more comfortable the wooden butt may be equipped with a cheek and rubber pad. 

The iron sight consists of the sight leaf and front sight adjustable for windage and elevation. 

The range of the aimed fire through the iron sight is 300 m. 

Found on the receiver left side is an unified rail for the optical sight accommodation. The iron sight allows to deliver aimed fire with the optical sight in place. 

Must be able to legally accept a firearms transfer.

Spikes Dynacomp Extreme: $150
The Spike’s Tactical Dynacomp Extreme is a 5.56 muzzle device designed to reduce recoil impulse and muzzle climb to provide faster follow up shots. The Dynacomp's accomplish this by balancing the direction of the blast along the vertical (upward) and perpendicular planes of the muzzle to lower muzzle rise, while the end of the device restricts forward energy to reduce parallel recoil. 
The ports on the Dynacomp are ball dimpled for smooth expansion of gases and rapid heat dissipation. The front of the device is 0.25"" thick to better handle the abuse of full auto fire. The entire device is Melonite treated to enhance these characteristics and provide a slick black finish. 
NOTE: The Dynacomp Extreme model will bring a 14.5"" barrel to legal (non-NFA) length

Threaded for 1/2x28” barrels
