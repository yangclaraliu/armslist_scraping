You are bidding on a BRAND NEW, FULLY  CUSTOMIZED AR-15 Rifle.  We started with a factory Ruger 556 piston driven rifle and built from there.

It has an extra long factory rail, so the mounting possibilities are endless.    

This gun is the work of a gun enthusiast, a gunsmith, and a swat team professional, and the finished product is something you will be proud to own.   

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles TWO-STAGE PISTON WITH ADJUSTABLE REGULATOR provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The four position gas regulator can be adjusted for optimum reliability and superior operating endurance. The gas system may be closed completely for manual operation during training or when using a suppressor.

He told me it is a late 40's or early 50's model. I fired only three rounds just to see how it was, its GREAT. There are many different countries that make similar looking pistol's but this is the very favorite of most all collectors. You can see there are many look alikes out there, like the TT and these too that are going from around $300. to as high as almost $500. and most of them are not the earlier models like this one is. It looks and feels like a 1911 .45, Colt. It comes with two 9+1 round magazines, a cleaning rod and a leather holster. This is a very powerful pistol but very easy to shoot. I was told that it fires something like a cut down AK47 machine gun round and I was also told it is closer to a .357 so whatever one it is, its still GREAT. I would of loved to fired a few magazines through it but I didn't want put that many rounds through it just in case I ever wanted to sell it.

Manufacturer: Zastava GM57A
Item: 7-GM57A

The Tokarev pistol was developed by Russia in the 1930's as a primary service pistol. The TT-33 was widely used in World War II primarily by Russian officers well into the 1950s. The Fedor Tokarev designed sidearm uses a short recoil design, external hammer, integrated feed lips and fires the 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridge.

This Yugoslavian M57 was built by Zastava and utilized by the Yugoslavian Military and Police forces. The M57 version differs from the TT-33 by holding one more 7.62 Tok cartridge in the longer magazine and corresponding grip.

595,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1123595,For Sale:  WARNING - STEEL CORE CHINESE 7.62 x 39 AMMO,"WARNING CHINESE STEEL CORE, Wilmington, North Carolina","$ 1,500","Listed On: Saturday, February 23, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"To be clear: I have no problem with people trying to make money including a profit on their ammo. It's the American way. What I have a problem with are people selling things complete with claims that are simply not true or misleading.

 Individuals are now selling steel core Chinese ammo claiming or insinuating it's 'armor piercing' for $1 a round and up. Lead core 7.62 X 39 is selling on here for 40 cents a round and up. With regard to the steel core being AP: If by ""AP"" you mean it will defeat soft body armor like pretty much every other center fire rifle projectile, it is certainly AP, it is this factor, the steel core, and the fact that firearms which were legally pistols came out chambered for 7.62 X 39 that lead to it being classified as ""AP"".

 18 U.S.C., § 921(a)(17)(B)

 Defines armor piercing ammunition as:

 ""
 A projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or
 A full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile.
 ""
 The ""handgun"" requirement is key and is what caused this ammo to be banned from importation. Note the decided absence in the US code of any reference to the projectile actually being able to defeat any particular sort of ""armor"". The law was, at least on it's face, intended to prohibit handgun ammunition that can defeat soft body armor typically worn by law enforcement officers.
 Politics and the fact that this was, at the time, the lions share of 7.62 X 39 ammo being imported probably also played a role.

 Now, that said, If you mean it is armor piercing i.e. ""AP"" against steel or other hard plate to a greater degree than regular lead core, like .30 cal blacktip with a hardened steel penetrator core, or modern SLAP rounds, it most certainly isn't AP. The core of all the steel core Chinese being sold on here in any quantity is soft mild steel core used to save money in manufacture since it is cheaper than lead. It's no more AP than plain old lead core 7.62 X 39. Years ago I fired Chinese mild steel core 7.62 along with lead core 7.62 X 39 at 1/4, 3/8 and 1/2 steel at 50 yards. Both rounds defeated both the 1/4 and 3/8 and exited out the back. Neither would defeat the 1/2 although they left large craters and dents and multiple hits in the same vicinity created cracks. I had plywood behind it and there were no holes or damage in the plywood from the 1/2"" test. In other words: The steel core has no more penetration than lead core. Also, what they neglect to tell you is that the core is not the only thing that's steel. In addition to the case the bullet jacket is also usually steel which means you are shooting a steel jacketed projectile down your barrel instead of copper. Which wears the rifling faster? To be fair some of the lead core foreign production is also steel jacketed. If you still want to pay $1 a round for this steel core then nobody's stopping you, it just isn't what the ""AP or ""armor piercing"" description may lead you to believe it is. Oh yeah, most if not all of the steel core Chicom is also corrosive, something else they aren't probably going to be telling you about it.

 If you doubt the results I claim, check this video. The only difference between their test and mine is that they used 1/4"", 1/2"" and 1"" plate and also tested true Chinese API ammo as well as plastic core training ammo in addition to the mild steel core and lead core ammo. Their conclusion: The mild steel core Chicom is a waste of money. If you want true armor piercing ammo that's more effective than lead core then you have to get the extremely difficult to find API which does have a hardened penetrator in it. Price last time I saw it was $7 a round. On the up side it will defeat 1/2"" steel plate if that is important to you. On the other hand, plain old generic lead core 7.62 X 39 will defeat up to 3/8"" mild steel plate. It will also easily defeat any body armor NIJ level IIIA or less if you are worried about home invaders etc wearing soft body armor.

Video doesn't lie folks, and I don't have any reason to either. Don't believe the hype buy 2 or 3 times the amount of lead core and get the same or better real world performance.

This is more of a varminter rifle, so you can expect it to be a little more accurate than the average AR, but it is not MIL-Spec, the obvious being no dust cover or forward assist, no chrome in the barrel, and the BCG is similar to lighter AR BCG designs as opposed to the heavy M16 BCG.

The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.
