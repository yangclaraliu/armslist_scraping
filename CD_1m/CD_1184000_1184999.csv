I like the rifle and the caliber, but I'd prefer one in military configuration.  Ideally a carbine with a folding bayonet, but any Mosin Nagant in military configuration will do.

$800 or obo. I am also looking for a Glock 21.

Maybe 50 rounds have been through this rifle.  I've gotten some very tight groups with it.  It is feather light to carry, yet the recoil is easy with the Pachmayr® Decelerator butt plate.  Feel free to request many additional images.  This is a very good looking rifle with nice wood grain.   

The scope bases are specifically matched to this rifle in terms of finish and style of the rifle’s classic lines.  The original factory box, a 2008 Kimber company catalog, owner's manual, store tags, and other documentation are included!  Total price paid, before tax, was $1,122.49.  Asking $900.00.    

What has been said about this rifle:  “The Model 8400 has more in common with a custom rifle than one assembled on a production line.  Barrel, chamber and trigger are match grade.  Barreled actions are bedded into classic American sporter stocks on pillars and with glassed recoil lugs.  Wood stocks are oil finished by hand and each stock includes a Pachmayr® Decelerator 1-inch recoil pad.  The Classic has a carefully shaped and hand-finished A-grade walnut sporter stock.  The action is pillar bedded and the barrel free floated to maintain zero under the toughest field conditions.  Metal surfaces are finished in matte blue to avoid reflection.”

I have in great condition a Sig P220 .45ACP. DA/SA w/ decocker. It has been Cerakoted Titanium. Not Cerakoted to cover up anything, I wanted the most durable finish that money could buy. Short reset trigger. Crimson Trace laser grips. TFO-Tritium fiber optic sights about a year old so tritium is bright. Buffer Technologies stainless guide rod. Approx. 200 down range on this one. 2 mags. Case. Manual. Also a Black Hawk holster. Everything in excellent condition. This handgun is considered by our military as "" To hell and back reliability"". 
Over $1500 invested.

This is the ultimate in reliability and longevity. Built to be the best under any conditions. If your looking for a handgun to be with you when the SHTF, this is the one.

This weekend only cash price $900. If it doesn't sale, I'm keeping this one.

If you don't want the laser grips, I'll go $800.

Call: 615- three seven two-four five two three.

These guns are rare and very collectable. Baker was one of the high end gun makers back in the day when LC Smith bought them out in 1888. LC Smith was then bought out by Marlin in the 1940s. This gun comes with a note from Ahlman's gunsmith varifying that it is still in fine working order and safe to shoot with light blackpowder loads (comes with the note from ahlmans themselves for proof).

Available for local pickup/delivery from Ashland to Chippewa Falls area, as I travel back and forth a lot, or will ship rifles to another Wisconsin resident 18 or older for about $25, or to FFL in other state if legal in your area, your responsible to find out. UPS next day to FFL for handguns. Thanks for looking, will be adding more guns as time allows."

With the half bobbed hammer the lock is now disengaged.  I have the original hammer should you ever want to change it back.  There are no flaws on the gun, scratches, etc.  Timing is perfect, everything functions as it should.

This gun has less than 100 rounds through it.  The Model 360J is chambered only for the 38 special. This is one unique handgun in that it is built with a scandium frame, comes with a carbon steel cylinder and finished in melonite.  It weighs less 14oz.  It can handle 38 special + P.  You won't find any documentation on the S&W website on this gun, probably a special order that fell through.

I am including all original material including box/lock/paperwork/etc.  Also included is the original hammer and TWO holsters.  One being the Desantis pocket holder in the pictures.  The other holster included is an IWB Desantis Sof-Tuck

The PMAG is made from an impact resistant polymer and features; easy to disassemble design, flared floor plate and ribbed body for positive grip when doing magazine changes. The stainless steel spring aids in corrosion resistance and has an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower to increase reliability.

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons."

724,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1184724,For Sale:  Romanian M69 Military 22 LR Training Rifles (several to choose from),"SE Springfield, Springfield, Missouri",$ 125,"Listed On: Saturday, March 16, 2013",Rifles,no type,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have for sale a pair of Romanian Model 1969 Military 22 LR Training Rifles. These rifles are known for their accuracy and durability. I purchased a few of these back when they were still easily available, intending to finish each one over time. As you can tell by the picture, I've only gotten around to finishing one. Note that the finished one on the bottom is NOT for sale.

While these 22 LR rifles are perfectly shootable ""as-is"", I recommend you consider these as a project rifle with the following considerations:

1. Magazine Well. Each Romy M69 will come with one 5-round magazine. I have 5 of these rifles and the fitting of the magazine to the mag well has been hit and miss. Some of the receivers have required a bit of modification for the magazines to slide in and out freely.

2. Case Ejection. As is common in these M69's, the cases are not often fully ejected from the ejection port, requiring the shooter to slightly tip the rifle and allow it to fall out. This is ""as-designed"" in the rifle. One of the only quirks I've come to discover.

3. Scope Rings. The rifles are extremely accurate with the built-in 25, 50 and 100 yard sight adjustments. However, I've heard (but never verified) that mounting a scope can be a challenge.

4. Wood Rifinish. These rifles refinish VERY nicely. As you can tell from the bottom rifle, some have Beech wood, but more commonly Walnut stocks. The fun of these rifles is that they are great project guns, but you aren't going to ruin the collector value by trying your hand at refinishing or reblueing. The stocks are in great shape, but the finish leaves something to be desired. They all refinish beautifully.

5. Bore Condition. Perfect. Nothing really to add here. For that matter, the rifles are free of rust, pitting, etc... They're just a bit dirty and need some TLC in that regard.

FINE PRINT:
There are only two (2) rifles left for sale. I would like to sell them as a pair. Price is $125 each, or $225 for the pair. If you buy both together, I will include a bottle of Brownell's Oxpho-Blue and a spare firing pin and firing pin spring. Also, I will require a copy of a current valid Missouri Drivers License or CCW. I am a C&R holder and will need to log these out in my book to the purchaser.

Please do your research on this rifle and its quality if you have never heard of them. Feel free to send any reasonable offers, but please don’t waste my time or I will not respond. Thanks

This is a Maverick by Mossberg. Accepts 2 3/4"" and 3"" 12gauge shells.
Magtube holds up to 5 shells. I really haven't shot it much this year and I am looking for other firearms. I am the 2nd owner.
It is in fairly decent condition with some signs of use and wear.
I'm a gunsmith and I was building this for myself so some finishing can be done if you want, the gun works fine otherwise.
Has:
-BlackHawk! tactical 6pos stock with pistol grip and KNOXX Recoil System (look it up)
-Magpul RVG grip mounted on action pump. Can be completely removed. I was going to put a AFG on it.
-B-Square saddle scope mount.
-Barrel is aprox 19"", cut down from 22"". filed but not blued. No bead sight, I was going to thread it for a breachers muzzle. The barrel is the only thing not finished. 
-Tactical Blackhawk one point sling.

Ammo:
188 different 12 gauge shells. 100 are Federal multi purpose loads. Theres about 25-30 home defense rounds, on top of some slugs and other buckshot like Winchester PDX fragmented slugs and Olin corp military 00 buck.
I can throw in the ACU scabbard if I have to.
Trade or trade + cash only. Value I would put on this package is $460. I have over $600 in this package.
Please email me with details on what you have. If you have ammo with your rifle or shotgun, thats a plus. FYI, don't expect to get a ""ban hype"" price for anything I am looking for as trade. Keep the prices real or negotiable.
My name is Dave. Will sign bill of sale or whatever the state requires in a private sale. I'm in Winsted and cannot drive because I don't have an available car. Gas isn't cheap and inflation sucks, so if you have a guzzler, I will accept do trade no cash, just don't drive up in a Prius.

I am constantly looking for good deals on large quantities of new .45 ammo to resell at a reasonable fixed price, regardless of the brand of ammo. My intent is to hold the line at or below $30 per 50 round box during this weird shortage for as long as possible. Yes, I make a couple of dollars per box, I make no apologies for that, but a small profit enables me to locate other supplies and quickly purchase good ammo for resale.

I have no purchase limits, if it's in stock and you have the cash, I will sell as much ammo as you want. It might be a good idea to email or text message me first if more than 20 boxes at a time is wanted.

At this time I do not stock any other calibers other than .45 (sorry, no 9mm or .22), I have enough problems finding .45 to keep supplied. Thanks to all of you who have bought my ammunition recently."

Pistol Grip. the only serial numbered parts on rifle were the receivers with the exception of National Match rifles which had the bolts electro pencilied with the receiver number. Polished bolts marked NS for nickel steel were standard on NM rifles and some were fitted with C stocks also, early triggers were grooved, bolts body's were smooth and had a bolt handle that was forged staight down, later designs are swept slightly to the rear. rear sights were mounted on a collar press fitted to the barrels which also contained the sight base, the windage markings and the semi circle gearing for the rear sight windage adjustment, the sight has two options, when folded down the groove in sight is set for 550 yards, the battle sight setting. when the site is raised up you have both a peep sight and a groove aperture from which to choose, both settable to 100 yards at lowest setting. as slide is moved upward the groove on the rear sight base will automatically move to the left to compensate for SPIN DRIFT, that's called the coriallis effect caused by the rotational force imparted by bullit spin. original finish on these rifle was both parkerizing and bluing depending on manufacturer and the model years. all metal parts including sling swivels will have a letter code stamped on them, S for Springfield RI for Rock Island and so on and so forth. original rifles will have a barrel marked same as receiver name, some exceptions are rebarreled rifles and Marine corps rifles which are marked USMC on the barrels for obvious reasons. USMC Sniper versions will be so marked and bolts will be penciled with receiver numbers as they used NM rifles as there sniper base, the original Unertyl scopes were also marked USMC if it is not it is a reproduction or a fake! however you see it. Remington began production of 1903 rifles to help supply logistic's when Springfield armory began tooling up for M1 Garand Production, they were refered to as the 1903 modified, Curiosly Remington did not Produce Proper 03 barrels shortly after production thay modified current tooling of 03A3 barrels to fit the demand of 1903 modified production, the only way to tell is by removing the rear sight collar and examining the ruff machining, as production neared the end the rear bridge on receiver began to change shape, they got taller and had the side ways machined bar that would later become the dovetail for the 03A3 sight base, these are called transition rifles. the rear sights were simplified in design for a couple of reasons, they were more robust and easyer to see in lowlight conditions. they were infact adjustable for both windage and elevation inspite of Current info floating around you know, soldiers who could not figure out elevation and drift (Well maybe if they were AirForce) anyway there are ""Collector"" rifles and there are ""Collectable' rifles, know the difference before you plop down your hard earned cash on an Emotional Purchase, get the facts from a Collector of said weapon and not a Pawn shop esto'mate. I have seen rusted, chopped up, mismatched junk for sale by ""Dealers"" for top prices because it's OLD and it's a Collector piece. as has been stated they are EXTREMLY ACCURATE Rifles, I have been a Collector and Shooter of these weapons for over 42 years and they will shoot with the best off the shelf rifles available today. but what do I know."
