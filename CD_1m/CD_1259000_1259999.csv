The .300 Whisper was originally based on the .221 Fireball case necked up to .30 caliber. However, avid reloaders have found the .223 Remington or 5.56×45 mm NATO works well when shortened and resized to .30 caliber. Firing in the .300 Whisper chamber results in a slightly sharper shoulder. Magnum pistol powders such as H110 work well for supersonic loads. Sierra 240 grain (16 g) jacketed bullets work well if the barrel has a 1:8 twist. Barrels with a 1:10 twist will stabilize 220 grain (14 g) bullets at subsonic speeds. 125 grain (8 g) bullets will reach 2400 ft/s (730 m/s).
There are a few points to be considered regarding the utility of the .300 Whisper:
Supersonic loads are capable of matching ballistics of the 7.62x39mm and the .30-30 Winchester, making the .300 Whisper very capable as a short range deer hunting cartridge.
The use of heavy bullets, along with the low powder weight and small case capacity, make the .300 Whisper ideal for use with sound suppressors. These subsonic loads offer energy levels similar to that of the popular .45 ACP pistol cartridge, but range is substantially increased due to the longer, more efficient .30 caliber bullet.
Cases for the .300 Whisper can be formed from common and plentiful .223 Remington brass by sizing and trimming to length. However, J.D. Jones has recommended against this, citing the difference in case thickness at the neck (compared to the .221 Fireball) as a potential issue. This problem can be exacerbated when military 5.56x45mm cases are used. (The Whisper name is trademarked thus: the only firearms with a .300 Whisper chamber are those from J.D. Jones and Thompson Center, which licensed the name. All other guns are cut to .300/221 which has different chamber specifications than the Whisper, particularly in neck wall thickness. Because the .300 Whisper is a wildcat cartridge there were no established Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI) specifications for the chamber reamers, and the necks were cut to allow for standard .308 neck thickness, which is approximately the same thickness as produced from forming .223 brass. Typically only guns with Whisper chambers will have problems with .223 brass—.300/221 chambers work very well with .223 brass, and the .223 brass is considerably stronger than .221 brass.)
Perhaps most importantly, any firearm with a .223 Remington bolt face can be converted to .300 Whisper by re-barreling the action. As such, the .300 Whisper works well in AR-15–based rifles, especially when some type of gas regulator is installed.
In addition to special applications in suppressed firearms, the .300 Whisper has become popular with metallic silhouette shooters due to its low recoil, good long range performance, and very high accuracy."

Up for auction is the mr556a1, A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.
Payment would be made via Postal money order or paypal (preferred) and all firearms would be shipped to an FFL i accordance to BATF regulations, so FFL is required for shipment of firearm.

BELOW ARE SPECS AND FEATURES FROM STIHL WEBSITE REGARDING THIS MODEL. 

STIHL professional chain saws are made to deliver the power you need when cutting wood is not just a hobby, but a way of life. With high power-to-weight ratios and heavy-duty components, a STIHL professional saw will keep you cutting day in and day out with these features:

High-tech Magnesium Housing provides long-lasting wear.
An Adjustable Bar and Chain Oiler allows the operator to adjust the oil flow for long bars or dirty cutting conditions in max position. It also saves oil when using short bars in clean conditions.
An IntelliCarb™ Compensating Carburetor automatically adjusts the air/fuel ratio to maintain optimal performance during changing environmental conditions.
The Extra Slim Profile is ideal for overall comfort and ease of use.
Its Side-access Chain Tensioner allows for easy tensioning of the saw chain.
The Master Control Lever™ is a single lever that allows the user to operate the choke, starting throttle lock and on-off switch all from one convenient location.
STIHL manufactures its own saw chain for optimal performance and compatibility with your STIHL chain saw. Swiss-made STIHL OILOMATIC® Saw Chain is pre-stretched before it leaves the factory, which helps eliminate excessive stretching during the break-in period, reducing maintenance time and component wear.
The Electronic Ignition provides easier starting and smoother running.
An Anti-vibration System helps reduce operator fatigue and improves comfort.
Our Ematic™ Bar Lubrication System delivers proper lubrication while reducing oil usage by up to 50%.
Designed to stop the chain in fractions of a second, the STIHL Quickstop® Chain Brake System can be activated manually or by inertia if the kickback force is sufficient.
The Translucent Fuel Tank allows the operator to easily check the fuel level before starting work while the Balanced Fuel and Oil Tank Capacities allow for efficient refills.
The Front Handle is designed for a secure grip and is ergonomically angled for comfort.
Front and Rear Hand Guards help reduce the risk of injury.
Bumper Spikes help prevent pull-in and provide better control, making cutting easier.
An All-position Carburetor allows the engine to run at full power in any approved operational position.
A Combination Wrench/Screwdriver is supplied, providing easy and convenient adjustments to the saw.
The Chain Catcher helps reduce the risk of operator contact by a chain if it should break or derail.
Features like Heavy-duty Centrifugal Clutches, High-pressure Alloy Die Castings and STIHL-designed cylinders help provide durable, long-lasting wear.
The Easy-to-Access Air Filters and Protected Spark Plugs provide easy chain saw maintenance.
The Spark Arrester Muffler is designed to reduce noise levels and the emission of sparks.
The Smooth Clean Design has no rough edges to snag on clothing or brush.

An IntelliCarb™ Compensating Carburetor automatically adjusts the air/fuel ratio to maintain optimal performance during changing environmental conditions.
The Extra Slim Profile is ideal for overall comfort and ease of use.
Its Side-access Chain Tensioner allows for easy tensioning of the saw chain.
The Master Control Lever™ is a single lever that allows the user to operate the choke, starting throttle lock and on-off switch all from one convenient location.
STIHL manufactures its own saw chain for optimal performance and compatibility with your STIHL chain saw. Swiss-made STIHL OILOMATIC® Saw Chain is pre-stretched before it leaves the factory, which helps eliminate excessive stretching during the break-in period, reducing maintenance time and component wear.
The Electronic Ignition provides easier starting and smoother running.
An Anti-vibration System helps reduce operator fatigue and improves comfort.
Our Ematic™ Bar Lubrication System delivers proper lubrication while reducing oil usage by up to 50%.
Designed to stop the chain in fractions of a second, the STIHL Quickstop® Chain Brake System can be activated manually or by inertia if the kickback force is sufficient.
The Translucent Fuel Tank allows the operator to easily check the fuel level before starting work while the Balanced Fuel and Oil Tank Capacities allow for efficient refills.
The Front Handle is designed for a secure grip and is ergonomically angled for comfort.
Front and Rear Hand Guards help reduce the risk of injury.
Bumper Spikes help prevent pull-in and provide better control, making cutting easier.
An All-position Carburetor allows the engine to run at full power in any approved operational position.
A Combination Wrench/Screwdriver is supplied, providing easy and convenient adjustments to the saw.
The Chain Catcher helps reduce the risk of operator contact by a chain if it should break or derail.
Features like Heavy-duty Centrifugal Clutches, High-pressure Alloy Die Castings and STIHL-designed cylinders help provide durable, long-lasting wear.
The Easy-to-Access Air Filters and Protected Spark Plugs provide easy chain saw maintenance.
The Spark Arrester Muffler is designed to reduce noise levels and the emission of sparks.
The Smooth Clean Design has no rough edges to snag on clothing or brush.

It seems to prefer CCI tactical .22LR rounds (the ones for rimfire AR's).  It is essentially new from the factory and includes the original velvet-lined pouch and 1 original magazine.  Sorry, no box or papers as these have been misplaced over the years.  It has been in a dehumidified safe for 30+ years.  

This particular model and serial number are the rarest of this production line.  Below is some info on this gun's production history:

""Serial numbers of production Model 61-1 pistols range from B7801 through B9850.  Total production of the Model 61-1 was 2550 units, making it the most collectable of the Escort pistols.""

FRONT & REAR WITH FRONT SIGHT KEY

COLOR: Black  

CONDITION: NEW IN BOX 

This is for a pair of MBUS PTS GEN 2 Flip up sights. One front & rear sight & key. These are made by Magpul's PTS division. The MBUS (Magpul Back-Up Sight) GEN 2 is a color injection molded, folding back-up sight. The MBUS Front Sight is adjustable for elevation and fits most 1913 Picatinny/Weaver rails. The new features of the GEN 2 MBUS include reduced size for greater optics compatibility, and spring-locking front sight post holds consistent elevation.

The Front Sight is adjustable for elevation. Rear is adjustable for windage and also has flip aperture. 

Spring relase can be easily manuplitaed from either side or by pressing the top. Spring pressure and detent keeps sight erect but allows for smooth and crisp folding in the case of impact to avoid damange. Protective wings shield the adjustabele spring-locking  front sight post. Once installed these provid the same bore height as standard  irons. 

These sights fit very tight. You must remove the tightening screw & then it will take both hands to get them on the rail. I do not recommend using any prying tools as you might scratch your gun or damage the sight. 

There has been some confusion regarding the differences between MAGPUL USA products and the MAGPUL PTS products. All MAGPUL USA products are made with DuPont polymer and are close to indestructible. With MAGPUL PTS products, they are made with the same quality and almost all the same materials as original MAGPUL USA parts. Because of regulations regarding sales of US Made firearm parts, MAGPUL USA products, which are made in the United States, are generally not available for sale outside the United States. MAGPUL PTS parts, however, are made in Hong Kong and are legal for sale anywhere in the world. 
I am asking $50 cash. I have two new sets.  Face-to-face in Indianapolis. No shipping, no taxes, no paperwork."

It's chambered in 243 Winchester and for a rifle that's over 40 years old it's in great condition. Bluing is still dark and full. The stock is a honey claro Walnut (straight grain no figure to speak of). The 24"" barrel's bore is bright with lands and grooves sharp to the muzzle. I doubt it's been fired much at all since there is NO copper residue on the bolt face. There is NO rust anywhere. There are some small dents on the left side of the stock. These are not serious and you should be able to bring them back with a wet cloth and a hot iron. If it's important.

All in all a very nice specimen of an old school rifle that was known to be accurate and tough.

Designed for the plinker, serious shooter or varmint hunter, Colt’s CR6724 is a direct descendant of the rifles that made Colt ""the small-arms sensation of modern warfare”, the original AR-15 design from 1963. The CR6724 has many features that make it right at home on the range and in the field. A flat top receiver will allow for many types of optics and a tubular handguard is comfortable for all day long shooting. With its full floated 24” stainless steel heavy barrel and enhanced trigger and hammer, the CR6724 lives up to its name as the Colt Accurized Rifle. The CR6724 is the perfect choice for the shooter who wants the look and feel of the original, but requires the accuracy of a modern semi-auto rifle.

It's chambered in 30-06 and for a rifle that's over 40 years old it's in great condition. Bluing is still dark and full. The barrel was not drilled for open sights. The stock is a honey Walnut (straight grain with a little figure in the butt area). The bore is bright with lands and grooves sharp to the muzzle. I doubt it's been fired much at all since there is NO copper residue on the bolt face. There is NO rust anywhere. There are some small dents on the left side of the stock. These are not serious and you should be able to bring them back with a wet cloth and a hot iron. If it's important.

All in all an very nice specimen of a rifle that was known to be accurate and tough.

Price is $425.00 picked up in Midtown, Houston, or I can ship to your FFL for $30.00.

This is a 1998-built safe queen, that is as new with only 35 rounds fired, and has never seen any field use.  No marks of any kind - it is perfect.

Included is the .375 H&H Magnum Professional Hunter, based on a 1997 Winchester Model 70 action, custom Jarrett barrel (all metal work finished in non-glare matte gray phenolic finish), custom MacMillan fiberglass stock, express sights (zeroed for 50 yards), two (2) Leupold Vari-X III 1.5x5x25(mm) scopes (each tuned for one of two custom loads), scopes are both mounted in Talley Twist-Off rings which maintain perfect zero, and custom leather Jarrett sling, and custom fit Americase aluminum breakdown travel case.

This rifle has had two loads developed for dangerous game.  Included are test targets (less than 0.5 MOA at 100 yards) and chronograph output for the two Jarrett developed custom loads, a 300-grain A-Square Monolithic Solid, or the 300-grain Hornady Round Nose Soft Points.  Of the original 80-rounds supplied, there are 45 rounds remaining, in an MTM case; load details are also included along with the 35 rounds of 1-x fired brass.

This gun was featured on display at the 1998 Safari Club International show, before being delivered to me.  Original invoice provided.

Package deal of $6000 FIRM.  This package would sell for in excess of $10K today and take a year for delivery as a custom order  Shipping and Handling $100 for insured Fed-Ex delivery.  This item is sold as is, in perfect working order as described.  No test firing or inspection period, or returns.  Kenny Jarrett only makes the finest, and this is one of them."

This upper is sexy and I'm sad that I have not had a chance to fire since assembly.

I AM SELLING THE UPPER ONLY, please do not e-mail asking how much for the complete rifle as I am not selling the lower nor BCG.


Upper receiver is a brand-new JD Machine, never fired, with their charging handle included, M4 ramps.

Barrel is a Daniel Defense 14.5 chrome-lined with perm attached Vortex. No BCG is included with this package. 1x7 twist, pinned FSB, no swing swivel.


Here are some quick pics from when I assembled it. The barrel does not have CHF markings so I assume it is not. The rifling looks perfect, I bought the barrel used a year back from the AR15.com forum and it was stated to only have 300 rounds down it. This was not fired since I assembled it, I did rack and dry-fire a few times with a spare BCG but that's it.

I would like $530 picked up, or $550 shipped.  Includes DD heatshielded M4 handguards (not including the shorty VFG in pics) and including a Cardinal-Forge carry handle. Paypal accepted as long as you cover fees (3.5%) or as a Gift, otherwise money order or cash in person (Lake in the Hills, IL)

The SS109 projectile features a 62 grain full metal jacket around a lead core with a steel penetrator tip. This standard NATO SS109 bullet is the same as the popular U.S. made M855, only no green paint is applied to the tip. The ammunition is first quality, new production ammunition, loaded in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases with Mil-Spec crimped sealed primers and sealed bullets. Each round is in the bright, pristine condition as the day it was loaded.

ONLY TRADES THAT MIGHT be considered is a sig or HK type pistol that is suppressor ready (read as threaded barrel) caliber 9mm or MAYBE 45... if you have a different pistol that i havent thought about that would be good for suppressor with a threaded barrel let me know and I will consider.... currently have a glock 34 that im thinking about just getting a threaded barrel for (thus the MAYBE on the trades) WILL NOT SPLIT UP THE PACKDGE... LOWEST cash price is 1550.... trade value at 1650... please if you make me a cash offer 1550 is the least I will take.... this saves us haggling... again this is to fund a tax stamp and maybe a diff pistol to suppress so all other trades will be politely rejected... thanx for looking text anytime at REDACTED"
