I am looking to buy an SKS that accepts the AK mag. I am not looking for a homemade hack job. If you have an M and it is available for sale or trade at an APPROPRIATE price let me know. If you are looking to retire on the price don't bother. The sun has set on over inflated prices and no one is buying them anymore. I want this rifle for convenience of mag swaps from my AK to an SKS-M not because I don't have 3 regular SKS models already.

I am willing to trade a full bubba Norinco SKS OR a full factory Norinco SKS towards your SKS-M with cash and/or accessories. I have several mags and thousands of rounds of ammo I could throw in for the right rifle. Let me know what you have and your price. If you are open to a trade I will make you an items offer based upon what your asking price is. Know what you want BEFORE you email me so we don't have to play any games and send some pics as well so I know what I am considering for purchase. Otherwise it's just words on a screen. I am interested hence this ad creation. 

I want a face to face exchange only. No shipping items. I will drive to you as long as it's worth the time. I will have my VT photo ID to prove age and residence so know beforehand there are no legal complications with this exchange on my end. I will require a bill of sale for my records.

If you email and when I reply you stop responding then please save yourself the hassle and don't bother emailing at all if you're not serious. I am ready to buy NOW so you be ready to actually sell.

*NOTICE: PMAG 20LR COMPATIBILITY WITH LMT MWS RIFLE
A potential compatibility issue has come to Magpul's attention regarding the PMAG 20LR magazine when used in a limited number of 7.62 NATO caliber LMT MWS weapon systems. When the PMAG 20LR is inserted into the magazine well, some MWS rifles exhibit interference between the bolt catch and the rear of the magazine. This can cause partial engagement of the bolt catch and result in unintentional contact between the bolt carrier group and the bolt catch during normal weapon operation. Although this issue has only been reported by a very limited number of end users, Magpul has introduced a slight modification to all new production PMAG 20LR magazines to eliminate any potential for bolt catch interference, effective 5/18/2011.

Magpul is committed to continued improvement of our entire product line to ensure the widest range of weapon compatibility and best functionality possible. To most efficiently handle compatibility inquiries regarding the PMAG 20LR, please contact Magpul via email at REDACTED."

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar.  The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed.
The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel.  The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard.  The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver.  The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.

741,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1237741,For Sale:  Spikes Tactical AR15 AR74 w Melonite Lothar Walther barrel 5.45x39,"West Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee","$ 1,650","Listed On: Monday, March 11, 2013",Rifles,Spikes Tactical                                                                                ,5.45x39mm                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a new AR15 that will pay for itself in ammo savings, and then continue paying you back every time you buy more. It is a brand new limited production Spikes Tactical upper in 5.45x39 (AK74) caliber matched to a brand new complete milspec PSA GenII forged alloy lower receiver. It has never been fired and the fit is perfect, nice and tight. These are unofficially referred to as a ""AR74"" and are a very smart buy due to the similar caliber ammo they take which is plentiful and at a much lower cost. It has a top quality Lothar Walther barrel ($375 alone) and complete corrosion resistance treatment, specifically designed to chew through cheap surplus 5.45x39 ammo that is still widely available and only costs $160-$180 per 1080 round can. You will save approximately $500 or more per 1000 rounds compared to .223 / 5.56, so buy the time you have purchased 3 of the 1080 round cans you have saved the entire cost of the rifle, basically making it free. After that, it will continue to pay you back by saving you another $500 or so on every 1080 round can purchased. Instead of feeling gouged when trying to buy some ammo just to go shoot your rifle for the day, you can enjoy taking advantage of the minimal cost of your ammo making it a pleasant experience. This gives you an affordable way to stock up on ammo for your AR15, you can stack it deep in sealed cans and have a lifetime supply for that price. Shoot 3-4 times the amount of ammo (in a better round) than your buddies can with their AR15s for the same cost. You can even afford to waste I mean shoot your ammo using one of those SlideFire stocks with this set up if that is your thing. The 5.45x39 has a very flat trajectory and nearly identical velocity to 5.56, but tumbles violently on impact due to bullet design (as opposed to cleanly passing straight through like 5.56 can). It produces much more devastating wounds, and over-penetration should never be an issue with this caliber. Some people prefer it for home defense due to that fact alone. This is by far the cheapest military spec'd ammo there is to my knowledge. Some batches of this ammo may be corrosive, which really doesn't matter if you clean your rifle after shooting, but in case you cant or don't, this limited edition Spikes Tactical Corrosion Resistant upper has the following features: Melonite finish inside and out, Lothar Walther Barrel with Nickel Boron M4 Extension, Melonite coated F-marked FSB, Melonite coated Gas Tube (stainless roll pin), and Melonite coated A2 Flash Hider. I saw a video recently of a guy that shot 7500 rounds of corrosive surplus ammo through one of these Melonite treated uppers over the course of a year without cleaning the rifle. When he finally did there was zero corrosion present due to the anti-corrosion Melonite finish. Lower is complete milspec Palmetto State Armory, with a nice trigger and 6 position collapsable stock. Price is firm."

These folks offer some of the most awesome brakes available out there . I was trying to find some one reputable to turn down my bull barrel and then thread and mount a muzzle brake with no luck . I did a little looking around and came across Grizzly's web site and was convinced this might be an alternative . I have ordered a bolt on brake from them and am looking forward to mounting this on my Rock River Arms Varmint Rifle .  Check out their sight , you might find something for your firearm , what ever it might be .  I ordered mine over the phone and Jeff was extremely helpful and patient . I have every confidence what I have ordered will be of the highest quality , so do your self a favor , if you are looking for a solution to muzzle flip as well as esthetically pleasing looks , give a look at their site ! As soon as I apply the brake and have an opportunity to shoot thru it I will post my findings .

Muzzle brake came Saturday , mounted it for before & after pic's then went to the range and ran a few rounds through it .  Right picture is before brake , left picture is after .  Shot the first group then cleaned the bore , applied the brake permanently and shot the second group . This was at 100 yards . Thank you Grizzly Gun Works . I will order a brake from them for a DPMS I have . They offer both threaded and none threaded brakes . $250.00 is what this brake cost , and they do not make the brake for your specific firearm until you place the order .These groups were done quickly to test target reacgusition . Proved to do well !!  This RRA .223 Varmint Gun looks like a .50 Cal. , and that may not be for some people , but for me , looks awesome and shoots the same !!"

Due to the current political climate and the high prevalence of sheeple, I just paid a hell of a lot more than I should have to for another 'black rifle.' I'm not made of fiat currency, so therefore I need to offset my latest endeavor into common sense.

Unlike most folks selling their ammo you will see I'm actually offering high QUALITY products at a premium ... vs all the entry-level products at ridiculous mark-ups... that are all over the place out there. Am I charging more than I paid? Yup. I'm fully justified to do so due to the fact that I had the foresight to plan and ACT accordingly. I jumped through plenty of hoops to get what I have. I don't make it a habit to give away any of my labors for nothing in return, at least in this instance Try going anywhere online or elsewhere and see if you can find a better deal on what I have to offer. Most everything I'm offering isn't even readily available these days... and hasn't been for quite some months now. Period.

It's been my experience that firearms related PURCHASES always turn out to be a most positive and beneficial thing, whereas whenever I've SOLD something I already possessed... down the road I seriously regretted it. Always. So as crazy as it might sound, if I don't sell one solitary round, that would actually work out for me in 'the long run.' Just ask Don. If I TRY to replace anything I'm offering here within the next 6-12 months or even later... most likely I'll be paying more than what you'd be paying to me in the present. Of course that is assuming that these type of QUALITY products... will even be readily available for purchase at that time.

These folks offer some of the most awesome brakes available out there . I was trying to find some one reputable to turn down my bull barrel and then thread and mount a muzzle brake with no luck . I did a little looking around and came across Grizzly's web site and was convinced this might be an alternative . I have ordered a bolt on brake from them and am looking forward to mounting this on my Rock River Arms Varmint Rifle .  Check out their sight , you might find something for your firearm , what ever it might be .  I ordered mine over the phone and Jeff was extremely helpful and patient . I have every confidence what I have ordered will be of the highest quality , so do your self a favor , if you are looking for a solution to muzzle flip as well as esthetically pleasing looks , give a look at their site ! As soon as I apply the brake and have an opportunity to shoot thru it I will post my findings .

Muzzle brake came yesterday , mounted it for before after pic's then went to the range and ran a few rounds through it .  Right picture is before brake , left picture is after .  Shot the first group then cleaned the bore , applied the brake permanently and shot the second group . This was at 100 yards . Thank you Grizzly Gun Works . I will order a brake from them for a DPMS I have . They offer both threaded and none threaded brakes . $250.00 is what this brake cost , and they do not make the brake for your specific firearm until you place the order .These groups were done quickly to test target reacgusition . Proved to do well !!"

Bushmaster's Optics Ready Carbine is designed to provide a platform for your imagination: any optics, any purpose, anywhere. The ORC comes with a receiver-length Picatinny optics rail and two 1-1/4"" riser optics blocks (perfect for holographic sites, scopes, or red dots) without a lot of extra factory accessories that you're going to replace anyway. But the ORC isn't a bare-bones rifle by any means. Its 16"" M4 profile barrel is chrome-lined in both the bore and the chamber with an A2, birdcage-type flash hider to control muzzle flash. A heavy oval M4-type handguard provides a fore-grip while maintaining the ORC's immaculate balance and control. The ORC's six-position telescoping stock reduces overall length by 4"" when collapsed for convenient carry. Every ORC is shipped with an operator's safety manual, a detachable box magazine, an orange safety block, and a black web sling."
