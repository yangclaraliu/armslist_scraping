It is flat black with military type paint. It is a 6.2L Diesel Engine with 73,000 miles. The vehicle runs very well. All the lights and reflectors are new. I have done regular oil changes on this vehicle while I have owned it using Rotella T motor oil. The Blazer has 32 Inch mud tires with a lot of tread still on them. It also has a nearly new 32 inch mud tire for a spare in the back seat. The vehicle is still 24 V but I will give the buyer of the vehicle the directions on how to convert the Blazer to 12 V. I will also give the buyer of the vehicle a military CUCV manual.   The vehicle has a engine block heater that works very well.

The Blazer is equipped with new lockable center console, front bucket cloth seats from a 1989 civilian model blazer, and a tilt steering wheel from a 1989 civilian model blazer. The vehicle has a new stereo/CD player with after market antenna, and MP3 Player Jack, and Kenwood speakers in the front doors. There is a mounted tachometer on the dash and mounted fire extinguisher on the floor.

All the windows are tinted except for the windshield. The vehicle is covered in rhino-lining inside the cab on everything behind the front seats. The backseat is still in place and in good condition. 

There is a mounted large ammo can in the back used as a small tool box. There are a total of four ""D Ring"" shackles for pulling on the front and back of the vehicle.

The CUCV/Blazer still has functional black-out lights and switches. Four wheel drive (4 Low and 4 Hi) both work. The Blazer is equipped with a K&N air filter. The Blazer has an aftermarket steel Cowl Induction Hood. 

I was planning on making this the ultimate camping/survival/off road vehicle however my family is growing and need to get rid of it. I am selling with the Blazer a Radio Shack CB Radio with Wilson Antenna, a Rancho steering stabilizer, and KC Lights (with covers) with electrical switches and harness for lights. Those items have not been installed yet but do come with the blazer as I was planning on adding them. Also, the Blazer is equipped with a white dome light on a toggle switch. I have a new dome light that has the option of white or red (for tactical situations) that will come with the blazer. It is not installed but will come with blazer. 

The entire rear latch and handle have been replaced. The last one broke and I ordered all the parts from LMC Truck and installed them. No parts in the latch were reused. 

There is only one minor rust spot and it is only surface rust on the passenger side door. The rust spot can be easily fixed and cleaned with minor work. 

I am asking $6500 Or Best Offer for the vehicle. Please email me with any questions or if you would like pictures sent to you via email.  I have a lot more photos."

The laser is activated by a small switch on the left side of the stock. This rifle has had about 1000 rounds through it give or take a few. It eats anything you put in it provided you use a good steel-lipped mag. It has some wear on the top from the lock from having it stored in the closet. This gun is meticulously cleaned after every trip to the range and has been well loved. Some minor scratches here and there i can send pictures. This is truly a very cool firearm to own and so much fun to shoot! Comes with factory lock and a case and the red dot sight in the picture and factory mag.

This particular rifle is all original Remington parts, with only 2 small non-Remington parts in the bolt - extremely rare as there are 36 of 38 parts stamped with R, battle swap).  Barrel made 2/1918 which matches serial # dating.  All original blueing (many/most were re-blued throughout use of multiple wars).  One small scratched area of stock, but have seen on other rifles so may be a rack storage issue.  The bore is clean and bright and will be an excellent shooter.

Designed for the U.S. Army and carried by U.S. Navy SEALs, Texas Rangers and many other elite military and law enforcement professionals, the SIG SAUER® P226 has earned its place in the highest class of 
production pistols.



The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. 



The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle, and its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. 



You will receive the pistol, case, two magazines, manuals, etc. I will only accept check or money order. I will only ship FFL to FFL. Please feel free to ask any questions and more pictures can be provided if needed. Thanks for looking, Craig"

The new bi-directional, X-Tac frontstrap and slide treatment offer enhanced grip and improved durability over traditional checkering in severe and hard-use environments. Scientifically designed to work with dry or wet hands, with or without tactical gloves, the X-Tac pattern redefines secure shooting comfort and gunhandling without the coarse, often painful nature of other grip treatments. In tandem with our G-10 Starburst grips, the X-Tac tread pattern locks securely into the firing hand and will reduce muzzle flip without snagging on clothes or cover garments. The X-Tac proudly wears our newest rear sight, the Wilson Combat® 1911 Battlesight. This high profile rear sight has a .145” wide U-Notch for optimum sighting in low-light, dynamic range conditions. The rear blade of the sight is serrated, while the notch area is recessed into a semi-circular pocket for a crisp, protected sight picture. This model has the Tritium Night Battle Sights with two white in back and one green up front. You will receive the pistol, bag, two magazines, manuals, etc. I will only accept check or money order. I will only ship FFL to FFL. Please feel free to ask any questions and more pictures can be provided if needed. Thanks for looking, Craig"

It comes with a 20rd magazine, two point sling, Kel-Tec hard case and all the original paperwork and manual. Length: 31"". Barrel length: 24"". Magazine: 20rd. Practical range: 1200m. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels have a Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and the Hunter comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle."

750,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1750750,For Sale:  Colt Single Action Army (S.A.A) - Tanaka,"New York, New York, United States",$ 800,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 12, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Tanaka SAAs are widely held as the most beautiful, accurately replicated and well made airsoft revolvers available. They are only sporadically made and are often totally unobtainable.
The box was fairly typical of Tanaka's other revolvers, except that the background to the photographic artwork on the lid was bright red, rather than the usual dark background.

The silver finish on this gun is nothing like the stainless finish on the S&W 629s, being a bright, highly polished chrome finish....The weight and balance of the gun is good and there is nothing visible on the gun that one could describe as a fault or blemish.
The hammer cocks to two positions, half cock to permit rotation of the cylinder for loading and full cock, for firing. Of course, being a Single Action revolver, the SAA needs manually cocking before each shot, like a springer. This is achieved simply by pulling back the hammer.

On the barrel's left side is the legend ""COLT SINGLE ACTION ARMY .45"", with ""COLT'S PTFA MFG. CO. HARTFORD CT. U.S.A."" on the top of the barrel. There are a couple of small proofing marks on the left side of the trigger guard.
There are Colt logos on the grips in the form of a rampant horse in an oval raised section and there's a small Colt horse logo next to the patent marks. If you turn the gun upside down, you will find the only Tanaka mark right on the front of the frame, where it reads ""ASGK""/""MFG.TANAKA"".
The foresight is tall and clear, but the rear sight is a simple groove in the top of the frame, making the sights rudimentary at best.
The overall finish is excellent. I could not find anything that looked like a brush mark or pitting and the consistency of the mirror finish chrome effect across the various parts and materials appears 100%, even under varying light conditions, which are often expose even very minor flaws.

To load extra BBs, over the standard six cylinder openings, you need to remove the magazine stored in the extractor rod, which is done by depressing the 'screw' at the front (on the underside) of it. You can then fill the magazine with BBs and replace the extractor rod.

The grips are black plastic, replicating hard rubber, The hammer certainly is metal, as is the trigger and cylinder."

Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45.

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. Apparently the SEALS think differently! Note: in a picture from “No Easy Day” there is this model HK45C top left in the locker of equipment used in recent operations. Same gun minus the suppressor.

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics:

Integral MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
ERGO (HK45 full-size) and slim-line (HK45 Compact) grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
Two high-capacity 10 round mags that fit both the HK45 and HK45C
Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system
O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and better accuracy (four extra rings supplied)
Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and increased accuracy
Improved ergonomic control levers (safety and/or decocking)
Low profile drift adjustable Tru Dot night sights
Contoured and radiused slide with forward slide (grasping) grooves and anti-glare longitudinal ribs

Weight unloaded (no magazine):	9.8 lbs. Length: 31"". Barrel length: 24"". Magazine: 20rd. Practical range: 1200m. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels have a Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and the Hunter comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle."

It comes with a 20rd magazine, two point sling, Kel-Tec hard case and all the original paperwork and manual.Weight unloaded (no magazine): 9.8 lbs. Length: 31"". Barrel length: 24"". Magazine: 20rd. Practical range: 1200m. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels have a Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and the Hunter comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle."
