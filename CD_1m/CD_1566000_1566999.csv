I'm also keeping my eyes open for FAIR deals on ammo for those calibers as well as 7.62X39 to a lesser extent (can't ever have too much!). I'm not in a hurry so I can afford to wait and skip the price gouging that is so rampant right now. 

In addition to the powder and ammo I also am interested in brass and bullets for the pistol calibers, for the right price.

I would prefer to trade but cash either way would also be considered--I don't have a lot of cash right now...but who does, right? (For the record I for the most part really would like to get some powder and/or reloading components, so the ammo is only if part of the deal or a really good price.)

If you are able to meet anywhere between here and there along I-5 during those times we can work out somewhere to meet. RESPOND QUICKLY BECAUSE WE LEAVE TOWN AT 2 P.M. TODAY

Let's help one another out and not use these times as an opportunity to make a quick buck or two with ridiculous prices. Our community is better than that, and we need each other right now more than ever.

Posted in PA. Asks for money order to Nevada??? Google Christopher Munn Nevada and check the 1911 forum. What a tool. Hope he gets what's coming to him

Here is his response:

I understand your concern about trying to protect yourself. You really do not have anything to worry about if it is dealing with me,I have no reason to do anything funny, if there is anything then i have to deal with the police because of the firearm involved. I am a man of honour and will never do anything stupid to jeopardize my career.You are sending this to my house address and also the post office money order is backed by the government,  there is no way i can hide from my identity, if i try to do anything  funny..i'll have to deal with the postal inspector and ATF because of the firearm  and money order involved. So you have my word for a smooth transaction.I bought this for my personal collection but finances force me to sell it. i am in Money problems right now(problems with the Mortgage, credit card etc)...my wife had to stop working because of her health conditions so the whole weight is all on me for now and the gun is ported
  I will hold it for you pending receipt of payment.  Please send post office money order to:

The scope is a 4x-16x BSA Contender(retails for close to $200) with an illuminated reticle( crosshairs illuminate in 3 colors: red, blue, green with 3 brightness setting for each color). The rifle also comes with a Blackhawk soft case, 6 thirty round Pmags(2 have dust covers), and the 2 ten round magazines that came with the gun(they fit up into the stock for storage). I am not interested in ANY TRADES.  I prefer to sell to a concealed carry permit holder but is not required as long as you are willing to prove you are a GA resident and old enough to own the gun. The best way to get in touch with me is through email and I will respond quickly. I will not ship the gun.

This is the identical ammo being used right now in the Middle East by U.S. Troops.
The 5.56mm M855 has a green bullet tip. Adopted by NATO in 1980, the new load has a spitzer boattail bullet. It also has much improved penetration characteristics over the old M193 55-grain projectile at all ranges, resulting in higher retained velocity and greater accuracy at long range. The 5.56mm M855 is ideal for use in rifle M16A2, M4, and machine gun M249. Synonyms: 5.56 Penetrator, 5.56 x 45mm

Manufacturer's Data:
Muzzle Velocity 3000 ± 40 f/s at 78 ft.

Accuracy ind targets horiz and vertsd = 7.8 in. at 600 yd.

I believe the manufacturer is QFI (Quality Firearms Inc.) and I believe it was made between 1991-1992.  It is a blued finish, however some discoloration has started to set in.

A competent gunsmith can probably fix this relatively quickly, but I am not a gunsmith.  The condition is Fair and would be a good gun to get some cheap handgun practice.  For further information, this was an imported and rebranded Hawes Small Frame Revolver.

New Enhanced Model Holds Two Carbines and Two Pistols
This case is designed to hold one or two of the M-4 carbines with a collapsible stock and a 16 inch barrel. It will also hold similar carbines with a collapsible stock, a folding stock rifle, or any other weapon that is under 35 inches in overall length. This 36-inch Voodoo Tactical brand padded rifle carrying case will help protect your rifle from the hard knocks of transportation, whether in your vehicle or in the field. It can also be used if you break down your gun or to carry different uppers.

Inside are two sets of adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case that has foam only on two sizes or the flimsy egg-crate foam of some hard-shell cases. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement.

Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories.
This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six standard size magazines and the center pouch is even larger.

This Voodoo Tactical gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear.

These bags are top notch and will last last a life time!"

According to the Ruger handbook, a rare and collectable combination of sights, and caliber.
It does have some wear from the previous owner, but is still in about 98% quality. Only scratches in the wood are just in the finish. Blue-ing is beautiful.

I have the Ruger custom scope rings, if you prefer taking your game at a distance, leather sling, recoil absorber, hard case, and a 9 round sleeve, for quick follow up shots. Though I doubt you'd need one, while firing one of the 19 500gr, 5,000+ft/lbs rounds that I have.

The round puts out over 4/3 as much power as the 7mm Magnum, and is good for any game that walks this Earth. 
For hunting, you can take any game you please, as long as you have the permit.
 For home defense, it is a heavy gun, to absorb the recoil, but single shot weapons are 4 inches shorter than respective lever or bolt guns, due to not needing the action, making it shorter than an 870 shotgun. And the .458 round can shatter an elephant skull. I'm sure that it can make short work of any armor any intruder will wear.
Worried about zombies? I'm sure this will make chunky salsa out of a line of them.
Plinking? Honestly, no. At $100+ for a box of 20, you better be rich if you plan on taking this to the range every weekend. But if you reload? From what I've read, .45 ""Long"" Colt rounds will work, allowing you to shoot for much cheaper, if you're not worried about Dangerous Game.

Single action sucks? A skilled operator can use this rig just as fast as a bolt action rifle.
Also, if you see a man taking a single shot rifle out of the case, and on a hunt, it says something about him. The silence of any onlookers tells you that they know you're both a more skilled hunter, and a better marksman than any of them."

The rifle is very accurate, the bolt is the second smoothest Mosin bolt I've ever worked and the manufacture date is 1940, factory tula

I have a Nagant revolver as well, marked 1938 tula, it comes with about 35 rounds. I've only shot it a little but it's proven accurate for me, though I've compensated for it shooting a bit off, it shoots consistently.. 

For the rifle and the ammo i'd like 500 as the sniper quality ammo is not cheap nor did I come by it cheaply. For the revolver i'd like 300 as I payed 275 for it without ammo, and they've only become more scarce as of late. I will do 600 on the pair if we can hurry up and get this done, even considering mosin rifles were 150 dollar rifles not too long ago that's a pretty good deal for two guns and a ton of ammo I think.

New Enhanced Model Holds Two Carbines and Two Pistols
This case is designed to hold one or two of the M-4 carbines with a collapsible stock and a 16 inch barrel. It will also hold similar carbines with a collapsible stock, a folding stock rifle, or any other weapon that is under 35 inches in overall length. This 36-inch Voodoo Tactical brand padded rifle carrying case will help protect your rifle from the hard knocks of transportation, whether in your vehicle or in the field. It can also be used if you break down your gun or to carry different uppers.

Inside are two sets of adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case that has foam only on two sizes or the flimsy egg-crate foam of some hard-shell cases. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement.

Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories.
This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six standard size magazines and the center pouch is even larger.

This Voodoo Tactical gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear.

These bags are top notch and will last last a life time!"

Prefer local sale in SC only for cash , otherwise only ship to FFL Dealer. Very rare hard to find (1941) RUSSIAN SVT-40 RIFLE - 7.62x54r caliber semi-automatic rifle. 10 round detachable magazine. The Samozaryadnaya Vintovka Tokareva (SVT-40) was designed by Soviet Arms Designer Fedor Tokarev. It was manufactured between 1941 and 1945. The SVT-40 is an improved and simplified rifle design over the SVT-38. During WWII SVT-40 rifles were highly prized captures by both German and Finnish troops. Many pictures in books of German troops on the eastern front carrying the SVT-40. The biggest issue with the SVT 40 is the ejection of the spent casing due to improper gas cartridge adjustment and improper powder loads. DO NOT use any loads over 150 grain as this will destroy the gas chamber. Overall condition is rated as fair to good for an old surplus military rifle that will never be imported again into the USA. 10 magazine is an aftermarket, so not all original, all other numbers match THAT I CAN TELL. Wood stock has 3 cracks/splits at rear top of receiver and at bottom of mag well. Gun has some surface rust spots. I would grade gun and bore as fair to good condition. Still has some blueing on metal parts. Additional pictures could be emailed to serious buyers only before ending!! If must be shipped, I will only ship to an FFL Licensed Holder Dealer Only!! Great for shooting , collecting or the one that got away! Serious Inquiries Only Please!!!

I have a Nagant revolver as well, marked 1938 tula, it comes with about 35 rounds. I've only shot it a little but it's proven accurate for me, though I've compensated for it shooting a bit off, it shoots consistently.. 

For the rifle and the ammo i'd like 500 as the sniper quality ammo is not cheap nor did I come by it cheaply. For the revolver i'd like 300 as I payed 275 for it without ammo, and they've only become more scarce as of late. I will do 600 on the pair if we can hurry up and get this done, even considering mosin rifles were 150 dollar rifles not too long ago that's a pretty good deal for two guns and a ton of ammo I think.

The decision was made not to enter full-scale production and this is one of the few examples of this special gun that will ever be available.



One other example of this rare firearm auctioned for more than $3,200 on GunBroker.com.



Following a test production of 500 guns in 2011, North American Arms reluctantly decided to end production because the hand assembly required to achieve the high quality that NAA demanded proved just too expensive.



  Since North American Arms announced that they would cease production, the Rangers have been soaring in value. One Ranger recently auctioned for more than $3,200.00 on GunBroker.com. All proceeds from this auction will benefit the NRA Women's Leadership Forum.



This one-of-a-kind Ladies Leadership Forum offering features special serial # NRAWLF1. Gun comes in a custom presentation case provided by North American Arms.

.380 Walther PPK/S. Good condition, shoots flawlessly. Stainless does have some light scratching as it has seen some duty time. Comes with original case, 2 magazines (one with finger grip extension), rubber handgrip, one Galco brown leather paddle holster, and one black leather ankle holster with harness.

I am aware of the safety recall on this model that was issued in 02/09. I sent the pistol to S&W the same year, they repaired it, and sent it back with a small punch dot on the back of the frame indicating the faulty hammer block was replaced. I have not had any issues with this gun and still carry it on duty.
