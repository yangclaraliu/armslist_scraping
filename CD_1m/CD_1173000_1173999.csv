About 400 were imported between 1991-1993 until President Clinton signed an executive order prohibiting communist nations importation of assault weapons.

This particular gun is in the most desirable and rarest caliber, 7.62x51 NATO (.308 Winchester) only this model was offered in that caliber. Most guns were in 7.62x54r which was less accurate.

Every serial number matches. The scope is a numbered 4x PSO made for the gun. 

It also includes a second 10 round magazine worth about $500.

I will not trade. I will not take less. I won't respond to you if you ask dumb or scammer questions. Foid and ID required. 

There are perhaps 20 mint, never fired guns like this left in the nation. They are incredibly accurate. (My other one was fired and it was .5 MoA)

Every accessory included, original case, everything still in oiled paper. Mint.

Please don't be an idiot and write me that you can buy a Dragunov for $1500...an Ak or SKS or Romak is not a Dragunov. Two of these sold online last month for $8500 and $9600 respectively.

Many believe that with the government constantly printing money, the US dollar could be devalued very soon, which many believe could lead to the one world currency referred to in prophecy. You've also got Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, and other nations demanding that the world move away from the US Dollar as the worlds trading currency - which would drop the dollar overnight like the peso once did. If the world switches to a 'common' currency, it will have to move to something backing that currencies value, and in order to be equitable to all nations it will likely mean a return to the gold standard of some sort. You may have heard that Russia and China have been quietly buying up all the gold they can get without disturbing the markets, and that Germany wants all their gold moved from the USA over to its own banks. What does all this mean for our economy? The US dollar could become as wall paper, gold would be king, and silver, being the poor mans gold, would follow right along with it. In other words, silver is an affordable commodity for you and I that has no where to go but up. Keep in mind also that while 95% of all the gold ever mined is still in use, silver is a disposable or consumable metal meaning it is generally not recycled, there are more uses for silver than there is for gold, and when our bottom starts to fall out from beneath us, everybody and their brother who cannot afford gold will be looking to buy silver - which will skyrocket the price/value. And lastly, in a time of crisis, silver is also a good currency alternative that will always have value.

LWRC M6A2 SPR
Black 5.56
Spiral Fluted Barrel

Brand New! NO credit card fees!!


The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

Plus a 4lb trigger compliments of JP trigger springs
Plus 
3 Tactical Plinker 35 round mags (these are going for 80 - 100 ALONE if you can find them
Plus a Surefire military spec flashlight with NV cover 

This isnt a cheap set up for a .22 and its a very very hard to find one since the mags will be banned within months and probably so will the rifle unless you already own it. Makes shooting fun again when you can leave the range with 500 rounds of ammo shot for 50 bucks ?

Its the reason I build these if the add is up I still have the gun and YES I WILL SHIP TO ANYWHERE IN THE US UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITION
If the mags are banned they arent going PERIOD I can try and find a 10 round to add in those are cheap online but I will not ship to states with size limiations PERIOD and I have google so dont lie to me I will check

Your funds have to clear my bank account first so if you paypal (which I prefer the funds have to hit my account ususally within 3 days and I will ship within 24 hours of the funds in my account. 
Legally speaking the gun has to ship to your FFL but the mags and other toys ill box and ship to you directly You will pay shipping costs (around $30 -40 not super bad and get it within a few days.

I do not list my cell phone and I am open to trades anything really I love military gear but guns are king so is coin silver and gold but any trade HAS TO EQUAL or surpass asking price

I have alot in this gun financially so save me the ""your such a fuck head emails"", I report em all and I know how to track IP addresses so keep the harassment on the youtube message boards.

The Samozaryadnaya Vintovka Tokareva (SVT-40) was designed by Soviet Arms Designer Fedor Tokarev. It was manufactured between 1941 and 1945. The SVT-40 is an improved and simplified rifle design over the SVT-38. 
During WWII SVT-40 rifles were highly prized captures by both German and Finnish troops. Many pictures in books of German troops on the eastern front carrying the SVT-40. 
The biggest issue with the SVT 40 is the ejection of the spent casing due to improper gas cartridge adjustment and improper powder loads. DO NOT use any loads over 150 grain as this will destroy the gas chamber. Overall condition is rated as fair to good for an old surplus military rifle that will never be imported again into the USA. 10rd magazine is an aftermarket so not all original.

In order to realize this goal the engineers spent years experimenting with different systems until they created this mechanical marvel. Simple but durable, the 54 uses a floating action riding on rails to achieve a totally recoiless system that stands up to the pounding of our 1100 fps system. Not only does this arrangement prevent transmission of felt recoil to the shooter, it also permits the rifle to excel in the accuracy department. When the rifle is fired, the action moves back lightly within the stock, absorbing the recoil, and permitting the pellet to exit the barrel before any of the spring vibration affects its travel. This system dramatically improves the accuracy potential of this magnum air rifle, making it a first class choice for either long range pest control or the precise demands of field target shooting. This side lever cocking magnum rifle's other features include adjustable trigger, adjustable rear sight, scope rail, Monte Carlo stock with cheek piece and checkering, and an automatic safety.
Sells on-line for $595.00 without the scope and case.
On a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent) this would be an 8.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper (not included). The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

The supplies of cerakoted LWRC's are almost non-existent right now because they increase production time. We were able to get our hands on one of the last cerakoted REPR's. We've been told by LWRC that it will likely be 2014 before more of colored versions will be available (if they'll even still be legal to be produced and sold to the civilian market at that time.)

Anyways....

M&p 9 full size with apex trigger kit, Burris fastfire 2, and dovetail mount. +4- 17rd mags, and an owb kydex holster that's never been worn. Does not come with box, papers, backstraps etc. 


The pistol itself has about 1k rds thru it, the trigger kit about 500, and the sight has been on for 500. The pistol has the slightest wear all over the slide, it's not really on the sharp edges though. The wear is barely visible and I don't think it's gonna show up in the pics. The trigger is one of the best I've felt out of all the apex kits I have installed. 

Disclaimer: The fastfire is not zeroed, I had it off for a full cleaning and haven't rezeroed it yet. 

Id like to sell as a package to cover as much of the cost of the HK but I'd be willing to keep some mags and the holster as I have other m&p's I can use them for. 


Asking $1000 but I'll entertain offers within reason. I'm also willing to meet within reason to let potential buyers look it over.

16"" 7.62 NATO

Brand New & In Stock!! NO credit card fees!!



The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper (not included). The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

The supplies of cerakoted LWRC's are almost non-existent right now because they increase production time. We were able to get our hands on one of the last cerakoted REPR's. We've been told by LWRC that it will likely be 2014 before more of colored versions will be available (if they'll even still be legal to be produced and sold to the civilian market at that time.)

ammo- very reasonable if you shop for the ammo you will see! Rare ammo regardless of the recent hype. Your lucky to find a box or two here and there every once in a great while. So decently priced considering I have seen others selling just the brass for a buck each.  
One or the other Ill part the two, Pistol or Ammo only if buyer isn't interested in the other of the two.
If someone is interested and can make a transaction happen with me no later than march 4th ill take 500 for the Pistol and Ammo.
Call number below for any questions. 
Transaction will be done through a FFL only , buyer consumes the transfer fee. Its pretty cheap everywhere these days.  Will not leave the immediate Des Moines area or surrounding communities.  Buyer takes all responsibility of the firearm. Its being sold as is used and seller has claims no liability for the mentioned firearm. The firearm is in excellent working order and will be transferred as such.  Thanks for looking!

  Reloaders should be certified by a state or national agency in said field. If your not I suggest you find a reputable reloader that will properly reload any ammo you may need for this pistol and or any other firearms! Seen too many people not take the right measures and end up with a broken gun and or worse hurt from some non-certified reloaders loading ammunition when they should not be!

With the Security System engaged, the Taurus PT-100 cannot be fired or cocked and the manual safety cannot be disengaged. Equipped with a forged-alloy frame, fixed one-dot front sight, and adjustable two-dot rear sight, the Taurus PT-100 offers outstanding accuracy and performance, without sacrificing durability and strength. The Taurus PT-100 is an all-around excellent pistol.

Barnett Quad-300 Compound Crossbow:
The Quad-300 is the fastest, most powerful production crossbow in the world. Barnett's leadership in innovation and superior technology is truly evident in this bow. Details such as the extended trigger pull which allows a much longer power stroke and the heavy duty components used in assembly are simply not found on other crossbows. The unique System 4 limb design, teamed with Radical Cam Technology and the continuous flight track assembly delivers incredible power, speed and performance. The Quad-300 is capable of delivering real speeds of over 300 feet per second when using 2219-XX75- 20"" hunting arrows. With this tremendous speed and heavy arrow projection, the power of the Quad-300 is bone crushing upon impact. In terms of speed and power, Barnett's Quad-300 out-performs all other production crossbows.

16"" 7.62 NATO

Brand New & In Stock!! NO credit card fees!!



The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper (not included). The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

The supplies of cerakoted LWRC's are almost non-existent right now because they increase production time. We were able to get our hands on one of the last cerakoted REPR's. We've been told by LWRC that it will likely be 2014 before more of colored versions will be available (if they'll even still be legal to be produced and sold to the civilian market at that time.)
