Its a Stevens 311 H and it was built to last.  I was wanting a 12 gauge coach style shotgun a few years ago but could only find 20 gauge options at my local dealers.  When I saw this shotgun it was the heavy duty construction that swayed my purchasing it.  I bought it.with 30"" barrels.  I had Louisville Firearms Service Center reduce the barrels to the current 18.5 inches and had adjustable rifle sights installed.

The two triggers were a major reason I.wanted a coach style shotgun.  If you squeeze both triggers at once then both barrels will fire.  Thats a lot of lead on target, lol.  I added the side.saddle to the stock, a.picatinny rail for a light and a Magpul AFG for more positive grip.  The shotgun is a workhorse and everyone who sees or shoots it loves it.

This Rifle uses a gas piston system as opposed to the conventional gas system. (The piston system is a lot cleaner) It has a 6 position stock with dual compartments on each side and an ambidextrious check rest.I put a hogue rubber pistol grip on because the standard plastic grip really suck and this grip forms to your hand really well. It has a standard m4 muzzle break and a 1/2 x28 standard threaded barrel. Rifle comes with troy industries flip up front sight and romag flip up rear sight. I've put less than 200 rounds through it. The gun functions great and eats up all types of ammo  whether its steel casings, brass casings, 75 grain comp loads, it cycles everything I've tried. bought it brand new back in October of 2012 from a dealer here in Reno. I am a Nevada resident, however this IS a California legal weapon with a ""bullet button"". I know this because I did numerous legal transfers through an FFL when I was a California resident last year. I also bought guns private party from Nevada legally using an FFL when I was a California resident. As long as they are compliant with the state laws. Since this is a rifle, no FFL is needed until January1, 2014 when all rifles and shotguns bought after said date in California will need to be registered. I am selling the gun simply due to me disliking the ar15 platform, I kind of don't like the thought of selling it because it is a very slick weapon but I'm more of an Kalashnikov kind of person. The reason I am selling in California is because everyone in Nevada simply has tried to jerk me around on the price past the point of being reasonable. I travel to Sacramento frequently to visit my parents therefore I would be willing to travel down or meet half way in Truckee or something for a legitimate purchaser of the gun. You will need to provide a bullet button and I will need to install it before the transfer is complete. The gun comes with 6 standard 30 round ""mag kits"" as Californians have been recently been calling them. (Two pmags, two troy industries, two steel GI mags. I won't take responsibility for you putting them together though of course. Please give me a call or text if you have any questions REDACTED -Connor
Btw, there is no rear sight on the weapon because promag is sending me a new one due to a manufacture defect. Purchaser must be at least 18 years of age and be qualified to possess a firearm."

Ive got a Huglu 12 gauge SxS model 201A in new and never fired condition. It was imported by my buddy from Turkey personally. He never got around to shooting it so has decided to sell it to try and get some cash. It is brand new and has only been taken out of the box to show people and to ""shoulder"" it.

I can shoot you pictures via cell or possibly email (if i can get my computer to actually wok for once). My cell is REDACTED if you want to text questions or offers. Please text only because between work and school I am nearly never free to take a call. However, if you want to call feel free to do so and I will respond if i can. Also, leave a voicemail if i dont answer so i know what it is about. I am possibly also interested in trades on this. I would take full or partial trade of a good full frame or compact 9mm, a good little ""snake popper"" 22lr, anything like that. Id even consider trades or a lot of ammo,  Or if you have another kind of trade in mind just let me know. I am pretty open to anything of value and use. I know that this gun isnt junk so please dont shoot a real lowball offer or I likely wont even respond. Thanks for your time and have a great day!

The lusterous blueing on the slide, barrel and other hard parts is nicely contrasted by the lovely walnut stocks with the carved S&W and Gunsite Raven logo's which is echoed in the Raven engraving on the receiver. The frame is made from Scandium. The sights are Novak low rise and make for a smooth, no snag draw from a holster (no front gold bead). The barrel is 4 1/4"" with a match grade barrel bushing. The trigger is adjustable. The gun comes in the factory lockable protective case with the original manual, barrel wrench, 2 S&W OEM ACT made, 8 round magazines and sealed packet containing the sample factory fired casing. 

I am the original owner and have fired this very accurate pistol less than 100 rounds of Federal and RP 45 ACP hardball. The earlier manufactured pistols like this one (SN FSP 0798) were completely hand fitted for maximum accuracy and reliability. The gun is in completely stock, unmodified condition since new. I will offer approximately 2 and 1/2 boxes of new RP (2 boxes of 50 rounds 230gr RN, approximately 1/2 box of Federal 230gr RN) to the buyer.

I play by the rules. For sale face to face only to bonafide Florida resident with proof of Fl residency, otherwise it has to go through (or sale to) an FFL. 

I also believe in describing an item accurately. Feel free to check my feedback on ebay (handle- achildofthesky )I am an individual (no sales tax!) and not a dealer or business and because of this, the gun is sold with out warranties of any type on my part and all sales are final. That said, if you have been looking for a truely ASNIB example of these accurate and finely assembled and increasingly hard to find pistols you will not be dissapointed with this one. 

Please, no tire kickers, Lookie Lou's or time wasters, I am selling a exrtemely high quality,hand fitted handgun at a very attractive price. Not looking for trades unless you have a no lock S&W 340M&P 357 magnum scandium as a part trade and possibly a NAA 22 Mag mini revolver again as a part trade. You will NEVER see another one in this area on a face to face deal. Don't miss out. Regret sucks!

Comes with box, instructions and mounting hardware. The only reason I am selling is to try out a scope and I don't want both. The sight works flawlessly .  It was was put on a rifle and never used. Chances are you know what you are looking at. These Red Dots are used by our military for a reason. They are battle proven sights that refuse to fail.

I can meet you anywhere from Sandy to Portland to Milwaukee as I drive around all day for work.
Description:
Smaller and lighter than other holographic weapon sights, the EOTech XPS2-0 is an ideal compact option for your weapon platform. The XPS2-0 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
The XPS2-0 runs on a single 123 battery, making it small enough to leave plenty of rail space for rear iron sights, magnifiers, and other tools (the shortened base requires 2.75 inches of rail space maximum). EOTech also eliminated the battery cap and latch and replaced them with a simple O-ring tethered cap, helping the sight achieve better sealing. Note that the XPS2 is not night vision compatible.

I really love this gun and will probably turn around and buy another one if I can find one that will zero with the front sight post in the middle.

This rifle has approximately 250 rounds through it. It feeds and shoots flawlessly, including steel. It was manufactured in April 2013 and is 100% American made with a lifetime transferrable warranty. Attached is a limited edition Leupold  VX-R HOG 1.5x4 32mm Illuminated Red Dot Scope with flip covers. It is paired with a P.E.P.R. quick release tactical mount. The gun has been upgraded with a quad rail and features a ProMag vertical  foregrip. The stock grip has been upgraded to a Houge Rubber grip.
I am also including the original A2 style handguard, stock grip, x1 30 round steel magazine, 100 rounds of brass American Eagle ammunition, rail covers, and a sling soft case. Both the rifle and scope have lifetime transferrable warranties.
If you are looking for the perfect rifle/scope combo, then this is it. The Leupold VX-R allows you to co-witness targets up close, and dial in with the magnification for long range shooting. The optical quality is second to none.  The only reason I am looking to sell is that I need funds to complete an AR-10 build. I am pricing low to get the ball rolling. There is just over $2k into this rifle. Please no low balls or trades (with the exception of AR .308 parts/rifles).

Asking 700 for the package. Will negotiate if you don't want/need the red dot

I purchased this rifle some time ago, and boy was it rough. I refinished the stock, did touch up bluing, cleaned the living hell out of it, and made a new butt plate for it. It shoots like a dream. At 75 yards, I could nail a two in spinning target with iron sights. An issue that may or may not be serious to you is the safety switch does not stay engaged. You can push it and hold it in position, but it does not stay. This can be fixed with two small parts, a small bearing and spring, that you can order right off the Numrich gun parts website for a total price of $5.10. The gun comes with a sling, gun sock, 15 round magazine with steel lips, and one of two scopes depending on the price/trade. I have an older Bushnell 4x Sportview, or a much newer Bushnell 3-9x Variable Power scope. The deal also includes a full brick of 550 round .22LR and original parts ordering pamplet when the rifle was bought new.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... 

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Today (8/5/13) I sold my FN Five-seveN to a very lucky father and son, through an online listing. Unfortunately they were not able to also purchase the ammunition. I am returning to school to finish my engineering degree and could use the money for tuition and books.


The Federal American Eagle AE5728A Total Metal Jacket (TMJ) 5.7x28mm round is a Full Metal Jacketed (FMJ) 40 grain projectile that completely encases the lead core of the bullet with a very thick full copper jacket.  AE5728A rounds have muzzle velocity of 1,900 ft/s and muzzle energy of 324 ft-lb out of a FN P90.


These TMJ rounds will penetrate low level body armor even with the FN Five-seveN pistol, unlike the FNH 5.7mm SS197SR Blue Polymer Tip rounds which do not penetrate as well and are designed to fragment upon impact. There are other more penetrating rounds in the market but they are either very expensive, very rare, and/or illegal to own without being Law Enforcement or a government agency. American Eagle's 5.7mm TMJ rounds are currently LEGAL to purchase in the State of Florida and are the most cost effective 5.7mm round if you are looking for that type of performance or for high volume training.


These rounds are compatible with the FN Five-seveN, P90, PS90, the AR-57, and any other 5.7x28mm chambered firearms.

this gun is arguably better than the ak-47 for the civilian non-battle shooting market, look at any comparison between the two. longer barrel, better gas system, bolt hold open on last shot, longer sight radius, etc.

also with it come two tapco 20 round magazines. the stock has been gently sanded to allow them to fit. i still have the original 10 rounder if you want it. 

another upgrade i've done is add tech-sights. google them, they make the sks (and other guns) so much better to shoot iron sighted. also, the front sight is a tapco hi-visibility sight. 

asking 450 obo, keeping in mind that the stock eventually needs replaced. (most people who shoot these and put them in ""tacticool"" stocks replace them anyway). i've shot it how it is for 6 months, and it's never broken further or affected accuracy."

http://www.brownells.com/optics-mounting/electronic-sights/magnifiers/g33-3x-magnifier-w-sts-side-mount-black-sku100REDACTED4-111118.aspx

The G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights. G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing.

SPECS: Magnifcation - Fixed: 3.25X. Eye Relief: 2.2 in. Field of View: 7.3 degrees. Length: 3.9 in. Temperature: -40 degrees to 160 degrees F. Waterproof: 33ft. Sealing: Fogproof Internal Optics. Mount: 34mm ring with integrated dovetail adapter for use with quick release mount"
