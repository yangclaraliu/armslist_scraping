Selling a Beretta 686 Silver Pigeon I O/U shotgun in 20 gauge. This gun is as-new. Only a few hundred shells fired. Comes with the hard case, all original chokes, two Briley extended black skeet chokes, and the original warranty info. Also has a Beretta gel pad to raise the comb up about a quarter inch and is removable.

Selling because I got a full tube set for my Krieghoff and just haven't shot this since.

These are $1900 new from online dealers so I'm pricing it very well. Need a bill of sale. I don't think you'll do anything crazy with an O/U 20 gauge but you never know... 

No trades. Selling to fund another project...well...maybe a Beretta 391 in 20 gauge since I like my 12 gauge 391 so much but that's it. I'm in Charlotte but get all over for work."

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

The Remington 870 Wingmaster Classic Trap shotgun was released in the year 2000 as a special limited anniversary. This is another one of those target guns like the Remington 1100 Classic Trap that is a mantle piece gun in my opinion. While you may take it out and shoot it every once in awhile its too nice to be an every day gun. Why? Well for starts is has fine gold engraving and a gold plated trigger....yep a gold plated trigger.
This is a Like new Shotgun, was told it was never fired... just beautiful...
I just cant sell it for new due to being a FFL

With an MSRP of around $1400; This gun could definitely be a piece that is handed down over generations if properly taken care of.

In addition to the gold inlay it also has a very nice high-gloss coat, and a polished blue receiver.

From the website:
The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.
Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.
Key Features:
Newly designed SPS Varmint stock with vented beavertail fore-end
Sling swivel studs included
26"" heavy-contour barrel (0.820"" muzzle O.D.)
Legendary Model 700™ action

This rifle is based off of the AR-15 platform and has a lot of interchangable parts!

The magazines for this rifle are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient.

This amazing arsinal operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

Ok, I am only adding this because of a silly email I received.  I will give you $300 and you can go buy a ""luger transfer"" one at a pawn shop.  Yes I understand that new model Rugers and Colts are not worth as much as my gun.  Does that mean that I want to trade you straight across for one?  If it does I will trade you my taurus tcp (that I know you want) for your springfield socom rifle.  It will totally save you from ...  extra money!

Please, I am reasonable and open to offers.  I am not open to silliness.  

Enough of that.  It is in great shape and I believe is fully functional (I never ended up shooting it).  The blue'ing is in great shape.  There is some very light holster ware.  There are a few minor spots where it looked like it rattled around in a glove box.  You only see them on close inspection.  Barrel is clean and bright."

Basically they order a gun, do the ATF form and sign it out to themselves, then sell it for VERY inflated prices.  Or if they do a bill of sale they take your info home and do a form 5 without your knowledge.

A home based FFL is easy to do, the biggest thing that keeps people from being able to do it is neighborhood restrictions that don't allow businesses."

This is a cartridge that contains no gunpowder. The little 20g. bullet is solely propelled by the powerful Eley priming mix. For this reason, it does not generate any significant pressure.

The .22 Colibri may be used to eliminate pests such as rats. It may be fired in any .22 LR rifle or pistol, however, it will not cycle the slide or bolt of semi-automatic guns. Has a Solid Point Made of Lead.

It comes in a cardboard box, has cleaning brush, two 9 round mags (9+1 capacity), paperwork and warranty info. It will still be greasy. I've too many guns, so last hired is first fired. These are not surplus pistols, they're new manufactured and the upper echelon of the Tokarev variants. Has a slide mounted safety; not a bad trigger pull, clean break, and a very thin profile.

I've got ammo to spare, so I've compiled 158 rounds of Bulgarian and Russian surplus ammo in good condition. No 1952 stamped cartridges, so all very safe and accurate. This cartridge is getting increasingly more costly, and rightly so; it hits faster and harder than 9, 40, 357 sig, or 45. It gets imported in bulk, and several reputable manufacturers load it as well. If you load 32 ACP, you can reload Tokarev. It is sadly too fast and penetrates too deeply for CCW. Keep this in mind; it will go through walls, car doors, people. Be warned, its a hot round.

Make an honest offer. THIS IS NOT A USED GUN. I'm aware of what they cost, what I've paid, and value of ammo/gun. It's not up for trade, and offers for trade will be politely rejected. Local pickup publicly. Text REDACTED for pictures or questions."

3X Magnifier Description(not eotech)(actual magnifier is more round than one in the picture): The 3X magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with holographic sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. This magnifier is a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with the included twist to side mount, the magnifier gives the user something never before possible – the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice-versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their sight on their platform. This versatile magnifier also can be used as a handheld magnifying monocular for discrete observation and identification. The included mount for the magnifier is the twist to side mount, which allows for quick attachment and detachment. The mount fits any MIL-Std Picatinny Rail.

I purchased it brand new a few months ago and used it minimally.  It's still in excellent condition and comes with the original box and paperwork.  This model has the walnut stocks (hard to find) and has a 4+1 capacity.  It can easily accept a magazine extension if you wanted to install one.  The finish is a very durable factory black Parkerizing.  The Police model is more refined and uses better components as compared to the Express model that you commonly see at the local stores.

My price is $500, only a little more than a new Express model, but you would be getting a much higher quality shotgun in this Police model.  I also have a large amount of quality buckshot and slugs that I'll sell once I have a sale for my shotgun.  First choice goes to the purchaser of my shotgun.

You can either respond to this ad, or you can text me at REDACTED.  I prefer texting because it's quicker, and this deal is first come, first serve.  I prefer to sell, but I might be open to trading for semi-auto pistols in either 9mm or .45ACP. 

**This is for a face-to-face transaction in the north Dallas area.  I will need to check your Texas DL or CHL to verify your eligibility to purchase.  By purchasing my shotgun, you are confirming that you are not prohibited in any way from possessing a firearm.**"

The barrel is 11.5"" with the 5"" flash hider and a 1-9 twist. I have owned this rifle for over 10yrs and have put around 2-3 hundred rounds through it. I don't rapid fire my guns so the barrel is in great condition. This has been a great little rifle and I like it quite a bit but I don't need it at this time. The rifle sold new in 03 for 699.00, the trigger job cost 250 and the additional parts ran nearly 150. The ammo is selling on here for more than 150 right now. The scopes value is unknown but I did check it out at the range years ago. With the scope on the rifle it held sub minute of angle groups. The action has been smoothed  with copper impregnated grease and cleaned repeatedly to take out that rough feel. It is smooth. It rode around with me a great deal of the time but I just don't use it enough now that I have a carbine light flat top.  This is a good deal. You can find AR-15's easy enough now but what you will pay to dress one out and get a decent trigger will hurt alot more than a grand."

I bought these online 6 months ago for $18 each and they were advertised as new. I don't think they are brand new but are close to it and I have never used them. You can read about Master Molder mags online, there are a few Youtube video reviews where they performed well and got good reviews, and they are Made in the USA. These are legal to purchase and own in Maryland now but come 1 Oct 2013, you will not be able to buy any magazine in MD greater than 10 rd capacity but already owned 20 rd mags will be grandfathered in and legal to own, so if you are thinking about buying some hi cap mags, don't wait too long as they will go up in price and they are already hard to find here in Maryland. I will mail these to you for only $9, or will meet FTF for a cash and carry deal in Southern Maryland or as far north as Bowie. I am not interested in counter offers or trades.
