59,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1592059,For Sale:  Henry AR-7 .22 Long Range Survival Rifle With Ammo,"Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 350,"Listed On: Thursday, May 9, 2013",Rifles,Henry Repeating Arms                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have for sale a Henry Repeating Arms AR-7 Survival Rifle. It is chambered in .22lr. All of the components are stored in the water tight stock. It is only 16"" long before assembled. It comes with two magazines, original box and paperwork as well as 500 rounds of .22lr. 

Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well. Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game. Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear. When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds. Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in Black and Camo finishs. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.

I am asking $350 firm with all of the ammo. FTF only, must have valid AL drivers license and be 21 years of age. A bill of sale and ID verification will be required.

155,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1592155,"For Sale:  Lets say ""Thank You! Fox31!"" by conducting legal transfers in front of their building","Downtown Denver, Denver, Colorado",$ 100,"Listed On: Friday, June 7, 2013",Handguns,Armalite                                                                                ,no type,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"It occurred to me the other day when the sensationalist quisling's at Fox31 attempted to instill alarm and horror in our fellow citizens over the legal and constitutional practice of transferring firearms from one private citizen of Colorado to another.   They even chose to pick ONE business amond many at a mall to seize upon the notion that somehow babies and guns are anathema.  So, over the next few weeks I'll be selling off some items from my collection - I will, however, require that all transactions be completed on public property directly outside the Fox21 studios at:

100 East Speer Blvd.
Denver, Colorado 80203

It shouldn't alarm then ONE BIT, since they are a ""gun free"" zone upon their property.  Imagine how safe we'll all be by transacting there - entirely free from fear!   I encourage all of you to do the same.  Let's remember that there are a few infringements on our rights that are promulgated in Denver, specifically, the ban on ""high capacity"" magazines exceeding 20 rounds and all weapons designed to use a magazine of 21 or more rounds capacity.  22lr weapons are excluded, for instance, your Ruger 10/22.   Shotguns of more than six rounds capacity OR a folding stock (or both) are also prohibited.  so let's make sure your shotguns DONT have a folding stock and cannot hold MORE than six rounds in the magazine.  

Let's also remember that their municipal code REQUIRES ""safe storage"" which would seem to also apply to all weapons.  So if minors are present, a lock on the action would seem prudent.   

And DONT FORGET ""aggressive panhandling"" is also against their municipal code. so keep that activity out of your transaction.


if in doubt check section 38-130 of Denver Municipal code at www.municode.com for definitions.  

You can sell ammo, revolvers, any lever action or slide action any semiauto pistol for which no magazine exceeding 20 rounds is made (so pretty much all glocks are out) or, curiously ""any firearm in production prior to 1954"" which should include the M1A, FAL, HK91, etc...  But hey, we'd be pushing it - right?   let's make sure when the quislings squeal and cry to the local police that the officers who respond have ZERO reason to enforce any ordnance.  So keep those folding knives at home if they are fit denver's code, ANY type of mechanical assistance in opening the blade (which should be less than 3.5 inches) - just leave then at home.  

""It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, display, use, possess, carry or transport any knife or instrument having the appearance of a pocket knife, the blade of which can be opened by a flick of a button, pressure on the handle, or other mechanical contrivance.""

It just occurred to me that this might be the safest way to conduct our lawful transactions - under the caring and watchful eye of the folks at Fox31.   If I didn't think they'd wet their pants and cry like babies, I'd conduct my transactions outside the personal address of the Fox reporter who conducted this ""investigation"" - but I'd have to catch him at a time when he wasn't cruising Colfax doing ""research"" for his prostitution ""investigation""."

If you don't want to read it then that's fine, but please at least read the last paragraph before contacting me. Thanks!

For sale is a barely used Savage Model 10 FCP-SR bolt action rifle with many extras! This precision rifle was bought on January 24, 2013 from Bill's Outpost in Maryville,TN and has been taken very well care of; it has only seen a total of 110 rounds of match grade factory ammo down the barrel. It has an SWFA SS 10x42 scope on a Nightforce base with steel Leupold rings, a Harris bipod, a Surefire muzzle brake, and a Pelican case cut to fit the rifle and its accessories. I will also include all paperwork to the rifle and all accessories, the original box, a box of Remington Premier Match 168gr Sierra Matchking HPBT cartridges to get you started, and any accessories that came with the rifle or its parts. Here is a detailed breakdown of everything that comes with this incredible package: 

The rifle: The gun itself is a Savage Model 10 FCP-SR. This uncommon and highly sought-after rifle has a threaded, fluted, and free-floating 24"" bull barrel with a 5/8x24 thread pitch and a 1:10 right hand twist rate. There currently are NONE of these for sale on Gunbroker and only 2 of them for sale on Armslist (counting this one). It has Savage's AccuTrigger that is user-adjustable and has been set to about 1.5 lbs, and it also has the AccuStock that is a factory digital tan camo and can accept a detachable magazine. The rifle luckily takes Accuracy International magazines, so there are a number of them out there if you want to buy more. The included magazine has a capacity of 10 rounds. The bolt has an extended-size handle to easily grasp, and there are 3 studs for mounting a bipod or sling. The stock is aluminum bedded for maximum accuracy. The receiver, barrel, magazine, scope, and bolt all have a light 3-color Krylon ""rattlecan"" camo on them to break up the black outline of the rifle and blend in better with its outdoor surroundings. This rifle easily will shoot sub-MOA with factory ammunition and even less with handloads! The original box, paperwork, trigger adjustment key, cable lock, and thread protector are all included.

The scope, rings, and base- The scope included is an SWFA SS 10x42 scope with a mil-dot reticle and 0.10 MRAD clicks. SWFA had at one point (they may still do) a Navy SEAL contract for their optics, so you can rest assured that the durability and tracking will be 100% reliable. This scope is only available from one source, and they are regularly on backorder for 6-8 months, unless you get lucky like I did. It has a side parallax adjustment and enough elevation to take you past 1000 meters. The scope is mounted with Leupold steel QRW quick detach rings, and they are mounted on a Nightforce 20 MOA base. Both the rings and base are top-notch quality from very high quality, precision companies. I have already mounted everything properly, and they will not be coming loose any time soon. It is already zeroed at 100m. All paperwork and packaging for the scope, rings, and base are included.

The muzzle brake- The Surefire MB762-211C muzzle brake is yet another product that is almost always on backorder due to being highly-desirable. The brake was properly timed to the threading and attached to the end of the barrel. It serves as a suppressor adapter for Surefire suppressors, and it effectively reduces the recoil down to about the level of a semi-auto 20 ga shotgun. It is not permanently attached, so you can remove it if you want to attach another brand of suppressor. The original packaging and extra timing washers are included.

The bipod- The bipod included is a Harris BRM with spring loaded, adjustable legs. This is a very sturdy and ultralight bipod that serves its role very well on the rifle. A solid bipod is invaluable! The original packaging and paperwork are included. 

The case- The Pelican 1750 case that is included is an OD color and has been cut to fit the rifle and its accessories. This thing is a tank--it is rock solid and will protect the rifle from anything short of a nuclear explosion. The case is air and water tight, and it floats when put into water. There are 3 pieces if foam to protect both the top and bottom of everything inside. It has wheels to roll on the ground to save your back from carrying it for extended distances! Of course, all original paperwork is included. 

The ammo- I will include a box of Remington Premier Match to get you started. This ammo is match grade ammo that is loaded with a 168gr Sierra Matchking bullet. This is the only ammo that I have shot through the rifle--it easily holds a 1/2"" group at 100 yards! The 168gr bullets are optimized for the 1:10 twist of the barrel.

***I also have a very nice, LNIB Leupold RX-600i range finder that I MIGHT include for the right deal. Just ask me.***

The only reason I am selling is because I just don't have the time or resources to shoot it as much as I would like to or push it out to the distances that it is capable of hitting. I will sell the rifle without the scope for $1800. I would love a partial or maybe a full trade on a Springfield M1A, but I might consider a Romanian PSL. If you want to test the rifle before buying, you are more than welcome to do so. NO bill of sale is required. I am certainly willing to ship anywhere in the US to the FFL of your choice! If interested, you can call or text me at 865-7six6-7555. Please NO EMAILS! Armslist emails tend to get lost in the void of cyberspace, people never reply to them, and I rarely check it anyways. Feel free to text me for more pictures or answers to any questions that you may have. Thanks for looking and God bless!"

The thread on the adjustable rear sight for the adjustment screw is damage so if you did want to install an adjustable sight, you may need to order a new rear sight, but you will already have the other necessary components to do so.  I am asking 1,700.00 for everything considering the gun sells new right now for over $2,000.00.  I also have some ammo that I can sell with the gun."

Greetings neighbors,

I have inherited an estate and among the items to be found a new home I have a 12 gun pine display cabinet with locks and under storage for ammo (also locks with same keys) -- Factory unfinished, like new (been in storage from previous owner) -- I've looked it up online and it's a Woodcraft Industries model WCP2A2205, which can be had new for about $800-900... Looking to get what's fair for it or guns of similar value. Maybe around $600 cash or some combination of stuff off my list below.

If interested I have a second cabinet in similar condition that may have been modified by the previous owner but still pretty much factory condition.

Pickup or delivery arrangements possible, talk to me, where there's a will there's a way.

The cabinets are still in storage an hour upstate so no tire kickers, if you're interested contact me and go from there.

- Wooden stock, not synthetic. If it comes with both, that's great, but it must have a wooden stock. If you want to sell me one with a synthetic stock at a low enough price that I can buy a wooden stock with the savings, that's ok, but I doubt it would be worth it to you.
- Serial number should start with 581 or 582 - newest version with thicker barrel and other recent upgrades. I'm not really interested in older models unless the price is MUCH lower, probably too low to be worth it to you.
- Condition should be NIB, LNIB or else we can discuss condition and price (it would probably be lower than $850 if it's not at least LNIB).

I am ok with either blue or stainless finish.

I would also be open to a Mini 30. In that case, I'd still want a wooden stock, but the serial number range is less important."

This came out of an estate, so the stock and finish on it were terrible.  I cut the stock up for  firewood, and refinished the rifle in Grey Dura Coat.  Turned out nice, and I finished it last week.  While I had the rifle apart, I added a tactical bolt knob and threaded the barrel 1/2 x 24, and put a good stainless steel brake on it.  The barrel is in great shape, with strong rifling, and about 23” long with the brake.  I left the iron sights on the barrel, so the scope can be removed and fired with the rail still on the rifle.

The stock is a new Hogue over-molded pillar bedded stock with the barrel channel that fits the factory taper barrel.  There is a Tactical Component Mag Xtender that extends standard 4 round capacity to 7 rounds, while still using the stock spring and follower.  I have the standard floor plate if you want to switch back to the old style.  Aluminum EGW picatinny rail with a 10MOA cant.  The scope is a NOS – box, but no paperwork – Burris Fullfield II with variable 1.75x5 power, sitting in Burris Xtreme Tactical rings.  Nice thing about Burris scopes, they’re guaranteed for life.  If there’s ever a problem, send it back.  This one is clean, with just a couple of handling marks on the turret caps.  

This rifle is unfired since I just put it back together today.  I’ll throw in a 20 round box of good PMC ammo to get you sighted in and in the field.  This should be a nice shooter, especially with the brake.  FTF in the Colorado Springs area only, with cash.  Please, no counterfeit bills.  You’ll need to be legal to own this, and I’ll ask for I.D. and a Bill of Sale.  Not interested in trades, or talking to idiots from any Denver TV stations."

You're buying the package, not just the gun. Don't tell me you found one on gunbroker for $899. After taxes, shipping, transfer, and credit card fees, you're still paying $1000.
