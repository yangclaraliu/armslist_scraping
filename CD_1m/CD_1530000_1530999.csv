A like new, in box, manual included, a new version of the Tippman A5 Hall Effect magnetic trigger electronic grip (aka HE-Grip) with an external selector switch upgrade kit for your paintbal marker.
A little upgrade to the tipmann e-grip was done: people on forums were sharing that the battery door can open during a play - a simple permanent solution is to add a little bit of padding to the inside of the battery door to have it shut snug - which is what I have done as soon as I got it new.
I believe, I have set it to 23 bps (balls per second) firing rate in full auto.

A 9mm C-9 Hi-Point semi auto pistol w/8 rd mag (model 916).  And to wrap it all up, 500 rds of 124 gr FMJ 9mm ammo.  Both the carbine and the Pistol are rated for +P ammo.   Have a carbine, pistol in the same caliber, with plenty of ammo to use.  Makes a perfect home defense setup and only 1 caliber to try to find.  Before I get the hater mail for them being Hi-Points, I'll break down the prices.  $550 for the Carbine, $300 for the pistol, and $350 for the ammo.  I know I didn't pay that much for them and inflation sucks, but SKS's used to go for $89 each and AK's went for $300 tops, and 5.56/.223 used to be under .25 cents per rd.  So by those prices, the inflation on Hi-Points are well below the average of the other over priced guns and ammo.  The reason for this rant is to curb the socialist freaks out there that just because the prices are not where they think they should be, then I am a horrible person. Sorry I don't fit your socialist model, everything is not about you...  I have not had any of the problems that Hi-Points are always rumored to have.  These go bang when you pull the trigger.   I would like to sell them together, but will sell the Carbine for $550 and the Pistol for $250. Will not sell the ammo separate. Not really interested in trades at the moment, need the cash. I can take additional pics if requested. Thanks for looking."

""Paintball RADARchron (tm)"" paintball / archery chronograph. This is a must-have, if you own a paintball marker or shoot a bow and arrow!
People call these things a chronograph , a chrony , a radar , a velocity or speed tester . It's all the same thing. :)
Better, zoomable pictures in my picasa web photo album here: https://picasaweb.google.com/REDACTEDREDACTED7/RadarChronPaintballArcheryChronograph
It is in like new condition, having been used for one day for about 12 measurements only.
This one measures projectile's velocity using microwaves and has a speed range of 150 to 450 feet per second ( fps ) with plus/minus 2% accuracy. Weighs only 3 oz. Operates using a 3v, tablet-type Lithium battery (the kind that a car remotes use), which should lat you over 3600 measurements! It is very compact and fits easily into your pocket, measuring 2.5x3.5x1.2 inches. Also you can use a string or a velcro strap to hang the chronograph off your marker's barrel should you feel lazy enough to hold the chronograph in your hand. :)
Comes in a hard plastic padded box with the battery, and the one-page manual.
Can be used for paintball as well as archery (or other sport that has stuff flying between 150 and 450 feet per second :)"

Can be used for paintball, airsoft, SCUBA diving equipment, or pneumatic power tool works - anywhere high pressure air / CO2 / N2 gas is used Better, zoomable pictures in my picasa web photo album here: https://picasaweb.google.com/REDACTEDREDACTED7/4500psiRemoteCompressedAirGasNitroNitrogenN2Co2LinePaintballAirsoftNicoPneumaticsNinja#
-Rated 4500 psi - that is a really high end stuff - 99% of remote lines out there are only rated to 3000psi (carbon fiber tanks are 4500psi).
-Nico Pneumatics brand gas line hose.
-cool Yellow-Black color (the color can always be changed by simply getting a Remote Line Cover that are sold in many places online in any color or pattern imaginable - the cover will serve more than just the looks purpose - it will also prevent the line to be caught onto branches and stuff)
-Ninja brand ASA, on/off slide check, and the quick release disconnect.
-Measures 45 inches (unstretched) to approximately 64 inches (stretched)
-The on/off slide check allows you to release the pressure out of the remote line, after you turned off the gas from the tank, so you could disconnect the remote line without having to fire your marker - a really convenient feature.
-excellent for MilSim Woodsball Speedball Competition or Renegade style paintball of airsoft play!

If you just want to buy 100 rounds to check it out, we can do that for $50.  I don't have any experience with this ammo, but Cabelas says:
""By replacing costly brass cases and copper jackets with aluminum and nylon, USA-made Herter’s aluminum-case handgun ammunition keeps cost down while preserving clean-shooting reliability and accuracy. Sized to incredibly precise tolerances, the nonreloadable, aircraft-grade aluminum cases cycle smoothly. Premium-quality, round-nose lead bullets are coated with a Total Nylon Jacket (TNJ) to replace expensive copper jackets. TNJ bullets are inherently accurate, and cycle fluidly through semiautomatics. As an added benefit, TNJ bullets eliminate hard-to-remove copper and lead fouling. Made in USA. Per 50.""  To be honest, I didn't know what I was buying when I got it, and then I sold my 40 so now I can't even shoot it to check it out.

As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. We have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead.

The .50 Beowulf was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results.

Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry.

The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal.

I’ve Shot 200 rounds through this rifle with never any problems at all I’ve got it tuned so the recoil is modest (about that of a heavy 20ga) and is a pleasure to shoot. Out to 200 yards the sighting is right on and I’ve been quite surprised at just how accurate this rifle actually is. (1in ragged hole at 100yrds with 5 rounds 2-2.5in at 200 yards)
The Package for everything is $4000.00 this Rifle is hard to acquire at this time as is the ammo this is my price and it is firm.
I will NOT sell the Ammo or the magazines separately.
If shipped out of state all shipping charges are extra.

Please reply with phone number as I will not respond to ""Is this weapon still available?"" anymore. If the add is up its still available."

""By replacing costly brass cases and copper jackets with aluminum and nylon, USA-made Herter’s aluminum-case handgun ammunition keeps cost down while preserving clean-shooting reliability and accuracy. Sized to incredibly precise tolerances, the nonreloadable, aircraft-grade aluminum cases cycle smoothly. Premium-quality, round-nose lead bullets are coated with a Total Nylon Jacket (TNJ) to replace expensive copper jackets. TNJ bullets are inherently accurate, and cycle fluidly through semiautomatics. As an added benefit, TNJ bullets eliminate hard-to-remove copper and lead fouling. Made in USA. Per 50.""

Michael Sieve, a Minnesota wildlife artist specializing in painting deer, is known as the mammal artist. Much of his artwork is wildlife in nature. He gained his knowledge about the wildlife he paints from hunting on the family farm as he was growing up.

""Seeing a trophy buck is the ultimate thrill for any whitetail fanatic. The handsome, curving antlers of a mature buck make him one of Nature's most striking creatures, and among the sportsman's most revered trophies. But mature bucks are exceedingly rare. The odds against a whitetail surviving the three years it takes to grow large antlers are staggering. In many hunting areas, 80% of bucks live to grow only one set of antlers. The remaining bucks, those that escape hunters, predators, automobiles and accidents, are true survivors. Armed with instinct and experience, these trophy bucks survive by following a strict set of rules. Some deer observe those rules so well they die of old age. But every autumn an handful will make only one mistake - and become a lucky hunter's deer of a lifetime."" ~ Michael Sieve"

The .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps) a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail better ergonomics and more ambidextrous controls.

Along with the HK45 Compact the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30% improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition the HK45 combines the accuracy modularity reliability and minimum 20000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

An improved USP-style control lever a combination safety and decocking lever is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the ‘fire’ position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use the HK45 is available in or can be converted to a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington New Hampshire."

Note: This is my LAST ONE!

This listing is for a new SUB-2000 9mm self-loading carbine.  It comes NEW in Box with one Glock 10-round magazine and the owner’s manual.  One of the best features of this carbine is that it uses standard Glock (model 17) magazines, which are readily available including the 33-round magazines, making this a perfect gun for Glock handgun owners.  

The SUB-2000 has a greatly extended range compared to a handgun.  The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range.  The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun.  This is an excellent choice for a vehicle gun, backpack gun, or anytime you might need something more than a handgun but do not have a lot of room and need something light and compact.  The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from the SUB 9 rifle.  

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle.  The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear.  By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB 2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key.  The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.  The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled without tools for cleaning or inspection. 

Specifications:

Caliber:  9mm Luger  
Weight unloaded lbs.: 4.0 lbs. 1.8kg 
Length Open:  29.5""  749mm 
Length Closed:  16"" 406mm 
Barrel Length:  16.1"" 408mm 
Aperture rear, Circular hood, Adjustable front Practical range/ over: 150yds 150m 
Rifle features an internal keyed deployment lock.
