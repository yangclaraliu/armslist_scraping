Item Description
The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine.  It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine.  First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel.  Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds.  Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine.  Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

It seems (acording to Dieter Marschall in ""Handguns of the Armed Organizations of the Soviet Occupation Zone and German Democratic Republic"") that these little .25 ACP pistols were status symbols in East Germany. Marshall states that the Tezet was not supposed to be worn in an outside belt holster by regulations but this was widely ignored by high party officials, staff officers, and Stasi. I have also read where female police officers prefered this pistol. I know that the belt holsters are few and far between. However I do know where to obtain/aquire a brand new shoulder rig for an additional $50 .. Let me know if interested.

The Vzor 45, commonly known as CZ 45 is a compact blowback operated semi-automatic pistol chambered in .25 ACP . It was made in Czechoslovakia and later in the Czech Republic . Derived from the CZ-36 following World War II, the CZ-45 is currently manufactured by Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod as theCZ-92.
In 1945 the CZ-36 was redesigned by Jan Kratochvil to make it easier (hence cheaper) to manufacture and became the Vzor 45 (model 1945) but is generally known as CZ-45. The safety lever which had sometimes appeared on the CZ-36 was eliminated (though a few early model 45s were manufactured with a safety lever). The changes included the addition of a side plate to simplify assembly and a magazine safety. The CZ-36 had a connector from the trigger to the hammer that ran on the left side of the magazine, whereas the CZ-45 has a Browning style stirrup-shaped connector that runs on both sides of the magazine.
The overall design of the receiver, slide, guide rod, and recoil spring are very similar to the earlier Browning .25 design. The barrel mount is also like the Browning, with a single lug that rotates into a slot in the frame. The trigger pivots on a pin.
When the trigger is activated and the hammer is down, the connector is pulled forward, rotating the hammer backward into cocked position. When the hammer reaches full cock, it is freed to fall and strike the firing pin , which ignites the cartridge. The hammer is not cocked by the slide--technically speaking, this is a self-loading repeating pistol, not an automatic or semi-automatic. Other than the heavy double-action trigger pull, the only safety mechanism is the magazine safety. When the magazine is inserted, it moves a bar which allows the connector to engage the sear. When the magazine is removed from the gun, the bar disconnects the trigger from the sear.
Disassembly is similar to the Browning. Remove the magazine and make sure the chamber is empty. Draw the slide back about 1 centimeter and rotate the barrel clockwise a quarter-turn. Remove the barrel and slide forward off the receiver. Other than the guide rod and recoil spring, there are no small parts that come loose.
The CZ-45 holds 8 rounds in the magazine and has a simple groove down the top of the slide for sighting. Its great merits are its simplicity and reliability, ease of field-stripping, and accuracy--despite its primitive sighting groove and double action only trigger.
The only design weakness in the CZ-45 is a brittle firing pin (like the CZ 52 ). This gun should never be dry fired.
In 1992 the gun was slightly redesigned, given a magazine release behind the trigger and a futuristic grip, and is now sold as the CZ-92. Unfortunately, due to the Gun Control Act of 1968, the gun can no longer be imported into the U.S., as it is too small. After the GCA blocked further importation, US Manufacturer Intratec started producing a near-exact clone called the Protec, though the build quality is somewhat lower.
CZ-45's are somewhat rare in the US resale market and go for about $250 in good condition and up to $500 in mint condition. CZ-92's are virtually non-existing in the US and go for higher prices, despite the limited applications of the .25 ACP as a self-defense round.
The CZ Custom Shop in the United States is planning to produce a limited run of US-made CZ 92's. A prototype was shown at the 2011 SHOT Show. CZ Custom aims to have the US-made CZ-92 included in the CZ Catalog at the 2012 SHOT Show. It is not confirmed if the chambering will remain .25ACP or possibly switch to .32 or .380.
The modern successors to the Model CZ-45 are the Seecamp .25 and .32, the North American Arms .32 and .380, and the Kel-Tec P-32 and P-3AT.

The RFI Enfield's were made with high strength chrome vanadium steel in order to safely handle the higher pressures generated by the 7.62 NATO round.

I purchased this rifle 15+ years ago because it was so interesting, however I put it away, forgot it, and never ended up firing it. I bought it from a dealer who had just received 5 of them and I picked the best of the litter. So the rifle is in excellent condition, and the bore is pristine. Gibbs stopped making these about 10 years ago so you don't see them very often anymore. You can still see the story on these rifles on Gibb's website under the history tab.

A good friend recently purchased one of the new Ruger Scout Rifles in .308, and it reminded 
very much of this #7 Carbine with regard to size, heft & balance. The #7 feeds from a detachable 12 round magazine so it offers a considerable amount of firepower with a heavy hitting cartridge.

Included with the rifle is a high quality reproduction of the original Jungle Carbine bayonet & scabbard, a reproduction heavy canvas case that is an exact copy of the original WWII model, an Enfield style canvas sling for the rifle and an additional sling that attaches to the canvas case for shoulder carry. Also an original canvas action cover (khaki green). Plus an original Enfield cleaning kit (rope/brass pull-through & oiler) that stows away in the rifle's butt-stock. Finally there are three boxes of ammo (1 box of Herter's 150 grain FMJ & 2 boxes of Wolf Military Classic brand 145 grain FMJ).

Asking price for everything is $675 with pickup in the Brandon area. Must be at least 21 and a Florida resident to purchase."

carbine features a 16' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with
Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible,

on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of
velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock
makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

As you would expect from the E2 model, ergo grip, short reach trigger, short reset trigger from the factory. I've only put around 200 rounds through the gun. As far as I know I am the third owner of the firearm--I do not know exactly how many rounds has been through the gun, but I have never had any malfunctions nor would expect any. Some blueing has rubbed off of the front of the barrel (smiley, common and inevitable due to tight fitment), and 2-3 minor scratches on the gun--otherwise the gun is in superb condition. (Follow links at bottom of ad for pics).

I've only owned the gun for a month and a half. I am selling it for something smaller to use as my edc ccw. This gun is truly built like a tank. Wish I didn't have to sell it.

Included is the hard case, along with 6 magazines 2x 15rds, 2x 18rds, 2x 20rds. One of the 15rd is an original sig magazine, the other 5 are mecgar. The 2x 18 rounders have only been to the range once. People claim the mecgars to be of better quality, but I haven't had a problem with the original. The gun has had work done to it by previous owner, polished feed ramp/trigger bar, hammer + sear contact. Very smooth DA pull. The SA breakpoint is very satisfying and predictable. Combine this with the short reset and steel frame and you got yourself a tack driver at the range. Double tapping is effortless with this gun. 

I am selling everything at cost.
------ P226 + mags : 925$. 

Also have 750 Rounds of 9mm, Herter's 115gr fmj  for sale. If you purchase the gun, I can toss in the ammo at $16 a box/50rds. Or 750 Rds for $240. I am not willing to sell the ammo until the gun is sold or traded.

Fits all Glock models except the Glock 36. Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of manufacture."

11 - .32 Rimfire, 9 marked Peters, 1 marked UMC, 1 Diamond marked
1 - .36 metal ""chamber"" - this is the really oddball one of the bunch.  What I was told by a collector friend of mine is that this was the prototype to the Colt 1851 Richards or Richards / Mason cartridge conversion.  Prior to the more common conversion they made this ""chamber"" that you loaded with black powder and the ball, and put a cap on it so that it was ready to drop into the modified 1851 Navy black powder cylinder.  From what I was told this design failed.  I could find no documented information and after a pretty extensive search using Google I couldn't even come up with a picture of another one of these.

1 - .41 Long Colt
1 - .44 Webley marked UMC

I bought it new for $1299 Feb 2012. I have only fired 200 rounds total through it. It comes with 2 factory stainless steel mags with plastic floor plates, Springfield polymer concealable half holster, Springfield polymer duel mag holder, cleaning brush, manual, Springfield factory hard case (all the factory stuff that came with it new!).
The Pistol is a nail driver at 50 yards yielding 2.5-3.0 inch groups for me on a sandbag rest! It has a factory adjustable rear sight, both the front and rear sight are trigicon night sights, Factory adjustable light weight trigger, factory light weight hammer, factory duel spring guide rod, Match grade barrel, ambidextrous safety levers, two tone finish of black on stainless steel which give the stainless parts a smoked look, factory large mouth mag well (makes for fast mag changes!!) It is not an easy 1911 to come by but is also one of the nicest ones Springfield makes. I carried it as my concealed gun since I bought it (some slight holster wear but nothing noticeable). I'll be sad to see it go but don't need it anymore as I bought a Springfield EMP model to replace it. It is now up for grabs to someone who will appreciate it as much as I have. Price is fairly firm.
FTF sale only, no bad guys, CO I.D. check will be made, prefer CCW holder to buy. No trades at this time please. If you want to make an offer please be realistic if you live in Denver I will be willing to meet only as far as Castle Rock...I won't do all the driving! If you are interested I will e-mail you detailed actual pictures of the gun! Picture listed is an actual factory picture of this gun. Thanks for looking."

Rifle has barrel is 26 inches with a 1 in 9 twist. Trigger pull is 2.5 lbs. It will take up to a 77gr Berger HPBT Match Target but nothing bigger due to the twist. The scope rail is a 20 MOA Badger and has a Swift 8X32X50 Variable Scope with the Sun Shade. I will not post a group size less than 1/2 MOA at 100 yds because it really depends on the individual shooter. It will do better than that but your milage may vary. This rifle has won the 600 egg shoot here in W TN. Round count is a little over 2200 rds. Stock is an HS with full alum bedding. Almost forgot the orange target sticky stuck on the left rear stock has my come ups for ammo/distance. It peels right off. I find it handier than bringing a note book along.

If anyone is interested I prefer FTF. I do hold a TN residency and have a CCP. Thanks for looking.

Did you know it cost approximately half the price to reload a .223 over a .308? .223 powder charges are in the 23 gr range over 43 gr of Varget for a .308. Same target performance out to 600 yds."

It only has about 40 rounds shot through it. Has no safety, with bullet indicator on top. Comes with three interchangeable grips for different hand sizes. Pistol has absolutely zero marks, dings, scratches, blemishes, nothing. Its in matt black. Feels great in hand very well balanced. 3 dot sight system very accurate. Comes with original blue hard cased box with original chambered test shot cartridge along with owners manual. Plus lock and wire for child home protection. I am also throwing in a leather inside the waistband holster made for this pistol plus 50 rounds of Winchester 155 grain HP bullets. I am asking $500 cash on hand and a signature for my records to show I sold the firearm. Sorry but price is non-negotiable. You can reach me at my cell REDACTED.
