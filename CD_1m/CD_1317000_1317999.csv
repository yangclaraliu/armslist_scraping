The 30MI or 30m is a true tried and proven workhorse, one of those ""I will never sell because it has a special place in my collection"". I had it for years and it has never ever jammed/misfired/not gone boom!  Regardless of what ammo you put on it, 100% shot every time. Full metal body (run out of ammo hit them in the head) it has always been cleaned/lubed after use. If you dont know the history of Star, do yourself a favor and Google it ! Very rare to have one of these in the market, specialy in this shape and with 2 (original)  mags and grip. 

Here are some specs and features:
The Mod30-M is a SA/DA pistol. Length of pull in single action is .098 inches; that’s right folks, under one-tenth of an inch. It’s a smooth pull, breaking at 4.41 lbs. Emptying the 15 round magazine is simpler than snapping your fingers. Keep the hammer down, and double acti.  pull length is .472 inches and breaks at 7.94 lbs. Overall length is 8.07 inches, with a 4.33 inch barrel and a sighting line length of 6.3 inches. Using standard 115 grain FMJ loads, and stretching the pistol to it’s “effective rage” of 164 feet (50 meters), penetration depth of 3.94 inches was recorded in pine boards. In the interest of safety, the pistol incorporates an ambidextrous thumb safety which requires the shooter to move their hand from a firing position to physically work the safety. Additionally, the Mod30-M has a magazine safety which prevents the pistol from being fired with the magazine removed.

The sale is for the Firearm, 2 original 15 rds magazines, soft molded grip and carry case.. Buyer must have drivers license and be willing to sign bill of sale. CASH ONLY. Or trade for a CC 9mm. Not in a hurry to sell."

Just got this thing all decked out and had to pay or a truck repair. I digress....Frosty ain't doing so hot

-Strikeforce Desert Tan Folding Stock
-40 round Tapco magazine
-Sun Optics receiver mounted see through SKS scope mount.
-Sightmark Holograph Sight with 4 reticle selection ($160 one, not one of the $40 economy ones)
-100 rounds of ammo
-The piece of mind that you can fight off the ""zombie invasion""when TSHTF
-The piece of mind that all the stores that I know of have plenty of cheap ammo for this IN STOCK
-A few stray ""Dremel"" marks where I modified the stock to accommodate the scope mount.
(not ugly-but then again, no one ever claimed an SKS was pretty to begin with)
-Shoots great! (did I mention Frosty?)
-The nice warm feeling of knowing that this isn't in the hands of a pinko commie anymore and is now owned by a PATRIOT that'll use it for whatever he feels he/she must because the 2nd Amendment says it's your RIGHT!

If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750 (If you want the ""Holo-sight"") If you want to save yourself $100 and have your own sight you can have it for $650. If you don't like it....you're free to write ""hate emails"" from yer mommy's basement because THIS IS AMERICA!!! I can then delete them while I laugh!

Seriously....,if you want this, email me stating your intention to buy, a number that I can call or text, and be prepared to show a valid form of ID and sign a Bill of Sale, because I'm ONLY SELLING to a LEGAL, law-abiding CITIZEN!

Lone Wolf Distributors match grade replacement barrels are manufactured from the highest grade mill select 416 forgings. CNC machined and heat treated, providing a life time of service and unparalleled accuracy at an affordable price. The standard groove and land rifling make this an excellent choice for those who wish to shoot lead, plated or jacketed bullets. Can be used in factory ported or stock pistols. Intended for use in the Glock 26 pistol only. Threaded 1/2 x 28

The Lone Wolf 9mm Major compensator offers a unique advantage to the discriminating competitive shooter. This exceptional performance is accomplished in 2 simultaneous steps. First, the redirection of gas to a 30 degree rearward angle actually pulls the barrel forward, reducing felt recoil. Second, the redirection of gas vertically provides a genuine reduction in muzzle rise. The result allows the shooters sights to remain on target or realigned quickly providing faster accurate follow up shots. 


*Lone Wolf Distributors provides a quality engineered light weight system that delivers maximum performance at 1/2 the cost of similar compensators.

Just thought I'd put it out there and see what would happen.
I have a very nice Sig Stainless Target 1911 that I would possibly like to trade for a 1911 only, that does not have the target style sites. This gun was made in March 2012 and I really like it, but I am not crazy about the big sights on it and ""Target"" engraved on the side. The gun shoots very, very well and is very accurate. I would consider a trade for another 1911 only!!! I would like another Sig, Colt or Kimber (possible Springfield). Must be equal in value. I am not looking for cash or a trade for any other model of gun. No bottom shelf brands!!!! Does not have to be stainless. Can make arrangments for test firing. The closer to Roanoke the better. If you are seriously interested in a straight up trade let me know what make/model you have and if I am interested I will contact you."

The highlight is an M4-style bayonet (if you are aware of Mini 14's at all, you know what a big deal having a bayonet is) mounted on a BRAND NEW M4-style muzzle brake with winged front sight.  Other modifications on the rifle include a rear tech peep sight and a leather/web green sling.  Extras include:  original front blade sight (beat up a fair bit before I got it), Choate birdcage flash hider which slides over original front sight, five magazines (two metal 40 round, one OEM steel Ruger 20 round, one original Ruger 5 round, one BRAND NEW polymer ProMag 20 round), two BRAND NEW magazine couplers to connect magazines together for quicker mag changes, an extra magazine reinforcement bracket (if you want to be able to swap between two different stocks quickly), 100 rounds of loose .223 ammunition, and a soft rifle sleeve to protect the gun.  I have a handful more NIP Promag 20 round magazines I would sell, or throw in for the right trade.

I haven't fired it since installing the new sights/muzzle break so it will need to be sighted in on the range, but I did bore-sight it as well as possible using a laser so it shouldn't need too much adjustment.  This is an older, used rifle so there's some wear to it.  A few dings in the stock and butt, some wear on the bluing, etc.  There's also some deep scratches on the mounting handle on the bayonet where the hole had to be enlarged to fit over the muzzle brake.  But everything is in great working order, and this is a unique Mini-14 for your collection or use.

If you have any questions after reading this ad, feel free to drop me an e-mail.  I can send more pictures on request, or set up a time to meet.  I'm willing to do a little driving if you're coming from far away.  You must have a photo ID, and I prefer to deal with a CCW permit holder.  If you don't have a CCW permit, you must sign a bill of sale that I will provide and I reserve the right to do a background check before signing the bill of sale if I feel it's necessary.  

I would like cash, but am willing to entertain the idea of trades with cash up or down.  I'm open to: 9 mm or .45 (handgun or carbine), silver (coinage or otherwise – if other than readily identifiable coins then we'll need to get an appraisal for fair market value), Ruger Mini-30, a .357 magnum rifle, a .300 win mag semi-auto rifle, possibly an AR or AK.  I might even consider a .50 cal, as long as it's not black powder.  Don't be afraid to make me an offer.  I'm not like some of these jerks that will ream you out if you don't cough up exactly what I want, and now.  I'm willing to make a deal.  However, don't insult me by offering me $200 in silver coins or something equally absurd."

Previous owner bead blasted and re-blued receiver with a matte finish, rest of gun is original, glossy bluing still in good condition.  Wood was re-finished at some point, with what looks to be polyurethane.  The gun has a few cosmetic flaws consisting of small varnish runs and some minor rust speckling on barrel--almost not visible.  Gun looks to have been used little, but not stored so well, so the exterior looks a lot older than the interior.  I hired a smith to smooth out the action last year, and it works perfectly.  Trigger pull is a little heavy--probably about 4lbs.  Very accurate.  19 round (22LR) tube magazine.  Comes with scope mount and a couple spare parts (carrier and carrier lever arm).  Bore is perfect.  I have more 22 rifles than I need, and I'd like to put the sale proceeds towards a shotgun.  I can send more photos upon request.  I'd prefer to conduct the sale at a range, after the buyer has a chance to shoot the rifle. $400 OBO"

Seems it didn't need to much an over-haul because - other than the wood stock and receiver cover - the numbers all match up.  This was built in 1967, in Factory 26, which produced all the earlier SKS's; and thus had the most experience.

Factory 26 had even continued with threaded barrels in 1967, while the other factories had switched to pinned.  I should mention here that this particular threaded-in barrel was the major part that the arsenal had replaced; and it looks VERY fresh, with sharp rifling at the crown.

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® employs a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.
 The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

I am not sure exactly what your referencing to magazines that we are selling and your welcome to call our company and voice your issue to us.  Funny if you would actually do a little more looking like our facebook page you'll see we just did a 19.99 sale on magpul mags, cheaper than anyone online that has them in stock. We shipped to all the customers sale day. Actively work with local law enforcement for custom builds and contribute to the wounded warrior program.  

I don't find your post uncommon, a lot of people complain about pricing and prices going up. But it happens every election and every gun ban. Prices are dictated by supply and demand aka current climate. As a consumer you have the option to wait or just simply not buy. 

FYI midway sells their pmags for 7 dollars cheaper than us. Only difference between us and them is ours ships next day and there is no 6 month back order list. I also think midway is a great company. 

At any rate thank you for your extreme well though out negative comment. Real or Fake job we love what we do everyday. Thanks again!"

I also replaced the cheap scope rings with a set of medium height Millet's. The rifle has 21 rounds of Federal 165 gr. through it. This is a hell of a shooter. The target picture is of the last three shots of the box, I couldn't believe a $600 rifle shot as well or better than my custom. Needless to say, I only needed one round for deer season.

A number in existence to this day is still undetermined. The Rogers & Spencer Black Powder revolver was manufactured in the early 1860's and 5,000 were ordered by the U.S. Military. In 1865 by the time the order could be filled, the Civil War was coming to an end and the contract was canceled. The guns were sold off to an arms dealer by the name of Francis Bannerman as scrap after the government contract was canceled and Bannerman sold the gun to consumers throughout the first quarter of the 20th century. Its still argued that around 800 of the revolvers did see combat in the Civil War. This particular Rogers & Spencer Revolver bares the serial number of 3060 (which appears matching on all parts) and all government inspection stamps (RPB on the grip and the letter ""B"" stamped on metal parts). The Gun also bares the Rogers & spencer name stamped on the frame above the cylinder, along with Utica NY stamped underneath for where the gun was manufactured. The revolver is .44 cal with a 7 1/2"" octagon barrel and is a single action. It has a smooth functioning action and minimal corrosion. The bluing has dissipated a fair amount from what looks to be everyday holster carry, which to a true collector definitely increases the cool factor! There is still some bluing remaining near the grip where the gun did not contact a holster. All parts on the gun are original. In poor condition these guns still list for $1,750.00 and in excellent condition up to $4,000.00. Im asking $3,000.00  OBO. Thank you.

See - This rifle was part of a trade.  However, it's the only .223 that I've owned.  When all my other rifles are 7.62-something, I just can't see stocking supplies for this one.  So I patterned the rifle at 100 yards, cleaned it thoroughly and am passing it along.

It comes with the 3-9x40mm scope that you see attached, with the proprietary Mini-14 rings.  And there's a combination flash hider/muzzle brake installed.  You also get two stainless steel, 20 round magazines and a box containing 24 rounds of brass-cased ammo.

This rifle is going to make someone very happy!  Additional pictures are available upon request. Open only to Ohio residents (w/ ID) in face to face transaction."

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

Barrel: Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN using their proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system. The barrel has an A2 style profile, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, and Mp and HP tested. The upper is and is finished off with an F-marked front sight post, and A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer, and are marked with the Palmetto State Armory logo on the left side, up front, just below the rail.

It is the customer's responsibility to be aware of all applicable laws and regulations regarding purchase and ownership of uppers with a barrel length of less than 16""
