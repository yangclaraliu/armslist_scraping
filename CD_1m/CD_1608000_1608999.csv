I am selling the stock, barrel, and scope for a Ruger 10/22, . Everything fits perfectly, the rifle turned into a safe queen once I added the upgraded parts.  The sock is no longer in production, and is in very good condition, minor scratches shown in the pictures.  The barrel shoots very well and looks awesome, minor scratch on the muzzle brake also shown in the pictures. It was advised by the manufacturer not to shoot CCI stingers through this barrel, I don't know why, and have never tried. The scope is the newest addition, it fits the rifle well with about an 1/8 inch space between the barrel, not a scratch on it. Stock and barrel can be sold separately.

Not familiar with AA-Ammo?  Let me enlighten you.

AA-Ammo is that ammunition bought by one A-Hole and then marked up by 50-100% and sold to another A-hole who is either too stupid to know he is getting SCREWED, too lazy to shop, or just to impatient to wait for things to return to a more normal state.
GOUGERS are predatory A-HOLES and they are a big part of why there is such short supply of ammo.
The other guys?  Well you may or may not be an A-Hole.  IF you insist on paying the gougers price then you my friend are indeed an A-Hole, because you keep feeding the problem.  IF you just didn't know any better then let me help. 

You and I can still get ammo at normal prices as proven by the attached receipt for ammo I purchased on FRIDAY.  3 boxes of Federal .45 for 32.17 each.

So guys and girls, STOP being stupid/ignorant/victimized by paying the gougers prices.  When you stop they will stop.  Let's put AA-Ammo out of business SOON.  ONLY YOU can stop this cycle.  When the gougers run out of victims, shelves will fill again, and all of you can go to your local store and get ammo again. 

STOP OVER PAYING>  You see someone asking 50-60 bucks for 100ct box of Federal .45 tell them to shove it!!  Flag these jerks and let's get them out of here.
Offer 35-36 bucks for time and trouble.  STOP BEING SHEEP!!!

The first is a concealable Galls vest. This vest is a 42R Male. It should fit anyone between 175-200lbs and 5'8 - 6'0. I wore this vest while on duty for about 6 months. It shows a small bit of wear, but was never shot, and still has a ton of life left in it.  It has the soft kevlar lining inside and has the ability to accept trauma plates as well. Without the trauma plates it is Level IIIA, with the addition of trauma plates it could be brought up to Level IV. $200.

The second is a Molle Pattern Vest in black. This is a Blackhawk Male Large. I have worn this vest twice and it is virtually brand new. It also has the soft armor plates on the inside with the ability to accept the hard ceramic plates. As it sits it is rated at Level IIIA. $250

Both vests have plenty of adjustment so if you are a bit above or below the size recommendations there is still a great possibility it will fit. Most Blackhawk vests you see online do not include the kevlar, it is just the fabric vest. I found this out the hard way. I may possibly be interested in a trade of some firearms related item. I reload so any supplies or even a firearm plus cash on my end. Just let me know what you have.
