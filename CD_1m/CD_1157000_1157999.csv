Hornady XTP bullets were designed for hunting, self-defense, and law enforcement. One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities. 

Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition."

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

The 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient.  This rifle comes with one 20 round magazine, but additional 20 & 30 round magazines are available for purchase separately.

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

This gun shoots the inexpensive and readily available 7.62x39mm Ammo.  Comes with the STS-081 Mini Red Dot Sight, Handguard Rail Mounts, three 30-Rnd Tapco polymer magazines, 100-Rnds of Ammo, gun lock and owners manual.  This is a high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operated firearm with a military grade barrel to ensure accuracy and durability, and has an ambi safety selector.  To create this firearm Sig Sauer took everything that makes the traditional AK-47 inaccurate, and eliminated it! The 556R model is crafted with much lower tolerances than traditional AK-47 rifles, resulting in a much more accurate rifle able to stretch beyond 200 yards no problem!

TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is the new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable operation and function.

Quality made in the USA by Cobra Ent. Firearms: 
""Cobra Firearms are manufactured and assembled 100% in the USA. Every firearm we produce carries a lifetime warranty. We are one of the top 10 handgun manufacturers in the US today and are recognized for our quality made yet affordable line of firearms."" 
Life time warranty, transferable to any owner. From the factory: ""Factory direct life time warranty covers all owners of the firearm"". If you ever have any problems you send it for free repair or service, if is not repairable they will send you new one. Not many factories have the lifetime warranty, this is the good indicator of the excellent quality. 

This is the perfect size light weight handgun, perfect for personal concealed carry, pocket, purse, vehicle, man and woman. 
It is all chrome, black polymer grips, maintenance free-no oiling needed outside, it wont corrode, oil wont stain your clothes, it wont make mess in you purse. 
Perfect concealable firearm for a beginning shooter to an experienced marksman. No recoil, very easy and simple to operate and shoot. Perfect balance and shape - rounded edges, will not catch the clothing while drawing. And reassembles the famous James Bond Walter PPK. 
Caliber .32acp (auto) it's actually 7.65x17mm. It has good stopping power. This is the best caliber for the smaller pistols, because if you go bigger you are losing number of bullets in the mag and shooting becomes unpleasant especially for very young people and females, due to short handle /grip and huge recoil. Light weight of the gun cannot compensate any part of the recoil forces and gun can even jump out of the hands and kick you in the head. That is why .32 is the perfect choice with almost no recoil, even seven years old can shoot it safely.

This is the perfect size -  light weight handgun, perfect for personal concealed carrying, pocket, purse, vehicle, man and woman.
It is all black, polymer coated, maintenance free-no oiling needed outside, it won't stain your clothes, it won't corrode, it won't make a mess in your purse.
Perfect concealable firearm for a beginning shooter to an experienced marksman. No recoil, very easy and simple to operate and shoot. Perfect balance and shape - rounded edges, will not catch the clothing while drawing. And resembles the famous James Bond Walter PPK.
Caliber .380acp (auto) it's actually 9x17mm, same caliber like the standard police/military 9x19mm para, but only 2mm shorter casing. It has excellent stopping power. This is the best caliber for the smaller pistols, because if you go bigger you are losing number of bullets in the mag and shooting becomes unpleasant especially for very young people and females, due to short handle /grip and huge recoil. Light weight of the gun cannot compensate any part of the recoil forces and gun can even jump out of the hands and kick you in the head. That is why .380 is the perfect choice with almost no recoil, even a seven year old can shoot it safely.

Absolutely perfect condition.  It comes with 2 magazines and they are 13 or 14 round magazines.  This gun belongs to a friend of mine and he purchased this gun around 10 years ago.  This gun is a double action to single action and has a half cock safety as well as the slide operated safety which is also a decocker.  So essentially this is a full size all metal gun with all the features of a new gun.  Anyone who doesn't know exactly what they are looking at will mistake it for the revered Browning Hi-Power.  It also breaks down very easily and is easily reassembled."

I just received this in a trade a little less than a month ago and I have fired 200 flawless rounds down range. I am unsure of the round count but from the looks of it, I'd guesstimate 600-700 rounds.

This RAMI is a SA/DA, Polymer frame, no decocker with adjustable factory glow sights. The adjustable rear sights have the factory green glow dots, the front sights are factory but I've removed the green glow dots (mucked up from gun powder) and made the front dot bright white for faster sight acquisition.

This a great carry or range gun as it is dead on accurate and low recoil for it's size. 

I do not have the case or original paperwork as I received it in a trade that way.

Gun comes with:
CZ RAMI 2072 P 9mm
(3) 10 Round Magazines
(2) 14 Round Magazines
(1) Pistol Rug to carry everything

Trade Value is $675.
This CZ is very hard to find and if you know CZ's they make some of the most reliable firearms in the world. 10 round mags are going for $40 - $50 each, 14 round mags are going for $50+ on gunbroker.

I'm an enterprising grad student, not a price gouger as you can see by my fair and affordable pricing. 

I'd like cash for these, but might trade for NIB factory made block 19 magazines, and ruger factory made 20 round mags for mini 14.

I will update this listing as items sell. They will be marked sale pending until paid for. I can ship if you want to pay for it. I prefer local buyers. You must be over 18 yrs old, and able to legally possess ammunition. I also accept paypal if that is how you prefer to pay.

Quick note: If you're looking at this ad it is because you are in the market for ammo. You may have already been out about town looking. If so you know how hard it can be to find this ammo, especially what I have for purchase. I'm only asking for fair market value, with a minimal markup for my time and effort. I'm not desperate. With that said don't send me cockamamie low ball offers. Unless they provide humor and will make me laugh. I won't sell you the ammo but a good chuckle is always welcomed.

All of this ammo is new production, new in box bought within last few months. When purchasing remember that I'm a college student - and I've done all the leg work for you already.

Here is what I have for sale along with suggested offering prices: 

2 boxes each with 50 rounds of Blazer 380 Auto 95 grain FMJ with aluminum casing - asking $28 each box 

1 box each with 100 rounds of Winchester 380 Auto 95 grain FMJ with brass casings- asking $45 for the box

4 boxes each with 50 rounds of Magtech 380 auto 95 grain FMC with brass casings- asking $24 per box

2 boxes each with 20 rounds of Magtech 380 ""First Defense"" 77 grain SCHP - asking $25 per box

and last but certainly not least- 4 boxes each with 25 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 90 grain FTX - asking $28 per box

Last note: I'm a college grad student working on an MBA, and have studied capitalism as well as economics- everyone knows that scarcity drives relative value, but also any item is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it.

Send me questions if you have them, I can send other detailed pictures if you need them. Also I will be honest and communicate what the highest offer is, especially if someone else wants the ammo more than you do- and is willing to pay premium.

another note- in between class I'm out and about, I can help find specialty ammo for you - or die trying (not literally.) If/when I find what you're looking for you can help offset my ridiculous college textbook fees with a nice donation. Also I'm looking for a real job soon- medical technology field- sales or ???

Buy my ammo and keep me off the mean streets of Denver.

Thank you for your support and for reading my listing."

Plus side is that this is a nice defense round, great for your concealed carry weapon. Also the brass is some of the highest quality for reloading. Each round is produced for consistency and proven reliability. Lots of knock down power, and very accurate. 

This is the 147 grain XTP in 9mm. Similar to critical defense, minus the polymer tip. 

Quick synopsis: I'm a college student working on my MBA. In between class I'm chasing ammo and sometimes even find some. Ha ha ha- you know what I'm talking about....because you've looked high and low for 9mm ammo yourself.

This is a premium product, my pricing is based on what I had to pay to purchase the ammo, plus a small markup for my time and effort. As they say, ammo is where you find it, and is only worth what someone else is willing to give you for it.

I bought this rifle back in 05 and have customized it in the past year.  All of the parts have been professionally installed.  The rifle has not been shot too often and the bore is great.  The rifle shoots great and is a TON of fun to shoot.  It is also pretty accurate!  In all the years I have had this rifle it has ALWAYS worked great.  In all of the years I have owned it I would say I have had under 10 malfunctions.  All of them were in the first year of owning it and with HP ammo.  Since then, it has always fed everything perfect, including HP ammo.  It has always been cleaned and oiled regularly and has been well taken care of.  The side mount rail is by far the best optics mounting solution for an AK.  It is VERY stable and any optic I mounted on it ALWAYS held zero.  All you need is to pick your optic and put it on!  I am selling it because I want to put the money towards another project.

$60.00 each or 10 or more for $55 a piece. (20 available)

Magpul is pleased to announce the latest addition to the PMAG family: the PMAG 30 M3. Like its predecessors, the PMAG 30 M3 is a lightweight 5.56 x 45 NATO / .223 Remington 30-round polymer magazine for the AR15/M16 platform, but with a number of new features which improve its durability, compatibility, and overall performance for the most demanding professional shooters. By combining the knowledge gained from years of PMAG production, extensive research and development of materials and manufacturing processes, and incorporating feedback from a broad range of end-users, the PMAG 30 M3 pushes the envelope of magazine performance one step further.

The PMAG 30 M3 features a corrosion-resistant stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower, pop-off Impact/Dust Cover that snaps onto the floorplate when not in use, and easy tool-less disassembly for cleaning and maintenance. Low-profile ribs and aggressive front and rear texture provide positive control of the magazine while helping ensure compatibility with common double and triple magazine pouches. The easy to disassemble standard flared floorplate provides drop protection and aids extraction from magazine pouches, but can be replaced by a PMAG Ranger Plate for improved handling, or the new M3 Slim-line floor plate to minimize bulk (not included). A paint pen dot matrix (click here for marking guide) has been added to the bottom panel of the magazine body for easy marking by the end user for magazine identification.

Due to recent legislation which is highly likely to become law soon in Colorado Magpul may be forced to leave the state or go out of business. What this means for the future of these fantastic magazines is unknown. Magpul being the Great company they are will do there best to get production up and running again as soon as possible (currently 1,000,000 Pmags on back order), but will it be before a possible mag ban comes down from the federal government....I sure hope so. Please write the politicians in Colorado and tell them NOT to do this.....

Update: Magpul announced they will be moving there company to a different state! Until the day the new law actually goes into affect Magpul will be selling all the mags they are producing to colorado residents, so they can get as many in the hands of the citizens there as possible. This is an awesome move for a company to go the extra mile to help the citizens there.

Between the move of the company and the fact that Colorado residents will have first dips on what is being produced, it will probabaly be quite a while before mags begin to ship out to the rest of the country again."
