The SU-16CA is a hybrid of the SU-16C and SU-16A rifles. It comes with the same 16-inch barrel with Chrome-lined bore and chamber and 1/2-28 threads as the C model. All features from the C model are retained and combined with the stock of the A model. The SU-16CA will come with 2 10 round magazines that store in the stock and all the same Parkerized parts as the C model. Like the A model, the SU-16CA can be folded for storage and it will not fire in the folded position. This allows for it to be purchased in most states that still have an ""Assault Weapons Ban""

If you wish to be next in line (if sale falls through) please contact me.  Ad will remain up until funds arriive. Sig P232 with a case date of 8/8/09, purchased new on 9/10/10, I purchased it from the original owner on 10/26/12.  Total round count down the barrel is 35.  This is the stainless model and comes with two extra recoil springs, other kit parts, original standard Sig grips as well as the Hogue rubber finger groove wraparound grips, Siglite night sights, 3 Sig magazines, a very nice leather OWB holster by Hunter, and the Sig factory case.

Price for all of the above is firm at $650.  I am not interested in trades unless you want to make me a very favorable deal coming my way – cash plus your firearm or a very valuable firearm that I can not say no to.

I am located in Southern Oregon, south of Roseburg, and will travel to Roseburg if need be.  If you have tried to find one of the stainless P232s, then you know how difficult that can be.  Mine is like new, no marks of any kind.  Pistol has sat for months on end and I have decided to continue carrying my Sig P238.  The price for everything is very reasonable and I would expect this to be gone in a short time.

I did some research on these and found they are good quality; all parts made by Tanfoglio; the slide (steel) and frame are machined, not cast, and were actually assembled and distributed from Florida by FIE. Has a thumb safety, and heel mag release.  Made in Italy and assembled in the USA.

Since owning I have fired 5 rounds in quick succession and it functioned flawlessly;  feel like this would be a good pistol for a first-timer, conceal-carry, training, or maybe just a good backup weapon.  At any rate, good, inexpensive fun...comes with the 6+1 round magazine and 45 rounds of ammunition.

It just seems rough to me although it has smoothed out since new with those rounds. I have a nice IWB holster (Crossbreed) for it as well. It comes with the cheap Walther case but I harvested the foam to place in another case. It also has the adjustable backstrap and all manuals/registration cards, etc....

This is NOT a conversion kit; this gun was made for plinking. 

I purchased the gun new, and have put ~250 rounds through it with only 5 FTL early on in the process. The gun has been meticulously cleaned and maintained, and is sighted in perfectly.

When first purchasing the gun, I saw reviews complaining about running errors, and that, gun to gun, it is hit or miss if it will run right. Well this one hits it out of the park. The gun has only ever seen federal bulk ammo, and has run very well, as described above. Most reviews also give the GSG 1911-22 high marks all around.

Don't waste time buying a new gun at new gun prices with the chance that it will not work anyways. Most places are selling the gun around $375, but that only comes with 1 mag (which are expensive on their own at $35-40) and no ammo. This package has it all!

As shown in the pictures, the gun shows no wear outside of normal running marks, and has never been holster worn. The gun comes with an extra magazine, original hard case, gun lock (w/ keys), fake suppressor can, extra set of sights and buffer ring, take down tools, and instruction booklet and materials. Also included are 100 rounds of 22 lr ammo.

Will only make a FTF deal, and buyer must have Indiana DL and LTCH."

Based on the full size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases conceal ability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semi-automatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot  two finger grip frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full hand grip frame.  Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate and highly concealable pistol. Variant 1 Double action/single action with ""SAFE  position.

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years."

I ditched the Tupperware stock and the factory bases were bad. I replaced them with an EGW 20moa rail. I added a Boyds Rimfire Hunter in forest camo laminate along with a DIP trigger guard and thicker bottom metal. And replaced the accutrigger with a Rifle Basix trigger. Had a friend thread the bolt knob and added the tactical bolt know (it is either an EGW or Badger, cant remember) and I added an Anschutz rail on the forearm and a Harris adapter to run my bipod. I left the rail setting a little proud in the stock forearm, mainly because Boyds laminates are soft and didn't want the bipod denting/scratching the laminate. Rifle has about 200 rounds down the tube, looks new (mainly because it almost is), and likes CCI subsonics (although I don't because you get a lot of flyers with them) and Lapua Center-X (my favorite, seems to shoot great in everything). I shot the cci mainly to break it in a bit and I had new box that I had not shot in two years. DOES NOT come with Vortex 5-15x44 seen in pics or the rings or bipod.

I bought it off another forum about 5 years ago, and I have never seen another one like it and they have never offered one like it. I am guessing they made it for a trade show or someone they knew. It has a couple of little pinholes on one side of the butt, but is in excellent condition and always gets comments. Makes the 93 look a little like a cooper. I bought the 93 as a BTVS, it is a pre-e receiver, stainless with stainless trigger guard and bm. has the accutrigger, not sure what it is set at as I have never messed with it. The bases had been replaced when I got it, and they are a little taller than the factory ones. I run low rings on all the scopes I have had on it from 50mm down to 40mm. Rifle is accurate, around 1/2"" depending on ammo. I have not shot it in about 2 years, but as with most 17hmrs, the problem is consistent ammo. I would get flyers with all the ammo I tried. It likes the standard 17gr hornady or Winchester. It does not like the light or heavy (15.5 or 20gr) ammo.
will not separate stock and action, please do not ask. this sells as a package or goes back in the safe. Price is firm. I have had multiple offers over $200 for the stock alone.
