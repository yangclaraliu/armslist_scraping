Up for auction is a very nice Browning Model 71 lever action in .50 Alaskan, These rifles were orginally chambered in .348 Winchester. Gunsmiths wanted the Browning 71 due to its durability and strength when converting rifles to 50 Alaskan. This rifle has a half octagon half round barrel measuring at 34"", an all steal Schnabel forend, the sights have not been clipped and the engraving on the barrel and action are beautiful. the stock also has a hidden compartment for holding 4 rounds. The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping.

(1st Gun)  is the Mossberg 500AB 12 gauge pump shotgun...it's a 6-shot and comes with a picatinny rail mounted Red Dot scope. The 500AB is the 500A Mossberg shotgun with some upgrades...specifically a Walnut stock VS. the various hardwood stocks found on the regular 500A model. This 500AB also has some metal etchings, that the 500A doesnt have ...and it has a 30"" barrel. (Every part on this 500AB is interchangeable with the regular 500A)
This is a fixed full choke 30"" barreled shotgun. 30 inches is a long range shotgun. Perfect for Deer and Water Fowl...and predators of any nature. You get the 75-100 yard reach of a rifle, with the spread pattern of a shotgun. Full choke means it keeps it's shot pattern tight over a long distance, so you get killing/stopping power at rifle like distances. It shoots bird and buck shot...and rifled slugs. It is chambered for 2 and 3/4"" and 3.00"" shells. It functions flawlessly and it looks good. The bore is beautiful inside...slick as a whistle. It also has a metal safety switch, not a plastic one like the newer Mossbergs. It has a Tasco Red Dot scope, a good one, that enables quick sholdering and accurate firing of shotgun. For those folks who don't know what a Red Dot scope is: You turn the switch on and the red dot is displayed in the scope lens...when you look thru the scope, wherever the dot is - is where the bullet goes. If you move your head, the red dot stays on the target your pointing the gun at and you can still see the dot as you move your head around. It makes for very quick and accurate shooting). I love this shotgun, and the new owner will too.
(2nd gun) is a Savage Arms MarkII .22 rifle...wood furniture..looks like brand new and functions flawlessly. Shoots more accurate than the Ruger 10/22 and the Marlin60..that's the truth. That's why it is scoped with a Barska 6.5-20x 50mm scope. This is a snipers scope...if you want the pupil at 75 yards away, you get the pupil. It's a bolt action rifle with (2) 10round clips.  I'll also include 1000 rounds of .22 LR ammo with it."

SURPRISINGLY SLIM
Introducing the XD-S™. Superior innovation in the palm of your hand. This slim, powerful addition to the XD® line delivers all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.

Every carefully crafted design element of the XD-S™ is engineered to deliver an unmatched shooting experience that’s as simple and intuitive as using your own hand.

At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. And with it, you get the power of a .45 with superior control and comfort without sacrificing important safety features.

SUPERIOR ERGONOMICS

The comfortable design of the all new XD-S™ feels so natural, it’s like an extension of your own body. The unique combination of an ultra-slim profile paired with enhanced performance point-and-shoot features allows you to shoot accurately without having to adjust your wrist giving you greater control.

Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picantinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target.

SAFETY FEATURES

A game-changer in the marketplace, the XD-S™ offers all of the quality and safety features you expect from the XD® line. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XD-S™ offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability.

SAFETY

Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

I also have ammo to go with gun:
   1 box of 100 round Winchester 45 auto 185gran

Up for auction is a very nice Browning Model 71 lever action in .50 Alaskan, These rifles were orginally chambered in .348 Winchester. Gunsmiths wanted the Browning 71 due to its durability and strength when converting rifles to 50 Alaskan. This rifle has a half octagon half round barrel measuring at 34"", an all steal Schnabel forend, the sights have not been clipped and the engraving on the barrel and action are beautiful. the stock also has a hidden compartment for holding 4 rounds. The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping.

I have a case, five battlepacks of the ammunition listed in this ad from Aimsurplus...

http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=A308Ger

It's in perfect condition, and 1990's production.  If you're going to put up ammo for long term storage, this is the only way to buy it and it's straight from Germany - it hasn't been transhipped to multiple foreign countries then eventually shipped HERE.   I am funding a toy or two and will sell it for a buck a round in full battlepacks only.  I do have a box broken open for you to look at so you don't have to burst your pack.  Five battle packs, 200 rounds per pack.  I'm in SE Denver and you get to drive to me to get it, unless you want to pay for shipping.  If you're not obvious adult, you'll be showing me your ID but I wont be recording it.  BTW an adult is 18.    If this ad is gone, the ammo is gone - so just make your offer no need to send a ""do you still have it"" email.  Just tell me you want to buy it and when you can come get it.  If the attached link doesn't work, just google ""7.62 DAG ammunition""  and you'll see the rundown on it.  I shot some yesterday and the stuff is cleaner than any surplus I've ever shot.  Primers are crimped AND sealed, and there is the typical sealant on the bullet itself - weatherproof stuff.  In case anybody wondered, the cupro-nickle jacket that makes it look like it's steel cased because of the color is actually about 90 percent copper and 10 percent nickle according to ammunition sources - for some reason even small amounts of nickle will make copper alloys look like steel.   It's magnetic, but cleared for use and import and NON-armor piercing according to ATF.  But the alloy itself is harder than typical copper jackets.  The addition of the nickle was meant to deter atmospheric corrosion in salt water environments."

I ordered 7k tula small rifle and 3k tula large pistol. it should have been 5 of each. Ive been using small rifle almost exclusively in place of small pistol A- because of availability recently and B- to simplify things. primers that work for my 223 work for my 38, 357, 9mm  and vice versa. I have shot roughly 15,000 tula primers and they all go pop. small rifle is fine to use(of course downcharging the load and working up from there) in place of small pistol as long as you have a solid firing pin hit. I wouldnt be sure of their use in light striker fire pistols but small rifle have worked just fine in my 380, both my 357 revolvers and in my 1911 using the fairly rare small pistol pocket 45 brass.

Im looking for an even trade, I dont care if you have CCI or tula, small anything primers are much more difficult to find than large pistol right now so lets not be picky. I will NOT sell these. dont ask unless you are wanting to shell out $80 for a brick. even trade 2k small rifle primers for 2k large pistol. I would consider trading ~600 primers for a unopened pound of either winchester 231 or HP-38(same thing)... Im going to run out of powder before I run out of primers

Again, I am NOT selling these... unless you want to pay overpriced panic prices so I can pocket $50 and get a brick in a month or two from the lgs for $30 once all this self induced madness dies down."

*Unless you're shooting through a barrier a .22lr can be just as lethal as a .223, especially if it takes the 'ping-pong' approach in your target's body (ricocheting off bones carving tunnels through tissue and organs). There is more than one real life story of a .22lr entering the target at a 'non-kill' shot, such as the shoulder, and finding its way to a 'kill', such as the heart.

*a .223 round cost over 10x's as much and it is 10x's harder to find in stock. 

*Your wife is going to be able to defend herself more confidently with a .22lr and not be thrown off by recoil.

*This rifle is the exact same size and weight as a colt m4 5.56 ... the money you save on ammo alone would pay for this purchase if you intend on practicing and familiarizing yourself with AR15 combat.

The Most Up-To-Date & Reliable Civilian Magazine Available 

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups. All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. This mag has our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.”  .223 / 5.65 AR-15/M4 Color: Military Gray. 30-Round

PRODUCT DETAILS WRITTEN BY THE MANUFACTURER (BROWNELLS):

The Most Up-To-Date & Reliable Civilian Magazine Available 

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups. All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. This mag has our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.”  .223 / 5.65 AR-15/M4 Color: Military Gray. 30-Round

Not advertising it as perfect, could use some restoration, and in the long run would preform better than the new Wingmasters (cream of the crop for the 870 series) without having that ugly gold colored trigger they started adding to all of them.

The bad:
The Wingmaster needs a new ejector spring, it broke, and is keeping it from cycling (the pump works great, the spring is just in the way).. I tried to get the pictures to show the fading, and scratches on the blueing, it certainly is not new, but it's defiantly more valuable than the finish on an express, and remains rust free.

Here's a link for the replacement part, cost $5 (if you know what you're doing) If not, have a smith fix it.

The barrel marks used on Mosin Nagants at the Tula and Izhevsk arsenals changed several times over the years and this is often related to the political situation in the country. The first major change was made in 1912 at Tula to commemorate the founding of the arsenal by Peter the Great in 1712. The wording was changed from ""Imperial Tula Ordnance Factory"" to ""Tula Imperial Peter the Great Ordnance Factory"" and the Imperial eagle was made larger and more detailed. During this period there was much unrest in Russia with one revolution having failed in 1905 and the next revolution of 1917 already brewing. 1712 was significant because it was also the year that St. Petersburg became the capital of Russia and the bicentennial was almost certainly used by the Tsar to emphasize the importance of his position to the wellbeing of the entire country.

After trials of several different repeating bolt action designs Russia adopted a new standard infantry rifle in 1891. It fires the 7.62x54r cartridge and is a combination of designs by Russian Sergei Mosin and Belgian Leon Nagant whose primary contribution was the magazine and feed system. The official Russian designation is “Three Line Rifle, Model of the Year 1891” but is more commonly known in the US as the Mosin Nagant M91. A “line” is a unit of measure equal to 1/10th of an inch. Production of the M91 took place at the Russian arsenals at Izhevsk, Tula, and Sestroryetsk. Due to a slow start in domestic production a contract was issued to the French arms company Chatellerault who built around 500,000 M91s. During WWI contracts were issued to the American firms of New England Westinghouse and Remington for 1.8 and 1.5 million rifles respectively. M91s were widely used in WWI and can be found with markings from many different European countries that purchased or captured them.

Various police forces use them due to their reliability and performance, and that is often the same reason civilians purchase them. They group well, perform well, and can handle being dirtied up some. They are compact and lightweight, so they would make for a great multi-purpose carbine. Just handling this one almost makes me want to buy one. If you are in the market for an AR-15 but do not feel as though you would trust yourself with getting the best quality parts to do a build-it-yourself, the Colt 6920MP-B is probably one of your best choices. They are more expensive than other AR-15s that are capable out-of-the-box, but the quality and fit of the Colt can't be matched. You can tell they come from the same factory as the military rifles; the left side of the magazine well is even stamped ""M4 CARBINE."" So, again, if you're wanting a good-to-go-out-of-the-box AR-15, I highly recommend the Colt SP 6920MP-B.

Normal High Velocity 22LR ammo goes about 1250 fps with a 40 gr bullet. ""Hyper Velocity"" ammo uses a lighter bullet to go even faster: (For example, the hyper velocity CCI Stinger uses a 32 gr bullet and goes 1640 fps.) So, the Aguila Interceptor delivers the hard impact of the heavier 40 grain bullet at a velocity almost as high as Stinger--an excellent combination of knock down and trajectory. 5% more energy than CCI Velocitor at the same bullet weight and the same energy as CCI Stinger with a 25% heavier bullet! Perfect fodder for semi-auto pistols and rifles that need high energy for reliable cycling. Eley Primed! Ballistics Information: •Muzzle Velocity: 1470 fps •Muzzle Energy: 192 ft. lbs.

Some ads claim to have cheaper prices BUT ARE NEVER IN STOCK. When they receive inventory the price is higher and the weapon packages always need hundreds of dollars of equipment before you can fire your first shot..So if you want it, here is a deal that gets you out shooting without spending another dime ! Ammo included !! You buy this deal and go direst to the range and shoot ! How many other offers have you seen that offers a COMPLETE PACKAGE ?! I'll even throw in some targets !
Stop falling for the tricks of typical retailers and especially the tricks and scams of the gun show cheats who sell imitation scopes, accessories ( yes , they are actually selling TOY AIRSOFT ACCESSORIES AS TRUE WEAPONS GRADE ITEMS !!!) !
Why even consider a used rifle  ?? There are so many new , 'under manufacturer warranty' rifles available ?!?  One failure and you lose that $100 you saved.

If you are in need of data storage, or if you want a nifty tablet pc, please read on.

I am willing to trade my external hard drive and tablet for a good condition Remington 870 or Mossberg 5XX series. I am willing to negotiate and add some cash on to sweeten the deal.

Here are the details:

Blackberry Playbook
- 16 GB hard drive
- 1 GHz dual-core processor
- 7 inch LCD screen
- 1080p HD display
- multi-touch capable
- Wireless-N Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n
- Front and back camera
- Comes with charger, USB cable, and protective pouch, as well as the original box and its contents (new cleaning cloth, instructions, etc). I believe the only thing I'm missing is the software CD, which you can download online.

It hurts a little to part with it, and I may have trader's remorse, but I haven't used it much since graduating college. Great audio for such a little device, and it holds its charge well, IMO. They're going for about $120 in ""acceptable"" condition, and over $140 in ""like new"" condition on Amazon right now. This one's in pristine condition. Not a scratch on the screen.

HP SimpleSave 1 TB External HD
- Not much to say here. USB 2.0. Charger and cables. Software is on the HD.
It's worth $160 new on Amazon and $50-70 in various used conditions. I'm gonna go ahead and say it's worth about $60.
I found that 1 TB is a bit excessive for me. I have an older external HD, and it's suiting me fine.

I also have some odds and ends that I could throw in. About 50 rounds of Winchester SuperX .22 LR ammo, maybe some spare HDMI cords, and some really good pipe tobacco, if you would like to seal a deal with a smoke. Cornell & Diehl's Bayou Morning Flake--over 10 years old--and ""Black Cordial"" from a CA tobacco shop.

I'm in no real hurry to get rid of these or buy a shotgun. I just think my electronics aren't getting their full potential out of them, which is a shame--maybe you have an 870 or 500 that's getting similar treatment as well. That said, please don't lowball me. Haggling is ok, but please don't insult my intelligence.

Please text FIVE ONE ZERO-857-FOUR THREE 63 if you have a real offer and would like to arrange a meeting. Thanks."

This custom shotgun is a must see. With its single-digit serial number, it is from a limited production run of only ten made. It has 20"" barrels with 3-inch chambers and is made of 18-2 polished stainless steel - and so marked. It has a gorgeous, Grade 2 wood stock set with engravings. German-made quality, throughout.

Not a heavy gun, its quite slim and nimble, and an absolute pleasure to handle. Please don't confuse this one with what passes as ""coach guns"" these days. This one is up to the quality guns of the past - with some added benefits from the modern age.

The classic ""Coachgun"" - one of the most effective and history-proven defense firearms ever designed. It's also probably one of the very last types to ever be included in any mindless new legislation. This firearm should last several lifetimes of serious use due to its superior construction and the material from which it is made.
