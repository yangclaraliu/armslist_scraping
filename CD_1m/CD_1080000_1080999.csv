The STEYR AUG 
is a gas operated semi-automatic
rifle with a 
locked action.
The STEYR AUG is famous for its modular concept, which allows it to be quickly disassembled into six main component groups without tools. Here are the six component groups »


BARREL: The chrome-lined barrel can be quickly changed without the use of tools and has a foldable barrel grip. Gas pressure can be adjusted, allowing functionality under adverse conditions, such as cold weather.

RECEIVER: The receiver has an integrated Picatinny rail (Mil. Std. 1913) on which to mount various devices, such as a scope or flash- light. The barrel is locked into the front and back of the receiver.

TRIGGER MECHANISM: Located in the rear of the stock, it’s designed for semi-automatic fire only.

BOLT: The STEYR AUG has a fixed locking bolt, with seven locking lugs. An optional bolt is available to convert the STEYR AUG from right hand to left hand ejection.

STOCK: Black synthetic bull-pup stock, contains the receiver group, trigger mechanism group, magazine and external bolt release lever.

MAGAZINE: The detachable magazine is a staggered box type and is made of transparent synthetic material. Magazines are available in 30 round (standard) and 42 round (optional) capacities."

For some reason they are marked 5.56 (.223 Rem) on the box, but they are .223 Rem cartridges (product code matches other American Eagle .223 Rem, and cartridges themselves are headstamped .223 Rem).  Product code is AE223.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $3-$5 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 30 boxes available (600 rounds total). Price is $16/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.  Price is pretty reasonable considering others are asking $1/round + for similar ammo.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 6 box minimum on orders I have to ship.

I can be reached through the Armslist messaging system, @ kolarskeet@gmail.com, or @ 585-613-8098 (please leave a message if I'm unable to answer). No texts please if you can help it, too difficult to try and conduct business via text, so email or phone call if possible."

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles are the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles."

For some reason they are marked 5.56 (.223 Rem) on the box, but they are .223 Rem cartridges (product code matches other American Eagle .223 Rem, and cartridges themselves are headstamped .223 Rem). Product code is AE223.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $3-$5 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 30 boxes available (600 rounds total). Price is $16/box FIRM.  26 boxes are the tan box shown in the first 2 pics, 4 boxes are the red box shown in the last pic. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush. Price is pretty reasonable considering others are asking $1/round + for similar ammo.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 6 box minimum on orders I have to ship.

The answer is ANY Walmart that has a sporting goods department and that sells firearms (not all do). You need to find that Walmart in your area. The AR rifle is only sporting good merchandise to Walmart and is held in no higher esteem than a golf club notwithstanding its different treatment under law.  
They sell them with respect to MSRP and profit margin consistent with the Walmart brand. That brand's mission is to give the everyday average working family the best price possible. They don't jack up prices based on trending hysteria. There is no fanfare when you ask to see one and no discussion of its rarity or that the price may go up if Obama starts confiscating them...just a sporting goods department selling sporting goods. The price point is set according to manufacturer MSRP and the buying power of the retailer.  
I did note that the guns trickle in and are sold almost immediately. You must be patient and diligent. It may take several trips or phone calls. Act like it is Christmas and you are looking for that Cabbage Patch doll for your daughter. Remember those days? After I posted the note, the Bushmaster I referenced was sold. More are coming in. 5 or 6 different brands including Colts and Sigs came into this particular Walmart this week...and sold in short order. They are continuously on back order and as they come in are first logged and then offered to the shopper for sale. There is no mystery to it...the salesperson has no special interest in it...just merchandise at MSRP or lower. Happy Walmart shopping to fellow gun enthusiasts."

This rifle is in new condition with the box and comes with 4 30 round pre-ban magazines, magazine pouch, sling, cleaning kit and bayonet with sheath. Some information on the VZ 58:
- The VZ 58 has a milled receiver. 
- Even with the milled receiver, it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
- The VZ 58 receiver is completely enclosed, preventing debris from entering the receiver.
- The bolt of the VZ 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
- The safety is more ergonomic, making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
- The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 58.
- The VZ 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
- The alloy magazine of the VZ 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lbs vs. .84 lbs)
- The VZ 58 is striker-fired, unlike the hammer-fired AK-47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.

This is the best polymer handgun on the market.  It is basically an upgrade from a Glock.  The Steyr M is a series of semi-automatic pistols developed by Steyr Mannlicher GmbH & Co KG of Austria for police services. The pistol has a multi-stage safety system consisting of two automatic internal safeties, two external trigger safeties and a manual lock safety.  The pistol’s design takes advantage of modern manufacturing techniques: the slide is precision-milled from steel;[2] the frame is an injection-molded synthetic polymer[2] and parts of the trigger and striker mechanisms are pressed from sheet metal.[4] For the purpose of regular maintenance, the pistol is stripped down into the following components: the barrel, slide, recoil spring, frame and magazine.

While the Steyr M is frequently compared to Glock-series pistols (both are polymer-framed striker-fired pistols, with Tenifer finishes), there are several differences in the details of the design. For example, the M-series had a fully supported chamber in all chamberings from the start (Some Glock models also had this feature from the start, other Glock models evolved to having more supported chambers when compared to their original internal layout), unique triangular/trapezoid sights, a loaded chamber indicator below the rear sights (on third and later generation Glock pistols this feature is present on the extractor on the right slide side) and a different grip angle (111°)."

I ballpark the value of this entire package at about $1200-$1300 (rifle, stock, scope, barrel).

The listing states .223/5.56 (the only option armslist would give me).  The gun does not have 5.56 printed anywhere on it, so I'm inclined to think this will only accept .223 cartridges.  I've read about a few people with similar rifles making 5.56 work in theirs, but I don't know whether that would damage the chamber/barrel.  So, in the interest of full disclosure...there you go.

Here is a Ruger 10/22 DSP (Deluxe Sporter). I believe this is still unfired as I can't find any indication that it has been fired. It comes with the factory box and paperwork. The registration card is still in the box. These Ruger's have a really nice checkered walnut stock and no barrel-band. Much nicer looking that the standard birch- or synthetic-stocked 10/22s.

More photos available, just ask.

Price is $400.00, plus $30 for shipping and insurance.  This will ship from a private individual via FedEx for $30 to any of the 48 states. Hawaii and Alaska will cost more. Make sure your dealer will accept shipment from an individual. If your dealer requires that this be shipped from a dealer, shipping will be an additional $20 for my dealer's fee.

I have listed this gun several times, for a few days at a time, then I take it down because I keep getting emails from guys that obviously haven't read the entire post, based on the type of questions or offers.
So I am going to try once more, if it doesn't work out I will just put it back in the safe, it's not much of an inconvenience  to go buy one.
I have a Smith & Wesson 5906, 9 mm, now before you say, that's an old gun, I know it is discontinued, but please read the entire post.
This is all stainless, totally mark free. I don't know exactly how many rounds have been fired, because all these other folks that seem to count each round, yeah right! I do know the original owner that I got it from said, he fired ""a few rounds to make sure the action worked properly"", then put it in the safe. Based on what I know about him, that was way less than a box.
I have the two factory original 15 round stainless magazines, and the original cardboard box, though it shows its age a bit. So here is the deal, I have more 9 mm guns than I need, but would like to have another .45. So before I go hunting for a new one I thought I would try to trade for one. I am especially fond of the 1911 style.
Due to the impending ban on magazines over 10 rounds, the pulse of the industry says these guns are going to go sky high on value, so you could double your investment in time. My gunsmith/dealer says a fair value on this gun is $600, I'm not going to argue over nickels either way, but can verify via internet sites.
I will leave this up for a few days, if you're interested let me know and we can swap ideas and pictures via email.
Thanks for reading,"

These guns are hard to find, and I'm pricing them at what I will probably have to pay to replace them if I decide to do that later. Asking prices are about average from what I can tell, so I'm pretty firm on them. Obviously, the more you buy, the more flexible I'll be. Please don't email me offering half of what I'm asking. You'll be wasting your time and mine. I will only sell face to face within a reasonable distance of Youngsville, and prefer that you have a concealed carry permit or pistol permit and a current NC driver's license. I won't need to take the permit, but I want to make sure you're legal to own a gun. I will also ask you to sign a bill of sale and give you a copy as well. Just covering my butt and yours."

The answer is ANY Walmart that has a sporting goods department and that sells firearms (not all do). You need to find that Walmart in your area. The AR rifle is only sporting good merchandise to Walmart and is held in no higher esteem than a golf club notwithstanding its different treatment under law.
They sell them with respect to MSRP and profit margin consistent with the Walmart brand. That brand's mission is to give the everyday average working family the best price possible. They don't jack up prices based on trending hysteria. There is no fanfare when you ask to see one and no discussion of its rarity or that the price may go up if Obama starts confiscating them...just a sporting goods department selling sporting goods. The price point is set according to manufacturer MSRP and the buying power of the retailer.
I did note that the guns trickle in and are sold almost immediately. You must be patient and diligent. It may take several trips or phone calls. Act like it is Christmas and you are looking for that Cabbage Patch doll for your daughter. Remember those days? After I posted the note, the Bushmaster I referenced was sold. More are coming in. 5 or 6 ARs (revision here, not 6 different brands), of various brands, including Colts and Sigs came into this particular Walmart this week...and sold in short order. They are continuously on back order and as they come in are first logged and then offered to the shopper for sale. There is no mystery to it...the salesperson has no special interest in it...just merchandise at MSRP or lower. Happy Walmart shopping to fellow gun enthusiasts."

Ok, many have been asking how old it is.  If you know about interarms you know it is very hard to find the born on date.

I have owned it for 7 years and only put 50 rounds (1 box) through it.  Serial# S135952 if you find diff results plz let me know."

This is a completely re-done Springfield Armory M1 Garand in 30.06. All parts are SA except the barrel, which has been replaced with an absolutely mint Danish VAR 1966 barrel. The VAR barrel is proofed and marked properly. These barrels are renown in the M1 world as phenomenal shooters and this one in like new condition with.  The bore is mirror-like and crisp, with a perfect crown. 

The finish matches on all the wood, and it's not shiny. Just very sharp, natural USGI look. All small pins and springs have been replaced, op-rod spring replaced, and the entire M1 was re-parked.

The rifle comes with 270+ rounds of 30-06 tracer rounds with ammo can.

This is museum like quality that could be the centerpiece of any man cave with the added benefit that you can take this to the range and make everyone want to take a look at it.  If you are looking for highest end quality, this is it.  I have been to more than 20 gun shows without seeing anything as nice as this rifle.  

NOTE: I do not sell junk. I have a 3 day policy on returns for cause. (i.e. not because your wife just said no, but if something is wrong with the rifle that I did not know about I'll refund or make it right - my reputation is more important than any sale.)

About the Seller: I am a licensed attorney and longtime advocate of gun rights. We have a right from God to self-defense. The Constitution of the United States and that of Ohio provides political protection and recognition of these rights. The second amendment has nothing to do with hunting; it is there to protect us from the number 1 mass murderer in all of history - tyrannical government.
