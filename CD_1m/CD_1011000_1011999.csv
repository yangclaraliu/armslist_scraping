This Kriss is in basically new condition. I bought this gun brand new when they first became available. I broke the barrel in cleaning it after every round for 10 shots then every other round for 20 shots, then every 5 for 30, then after the 13rd clip twice. I still have the 14rds left over from the box of 100 I bought, gotta leave enough for home protection! Only used M-Pro 7 gun oil. You can field strip this gun in about 5 seconds. Bolt comes right out very easy to clean and lube. I've only used the 13rd magazine but, I will include a brand new Kriss 30rd. I've shot everything from a ps90 to a M60 and this gun is impressive. Virtually no kick, the iron sights work but, the Eotech made all the difference. I wish I could keep this gun, but I have part with it. My friend just bought $4000 worth of 5.56 and said I could shoot all I want if I take him shooting! So, I'm in the market for one of the great assault rifles.

The Eotech is going to be used to finish my father's AR-15 that I am building for him as he has never had enough money to own a gun. This is for his birthday and he doesn't know about it.

I am willing to listen to all offers and have some cash to throw in as well.

I was going to trade my Glock for an Eotech straight up so that I could finish building an AR-15 for my father, who has never had the money to be able to buy a weapon. However, I need to still have a concealed carry that I can use.

This is a brand new Glock in that it has never been fired before. It comes with three mags, one of them an extended grip mag, a Blackhawk Size 7 inside the pants holster, a 20 round box of .40 hollow point rounds and a speed loader.

I am aware that I will also need to include cash and I am willing to do so. I could also include 4 brand new gen 2 pmags with dust covers as part of the trade.

I am looking for an Eotech, as long as it is in good condition, and a good concealed carry. I would prefer a 9mm concealed carry and do not want Kel-Tec or a pistol.

Here are pictures of the Glock and the extended grip mag.

The extended grip mag also increases the holding capacity of the mag, takes it from a 9+1 to a 10+1.

Feel free to text me, no phone calls, (802) 377-7 Four 80

Nothing wrong with the old one, but I recently built a new STW that is exactly what I've always wanted, and now I have to pay for it. 

The rifle for sale is a Sako model 995 - Factory original - no upgrades or changes other than a trigger job (2lbs, breaks like glass). You will love this trigger. If you are not familiar with this rifle, It is built on the TRG-S action, which is a magnum length, 3 lug push feed design. It has a 26"" medium contour free floated barrel, black synthetic monte carlo stock with a nice palm swell.  The action is a matte blue finish and the barrel & bolt handle are a high luster blue.  One feature I really like is the detachable box magazine which holds 4 rounds and is plenty long to seat bullets out there (3.730).  

Some background... I bought it 10 years ago for elk, deer, sheep, moose & antelope when I lived in Colorado.  I only hunted one elk season with it before I had to move to Illinois and I have not hunted with it since. I have fired exactly 60 rounds through it, all factory loads.  More recently I got into handloading and I now have the opportunity to hunt out west again, so I put a new scope on it and got ready to work up some loads.  That is when the NEW STW entered my life - One of those deals I just couldn't pass up.  

I love the Sako and didn't think I would ever sell it.  It always functioned perfectly and is in 95%+ condition. For me this rifle was always a pleasure to shoot, recoil is very manageable, probably due to the stock design.  Accuracy was very good and I was planning to refine it further with handloads.  I have 2 sets of Leupold rings (med & high) that mate with the integral dovetail bases on the receiver. The rifle weighs 9.2 lbs with a brand new Leupold 4.5x14x40 matte VX3 CDS on it.  I would sell with or without the scope.

I will consider trades as well.  Id really only trade for a mossberg 500 mariner model or a model 500 8 shot persuader (no mavericks) and either must be in great condition.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour  16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications.

New for 2012, we are offering the 16” R.E.P.R. with a spiral fluted barrel. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

 The TBL-37 is a Single Action tactical launcher chambered in 37/38 mm and made to the highest standards of American workmanship. Constructed of 6061 aircraft grade aluminum and 4140 hardened steel, it is rugged while maintaining a reasonable weight.

 The first version of the TBL-37 was known as the Fireball. Under that name it was extensively tested by George (“Grog”) Confer of L5 Productions and noted authority on 37mm and 40mm ordnance. Grog’s early review helped us to refine several important aspects of that model. Further modifications resulted in a sleeker, more tactically oriented, design that was different enough to warrant our renaming it the TBL-37.

 Based on the proven design of the Viet Nam era M-79 grenade launcher, the TBL-37 has advanced it to new levels. Replacing the heavy wooden stocks with modern tactical black poly was the beginning. We added a full barrel length Picatinny rail on the top and a short rail under the muzzle. These allow the owner to interchange tactical accessories thus providing the ultimate in flexibility. 



Description and Features

 In the standard configuration, the TBL-37 is equipped with a 16” barrel with a full length upper Picatinny Rail. The underside of the barrel is equipped with a poly horizontal Foregrip.

 The standard finish is matte black.

 The TBL-37 is shipped in a heavy-duty cardboard box with a corrugated foam insert suitable for storage and transport.


Ammunition (NOT included)

 The TBL-37 will handle 37mm ammunition made by any manufacturer. Available ammunition includes flares, smoke and other pyrotechnic rounds for civilian use. If you are a member of law enforcement or the military you can have a variety of “Less Than Lethal” rounds at your disposal. These include Batons, CS Gas, Wildlife Management (Bird Control) and crowd dispersing Rubber Pellets.

 The TBL-37 is ideal for use by SWAT Teams and others with critical tactical requirements.
