No BCG or charging handle. Upper is brand new and has never been mated to a lower. If you want higher resolution pics, just let me know. No trades.

For those not familiar with the different barrel profiles, the lightweight barrel reduces a bit of muzzle-end weight (where you want to reduce weight - i.e., the part of the rifle farthest from your body) relative to the government profile barrel. From the chamber to the FSB, the barrel is identical to the government profile barrel. All the weight savings is at the muzzle end.

The streaks and unevenness you see is just the preservative oil that is slathered on at the factory.

Third is one of the cleanest 1944 M44 carbines I have run across. Has original side folding bayonet, all matching numbers rifle. It has been counter bored, but I think this was one that was just done & probably didn't need it as the entire rifle looks to have not been fired much at all. Bore and rifling are both fantastic.

Thermold Magazines started in the 1960’s as a molded plastics injection manufacturer that served the automotive industry. It's founder, William Howard, was well known in his hometown of Wilson, N.C. as an innovative thinker who held many patents. Mr. Howard was also a big game hunter for whom making firearms more reliable was both a passion and a necessity.

Using a nylon resin called Zytel, developed by DuPont after World War II to replace metal in large-scale manufacturing, Thermold began producing weapons magazines that resisted heat and corrosion, and functioned with extreme reliability. Thermold magazines rapidly became the product of choice among military personnel, law enforcement officers and sport shooters around the world.

This vest is not bullet-resistant and is only designed to protect from fragmentation particles.  Perfect for the militaria collector!   Price is $100.  I would be willing to ship this actual postage if buyer pays the postage."

All top brands Made in USA not lesser imported stuff,"Brandon/Valrico, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 425,"Listed On: Sunday, March 3, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello this is the last of my stash of .22LR ammo that I've put away over the years without even realizing it. I ended up selling my .22's recently so I just don't need this anymore. It's all been stored in a dehumidified safe so I guarantee it's all clean and 100% sure to fire. Included is:

500 rounds of the classic CCI MINI-MAG's - 40 grain copper plated bullet and my favorite over the years.

550 round bulk pack Federal 36 grain copper plated hollow points.

375 round bulk pack CCI Tactical Ammo that has a 40 grain copper plated solid bullet (this looks and shoots just like Mini-Mags to me).

200 rounds Remington ThunderBolt 40 grain solid lubed bullet.

100 rounds of good old Federal Lightning 40 grain solid lubed bullet.

100 rounds of Winchester SuperX 40 grain copper plated solid bullet.

100 rounds CCI STINGER - a devastating Hyper Velocity round that I used to hunt with.

Finally 100 rounds of Remington VIPER which is another Hyper Velocity round that has a lighter ( I think 32 grain) truncated cone (more pointed) bullet. I didn't think anything could top the CCI STINGERS when it came to pure destructive stopping power, but let me tell you that these Vipers are at least as powerful and probably more.

First $425 takes the entire lot. I really don't want to split them up at this point. Plus I really would prefer not to ship. It's a lot of work on my part and UPS charges outrageous prices to ship ammo if you don't have a prearranged deal like Cabela's and their likes. I'd say shipping this lot could run as high as $30 maybe even $40.

Last the deal is cash only and pickup is at my home in Valrico Florida or my office in Lakeland Florida. I'm not up for driving and meeting in a parking lot somewhere - hope you understand. Thanks for looking."

I did fire the few rounds I had and it fired, i just had to push the trigger back. Sell for $125obo. I would be willing to ad cash for right trade. Thank you."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Bought new from Buds in Lexington last March and has been sitting in the safe only being taken out twice to the range and back. The rifle is in excellent condition, always properly greased/lubed before firing and the walnut stock looks (and smells) fantastic. I had originally planned to build it up with a JAE stock and nice glass but other projects and finances kept it on the back burner. As a result it never really saw much use and the round count as of Friday only sits at 106. It's been a fantastic shooter right out of the box though and I hope to own another one day when the funds permit.

Attention Deer and Antelope Hunters- 

The .264 win mag is a very flat shooting cartridge.  Look up the specifications on this cartridge for yourself. 

The 700 BDL in .264 magnum is a fairly rare rifle.  This one is in overall ""good condition"".  It has some dings on the stock, and some speckling on the steel from rust.  It has been hunted with, and is around 40 years old, I can send  more pictures, and  don't expect  that it is a new rifle.  The scope is a 4X32 Tasco that could be used or changed out. The rings are see-through so you can still use the iron sights. It comes with one box of 140 grain SP ammo ($50.00).  I can send more pictures if you would like.


Terms- I require that you let me peek at your CO ID or CCW, and that you verbally tell me that you are legal to own a firearm.  That’s it. (Probably the main benefit of the rifle).  

Location- You must meet by my house, at Albertson’s Grocery Store on Mississippi and Buckley in Aurora.  Evenings and weekends work best. Don't Ask me to drive to Fort Collins! (LOL)

Price- $550.00 OBO.

Chambered for the powerful 7.62x54 cartridge. This weapon was designed to engage targets that were out of range for the standard infantry rifle. The action is piston driven Kalashnikov like an AK-47, just scaled up for the heavier cartridge. 

The rifle is in in good condition. Has been cleaned after every time at the range. I have put 80 rounds through it. 

Included is the following:
-Romanian PSL rifle
-4x24T black military scope with illuminated crosshairs with cover and eye piece *RARE
-6x24T black military scope with illuminated crosshairs with cover and eye piece *RARE
-8x42BA grey scope with illuminated crosshairs and bullet drop compensation with cover and eye piece
-1 10 round magazine
-1 5 round magazine
-Sling
-9-11"" detachable Bipod

No ammo is included. 

The scopes are all made at the factory in Belarus and have a light for illuminating the reticule. Optics best buy is offering the 8x42 here although they are sold out right now:   http://www.opticsbestbuy.com/POSP-Scope-8x42.html  They are offering it alone for $230 but most that I have seen even used go for closer to the $350 retail price. You can see from the pics that I sent you previously that it has the detachable rubber eye piece. It is the lighter grey ""civilian export model"" that was attached to the rifle. The 4x and 6x also have illuminated reticules but they differ from the pic I sent of the 8x reticule in that they only have the crosshair at center and the bottom post and 1 crowsfoot and there is only a rangefinder in the 8x. Windage and elevation are click adjustable on the appropriate turrets. The 4 and 6x scopes are the black painted ""military"" ones thatwere not meant for export. 

As far as how it shoots with the ""silver tip"" light ball ammo it shoots less than 1 moa and the recoil is about the same as any other 30 cal. I have not shot any of the copper stuff but I know other people who have shot it from theirs and they were getting about 2.5 moa. I have shot brown bear and silver bear ammo as well and that is about 1.5 moa.

The v7 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

Locks up tight but the trigger could benefit from some smoothing. The barrel and cylinder bores are smooth, bright, and shiney. The finish is poor and it looks bad. The metal is fine and it would be perfect for a refinish. The grips are correct and in excellent condition. 

These are going for stupid money in perfect condition. Mine isn't. I'm looking to trade for a 9mm sub-compact. Sig P250 or 290, a S&W Shield, maybe a Ruger LC9.

I'll put a trade value of $550.00 on it. These are rarely seen for sale anymore in any condition.

There seems to be some concern about my statement about the trigger being smoother. I'm particular about this sort of thing. The trigger feels about 90 to 95% to me. A few well placed strokes with a stone is really all I would add. And I may if I don't trade/sell it. Send it to Colt or Fords for re-finish and re-marking and have a new gun.

Although I would rather keep this FTF in SC, I can ship. The buyer would be responsible for all fees and shipping charges."

In case you were wondering about the paint, I have painted it similar to the weapons I used during combat operations in iraq. I served as a medic for a scout/sniper recon platoon; the paint on the weapons serves two main purposes. 1) an all black weapon allows someone to use the black weapon slung across your body as a perfect measurement reference for range estimation. 2) basic camouflage purposes, a painted weapon blends better in the environment, essentially makes it harder for the enemy to acquire you in their optic as a potential target.

Nothing fancy about this Bushmaster - Yes it is the polymer lower, which as you all know is ultralight. Makes a great racnh/back packing rifle, something you dont mind actually carrying around. I have never had a misfire or jam with this weapon( have always used good mags and brass ammo) and it has been cleaned after every use. I have the EOTech clone sighted in @ 50 yards and it puts rounds on target. Defintely not a LaRue or LWRC AR, but its fun to shoot and hits targets.
