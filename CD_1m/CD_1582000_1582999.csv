SUB-2000


The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers.

The Glock 17 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the
world's most popular pistol. The Modular Back Strap design lets you
instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size.
The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed,
real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the Glock
dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system.
A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates
left or right-handed operators. The G17 Gen4 also retains the Glock
accessory rail for your attachments.

The P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the
military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250
will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP).
The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the
functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This
allows an immediate change in caliber and size(subcompact, compact and
full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy
and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible
ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating
different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for
each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.
Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally
engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to
expect from Sig Sauer. Now available with either Contrast or SIGLITE Night
Sights.

I recently upgraded everything on the rifle I had this on, it's in overall excellent condition (I'm nice to my toys) and looks cosmetically excellent.

It's pre-drilled! So no fuss for you! (When you get this kit you have to drill your screw holes) I also had to shape it a little with a dremel to allow it to slide past the rivets on my Saiga 7.62x39 but will fit most any AK platform rifle.

Comes with the 6-position collapsible butt stock, the ergo finger groove pistol grip, and the handguard (which never even got mounted, has sat in the bag since I bought it and considered new.)

It's an easy way to lighten your rifle up and add a FOLDING collapsible buttstock, also should mention it will make it look a lot meaner at the same time."

This is a factory built rifle with less than 1k rds through it (probly closer to 700). The upper will come the complete uppper with rail and maybe the spikes dynacomp. I am keeping the sights, rail covers and hand stop. I ran this with a heavy buffer, with the dynacomp on it it shoots extremely soft. Much softer than my buddy's middy. I took it out today and ran 200rds if brass through it with no issues. I also ran some steel cased and had a few ftf (the bolt wouldn't cycle back far enough on a few rds). I believe a lighter buffer and it would run fine of lower pressure rounds but it wasn't a problem for me so I never switched. The upper has a bcm bcg(it will go with the upper unless your bcg is of lesser quality), and a Daniel defense lite 9"" rail. It's a awesome upper but I want something alittle tamer for a home defense rifle (it's a loud little pig). It's a awesome rig

As for trades I looking for the following. (Please no bushmaster, delton, etc)

All trades must be similarly outfitted with rail and comp (unless I am keeping my dynacomp)

First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel.  Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds.  Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about.

The .50 Beowulf is a rifle cartridge developed by Bill Alexander of Alexander Arms for use in a modified AR-15 rifle. The cartridge utilizes a rebated rim, sized to match the rim of the 7.62x39mm and 6.5 mm Grendel rounds. The case body is very similar in dimensions to the .500 S&W Magnum revolver cartridge, being slightly longer and fully tapered for automatic feeding in the weapon.

The cartridge has its lineage in the .50 Action Express, a cartridge originally developed for the Magnum Research Desert Eagle pistol, with significant modification to improve functionality and safety in the AR-15 platform. 

The round is intended to improve stopping power greatly at short- to medium-range as compared to the standard 5.56×45mm NATO round. One of its advertised uses is at vehicle checkpoints, since the heavy bullet's flight path is not easily deflected by auto glass or standard vehicle body panels."

This rifle was purchased by me brand new in October of 2012. The rifle has about 200-250 rounds through it since that time (brass only). 

I have always kept the rifle clean and also cleaned it right after firing. Notice that my price is not inflated, please don't purchase one of these for more then 1000 you are getting ripped off. 

Included in the 850 is of course the rifle, 4 30 round magazines and the sight. This is not the less the perfect bushnell trophy that is typically sold with the C15, it's a much better red dot. Costs around $180. Therefore with that and the magazines I think 850 is a fair price.

No trades, no checks, no money orders, cash only.

Thanks."

It's not an exaggeration to say the Prescott Az. made Ruger P95 is one of the sturdiest, most reliable and just plain durable handguns ever made. It's not the slimmest or trimmest pistol in the safe, but what the gun lacks in sheer polish it makes up for with an arguably unmatched combination of nuke-proof design and genuine reliability.

MODArmory iPhone AN/PVS-14 Night Vision Adapter 

Machined Anodized aluminum

Made in USA

MOD Armory now stocks a low-cost iPhone adapter that attaches the iPhone 4, 4s & 5 to PVS-14 night vision monoculars with screw-in eyecup flanges for still and video photography. This slip-in adapter safely and securely holds the iPhone in place behind the PVS-14 ocular, aligning the camera precisely and providing maximum field of view and zoom capability for the camera.  A jam-nut clamps against the ocular flange to hold the phone in any orientation relative to the PVS-14’s mounting plate. This permits vertical and horizontal frame orientations when the PVS-14 is used on a tripod or weapons mount.  Priced at $99.95, MOD Armory’s adapter is a simple, low-cost alternative.  



Coming soon, adapters for mounting this to the ANVIS, PVS-15/18 and thermal scopes including the M18 & MTM."

This rifle was purchased by me brand new in October of 2012. The rifle has about 200-250 rounds through it since that time (brass only).

I have always kept the rifle clean and also cleaned it right after firing. Notice that my price is not inflated, stop getting ripped off by people trying to sell you a C15 for more then $1000. This rifle MSRP's around 700-900.

Included in the 850 is of course the rifle, 4 30 round magazines and the sight. This is not the less the perfect bushnell trophy that is typically sold with the C15, it's a much better red dot. With it I can easily hold decent groupings at 100 yards. Costs around $180. Therefore with that and the magazines I think 850 is a fair price.

Magnum Research makes BIG handguns, and the BFR series of revolvers is no exception. The original BFR .45 Colt/.410 features a 7.5” barrel fitted with a removable choke, BUT this version totes 13.5” to make even the boldest blush. To make the latest version of the BFR a little handier, the Hammer has been fitted with a 5.25” un-choked barrel. Built with the same materials and processes used for BFR’s chambered with hot magnum loads like the .500 S&W Mag. and .450 Marlin, this revolver can easily digest any factory .45 Colt, 2.5 or 3” .410 shell you would care to feed it.

The P250, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers;(9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. It's modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""to hell and back"" reliability you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."
