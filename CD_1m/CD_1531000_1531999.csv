The 226 is chambered in 9mm. The bore is shiny and clean with good rifling. The finish is in very good condition and mechanically it is perfect. This is the classic 226 frame with no rail stamped made in Germany. 

Since acquiring the P226 I've installed the factory SIG short reset trigger (SRT), and the updated hammer spring strut and spring assembly. I also installed an 18lb main spring. I haven't had any issues with light primer strikes and the trigger pull is phenomenal. Getting redundant, but I also updated the trigger bar spring to the new style. This required new grips and I installed hogue finger groove grips. They are awesome for my hands, but if you have smaller hands you will want to get thinner grips.  It has factory battle sights (not night sights). I cannot recall the terminology for the type of sights, but it has a single bar in the middle of the rear sight. 

I've completely stripped this firearm multiple times to thoroughly clean the frame and all of the internal components. I polished the feed ramp on the barrel to smooth out feeding. The only thing I would do to this 226 to make it absolutely PERFECT is install a nicer set of sights.

Included with the P226 will be 2 15rd SIG magazines, and 3 18rd MecGar magazines. MecGar is a factory magazine supplier for SIG and they are arguably better quality than the original 15 rounders.

The second firearm for trade is a P229. This handgun will include barrels chambered in both 40SW and .357SIG. Both bores are bright and clean with good rifling. I've never fired a round through the .357SIG barrel but it does appear used. This SIG is also a classic frame design with no rail. The finish on this pistol is also very good.

The P229 has not received any of the updates that the P226 has, but I'd be happy to help a buyer complete the updates.

With the P229 5 magazines will be included. 1 SIG 10rd mag, 1 SIG 12rd mag, and 3 15rd MecGar magazines.

As far as trades go I'd be interested in hearing what you have to offer. I may also consider cash sales.

I have ammo in both 9mm and 40SW that I might be willing to part with for the right deal.

Make an offer!

This is a package deal battle rifle and ammo with an extra metric 20 round magazine.  You cannot visit your local gun store and pick one of these off the rack like you can with AR’s and AK’s.  This is a true 7.62x51 battle rifle that is proven.  Here is your chance to own something different. I have owned this rifle for at least 10 years now and have fired it very little.

This is not a Century Arms or other cheap wannabe FAL’s. This has a true flash hider and bayonet lug.

Low serial number Argentina receiver marked SAC Lattica and it is on the outside of the 
receiver, so it is a pre 1986 import.

It has an L1A1 (Australia, Britain, Canada) front end on it.  It takes European (metric FAL) magazines.  The entire upper, lower, and bolt/carrier interchange between the commonwealth, European, and Israeli FALs, just not the parts within them.

I am including 460 rounds of 7.62 M80 NATO ball manufactured in 08. This is not the cheap stuff or old dated foreign ammo that is being sold commonly.  I will include approximately 50 rounds of M62 tracer (PMJ 08 NATO) not pictured.

At this time I will not separate ammo and rifle unless I have a buyer for each.  I am in no hurry to sell but because I have found another firearm of interest I will test the waters and post it.  My asking price is not a price gouge, the panic buy and sell is finally over.  I could have easily sold this for $3000, during panic mode, but during that time I wasn’t interested in selling it.  To me it’s about the gun that suites my needs at any given time, not selling when I can to make a profit. 

Thanks for looking and please be an Ohio resident and legally allowed to own firearms.  I will not ship and look forward to a face to face deal."

During the Second World War and the early Cold War, the 7.62×25mm Tokarev was the standard automatic pistol round for the Soviet Union and its satellites in Eastern Europe. This ammunition is still in use by many of these countries today. During the war the Red army had found a few shortcomings of its 7.62mm TT-33 pistol, one of which was a tendency to inadvertently drop its magazine while in operation. The army wanted something that was lighter, with a heel release instead of a button and different ammunition. A direct blowback design was chosen for the pistol's operation, since it would be quick and cheap to manufacture, as well as accurate, due to the fixed barrel design allowed by direct blowback operation.

The 9×18mm Makarov round was designed by B.V. Semin in 1946, and was intended to be a relatively powerful round with modest bolt thrust that could function safely in a simple or direct blowback pistol. It was based on the 9×18mm Ultra cartridge which was developed in 1936 by Gustav Genschow & Co. for the German Luftwaffe, as a more powerful alternative to the 9×17mm used in the Walther PP, also a simple blowback design pistol. Nikolay Fyodorovich Makarov went on to design the Makarov PM pistol around the 9×18mm Makarov round in 1948.

The Soviet military required that their ammunition should be incompatible with NATO firearms, so that in the event of armed conflict a foreign power would be unable to use captured Soviet ammunition supplies. 9×18mm Makarov ammunition uses a larger diameter bullet than other common 9  mm rounds. Indeed 9 mm Parabellum is 9.017 mm (0.355 inches), however 9×18mm Makarov rounds are loaded with bullets measuring 9.27 mm (0.365 in). After its introduction in 1951, the 9×18mm Makarov round spread throughout the militaries of Eastern Bloc nations."

California: Anti-Gun Bills to be Heard in Senate Appropriations Committee THIS MONDAY, April 29TH . The state Senate Appropriations Committee is scheduled to hear several anti-gun bills.  Senate Bill 108 (Yee) requires mandatory locked storage of firearms within a locked house regardless of whether anyone is present. Senate Bill 293 (DeSaulnier) BANS the sale of conventional handguns, if the state Department of Justice approves the sale of “Owner Authorized – Smart” handgun technology. Senate Bill 299 (DeSaulnier) turns victims of firearm theft into criminals for failing to report the loss of their firearm within 48 hours. Senate Bill 475 (Leno) requires the prior approval of the board of supervisors of both the County of San Mateo and the City and County of San Francisco to allow a gun show at the Cow Palace. After they approve these gun laws they will start the next round including an Assault weapon ban. Obama To Ban Importation of Ammo, Magazines and Accessories Without Congressional Approval April 23, 2013
President Obama was quietly working behind the scenes, Presidential Executive Action, a strategy that, once again, bypasses Congressional oversight and the legislative process. “The Importation of Defense Articles and Defense Services — U.S. Munitions Import List references executive orders, with the stroke a of a pen and without the consent of Congress, ATF bureaucrats could make ANY gun part or accessory (including magazines) or ammunition that were originally manufactured or perhaps even those designed for military use no longer legal for importation for civilian use. That might mean no more milsurp parts sets. No more milsurp magazines. No more milsurp ammo. No more milsurp optics. Perhaps not even spare firing pins. This could be ugly. I strongly recommend that you stock up on AK-47's, ammunition and spare parts for any of your imported military pattern guns, as soon as possible! Once an import ban is implemented, prices will skyrocket."

For all the folks that keep asking me to ship, shipping is a real pain.  In just about every instance I will decline to do so unless it's a large order.  Keeping things simple is how I like to operate.  I'm not trying to diss out-of-towners, I simply am doing plenty of easier business locally.

Public awareness plug :

Hagglers need not apply. Comb the net or better yet visit your lgs if you think there is a readily available and better deal out there. Unlike many I actually have a use and need well beyond this amount of ammo. If it doesn't sell within a hair's breadth of what I'm asking, that means it won't sell at all and I'll be putting it to personal use.

For all those whom naively (and rather loudly and quite immaturely) claim that the ammo shortage is all over now, I would ask that they provide actual proof to validate their completely bogus and tiredly repeated claims. At the very best we are looking at another 6 months to possibly even more than a year of this. Blame your government that you voted for (on both sides)... not shooters whom were more responsible for themselves going into this... then you were.  I neither take hand-outs nor do I provide them.

Senate Bill 293 (DeSaulnier) BANS the sale of conventional handguns, if the state Department of Justice approves the sale of “Owner Authorized – Smart” handgun technology. Senate Bill 299 (DeSaulnier) turns victims of firearm theft into criminals for failing to report the loss of their firearm within 48 hours. Senate Bill 475 (Leno) requires the prior approval of the board of supervisors of both the County of San Mateo and the City and County of San Francisco to allow a gun show at the Cow Palace. After they approve these gun laws they will start the next round including an Assault weapon ban. Obama To Ban Importation of Ammo, Magazines and Accessories Without Congressional Approval April 23, 2013
President Obama was quietly working behind the scenes, Presidential Executive Action, a strategy that, once again, bypasses Congressional oversight and the legislative process. “The Importation of Defense Articles and Defense Services — U.S. Munitions Import List references executive orders, with the stroke a of a pen and without the consent of Congress, ATF bureaucrats could make ANY gun part or accessory (including magazines) or ammunition that were originally manufactured or perhaps even those designed for military use no longer legal for importation for civilian use. That might mean no more milsurp parts sets. No more milsurp magazines. No more milsurp ammo. No more milsurp optics. Perhaps not even spare firing pins. This could be ugly. I strongly recommend that you stock up on AK-47's, ammunition and spare parts for any of your imported military pattern guns, as soon as possible! Once an import ban is implemented, prices will skyrocket. BUY IT NOW BEFORE YOU CAN'T."

This scope kit is specifically designed to fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

Leave the power set on 2x or 3x in the field and you’re ready for close-in, fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For long shots at smaller targets, turn the power ring up to the full 6X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is a great combination of a lightweight mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.

Night sights come standard as well, and it will come with two 8 round magazines and the plastic Sig case it came with.

I've put around 300 rounds through it with no problems. I've read bad things about the 8 round mags that it came with, but mine didn't seem to have any issues. I don't really shoot it that often, so I figured I'd see if I could trade for a new gun.  

I'm really interested in a large frame revolver chambered in .454 (raging bull, super redhawk, etc.), or something nice chambered in .22lr plus cash.

 Also interested in higher end knives, such as Microtech, Benchmade, Spyderco, ZT; limited runs from either of those companies always get my attention.  

If you have something you want to trade let me know, I'm kind of just seeing whats out there, but I'm very interested in the things listed above. I have around 400 rounds of .45 acp I'll throw in for the right deal. Shoot me an offer if you're interested and I'll get back to you. Thanks"

M952V
The M952V Millennium® Universal WeaponLight attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever™ rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. It utilizes one sealed LED unit to produce both brilliant white light and invisible infrared radiation for use with night vision devices. The white beam is configured for close- to medium-range applications. Changing back and forth from white output to infrared output is accomplished by a push/twist action on the M952V head, which self-locks into the selected output mode. The tailcap switch assembly features a momentary/constant-on pushbutton switch and a momentary-on tape switch (7-inch cable) that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Available in Black and Desert Tan.

Custom Star Model B 9mm Luger Pistol-Exactly Like The One in Pulp Fiction.
Hitman Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) carries a 9mm Star Model B throughout the film. Some audiences have been confused due to the Model B's visual similarity to the .45 ACP M1911 (like Vincent's Auto-Ordnance M1911A1) and some movie critics have (wrongly) listed Jule's reference to his gun as ""Mr. 9mm"" as a goof, but as the Star Model B is a 9mm gun, it is not a mistake.. Almost identical design to the 1911. Includes 1-8rd magazine.

1) Retails for about $30, but I'll take $15-20 in cash or $20 worth of .45acp, M2 Ball (Garand food), or 9mm.

2) Not really looking to make a killing on these since I was given them. I'll take offers in ammunition. .45acp, 9mm, M2 Ball (Garand food).

3) $10? Looking mainly for some .45acp, 9mm, or M2 Ball (Garand food)

4) This M-10 Garand cleaning kit rand me about $30 after shipping. Since I accidentally bought two, I'd like to get close to what I paid but I'll sell for $25?

5) I currently have this bolt listed for $75 shipped on the CMP forum and I was told by a lot of members that it's a very reasonable price. I paid $85 for the bolt that I currently have on my rifle to complete it, so I guess the price seems fair to me. 

6) It's used, I used this in Iraq and Afghanistan. I went to turn in my weapon with it on it, my armorer told me to keep it. I've seen them go anywhere from $40-$80, but I wouldn't mind getting either $30 or some M2 Ball (Garand food).

7) I'll take $25 for this holster. It's nice, works great, and is pretty much the standard for a Beretta 92FS.

8) These retailed for over $80, but I'll take $25-$30 for it. I would love to get some M2 Ball (Garand food) for it."

A common problem with the Ruger carbine in tube fed, rotary magazine fed and lever action is the trigger guard assembly housing cracking at the front preventing the rifle from firing properly and safely. The trigger guard assembly housing is no longer available. (Ruger no longer sells the part, and the major parts houses do not have this part. If yours is broken you will not be able to find this part unless you buy another gun and take the assembly apart from another working gun. ( not an ecomomical way to try and fix a rifle.) Ruger recommends that if you find a part that you are going to take from another working gun that it needs to be fitted for the gun you're intending to fix by a qualified gunsmith. If yours is broken, you are left with a decorative 'non-– functional wall hanger' that you will not be able to use---------------- or you can sell the rifle as a parts rifle to me and use the cash that would not otherwise be available to you to help replace it with something that works.

If your trigger guard assembly is broken and you are interested in selling the rifle out for parts I would be interested in purchasing your rifle as a parts rifle. There are other parts, not the trigger guard assembly, that I need. If you observe that your trigger guard assembly is loose and wants to drop down partly out of the underside of the stock ahead of the trigger where the bullets feed into the rifle and the bolt action wants to lock up when this happens, then your trigger guard assembly is broken. You can verify this by contacting a gunsmith at your nearest Gander Mountain or by contacting Ruger Customer Service Department directly. (www.ruger.com or REDACTED).  They will verify that this part is no longer made, not readily available through gun parts supply stores and in a broken condition renders your rifle nonfunctional.

If you are located in Wisconsin we can likely arrange a safe mutually agreed upon in-person pickup point. If you are located out of the state of Wisconsin I would arrange to have you take your rifle to a gun shop within 30 min. of your home and upon transferring your rifle to the gun shop they will give you our agreed-upon cash price right at that time. You walk into the gun shop, hand the clerk the rifle, he pays you cash on the spot. The sale of your broken rifle is done at a safe location and you get paid right away. I would pay for the shipping cost and FFL transfer cost that would be required. In this way the rifle is also being transferred where I would be required to submit to a background check. This would ensure you that your rifle, even though broken, is being sold to someone who can legally own a firearm. If you have a Ruger carbine that you are interested in selling me please e-mail me or call me and I will share with you my contact information and work out a mutually agreed-upon purchase price and the name and address of the Gun Store nearest your home that will receive the rifle and pay you cash. The sale and transfer will take you the time it takes to drive to the gun shop, hand the clerk the rifle, receive your cash and drive home.

Excerpt from Benelli's website:

""Now the same Benelli M4 used by the U.S. Marine Corps can be your home defense shotgun of choice. When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a shotgun, they bought the M4 — the 12-gauge shotgun that functions the first time, every time. Its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operated (A.R.G.O.) system developed by Benelli engineers has dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber that operate directly against the bolt assembly. This particular shotgun is listed for a MSRP of $1899 on the Benelli website. It weighs 7.8lbs and is 40"" in total length.

The M4 Tactical comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a fully adjustable ghost-ring rear sight and fixed-blade front sight and a black synthetic pistol-grip style stock. An optional standard stock is offered. With features and reliability that do it for the U.S. military, the Benelli M4 is an excellent choice for your own home defense plan."""

KSG
The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
