Now here's the skinny, When I got this rifle the stock was in TWO pieces and the barrel had heavy surface rust on it, but the bore was still in great shape. All of this was due to a woman's scorn.  I repaired the stock, filled sanded and painted it. The stock is really strong it won't break easily from the repair.  I took the barrel and receiver down to bare metal and primed and painted all metal parts with ceramic paint (tough stuff). The paint is also baked on.  It rifle looks pretty darn good if I say so myself. And shoots EXCELLENT as all Model 60's do. This is a great beat around rifle. It functioned flawlessly for me with Winchester 333 bulk ammo. This rifle has the 18 round magazine tube. I'm letting it go for cheap.  70 Bucks FIRM!"

We are not looking for junkies, druggies, felons, anarchists, hippies, drunks, or tactifools.
Just because you saw an episode of doomsday preppers, doesn't mean you are a survivalist.
We are not looking for out of shape, obese, keyboard commandos.

What we are looking for.
Must be 18 or older.
Healthy, fit individuals who are able to train.
Those who know and understand OPSEC.
Former Military or LE a plus, but not necessary.
People with a relevant skill set.
People with morals.
People who believe in the US Constitution!

So what do we do? We train in prepping/self sufficiency, first aid, marksmanship (Airsoft and live fire drills), bug out drills, disaster response drills (community service/defense).

I have only had this piece for about 9 months now I am the first owner I purchased it from the American Historical Foundation in Ashland, Virginia. I honestly regret selling it b/c there are only 1000 of these world wide. I have number 986 I barley made the chance to owning this fine pistol. Of course this is a working firing firearm and it has never been fired before neither handled with humans hands unless with lab gloves were worn first. I honestly never had to handle it anyways until I decided that I have to list it so its only been handled by me with the lab gloves on. Some of the neat features in this pistol are: its a 1911 style, it has real rattlesnake skin grips, its 24 karat Gold in several areas, its displayed in both factory hard colt case and a walnut glass display case with a key to lock the case, its got the Colt Legacy Emblem embedded in the grips, its the colt legacy edition, its got all factory paperwork and documentation/ certificate of authenticity, it also has the factory lock, silicon cleaning towel, white lab gloves, regular factory black rubber grips, and the factory traveling bag used only for traveling and not storing the pistol for a long period of time. This pistol is absolutely beautiful a must have for colt collectors or any collector, you don't find these for sale everyday. Whoever has one of these pistols most likely has it stored away in their safe to past down the family generation, I obviously cant do that I wish I could but I have to move away. I honestly have not seen one of these sold before yet, so they are really hard to come by, but here's your chance to own one now. Enough said the pictures will do the rest of the talking for me and you decide. Definitely bid with confidence on this one, this pistol will always hold its value and rise over the years pass by. I will guarantee you wont find one like the condition this one is in. This is factory new and I am the original owner. Its been a safe queen since the day I bought it. For all bidders please know your state and local laws for owning this piece. This is considered a pistol so legal age is 21."

I have only had this piece for about 9 months now I am the first owner I purchased it from the American Historical Foundation in Ashland, Virginia. I honestly regret selling it b/c there are only 1000 of these world wide. I have number 986 I barley made the chance to owning this fine pistol. Of course this is a working firing firearm and it has never been fired before neither handled with humans hands unless with lab gloves were worn first. I honestly never had to handle it anyways until I decided that I have to list it so its only been handled by me with the lab gloves on. Some of the neat features in this pistol are: its a 1911 style, it has real rattlesnake skin grips, its 24 karat Gold in several areas, its displayed in both factory hard colt case and a walnut glass display case with a key to lock the case, its got the Colt Legacy Emblem embedded in the grips, its the colt legacy edition, its got all factory paperwork and documentation/ certificate of authenticity, it also has the factory lock, silicon cleaning towel, white lab gloves, regular factory black rubber grips, and the factory traveling bag used only for traveling and not storing the pistol for a long period of time. This pistol is absolutely beautiful a must have for colt collectors or any collector, you don't find these for sale everyday. Whoever has one of these pistols most likely has it stored away in their safe to past down the family generation, I obviously cant do that I wish I could but I have to move away. I honestly have not seen one of these sold before yet, so they are really hard to come by, but here's your chance to own one now. Enough said the pictures will do the rest of the talking for me and you decide. Definitely bid with confidence on this one, this pistol will always hold its value and rise over the years pass by. I will guarantee you wont find one like the condition this one is in. This is factory new and I am the original owner. Its been a safe queen since the day I bought it. For all bidders please know your state and local laws for owning this piece. This is considered a pistol so legal age is 21."

Leupold  scope base and rings. The rifle is new and unfired, never even loaded the rifle. The scope is a Bushnell  3x9 varible with 40mm objective lens. The scope is used but in very nice condition with clear optics. I have the box, gun lock and paperwork which came with the rifle when I purchased it new. I am the only person to have owned this rifle. I also have six  boxes of factory ammo, three boxes are Winchester, two boxes are Federal and one box is Remington. The reason I am selling this is because I have found a Howa M1500 which I just have to have and the wife sez one must go before another can come home. $600.00 for gun/scope/ammo.  Had a Guy ""INFORM"" me I was asking too much, because he can get one at Cableas with a Simmons scope for $519.00......well yes you can, but you have to drive there, pay sales taxes and complete a ATF form, not to mention standing in line with a bunch of rude knotheads. And you'r not getting Leupold scope base and rings. And Cabelas is not going to include six boxes of ammo with it either. I calculate, $480.00 for the gun/scope/and rings and $20.00 box for the ammo for $120.00. Might be open to a trade, but only for another firearm."

I have only had this piece for about 9 months now I am the first owner I purchased it from the American Historical Foundation in Ashland, Virginia. I honestly regret selling it b/c there are only 1000 of these world wide. I have number 986 I barley made the chance to owning this fine pistol. Of course this is a working firing firearm and it has never been fired before neither handled with humans hands unless with lab gloves were worn first. I honestly never had to handle it anyways until I decided that I have to list it so its only been handled by me with the lab gloves on. Some of the neat features in this pistol are: its a 1911 style, it has real rattlesnake skin grips, its 24 karat Gold in several areas, its displayed in both factory hard colt case and a walnut glass display case with a key to lock the case, its got the Colt Legacy Emblem embedded in the grips, its the colt legacy edition, its got all factory paperwork and documentation/ certificate of authenticity, it also has the factory lock, silicon cleaning towel, white lab gloves, regular factory black rubber grips, and the factory traveling bag used only for traveling and not storing the pistol for a long period of time. This pistol is absolutely beautiful a must have for colt collectors or any collector, you don't find these for sale everyday. Whoever has one of these pistols most likely has it stored away in their safe to past down the family generation, I obviously cant do that I wish I could but I have to move away. I honestly have not seen one of these sold before yet, so they are really hard to come by, but here's your chance to own one now. Enough said the pictures will do the rest of the talking for me and you decide. Definitely bid with confidence on this one, this pistol will always hold its value and rise over the years pass by. I will guarantee you wont find one like the condition this one is in. This is factory new and I am the original owner. Its been a safe queen since the day I bought it. For all bidders please know your state and local laws for owning this piece. This is considered a pistol so legal age is 21."
