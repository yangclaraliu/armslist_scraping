Working with our newly formed 3-Gun shooting team, Team Stag Arms, we have determined the features and configuration that will have the broadest appeal and use in competition. With this rifle, competitors are able to produce fast and accurate shots from close to long range as is needed in 3-Gun competitions. Boasting an 18” stainless steel fluted heavy barrel with a rifle length gas system and the new Stag Arms 3G compensator; recoil impulse is greatly reduced allowing for fast follow up shots. Aiding in accuracy is the Samson Evolution handguard, which is free floating and modular, allowing the attachment of rail sections or sling mounts along the handguard. This also grants the shooter the ability to mount accessories as needed but not be burdened with a full quad rail. The trigger is a Geissele Super 3-Gun trigger, which was specifically developed for 3-Gun competitions, as the name implies. It possesses a great reputation for durability and has what Geissele calls a hybrid pull. This hybrid pull is a unique combination of a single and two-stage that allows for both quick close range shots and more deliberate long range shots. The buttstock and pistol grip are from Magpul featuring their collapsible ACS buttstock that provides a comfortable cheek weld along with storage and their MOE pistol grip that provides a solid and secure grip. The rifle also is available with optional Dueck Defense Rapid Transition Sights (RTS) which are offset iron sights that are used for close in shots. Specifications: 18” stainless steel fluted heavy barrel with a rifle length gas system, 5.56 NATO chamber, and 1/8 twist rate.

Also included is a surplus Chinese stock, in far better condition that the original stock that is currently used.  This replacement stock is designed for a spiker bayonet, as opposed to the blade bayonet featured on this rifle.  However, the quality of wood is much better.  It is worth noting that the cross bolt on the replacement stock was turned ever so slightly, resulting in a small piece of wood splintering off.  I do not believe that this will impact the functionality of the replacement stock, and for this reason, the package price is such that the replacement stock is being included for minimal to no cost.  The price is $425, cash only -- do not send trade offers.  

The image included here is a stock photo, but reasonably represents what to expect (I do not own the rights to this photo, and will take it down at the polite request of the owner).  Keep in mind that this is a surplus rifle, and the original stock has gouge/scratch/finish-flaking all over it.  It is still caked in cosmoline, and the orignal stock does have a significant amount of finish flaking (hence the inclusion of the replacement stock for those concerned with cosmetic appearance).  Please keep in mind that this rifle is cross-posted, and for sale locally.  In the event it sells before acceptance from an Armslist user, I will politely notify you that it is no longer available.

Please use the Armslist 'Contact Seller' feature to email me. Terms are 'as is', with no implied or expressed warranty of any sort. I will not ship this rifle, and I will not sell to an individual with a Chicago address. Buyer will receive a duplicate Bill of Sale, and must have a valid FOID card. All applicable firearm ownership laws apply to this sale, and a 3 day wait period will be required (I realize long-guns require only 1 day, but I prefer to be overly cautious). Actual transfer will take place in Aurora, IL. Cash only -- any offer with different payment terms will not be entertained, and user will be reported to Armslist as a potential scam account."

Is also tapped for scope mount. Has had very, very few rounds through it and has sat in the closet a lot. Comes with factory box and instruction manual, 2 10 round factory magazines (the most reliable magazines). It's pretty easy to switch between the 2 stocks. I bought the Choate folding stock because it's rock solid when unfolded, the best of the folders in stability. When folded, the rifle is just over 2 feet long (27""), which would make it an excellent choice to stow in a backpack or small space, or as a survival weapon. $420 FIRM, no trades at this time."
