Many young men and women, on the occasion of becoming an adult, receive a .22 rifle, as a symbol of trust, maturity and their American heritage – and many other shooters, young or old, buy a Ruger 10/22 as their first rifle. Many elect to enhance the utility of this lightweight 22 rifle by adding a quality scope. 

Compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles. The eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of many full size scopes, but because of their short length they have to be mounted further back on the receiver to maintain proper eye relief. 

We have a Picatinny rail top mount for the Ruger 10/22 rifle that mounts further back on the receiver to accommodate mini-scopes in obtaining a full field of view. This four power scope, with it’s Range Finder reticle, can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This mini-scope kit is an economical and functional accessory for Ruger 10/22 rifles and especially for the Ruger Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled and stored.

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories (carry Handle NOT Included).
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification
- 1 magazine is standard.
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation

So far this week I have seen articles about Obama trying to violate our Constitutional rights as American Citizens (and non-citizens concerning free speech, freedom of religion etc) including a bill to eliminate Christianity and Judeaism in the military, our right to free press being used as evidence of terroristic activity, and of course trying to take our right to bear arms by ensuring us he has our best interest at heart. I find all of this, combined with his socialized health care scheme, to have a disturbingly familiarity to it. I have seen this before,not here, but in Germany, the USSR, Cambodia, China, Sudan, and every other country that was disarmed by it's government. What follows that disarmament of the populous seems to follow a pattern..oh right, genocide. If we do not stand and fight for our rights we are doomed to see history repeat itself. And where is this man? Who thinks he is above the God given rights of every American citizen? He's in Mexico, negotiating terms to seal the border. Now, I have strong views about immigration reform, but I came to an eerie realization today. If keeping illegals out hasn't been at the top of the list for the past 25 years, why is it suddenly so important that we have an inpregniable border to the south? I can't seem to stop thinking maybe he isn't really trying to keep anyone out. Maybe he is trying to keep something in. I seem to recall a similar wall in a different country, torn down in my short 26 years by a couple of men named Ronald Regan and Mr. Gorbichov. My fellow Americans, I implore you, let us show our strength in numbers. In every state, in every city, in 
every town, please, protest. Tell Obama you will not be getting on the train today or any 
other day. Tell him ""NEVER AGAIN"". Our forefathers did not wish for us to stand idly by and let everything they ought"

NOT $275 FOR ALL THREE OF THEM!!! Mossberg 22lr rifles. I have 3 all together. I have one model 151 and one model 152 one model 46M. All three are in excellent condition.I dig them out of my safe and in better conditions than I remembered. The 152 has the fold down handle made into the stock. It also has factory peep site on it. Also has leather slings on two of them. Two of them have Scopes mounted. I found two other old Scopes in my storage unit. Not sure what they go to, maybe my old Mauser rifles. They are so nice would probably have to go to museum to find nicer ones. The 46M is bolt action, the other two semiautomatics, tube fed through the stock. Older models made in the 50's great fun guns to shoot. I think I have two old scopes to go with them. They are in the safe and didn't dig out to take pictures yet. If someone is seriously interested can take pictures. Please give me a call or text.  Just updating this since yesterday. Thank you

I bought the gun for my wife, but the thing is built like a tank, slide/mag release require reasonable force; nothing for a normal man, but an inconvenient struggle for a woman with small hands. Currently has a lesser powered recoil spring to ease the power needed to chamber a round, but have the original. 

Gun shows average average wear. Been my regular shooter, but cleaned and maintained religiously. In all honesty, it is the most accurate gun I've ever shot. Fixed barrel. Completely reliable. Had one jam in approximately 500 shots, and that was caused by warped soft-tipped hollow point. Gun is solid metal, but small enough to carry if that was the desire."

The new Stag Arms Model 8T comes with a 16-inch, chrome-lined barrel with a one-in-nine-inch rate of twist. This is a side piston design, different from ARs with a standard buffer tube design. They tend to run cooler and cleaner, and most of the parts are still interchangeable. One of the most striking features about the carbine is the use of the Diamondhead VRS-T free-floating handguard, which has a solid rail atop, but relatively smooth sides and bottom. So instead of Stag Arms adding unwanted weight to the rifle, the company smartly decided shooters can decide if any rails needed to be attached, and precisely where. Unlike most offerings from Stag, the 8T employs a short-stroke piston system. Carrier tilt is minimized by the use of pads on the rear of the bolt and it comes with Diamondhead flip-up sights."

Because this shotgun is so small you can mount a front grip or possibly a flashlight for home defense. The wood furniture is in perfect condition, recently refinished. The finish on the metal is in great condition with minor wear.

This 92fs was manufactured in 2012 based on its serial number.  It has about  500 rounds through it.  I am the first owner, and it has been cleaned after every range visit.

It has a metal, singled sided, low-profile safety, with custom cover on one side as seen in the 3rd picture.  You can overhand rack this beretta without worry about engaging the safety.  It took me a while to track down the parts to set up the safety this way, and the single sided cap can no longer be purchased.

The original safety is also included.  A set of hogue grips are included extra as well.  Comes with the original case, 2 oem beretta mags, and child lock as well.

Inox means the slide, and barrel are made of stainless steel.  Frame is alloy.

Sure, it’s not a “real” rifle, but it’s going to be easier to hit your target with a pistol caliber carbine than a true pistol."

Double Barrel Couch Gun. 
This shotgun has a 20 inch barrel. The stock has been chopped to a pistol grip. It has been professionally done and custom carved to fit right into your hand. If you have ever done one you know it's challenging and time consuming. A picatinny rail has been fit and mounted on the foregrip. Because this shotgun is so small you can mount a front grip or possibly a flashlight for home defense. The wood furniture is in perfect condition, recently refinished. The finish on the metal is in great condition with minor wear. 

This shotgun is just big enough to stay out of class 2. It's overall length is just over 26 inches and has a 20 inch barrel so this is the smallest shotgun you can have without needing a class 2 weapons license. It is a blast to shoot and looks and functions great!

Details

This specially designed weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the MP6920 Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's MP6920 is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, this weapon comes loaded with Magpul MOE accessories.

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.  The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.  This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.
Included: One (1) 30rd Magazine, HK Tool, Instruction Manual, Cable Lock, Factory Case and Warranty

The AR-50A1 National Match is similar to our standard AR-50A1 with some VERY important differences. The AR-50A1 NM is produced from selected components: The National Match’s 33 inch barrel is three inches longer than the standard AR-50A1’s barrel. The barrel has eight flutes. The flutes help with cooling and reduce unnecessary weight while maintaining accuracy-enhancing stiffness. The barrel has a 50 BMG Match chamber instead of a standard military chamber.


ArmaLite has also developed a “Skid System” for the AR-50A1 National Match. It’s meant for serious match use and comes standard, NOT as an expensive add-on. The ArmaLite Skid System provides parallel rests on the rifle that are parallel with the bore of the rifle so when it recoils it will recoil straight back. This has been requested by match shooters, some of whom have made their own. The front skid attaches to the slot in the forestock similar to the way bipod rails are attached. The rear skid attaches to the buttstock. Armalite developed the Skid System without modification to the AR-50A1’s original parts so the system can be used by shooters who already own an AR-50A1 and want to use their original stock with NO MODIFICATIONS.

Looking for more reasons the AR-50A1 NM achieves sub-MOA accuracy? Here they are:

The heart of the rifle is its metallic stock-to-action interface. The patented V-Lock™ Bedding Wedge and V-Block Stock assure absolute strength and repeatability for superb accuracy. The aluminum stock reinforces the receiver like a bench-rest sleeve.

It’s not just the bedding that improves accuracy. Independent testing has proven the AR-50A1 muzzle brake to be the best in the industry for both recoil control and accuracy. It scrapes away turbulent muzzle gasses and lets the bullet break into clean air for amazing accuracy."

3X Magnifier Description: The 3X magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with holographic sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. This magnifier is a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with the included twist to side mount, the magnifier gives the user something never before possible – the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice-versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their sight on their platform. This versatile magnifier also can be used as a handheld magnifying monocular for discrete observation and identification.
The included mount for the magnifier is the twist to side mount, which allows for quick attachment and detachment. The mount fits any MIL-Std Picatinny Rail.
