looking to buy an 870 in 20 gauge, and maybe one in 12 gauge, as well as sig pistols, let me know what you have, bluntly, not going to entertain paying full retail, will buy new if that is all there is, just checking the used market first. May, emphasis, may be interested in other pistols/small bore rifles that are competition styles.

If you want full price, good luck, go try that at Gander or Cabelas, bluntly, Gander looks up the book price then offers you 40%.....so...I am thinking more like 80% of book price....

pics will be required, meeting in public place in Columbus area will be required, Ohio ID will be required, I am willing to sign bills of sale, and show my ID.  

PS if it is new in Vances ad, do not ask me for more than retail...

Description : A pre-ban Chinese Norinco type(MA compliant), I put about 200 rounds through it, was LNIB when I got it. It comes with quite a few accessories and upgrades, a matching bayonet and 4 (pre-ban) mags.


This is a 56s type sidefolder with the original red bakelite furniture; I have installed other furniture but still have the originals.


The stock locks SOLIDLY unlike many AK type folders; the trigger is the double hook type, which provides a much smoother and better trigger pull compared to most other AKs which have a single hook trigger.
Chinese receivers are 1.5mm thick as opposed to most AK receivers which are 1mm thick; chinese barrels are also thicker than standard AK barrels.


Accessories : I replaced the original pistol grip with a red US Palm grip because I found the original to be too small; the texture is not unlike that of a Glock, and there is a small compartment inside it.


The lower handguard was replaced with a black Hogue Overmolded handguard that provides an excellent grip and a heatshield unlike standard and most aftermarket AK handguards.


The dust/topcover was replaced with a TWS Dog-Leg top cover (aluminum) which allows you to mount optics and the like to its picatinny rail and is guaranteed to give you repeatable zero. I also added a Buffer Tech recoil buffer.


Mounted on the TWS topcover is a Vortex SPARC red dot which runs on CR type batteries and has a night vision setting; this is not a full size red dot like an AimpointComp M4, it falls into the category of mini-red dot.

The full kit for the Vortex Sparc is also included, which has a 2x magnifier, multiple risers, spare screws, alan wrenches, a spare CR battery and a lens cleaning cloth.


The bayonet is the Chinese Bakelite type 2, and comes with a slant brake (which I used for display) and a Manticore NightBrake (keeps the muzzle rise and kick down pretty well) which they bayonet will not fit with.

4 (pre-ban) steel mags and 120rds of Brown Bear

Selling Terms : FTF (Must have an LTC A) at a local FFL; I prefer to do any handling/ selling of firearms at an FFL, but as long as you have a valid, up to date LTC A, I can make a private sale.

This DPMS LR-308 SST Heavy Barrel is fully chambered in 260 Remington and ready to install on an upper receiver. The barrel's 20"" Length is great to keep a rifle reasonably maneuverable and lightweight while also producing good velocities in order to benefit from the 260 Remington's superior ballistic characteristics. Whether building a new rifle from scratch, or simply to change calibers in an existing gun, this SST Barrel is an excellent selection and is compatible with any LR-308 based upper receiver. It is constructed of 416 Stainless Steel that's finished with an attractive Black Teflon coating for corrosion protection, and includes a single rail gas block, barrel extension and locator pin. 

NOTE: This is the same barrel used in DPMS LR-260 factory rifles, meaning it will fit other DPMS LR receivers including the LR-243, LR-6.5 Creedmoor, LR-308 and LR-338. Barrel is not compatible with any AR-15 based receiver.

I bought it around 2000. In awesome shape, only a few scuffs on the A2 buttstock.

The Sharp Shooter Laminate Varmint-Target stock is the solution if you need a multi-purpose stock.  The LVT features an ergonomic ambidextrous design for comfort and control, a vertical style pistol grip with palm swell and thumb ramp, and a 2-1/2 inch wide semi-flat beavertail forend that offers the perfect compromise for off-hand and bench shooting.  The parallel geometry from the forend to butt stock toe ensure consistent return to battery on bags, while the optional deep butt hook allows for better hand support when shooting with a bipod.
The basic stock comes with no adjustable amenities, nor the accessory rail or butt hook.  These options are available ONLY on the LVT stock and may not be added to any other stock we offer.

This is one of those rather not sell ads, but I have to sell a few things to pay for a couple really nice new things. This is a Savage F/TR (Target Action w/extra light accutrigger) Barreled Action in .308. The barrel is 30” It has about 400 rounds through it. It is a very accurate combo. I have used one load in it,and never bothered to try anything else since it has shot lights out with RL15, unsorted 168 SMKs, and the same Federal Prepped Match Brass that I started with. I have Lapua brass just sitting on the shelf that I have never even broken out. It is virtually a one ragged hole set up in the F-Class stock I had it in at 100 yards. I have shot right around 1.250 groups at 300 with it a number of times, and I think it is capable of 1” groups. I do not want to separate the barrel from the action. So, preference goes to the person who buys the combo. Shame to break it up. If I do that I will probably keep the barrel for myself. Comes with screws, trigger guard and trigger adjustment tool.

Empty Holster Protest

What is it?

The Empty Holster Protest is SCC’s signature attention-getter. It’s a peaceful demonstration that involves students wearing empty holsters to class, distributing literature, and holding debates or speaking events.

Why?

SCC members are protesting college polices and/or state laws that disarm law-abiding citizens who are legally permitted to carry a concealed firearm in hundreds of other locations in their respective states. Since criminals do not honor rules against firearms, these dangerous policies stack the odds against students and in favor of criminals. The empty holster is a token symbolizing that disarming all law-abiding citizens creates defense-free zone which are attractive targets to a for criminals.

Where?

The Empty Holster Protest has participants all across the nation. Thousands of students across hundreds of universities take part each year.

When?

The protest takes place each spring. This year, the protest will be held Monday, April 8, until Friday, April 12, 2013.

How can I join?

For starters, register your attendance on our Facebook event. You can also go to our state-by-state page and contact a campus leader in your area. If none exists, perhaps you’d like to be the one to start a chapter with your school? Otherwise, contact the Regional Director for information on getting involved.

What if I’ve already graduated?

Send a letter to your alma mater stating that you refuse to send your hard-earned money to an institution that denies its students, faculty and staff the basic right to protect themselves. If you can, donate some of your hard-earned money to SCC – just $5, $10 or $20 can make a difference. You can also write your state representatives if there’s a bill pending in your state, or even contact the local university and explain your views. If you’re not sure how to do any of this, contact us.

I’m a little past my college days.

No problem! If you’re a parent, or know someone in college, let them know there’s a group out there that stands up for their rights. You can always write a letter to your representative, or to your local paper. You can spread the word among other parents, or try to educate faculty, staff and administrators who may be opposed. If you oppose discrimination against concealed carry permit holders on campus, then there’s always a way you can help out.

What about high schools?

Students for Concealed Carry on Campus focuses on college environments where students are adults. We do not address concealed carry in K-12 schools.

If you want concealed carry, why openly carry holsters?

Our end goal is concealed carry on campus for law-abiding citizens. Until that goal is reached, our goal is to raise awareness for our cause. The protest is an extremely effective tool for bringing the discussion of Campus Carry to the forefront, as well as educating people about the issue. It is impossible to raise awareness by wearing hidden objects of any sort."

382,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1423382,For Sale:  To the ammo cry babys,"north, Buffalo, New York",$ 100,"Listed On: Monday, April 8, 2013",Rifles,no type,22 Long Rifle,no type,no type,"How long are you people going to whine about prices?
They are not going down anytime soon. Ammo is back ordered for months.
The big retailers are selling it for .20 cents around and up for .22 lr and it last online for 2 minutes if you are lucky.
Gunbroker prices are .13 cents a round and up plus shipping. Cases of 5000 are hitting $700 plus shipping on there.
Its like everything else no one wants it when its cheap but when it goes up everyone wants it. And you want to bitch about the people that planned ahead?
Take gold for an example in 2005 it was under 600 a oz then it went to 1000/oz then 2000/oz. So someone bought it in 2005 at 600 today its worth around 1600 so the people that invested in it should sell it for 600? I dont think anyone is that stupid. Same thing with stocks and other goods. Are you going to sell your house for less than its worth because someone wants it for half price?
Ammo is going to keep going up. Starting in january 2014 you will have to do a background check to purchase it and your purchase will be put in a state data base.
Do you think a dealer is going to spend time doing a check and not want extra for his time? Not gonna happen.
You wont be able to order online unless it gets shipped to a dealer for a background check. And at $3.80 a gallon for gas are you going to drive out of state to look for ammo? It will cost you more than most prices on here. Unless you live on the boarder and places in PA are already not selling ammo if you are from NY. And they dont have it in stock. The whole east coast is out of stock NY to Florida.
lets face the facts this country is going down the drain. We lose rights everyday by the people some of us voted in. It was all about ""CHANGE"" Yeah the change to a non free socialist country.
I dont like the prices either but Im buying when I can. For a little extra I know I have ammo to protect my family.
What are you going to do when the food supply gets cut off because we dont do what big brother wants? You going to stop looters with a empty gun? You going to stand by and watch criminals take the stuff you earned and assult your wife and children? Possibly die bitching and being stubborn about a few cents more a round?
Most of the sellers here are offering life insurance at a little higher price than normal. Whats the cost of not having it?
Wake up people the america we knew is no longer here. Its only getting worst. If they get the 2nd they will take the rest from us.
Sorry to rant, but the ammo price crying is getting old. If you dont like the prices of the ammo ads dont read them.
PS. If anyone has some CCI 22lr for sale around .15 cents a round send me a email."

If your trade isnt worth the same amount as the FNAR, add cash or another trade to even it out. I am not looking for super duper capacity mags or tons of ammo. The book value on this rifle is $1325. Im not going to pay more for your trade than i can buy it for at my local gun store. Email if u have any questions or a different offer."

As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. We have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead.

The .50 Beowulf was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results.

Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry.

The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal.

Looking for a very specific thing so I'd have to see pictures.

This is an early production all black finish, carbon steel frame and slide and barrel-slide release etc. Plastic grips rather than rubber grips, slanted frame dust cover, sculpted frame around slide release-(introduced around '97-'98). 
Earliest guns had a screw under the slide release and no sculpting, later guns have beefier dust cover and came two-tone either black slide and stainless frame or stainless slide and black frame. 
Used excellent condition(no rust, slide and frame finish excellent but some corner/edge wear, bore excellent)
Front sight slightly deformed corner(dinged) but still very straight and solid and easy to line up.
Unknown number of rounds shot but probably close to 1000 without a single feed or firing issue.

FYI: How it works is we meet at a local FFL certified gun store you look at the gun, if you like it, you can buy it, and you then have to pay the gun store a $35 fee for the tranfer from my name to your name, and anytime you buy a gun whether private party, new or used at a store, etc, you have to pay a $25 background check fee. Then the dealer will hold on to the gun for 10 days while the the background check is completed, then after 10 days you can go back to the gun store and pick up the gun.

This model retails out the door for almost $1k with no scope and stock grip.

Nice revolver has had less than 30 rounds through it and shows like new. 9 1/2 barrel, custom grip, and a Tasco scope. I believe it's sighted in at 65 yards but it's been a while since i've fired it and don't remember.

The luepold scope that is pictured is not the one on the gun. I'll only include it for a nice AR set up or if your trade includes multiple guns. scope cost 500$ so if you offer me a 800-900$  gun you're not getting the scope. Scope is included for a trade value around $1200.00 or 1150 cash in my hand

This might be incorrect, so it is your responsibility to know the laws where you live. While it may seem my price is sort of high, I am not trying to ""gouge"". I really would prefer not to sell it.

I bought it around 2000. In awesome shape, only a few scuffs on the A2 buttstock. The upper has less than 500 rds through it, as not too long after I bought it I put a Bushmaster 11.5""/5.5"" (yeah, I know, but it looks awesome and is fun to shoot! :) ) upper on it and Colt adjustable stock (not marked but it is a Colt stock), which are both also for sale.

Sighted in at 25 yards, and painted it camouflage ( so I can do some practice shooting, hunt rabbits, squirrels and pigeons at the backyard, and not disturb my neighbors: "" OMG, he's holding a gun, call the cops ""
I don't remember how many squirrels, rabbits, and birds I took down. The rifle is extremely accurate ( fixed barrel design, underlever cocking sytem, so the barrel doesn't move at all, not like the break-barrel models, which affects the accuracy and consistency because the barrel would never be the same after shots ),very quiet ( 800FPS  velocity but the sound isn't more than a balloon pop). I have the picture to show, 7 pelllets went through the same hole ( see it yourself ). The reason I'm selling it because my mom doesn't want me to kill those animals, she said it's cruel to take their lives. So, I'm giving up this beast to anybody, who's enjoy to shoot them. It's a perfect solution for practicing at the backyard, hunting, pest control, or teach the young kids how to handle and shoot a rifle. The cost of the bullet ( I mean, pellet ) is so cheap, 500 counts = $3.00. So, it won't break the bank as the real bullets, even  .22lr is so expensive these days.
The rifle is equipped with Centerpoint 3-9x32mm airgun rated scope, The scope is clear , and flawless. ( comes with see-through lens cover ), 400 counts of pellets ( same used with this rifle ), sling mount swivels, rubber butt-stock .
