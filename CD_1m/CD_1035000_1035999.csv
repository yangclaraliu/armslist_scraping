These are BRAND NEW to the market. They are loaded loaded by Fiocchi using Fiocchi brass (and I would assume other components as well) and are branded for Tula (box is marked ""Made in Italy""). Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 2 boxes available (100 rounds total). Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 2 box minimum on orders I have to ship.

I can be reached through the Armslist messaging system, @ REDACTED, or @ REDACTED (please leave a message if I'm unable to answer). No texts please if you can help it, too difficult to try and conduct business via text, so email or phone call if possible.

Only 2 boxes left at this point. Will post back if I'm able to scrounge any more up (sold 19 boxes in about 6 hours today)."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

IMPORTANT NOTE! You must go through an FFL (even if local) which means an additional $30 paid to the FFL for the background check. I do have an FFL in Black Forest that I trust who can do this transfer, or we can use yours if you have one. If you are not local and we are shipping, you must send me your FFL's license information because I can only send to them.


The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

Okc, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","$ 4,699","Listed On: Tuesday, February 12, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a 2003 Honda Shadow ACE Deluxe edition. The bike has approximately 8200 miles on it. I am the original owner of this bike and it has been garage kept all its life. Never been down or wrecked. I have about $10,000 total invested in this bike, I realize obviously it's not worth that, but I believe that my asking price is fair with the equipment on it currently. The pictures below are large please allow them time to load, they are quality pics that show a lot of detail. Ok, here are some of the options this bike has on it. Cobra Drag Pipes w/o baffles. It's loud and sounds like a Harley. Clear turn signal and tail light lenses all the way around, with LED bulbs in each. This bike has been lowered approximately 1"" all around. Mapam forward controls to give a little more relaxed riding position. It has a K&N air filter inside the air box, and Barnett Heavy Duty Clutch springs have been added. The wheels and hubs have been professionally powder-coated black to match the paint, with the spokes being left natural aluminum color. Brand new front & rear Dunlop Wide Whitewalls with less than 2000 miles on them. Also numerous chrome items have been added like switch housings, new wide-style levers, Cobra 2"" pullback risers, riser clamp, master cylinder cover, radiator cover, horn cover, coolant cap cover. This bike currently has the Memphis Shades brand full fairing with the short 5"" black windshield. Memphis Shades Honda Shadow mounting brackets for said fairing. Hogtunes Audio system with handlebar mount for an MP3, or satellite radio receiver. National Cycle Cruiseliner Hard Saddlebags and their respective mounting brackets. These last 3 parts the fairing, Hogtunes system, and the hard bags alone would cost you over $1600 to purchase separately. This bike is only 750CC, but it's very powerful and everyone always mistakes it for at least an 1100CC just looking at it. It's quick off the line and all the way up to 70 and it fits in with the big boys. This is a very well taken care of bike, I would rate it a 9 out of 10. This bike is a great looking bagger, so if you want a nice bike without the big price you owe it to yourself to at least come take a look at this bike. If this ad is still up then the bike is still for sale. I'm not a dealer and i'm not hurting for money but I know what this bike is worth. I respond to all emails promptly as I receive them. Feel free to ask any questions you may have."

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, a Mil-Spec backup iron sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

Ringo had one. Rooster had one. Lucas had one. Josh Randall had part of one. Yes, all of these screen heroes had a Winchester Model 92. Who can ever forget the scene in Stagecoach as John Wayne as Ringo twirls his '92 Winchester to stop the stage. Or perhaps the greatest scene ever in any Western as Rooster Cogburn with a Colt Single Action Army .45 in his left hand and a freshly twirled .44-40 Winchester in his right hand yells ""Fill your hand you sonnavabitch!"" and prepares to meet the Ned Pepper gang single-handedly.

Most of us grew up watching Chuck Connors as The Rifleman twirl his large loop lever Model '92 to cock it and then operate it like a semi- automatic on the streets of North Fork. Steve McQueen, as the bounty hunter Josh Randall in Wanted: Dead or Alive also carried a bastardized Model 92 with a short barrel and shorter stock. The eye-catching loop lever was there along with someone's idea of what the little '92 should carry as ammunition as Randall's belt was filled with .45-70 cartridges that would not even come close to fitting the Model 92.

The Rossi R92 Round Barrel delivers a shorter, lighter version of its big brothers with this 16 inch carbine models.  All R92 Round Barrel models feature crescent buttplates and an extended front sight. 

Excellent for brush hunting and wilderness packing.

I am looking to trade or potentially sell my Beretta 950 Jetfire .25 pistol. While it is used the gun has a low round count and is in great shape both mechanically and cosmetically. I want to trade/sell this gun which I bought for CCW because I recently purchased a Bersa 380 and prefer that for my ccw needs. Regardless this gun makes for a great backup pistol/deep cover ccw gun.

This package includes the pistol, 1 mag, 1 uncle mikes pocket holster, 1 new otis .25 cal bore brush, 72 round of Sellier & Bellot FMJ, about 42 rounds of PPU FMJ, and 33 rounds of Hornady 35gr xtp (the carry ammo i used). 

Trades I will definitely consider are as follow: good Tokarev pistol in 7.62x25 cal, good makarov pistol, other handguns suitable for ccw (preferably not smaller than.380 cal), .357 mag revolver, a good semi auto .22LR pistol (such as a ruger) , a good amount of .223 ammo. I also welcome other cool pistol, rifle, and shotgun trade ideas, feel free to PM me worst thing I can do is give you a polite no thanks. Also interested in a GLOCK 19 (would add $200 to trade).

Sale price is $300 cash, pm me with an offer.

The trade/sale would have to occur in NOVA, preferably somewhere in Arlington. BOS, VA licence, CHP or VA voter card all required.

This is a nice Davis derringer in .32 acp caliber. For safety reasons, they make these with a heavy trigger pull. At 10 feet, the two shots are centered on target with about 4"" of vertical dispersion. At 21' I could keep them in the chest of a standard police target. Beyond that range, I could miss the chest; i.e. this is a close range gun! The .32 has noticable recoil in a gun this small and light; not stout, more like fun. Very much a close range defense gun; a nice backup, or even a backup to your backup. Thank you."

1996 Hot Springs Landmark 7 person hot tub...original and only owner of this hot tub, bought in Tulsa at Fiesta. It is extremely well insulated, currently it's drained, but I think it might need a board or possibly a new heater. It has a cover, but I would recommend replacing the cover at some point as it has absorbed water so it's really heavy, although it looks pretty good and is functional. It has an EZ Lifter, but with the current weight of the cover, I don't recommend using it until the cover is replaced at some point. The siding is Everwood and is in good condition. I can trade as-is or I can have the diagnosis/repair made and trade at a higher value. $1100

The Citori XT Trap is a serious trap gun. We all know that shooting trap is great  fun -- but at the same time it can become serious business. Competition becomes heated and the pressure can be severe. The Citori XT Trap is not guaranteed to score more hits, but this model quickly becomes a natural extension of your arms and shoulder, helping you to get on the target faster, with clean, complete follow-through. It swings easily, deliberately, naturally. With its vented side ribs, ported barrel and high post rib, it immediately becomes your own personal trap gun.

The XT Trap also has a beautifully sculptured Monte Carlo stock that goes beyond good looks by raising your eye level with the rib so you have a bit more of a head up view of the bird -- something that can improve scores and essential in doubles trap.

The comfortable finger grooves along the forearm, three Invector-Plus™ choke tubes and the Triple Trigger™ System, all contribute to the ease of shooting you need to compete and have fun -- without ever having to complain about your shotgun
