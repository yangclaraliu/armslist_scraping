Crucible: CPM S35VN:

CPM S35VN is a martensitic stainless steel designed to offer improved toughness over CPM S30V. It is also easier to machine and polish than CPM S30V. Its chemistry has been rebalanced so that it forms some niobium carbides along with vanadium and chromium carbides. Substituting niobium carbides for some of the vanadium carbides makes CPM S35VN about 15-20% tougher than CPM S30V without any loss of wear resistance. CPM S35VN’s improved toughness gives it better resistance to edge chipping.

Because both vanadium and niobium carbides are harder and more effective than chromium carbides in providing wear resistance, the CPM stainless blade steels offer improved edge retention over conventional high chromium steels such as 440C and D2. The CPM process produces very homogeneous, high quality steel characterized by superior dimensional stability, grindability, and toughness compared to steels produced by conventional melting practices.

ASP Friction Loc 26"" Expandable Baton  (F26B) has proven itself as a virtually indestructible tool that is easily carried and readily available. The Friction Loc Baton is constructed of 4140 seamless steel tubing is not commercially available in the United States. As a result, ASP must have a special chemistry or heat of steel poured in Germany and then pierced into rounds. This raw stock is then drawn by an American company into tubing that is fabricated to ASP specifications. As a result, ASP is the sole source of 4140 steel tubing for expandable batons. ASP 4140 is 25% stronger than more commonly available 4130 tubing. The Friction lock also features a Black Chrome finish which is a state of the art black finish for steel surfaces. It is a true black plating, not a paint. As a result, it is extremely hard and will not scratch. Black Chrome will not rust as do other surface treatments. It is exceptionally durable and does not flake or peel. Black Chrome offers deep, rich, black corrosion protection.

Manufacturer’s description follows:

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

Bravo Company mid-length, 14.5"" , gov't profile barrel.  You know their quality specs.  Troy linear brake is permanent making it a legal 16.1""  You will be quite surprised at the groups this particular barrel holds.  ( 500 rounds total, barely broken in)

Troy MRF-MX 10"" free float quad rail with Spike's ladder on the bottom rail for comfort.  The rail is marked ""Colt"" also since it was a take-off.  Looks as new.

Young Manufacturing, coated, light weight NM bolt carrier.  That coloring is normal as the carrier gets slicker as it heats up.  You can run this dry.  I use hornady dry lube.  The bolt is regular mil-spec that I just spruced up with a Bravo Company extractor spring kit with o-ring. ( 40 rounds after install for function check 6/20)

Upper is EMMCO forge A2.  Couple of nicks but looks fine.  Charging handle has a large ""Black Rain"" tactical latch for easy, one finger charging.

Can change upper out to a flattop M4 for $30 extra.

Brand new ""New Frontier Armory"" LW-15 lower.  I built a super light weight rifle and used the other lower.  Had to buy 2 to get a decent price 3 months ago.

The LPK is NOT polymer.  It is a Palmetto State Armory full mil-spec kit with enhanced trigger, very smooth.

Standard 6 position stock from Smith and Wesson, carbine buffer.

C-more systems 4x scope with see through mount.  This is that same scope they built for Colt under contract years ago.  Brass knobs, alum. body.  Zeroed at 200 yrd 6/20 at Gateway.

$875  everything described.

$800  If you don't need the magazines or scope.

Keep in mind that upgrading a standard hand guard to a free float setup like this will cost roughly $200; but changing the A2 upper to flat-top will only cost you $60 ( $110 for M4 upper  minus $50-$60 selling the A2)

If you shoot at Gateway I will let you shoot it first as long as you show me the money and I know you're serious.  We can also meet at Gun Gallery for the sale.

170,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1789170,For Sale:  EOTECH G23 magnifier like new,"denver, Denver, Colorado",$ 450,"Listed On: Saturday, July 20, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Improve your accuracy at medium range distances while increasing target recognition with the EOTech G23.FTS 3x magnifier. Designed to transition a fielded holographic weapons sight into a lethal medium range optic, the magnifier puts the competition to shame. The magnifier is outfitted with a rugged streamlined optic with superior light transmission, giving you clear images in almost any conditions. The magnifier's unique holographic technology, meanwhile, allows the center dot to remain 1 moa in size while magnifying the angular size of the target. As a result, it's easy to maintain and even improve accuracy without moving closer. Plus, the zero is maintained in the holographic weapons sight and not in the magnifier. That means you never lose zero whether you're targeting through the magnifier or only through the sight. 

 This is the second generation of EOTech magnifiers, with a half-inch of additional eye relief compared to the first generation, along with fewer moving parts to keep the mount more stable. The company also positioned the windage and elevation adjustments inside the optic rather than in the mount, and added a locking, quick-detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. The magnifier--which aligns perfectly with standard height sights--comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate raised sights and works with all existing holographic weapons sights.

It offers a half inch more eye relief, positions the windage and elevation adjustments inside of the optic rather than in the mount, less moving parts in the mount which makes the mount even more stable, and has a quick release throw lever on the bottom of the mount which allows the quick removal of both the optic and the mount.

259,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1789259,For Sale:  Colt Single Action Army (S.A.A) - Tanaka,"Utah, Utah, United States",$ 800,"Listed On: Friday, June 21, 2013",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,no type,Single Action,no type,"The Tanaka SAAs are widely held as the most beautiful, accurately replicated and well made airsoft revolvers available. They are only sporadically made and are often totally unobtainable.
The box was fairly typical of Tanaka's other revolvers, except that the background to the photographic artwork on the lid was bright red, rather than the usual dark background.

The silver finish on this gun is nothing like the stainless finish on the S&W 629s, being a bright, highly polished chrome finish....The weight and balance of the gun is good and there is nothing visible on the gun that one could describe as a fault or blemish.
The hammer cocks to two positions, half cock to permit rotation of the cylinder for loading and full cock, for firing. Of course, being a Single Action revolver, the SAA needs manually cocking before each shot, like a springer. This is achieved simply by pulling back the hammer.

On the barrel's left side is the legend ""COLT SINGLE ACTION ARMY .45"", with ""COLT'S PTFA MFG. CO. HARTFORD CT. U.S.A."" on the top of the barrel. There are a couple of small proofing marks on the left side of the trigger guard.
There are Colt logos on the grips in the form of a rampant horse in an oval raised section and there's a small Colt horse logo next to the patent marks. If you turn the gun upside down, you will find the only Tanaka mark right on the front of the frame, where it reads ""ASGK""/""MFG.TANAKA"".
The foresight is tall and clear, but the rear sight is a simple groove in the top of the frame, making the sights rudimentary at best.
The overall finish is excellent. I could not find anything that looked like a brush mark or pitting and the consistency of the mirror finish chrome effect across the various parts and materials appears 100%, even under varying light conditions, which are often expose even very minor flaws.

To load extra BBs, over the standard six cylinder openings, you need to remove the magazine stored in the extractor rod, which is done by depressing the 'screw' at the front (on the underside) of it. You can then fill the magazine with BBs and replace the extractor rod.

The grips are black plastic, replicating hard rubber, The hammer certainly is metal, as is the trigger and cylinder.



As I have come to expect of Tanaka revolvers, the SAA seems to have all the main features of the real revolver accurately replicated, with the exception of removable shells.

The BBs can be pushed into open cylinder mouths and extra ones can be stored in the extractor rod (more on that later), whilst the gas is put into the cylinder (as on all other Tanaka revolvers I have seen) by opening the moving piece of the frame and using the, provided, gas can extension. You need to half cock the hammer to get the cylinder to rotate, as with the real thing and there is an evocative click each time the cylinder moves on a notch.

To load extra BBs, over the standard six cylinder openings, you need to remove the magazine stored in the extractor rod, which is done by depressing the 'screw' at the front (on the underside) of it. You can then fill the magazine with BBs and replace the extractor rod."

The Mako Group high performance E-lander magazines are made in Israel to fit AR-15 and Tavor style rifles. The reinforced floor plate and magazine body are stamped from strong, heavy gauge steel, then coated in a proprietary finish which has been tested to endure up to 96 hours of salt spray.
The Israelis make plenty of excellent polymer products, but steel is their choice for these combat mags.
When their rifles lock open the Israeli riflemen are trained to do a quick look and check the easily seen white polymer, non-tilting, self-leveling follower. It lets the rifleman tell at a glance that the rifle is out of ammunition. The follower is white for a reason, but red and OD followers are available from Mako.
These magazines have been used and tested by elite special military forces and anti-terror units in Israel and are proven to withstand severe combat conditions.
Specifications: • • Caliber: 5.56x45mm • • Follower: white polymer non-tilting self-leveling • • Capacity: 30-rounds • • Body Material: Heavy gauge steel • • Basepad: Reinforced steel floor plate
A SurvivalBlog reviewer wrote, “I test fit several 30 round E-Lander magazines (both loaded and unloaded) in the magazine wells of six ARs here at the Rawles Ranch. I should mention that their lower receivers on these ARs came from four different makers. The magazines went into all six lowers with no difficulty whatsoever, and they dropped free with a touch of the magazine release. I also test fired one full magazine, and it fed wonderfully. Since they are steel, these magazines should give a lifetime of reliable service.”"

 8. Rock River Arms Riser with rear sights..Long range / short range sights (All in one):  $55
 9. Lastly I have some real cool Rifle 45 Degree Offset Micro Flip Up Rapid Transition Sight System BUIS ($40 for the set)

These sights (sight set Front & rear) are removable sight that sets on a 45 degree offset with push QD button flip up style sights. You can utilize the scope on your rifle and your sights without having to remove, fold or add any sights since the irons are at the offset.
 Mounts to all picatinny rails. Dual apendature on the rear sight with sight adjustments for sighting. Front sight adjusts up and down for sighting. Front sight is used for rail height applications (not gas block height).
 Spring-loaded sights deploy at the push of a button to provide instant backup sighting. Quick Deploy System locks securely and requires a firm, positive press of the button to deploy or retract the sight, so it won’t accidentally activate when bumped—these sights stay where you put them.

♦ Minimal profile when folded with radiused edges and a smoothly curved front surface to prevent snagging on foliage, gear, or clothing. Cross bolt and side bar provide solid attachment to MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style rail systems.

 ► T6 6061 Aircraft Aluminum Body

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. There is minor fouling at the breech. This revolver may not have been fired since leaving the factory. There is no apparent erosion. 

Overall Condition: This revolver retains about 98% of its metal finish. There is an unfortunate scratch on the left bottom of the barrel, another small scratch on the ejector rod housing near the frame and another on the butt at the toe. There are apparently no other mentionable marks on this spectacular pistol. The Screw heads are sharp and undamaged. The markings are clear. Overall, this revolver rates in about Excellent and LNIB condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. We did not fire this revolver. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: The original box is provided. The end flap of the box matches the description and serial number of the revolver. The interior Styrofoam is in Very Good condition. The exterior box shows tatters at the corners and a few tears but is in Good overall condition. 

Our Assessment: Here is the one that got away, a third gen. Colt .45 with fabulous grips. The fit is so sharp, that we would assume these to be factory, though the box is not marked. There is little if any use/wear evident on the revolver and it is quite possibly unfired since leaving the factory. This is the standard f the industry, for literally over a century."

This lower has never been fired and has sat in the safe unused. It will included a mil-spec buffer tube WITHOUT buffer, spring, etc. The only thing I don't like with it is that the safety selector switch goes to the ""Full-Auto"" selection (Does not shoot full auto) but I believe this is only because I lost the detent spring that holds the selector in place (You can pick one up for $8). However the safety still works flawlessly and does not fail to engage/disengage when tested.

Here is what the previous owner said about this rifle when i purchased it...


""Here is a Krinks AK47. Has the AK 74 look with synthetic furniture. Fired very little.

Comes with 1 steel mag.

I traded into this rifle, not knowing its current state. It had failures to feed, cycle and return to full battery. I polished the rails, bolt, and top of the hammer lightly and it really loosened up. Out of 30 rounds, only had 2 failures to return to full battery.

Long story short, I am sure it can be made very reliable, but i am frustrated with the whole ordeal and just want it gone. I can text a few pics. Will add them when i get home."" End Quote

I'm selling a few of my guns to make the downpayment on a new home, so I cannot entertain trade offers. I would like to do this as a cash sale, face to face transaction. Buyer MUST provide a valid SCDL, military ID, government issued photo ID or CWP and be willing to complete a bill of sale for private party transaction that will include your full name, address, ID info and a contact number. Buyer must also answer the normal questions, are you a felon, fugitive, mentally incapacitated and so on. We all know the drill. (I never want the police showing up at my house wanting to know where a weapon I bought went and I not have the answer and paperwork to support my answer) I will only sell to someone who can legally own a firearm.

If you went out and bought everything in this package today at retail prices it would cost you $2715 with the ammo, almost $3000 after taxes and fees. I will sell the whole bag of goodies for $1770 saving you over $1000 on a first rate rifle, top shelf accessories and good quality ammo.

If you have questions please don't hesitate to shoot me an email. I'm happy to provide as much information to potential buyers as I can. It's one of my favorite rifles, but having the opportunity to buy a home of our own outweighs my like for this rifle. Eventually I'll buy another one just like it but for right now I need the cash to finish off the down payment.
Thanks for looking."

The Legendary Uzi is one of the world's most famous firearm brands and the manufacturer Vector Arms has the reputation in the industry for making the best Uzi out there. This high quality 9mm semi auto Uzi has a folding stock and bayonet lug.  Comes with one 20 round mag and eight 32 round mags.  Also included is an uzi lula (loader/unloader) and a black zippered case that holds everything.  I only had this at the range once and put a couple mags through it.  It’s a nice shooter with the stock folded or unfolded because of the low recoil.

This gun is the commercial version, and the 6th variant (there were six model variants?). The Ortgies pocket pistols were made (officially) from 1919 to 1924. This particular gun (according to the serial number) was made around 1922-23. The Orgies semi-automatic pistols were excellent, well made guns. The design was ahead of its time. This gun has the factory original 7rd magazine. Overall, this gun is in very good condition. Has all matching numbers (barrel, frame, slide). Bluing is in really good condition for its age (this gun is at least 90 years old). All original finish, not re-blued, or anything like that. Has factory wood grips. The grips has no cracks, splits, or damages. Has a few minor dents and dings. Barrel is in very good condition - has a few minor surface rust. Bore is in very good condition. Has a a few minor rust (the Germans or people back in the old days used highly corrosive ammo). In addition, there's an old Ortgies owner's manual. It's really worn out, tattered, but all the pages are there (but not intact - it looks like as old as the gun itself).  You must be at least 21 years old or older and have a valid Kentucky driver's license (KY CCDW) to buy/trade this gun. Local (Kentucky) sale/trade only. No shipping. Just email me with any questions. Serious inquiries only please. Thanks for looking.

 -- Below is an excerpt from one of the Ortgies websites. It is not my own. I am just giving a credit to the author/creator of that particular website. You can do a google (or yahoo) search on this particular pistol on the internet. There are several Ortgies websites on line --

 "" The Ortgies pistol has a number of unusual design features. The most obvious is its grip safety which, once squeezed, stays in the “fire” position without further pressure of the hand on the grip. A button on the left side of the gun allows the grip safety to pop back out. Since the grip safety is powered by the striker spring, the safety can only be popped out, i.e., placed in the “safe” position, when the striker is cocked. Hence, if the safety is enabled, the gun is cocked. When the grip safety is enabled, the sear is prevented from moving downward and the tension on the striker spring is reduced. Pressing the safety- enabling button also allows the slide to be lifted off the frame rail for disassembly. The striker serves as the ejector. ""

Comes with ample recently-purchased high-quality now-hard-to-find self-defense ammo, all .357 Magnum jacketed hollow-points: 1 20-rd box Hornady 125-grain nickel-plated, 44 rounds Black Hills 158-grain, 1 20-rd Box Federal Hydra-Shok 158-grain nickel-plated, 1 20 rd box Speer Gold Dot 158-grain nickel-plated,  partial box Hornady 158-grain Custom... about $125-150 ammo at current prices!  Or more!

This substantial gun is built like a tank.  It handles .38 Special loads with ease--very little felt recoil.  Even .357 Magnum loads in this gun feel tame compared to 9mm Luger rounds in my Baby Glock 26.  Fires double and single action: nice smooth trigger.  Adjustable sights.  No user modifications of any kind.. cylinder play is what you'd see in a new gun too.  Minimal wear: like new.  Gun feels rock solid, so it's fun to shoot!

This is a great home defense gun.. is a great woods gun too (recommend 180-grain hard-cast .357 Magnum rounds for black bear encounters).  Reliable, accurate, tougher than a Smith revolver by far.  Easy take-down, easy to clean and lube.  Religiously cleaned after every trip to the range.  For newbies: this gun fires light-recoiling .38 Special rounds as well as the hottest .357 Magnum loads, like having two guns in one!  So, if you're new, you can start out with light-recoiling .38 Specials then work up to the .357  Magnum Buffalo Bore rounds as you progress. The .38's recoil is so light it feels like a kid's .22: that's great if you're new to guns or have physical issues such as arthritis.  

Will sell to buyers in the La Crosse, Wisconsin area.. buyer must pick up in person.  I am a responsible seller: I ask that prospective buyers consent to a Wisconsin Circuit Courts Access background check online (I just need to look at your DL for that, then do a 2-minute check on the Web.. won't sell if you've a violent felony on your record, all else okay) or prove their character some other way (LEO badges, military ID, et cetera.).  Must be 21 years of age or older and a Wisconsin resident.

This gun is very hard to find now because of recent events at the federal level.  The ammo is very difficult to find in a gun store right now too.  Great buy, great gun.. can't go wrong on this deal!"

I have a like new (75 rds) Benelli Super Black Eagle 2 with Comfort Tech stock.

This is the most versatile shotgun out there. Great for turkey, goose, ducks, dove, and pheasant. Also amazing for trap and sporting clays 

These sell new for $1749 plus the 4.7% sales tax. 

Look at the link above for info on the amazing shotgun. 

The Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility, and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. Utilizing the proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"", and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments. The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech system which reduces recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less on average; that's more than a pound less! The ComforTech system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest-shooting, most reliable shotgun ever.
