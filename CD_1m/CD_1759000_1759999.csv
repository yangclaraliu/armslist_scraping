We have a very nice and well built Arsenal Inc. AK47 built on a milled receiver. These are the best AK47's you can own they are not built with pop metal like the stamped ones. These SAM7R AK47's have great tolerances and are built to be an accurate and durable rifle. With a piston driven system and a milled receiver you will have a life time of shooting and of course the ammo will always be available.

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7 - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

Features on the Lady Hawk include the following:

FEATURES •100% new-production parts and components. •Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger •Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology •Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber •Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads. •Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.) •Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies. •922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines. •AK scope rail.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately. The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations. Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame.

Colt’s use of the MaTech flip-up sight is unique among flip-up rear sights in that it has adjustment for both Windage and elevation and its slender design allows for maximum peripheral vision when in use giving the shooter the most un-obscured view of the target. These are also the reasons that the MaTech flip up rear sight has been the US Military standard for almost a decade.

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor.

The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability.

The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones.

The AR6720 is a hybrid of Colt’s Government Carbine model AR6520 and Colt’s Flagship M4 Carbine model LE6920. This Lightweight Law Enforcement Carbine has a roll mark of AR-15A4- recognizing Colt’s newest designation of an ORC (optics ready carbine).

What justice does this person thinks he/she is doing? Maybe they're offended because they are the JACKWAGON asking $135 for the same ammo!!! To set the record strait I said they are not hard to find...because if you do your research you can find ammo if you look hard enough. AND, you're limited to ONE BOX per PERSON. Get a haircut & get a real job you Punk Kids!

Oh, another one is a guy who thinks he's got one up on everyone else by creating an email called: REDACTED

These are the crybabies running their mouth...& quite frankly I believe are the ones that need professional help. If it came down to it I think their weapons should be taken away because of the way they treat others & might retaliate since they didn't get their way."

New Gun Laws Took Effect July 1! 
Here's what I've learned that the news is not disclosing---

State law limits the amount the FFL Dealer can charge for Background Checks to only $10. It's basically a tax; the store must turn it over to the State.
The store must retain records for 20 years
The store must inspect the weapon; deeming it safe to operate.

I believe Corral Pawn on Main St. in Trinidad is doing the BGCs. 
Artic Shooting Supply, on 6th St, in Pueblo is doing them. $20 for both BGC & Transfer--No Limit on number of guns sold by one individual to another individual.
One $20 Fee Or, paid in full first, I will agree to ship UPS OVER-NITE to your FFL Dealer for Transfer; at your expense.

This gun is very customize-able. It has a 20 in barrel to help with accuracy and helps the barrel not get hot as fast so you can use it for a longer period of time. With this gun some of the cool features you could get upgraded are: you can replace the stock to get an adjustable one, you could take of the iron sights and get a nice red dot or a scope,change out the trigger and trigger guard for a better feel, get a new grip. Personally i would change the grip and stock on it so i could get a btter more comfortable feel. The armalite AR-15 is a great gun with the ability to be upgraded to your specifications or just be left how it isw and you will be getting a reliable and accurate firearm. Also with the Armalite Ar-15 is a Trijicon MOA Amber Triangle Reticle with A.R.M.S #15 Throw Lever Mount. The Trijicon’s technologically advanced Reflex sights offer shooters the perfect combination of speed and precision under virtually any lighting conditions.

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

It has an awesome set trigger with a 2lb pull, this allows for much more accurate long range shots, extended rubber buttplate, factory scope rings, and attached 5 round magazine. In addition to the adjustable iron sights a NC Star 6-20x50 mm scope comes with it.
The CZ 550 FS features a classic Bavarian-style Mannlicher stock, steel muzzle cap and a 3-position safety. This safety is unique in the CZ line to the FS, It locks the bolt and is on 'safe' when fully to the rear, remains on 'safe' with the bolt unlocked for unloading in the mid position and is ready to fire with the bolt unlocked in the forward position.
While the aesthetics of this model remind us of rifles from times gone by, with its short 20.6"" barrel, fast handling stock and iron sights, it is even today perhaps the most appropriate configuration for quick shots required when hunting in dense cover.

I bought these off of one of the sites and have subsequently started reloading.  I've got enough brass.  The price per box is what I paid for them - so don't give me your speech about going to Wal Mart and reselling them.

I also have 1 Box of 50 rounds of Black Hills 9MM 115 Gr JHP EXP @ $35

The following is stated on the outside of the box - The ammunition in this package has been classified as seconds because of cosmetic imperfections such as minor discoloration, dents or scratches.  Functioning and safety are unaffected.  

If you ever shot this stuff you know it is good ammo.  I've looked over some of the rounds and cannot figure out besides a ""dark spot"" on the base or side what the issue is."
