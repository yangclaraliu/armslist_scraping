With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

A polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.

Rapid and simple calculation of the amount of sight correction necessary to compensate for bullet drop and/or wind drift for a given range, enabling the shooter to determine either the equivalent telescopic sight adjustment (minute-of-angle, or MOA) or the equivalent hold-over (mils), by reading equivalents in both MOA and mils directly opposite the bullet drop/wind drift figure.

Additionally, angle of fire for uphill or downhill shots can be accurately measured, and the up/down compensation can be closely calculated to reduce the errors such shots can induce.

JARD INC, who is renowned for their match grade triggers, has made an innovative entry in AR-15 industry with their precision trigger technology, folding and side charging uppers, and fire while folded platforms. 

Guns & Weapons For Law Enforcement magazine praised JARD INC for their AR-15 platform this month stating

“All of us have struggled trying to get AR magazines fully seated into the magazine well of an AR-15 before, and I was quite please that this was not the case with the J16.” 

“The magazines slid into place and locked easily…” 

“…proved to be more than combat accurate…”

“I would have to call the factory trigger on my test gun outstanding…”

“I was impressed with my test gun…” 

“[JARD] is worth your consideration…”

The FastFire Red Dot Reflex sight is the most versatile red dot sight on the market. Mount it on your favorite handgun, shotgun or hunting rifle for greater accuracy and faster target acquisition. You won’t need to worry about sight alignment, eye dominance or finding your target. Just put the red dot on your target and pull the trigger.
The FastFire III offers upgraded features such as windage and elevation adjustments that don’t require a special tool; a convenient power button with three levels of brightness and an automatic brightness setting and battery access on the top of the sight making it easier to change batteries. We’ve also added a low battery warning indicator and see-through protective cap. 8 hour automatic shut off.

Ideally suited for use on pistols and AR-15s where fast target acquisition is desired, the FastFire red dot sight will also match up well with carbines, lever guns and shotguns. Both the FastFire II and III are ruggedly designed, impervious to the elements and will hold up to years of punishing recoil.

If, and when you can direct consumers to this gun for $329, readily available - then you will be of value. In the meantime, in this country we have something called the free market that is based on supply and demand. That means an abundant supply warrants fulfilled demand, thus lower pricing. To the contrary, low supply and high demand is what is called a seller's market, meaning prices are inflated. The seller does not create this market - the manufacturer, or in this case, the government has created market conditions.
When you take the time to look at the ad in its entirety, and apply a principle known as ""math"", you can see how a price is warranted. Gun actually sells for $449 new – GO LOOK AT RUGER’S OWN SITE. ($449 three dot, $529 w/Lasermax, $629 w/ CT) With that, a 7% sales tax and a background check brings the ""Purchase Price"" up to $482.80. Then when you add $35 for a box of ammo (also inflated because of the actions of our Government), plus $20 for a holster, you arrive at a total expenditure of $537.80.
Here is the link for you and everyone else:  http://www.ruger.com/products/lc9/models.html   And then click on the order/availability button and tell me what you see genius.
Google and see great prices on ads. But Quanity is zero. Have been since some of these ads are from 2011 when.... wait for it....everything was cheaper. 

So this is your narrative on PRICE GOUGHING??!!

As stated earlier, if you wish to serve this community, please tell us where, throughout the Florida market, the good citizens can travel within each buyer’s local market - where they can walk in, at any given time, and make said purchase for $369, not pay sales tax, not pay for a background check, and have seller included 50 rounds of ammo and a holster at no additional charge. I'm sure every buyer would be very interested. I'm not going to flag your posting, because freedom of speech, along with a free market is what hopefully keeps this nation great. But I will also reply to you directly, because I have no issue with standing behind my words. 
Gasoline use to be $2, stop buying and see how that works out for you.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD X 22"" barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

New hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. The semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other"

I bought this gun 3 weeks ago on an impulse buy because I know they are a little hard to come by. I was in there to buy shotgun shells and walked out with this. I have a kimber pro carry and I prefer steel guns. I have yet to either fondle or clean off the factory lube. The longest I held it was to take the picture. 
 I would like to get very close to what I paid and take a little loss on the transfer and tax. 

I by no means have to sell this to cover the utility bill. It can just sit in my safe forever for all I really care, I just figured a lot of people want one of these so why hold on to it. By the time they are readily available they will be a lot more expensive. this is what the gun salesmen were telling me as I was signing the papers.  So if this is what you want i'd grab it.

From Spikes Tactical:

The Spike’s Tactical Battle Trigger is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer to work with all calibers, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron. This plating gives you an extremely reliable single stage trigger and it’s also one of the most grit-free trigger pulls that you’ll find on the market and gets even smoother the more you shoot it. 
This kit comes with everything you need to replace your old trigger set. Inside, you’ll find the Nickel Boron plated trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector; as well as brand new Mil-Spec trigger, hammer, and disconnector springs. We’ve also included stainless steel hammer and trigger pins that both feature a Black Oxide finish for durability just in case the ones you have are a little worn or if you’re installing it in a new lower! 
Grab one today and drop one in your lower to finally get rid of that gritty feeling standard trigger!
Features:
Nickel Boron finish for a smoother trigger pull and enhanced reliability
Works with all calibers
Included:
Nickel Boron plated trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector
Mil-Spec trigger, hammer, and disconnector springs
Stainless steel trigger and hammer pins with a Black Oxide finish
Spike's Tactical Lifetime Warranty

The Spike’s Tactical Dynacomp Extreme is a 5.56 muzzle device designed to reduce recoil impulse and muzzle climb to provide faster follow up shots. The Dynacomp's accomplish this by balancing the direction of the blast along the vertical (upward) and perpendicular planes of the muzzle to lower muzzle rise, while the end of the device restricts forward energy to reduce parallel recoil. 
The ports on the Dynacomp are ball dimpled for smooth expansion of gases and rapid heat dissipation. The front of the device is 0.25"" thick to better handle the abuse of full auto fire. The entire device is Melonite treated to enhance these characteristics and provide a slick black finish. 
NOTE: The Dynacomp Extreme model will bring a 14.5"" barrel to legal (non-NFA) length
Features:
Threaded for 1/2x28” barrels
Machined from 303 Stainless Steel
Black Melonite finish
Ball dimpled expansion ports
Included:
Spike’s Tactical Dynacomp and crush washer

Spikes ST-T2 Heavy Buffer - Looking for a heavy buffer to replace your standard carbine buffer? Well, we came up with something that offers the HIGHEST performance at a reasonable price. The ST-T2 buffer is one of the softest shooting, smoothest, and quietest buffers on the market; not to mention it looks awesome! It doesn't have any weights to move around or fluids to leak out like some other buffers, so it's 100% maintenance free! 

The ST-T2 buffer weighs in at 115g/4.05oz. (Depending on the density and size of the HDTP, the weight can vary slightly) and the body is CNC machined from solid billet Aluminum bar stock for strength and durability. To finish it all off, it's Anodized matte black and laser engraved with our Logo. 

So you're probably wondering what's inside of this thing to make this thing so great and different? 

Each ST-T2 buffer is filled with HDTP which is short for ""High Density Tungsten Powder"" and topped off with a Mil-Spec bumper. Because of this, there aren’t any reciprocating weights inside to make a lot of noise and it also makes for a very smooth cycling rifle. The ST-T2 eliminates the chance of bolt bounce, helps with muzzle rise when firing in full-auto, and cuts down on felt recoil. As you can tell, it's a HUGE upgrade from a Standard Carbine buffer! It's designed for .223/5.56 but it works in all Calibers! 

Get one for your AR-15 today and feel the difference! 
NOTE: Actual weight can vary between 4.0oz and 4.2oz.

It is in very good condition with only about 100 rounds down range but it does NOT come with the additional backstraps, second backstrap pin, spent casing or third magazine. I know that the extra backstraps can be purchased online, although I use no backstrap on my Gen 4's.  It does come with the original clamshell case, lock, instruction manual and two hi-cap (17 round) magazines.  

I would like to do a face to face transfer, but it would need to go through an FFL as I just moved to Colorado and I am not yet a Colorado resident.  I am willing to pay the FFL transfer fee that most firearms shops charge.

The Glock FDE's are becoming harder to come by, but I need money to fund another project.  I am asking $650 because it does not have to additional backstrap or the extra magazine.  I am not currently interested in any trades.  If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me and thank you for your interest."

698,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1286698,For Sale:  ALG Defense AR15 Upgrade Trigger / Hammer Kit,"West Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 80,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 11, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Tuned by Geissele, the ALG Defense Quality Mil-Spec (QMS) Trigger is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the QMS is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however the majority of the associated grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the well known reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs. 
*If interested and serious please include a phone number to contact you on in your reply. No number no reply.

**Tuned by Geissele Automatics**

Performance Advantages for the Shooter:
The ALG Defense QMS trigger pull is smoother and sharper than a stock trigger. This is accomplished by honing the sear surfaces smooth while not removing metal below the valleys of the stock surface finish.
Sear geometry has not been changed from the standard profile so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged.
Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness.
Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness.
Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications.
A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition.
Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver. Both pins are Nickel-Teflon coated.

Advantages for the Armorer:
The ALG Defense QMS trigger is an enhanced standard trigger so maintenance and installation procedures are unchanged.
There is spare parts commonality between the QMS and stock triggers
Trigger assembly parts may be interchanged between triggers, there are no matched sets.
Since it is a trigger meeting the U.S. Military trigger specifications for the M4 Carbine, the ALG Defense QMS can be substituted for lower performing stock triggers while still staying in compliance with Unit or Departmental requirements."

KG-9 open bolt desing makes it easy to convert to full auto and because of this, ATF forced Interdynamic to redesign it into closed-bolt system, to make it harder to convert to full-auto.

I will also throw in a Serpa holster.  

The handle is stippled and it will come with everything that was in the box except the back straps (which are pointless anyway with it being stippled). I also had a nice trigger job put on it by a gunsmith (polished trigger bar, connector, etc.) and it breaks perfectly.

MANUFACTURER NO: RFA3OC
 Panther Oracle, 5.56 Carbine, Flat Top, Optic Ready, 16″, 6 Position Stock
 Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level carbine features a 16” light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating Glacier Guards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock.

Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail. The 16″ barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter."

56-U2 PRO 2nd re-issue
circa 2005 Only 3,000 Dano Pros were manufactured in 2005.

The '56 PRO has features similar to the first reissues and the vintage Danos, 
such as a single-cutaway semi-hollow masonite top & back with a plywood center body,

a clear pick guard, three-way pickup selector, tone and volume controls, bolt-on

intonation, aluminum nut, sealed tuners, expertly finished frets and smooth maple neck. 

The 56 Pro was a Limited Edition re-issue of the U2. Although a re-issue, the Danelectro 56 Pro 
has some distinctive changes from the original models, these changes include:

• The headstock shape, It has a slight cut out on the 56 Pro.
• No vinyl which bound the sides of the guitar on the originals.
• Master Tone & Volume, rather than the Danelectro trademark concentric ""Stacked"" pots.
• An upgraded bridge with adjustments for intonation.
• Higher output lipstick pickups than the originals and the first reissues.
• Metal strap buttons to replace the plastic ones of previous models (also, top button is now on the 
upper bout of the body rather than its original position on the treble side of the neck)
• Black necks rather than the matched neck and body colour of the originals and first reissues.
• Reshaped pickguard (longer and wider than the original design). Also lacks the silk-screened outline and 'D' logo.
• Modern ""Schaller"" style tuners
