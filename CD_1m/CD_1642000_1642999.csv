I was not going to go into it, but since people feel the need to tell me I'm a moron for trying to sell this for more than Dillon does, here is my diatribe: I ordered this on March 6 from Dillon. The website shows shipping and handling as well. I got a confirmation email of my order. On March 16, I had not received it yet, so attempted to call. I was placed on hold for 57 minutes before my life had to move on and I hung up. Over the next 6 weeks, I spent a total of 8 hours 47 minutes on hold, during hours they say they are open, and never spoke to one person. I replied to my confirmation email to no avail (didn't expect one). I finally gave up and on May 1 I ordered another on ebay. I received it from a vendor who has customer service within 5 days, and was notified when they received my order, packaged it, and sent a tracking number when it shipped. I even got a thank you note. On May 10, Dillon removed the money from my bank account and I received the first one on May 16th. So yes, Dillon says they have these for $100. They DO NOT. I placed the ad giving myself less than minimum wage for the time I have in this order, and I understand people want to dicker. I will NOT sell it for $100 because you think you can buy it for that, but my $150 is not firm. If you want to start using it by Labor Day, order it from Dillon.

These are few and rarely found in good condition. This one is good enough it can actually be fired but of course this is a valuable collector piece and is respectfully retired. The timing is good, springs are still strong, teeth on the cylinder are in great shape, etc.. As you can see, the nickle plating on the cylinder is mostly gone but for maybe 20%. The rest of the gun retains I'd say around 90% of the nickel finish and definitely shows it’s age but is obviously all original. Overall this is a great piece for the collection. The grips are in great shape as well. I tried to get some good pictures here and of course feel free to ask questions. Being an antique, this does not require an FFL. Value is $400.

Also is a Victor D/S action .22 revolver and it's also in great condition and shoots fine. The frame is finished in Titanium Dura Coat and it comes with a holster, 80 rounds of ammo and a hard case. The Victor with accessories is valued at $200.

I'll pay cash and/or trade for a suitable shotgun to use at the trap range. My first choice is a 12gauge over/under but will consider others. 
I also have several types of ammo that I'm willing to barter with as well, and I do mean at normal store prices, not inflated, low-life, scumbag, scalper prices.  I'm all about fair trade, you be too.

This item is also listed on the gunbroker site using the following link, so if there be any doubts about the legitimacy of this posting, please refer to my listing on that site and check my record.  My handle is Revelator 227.  http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=342831642

Because this listing appears on two sites, the wording in this description may be geared for one or the other site.  I am only looking to deal locally.   In the state of Missouri, I need nothing more than a bill of sale to transfer a gun to a buyer.  I am also willing to drop this pistol off at your local BRICK AND MORTAR gun dealer in the St. Louis or St. Charles area if you prefer to go the FFL transfer route.  I will not ship this pistol.  Lastly, I take cash only.

As a side note, I listed a Ruger LCP last Thursday and the armslist community flagged the listing as a SCAM.  My first thoughts were that local dealers were trying to block my post because my price was very competitive.  I was also told by the person that eventually did buy the pistol that it may have had to do with the fact that I do tend to write a lot and include too many details.  When I hear of all the horror stories on the news about sites like Craigslist and what not, I tend to say things and arrange the situation in such a way that I can avoid that.  However, I do realize the setbacks to that, so I will not make this listing so wordy where it shouldn’t be, but I do want to say that if my listing was flagged because people were trying to prevent me from competing, you who are responsible JUST LOST ANOTHER ONE because at the end of the day, I did make the deal, it was a very smooth transaction, I got my money and he got a good gun cheaper than he would have paid you for.   Mwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha……  and at the rate that people respond to these postings, this one will likely go quickly also."

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. 

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.


 A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.


Key Features:
•Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates
•MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories

Less than 500 rounds of brass through the pipe, COMPLETELY broken down and cleaned after both sessions. Im talking taking the bolt carrier completely apart, cleaning the pin, etc.  Im meticulous with my firearms.  Gun cycles flawlessly, and never had one malfunction. Included with the gun is one unused metal 30 round mag that came with the gun, the case, and all the documents as if it were brand new.   In a way its better than brand new - because ive basically finished the break in process (shoot, clean, shoot, clean) and the new owner can just enjoy without the hassle! 

Pictured on the gun is the gen2 Magpul MBUS flip up sights, and two new (more available) 30 round windowed pmags. Asking $150 for these accessories.

Also included in the sale for an additional $300 is a 500 round case of Independence (Federal) 5.56 NEW brass cased rounds. 50 - 20 round boxes. 

Asking what I paid for everything here - which is kind of unheard of right now.  I want the new owner to be able to shoot their gun without having to hunt for ammo for weeks like i did  - so i will not ONLY sell the ammo, but will sell the gun by itself for $1200.

Prices are FIRM. Im only asking what I paid - and not desperate for cash. SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY! The legitimate buyer will also have to sign a bill of sale, and provide a copy of their DL. Could also do an FFL transfer if you prefer (no bill of sale req'd then). 

Im out of town for few days - so Friday is an ideal day to meet.  

If interested please email or TEXT: 720 Four Four Five 6968 

ONLY trades i might be interested in is a great condition - Sig 229 9mm or 40SW pistol + a substantial amount of cash.  Please dont ask me to trade anything else."

He is using multiple e-mail addresses, but it is the same scam every time. I have had him contact me about seven of my ads so far. Every time I post an ad, I get a response from him that says he is VERY interested in buying my item, and to please respond. When I respond, he always says for me to consider it sold, and that he will be sending me the funds via cashier's check if that is okay. DON'T FALL FOR IT! First, any and all transactions should be done in cash, and face-to-face, unless you want to go through an FFL dealer and ship a gun. Further, it is an age-old scam, where they send you a very legitimate-looking cashier's check (usually a Postal Money Order, but it varies) and the counterfeit is so good, even most bankers will not know it is fake. Very often, they will send you a check for more than the agreed upon price, and ask that you just give a small cash refund to the party who shows up to receive the item. (Car, gun, lawnmower, whatever you are selling). It is a very slick operation, and you usually can deposit the check or money order and your account will be credited with the money until it gets back to the point of origin, at which time, a few days later, your bank will inform you that the check or money order is counterfeit, and you do not have the funds in your account. So then, you are out the item you sold, and any cash you might have been dumb enough to give the person who picked it up. IT IS A SCAM! DO NOT FALL FOR IT!"

Less than 500 rounds of brass through the pipe, COMPLETELY broken down and cleaned after both sessions. Im talking taking the bolt carrier completely apart, cleaning the pin, etc. Im meticulous with my firearms. Gun cycles flawlessly, and never had one malfunction. Included with the gun is one unused metal 30 round mag that came with the gun, the case, and all the documents as if it were brand new. In a way its better than brand new - because ive basically finished the break in process (shoot, clean, shoot, clean) and the new owner can just enjoy without the hassle! 

Pictured on the gun is the gen2 Magpul MBUS flip up sights, and two new (more available) 30 round windowed pmags. Asking $150 for these accessories.

Also included in the sale for an additional $300 is a 500 round case of Independence (Federal) 5.56 NEW brass cased rounds. 50 - 20 round boxes. 

Asking what I paid for everything here - which is kind of unheard of right now. I want the new owner to be able to shoot their gun without having to hunt for ammo for weeks like i did - so i will not ONLY sell the ammo, but will sell the gun by itself for $1200.

Prices are FIRM. Im only asking what I paid - and not desperate for cash. SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY! The legitimate buyer will also have to sign a bill of sale, and provide a copy of their DL. Could also do an FFL transfer if you prefer (no bill of sale req'd then). 

Im out of town for few days - so Friday is an ideal day to meet.

He is using multiple e-mail addresses, but it is the same scam every time. I have had him contact me about seven of my ads so far. Every time I post an ad, I get a response from him that says he is VERY interested in buying my item, and to please respond. When I respond, he always says for me to consider it sold, and that he will be sending me the funds via cashier's check if that is okay. DON'T FALL FOR IT! First, any and all transactions should be done in cash, and face-to-face, unless you want to go through an FFL dealer and ship a gun. Further, it is an age-old scam, where they send you a very legitimate-looking cashier's check (usually a Postal Money Order, but it varies) and the counterfeit is so good, even most bankers will not know it is fake. Very often, they will send you a check for more than the agreed upon price, and ask that you just give a small cash refund to the party who shows up to receive the item. (Car, gun, lawnmower, whatever you are selling). It is a very slick operation, and you usually can deposit the check or money order and your account will be credited with the money until it gets back to the point of origin, at which time, a few days later, your bank will inform you that the check or money order is counterfeit, and you do not have the funds in your account. So then, you are out the item you sold, and any cash you might have been dumb enough to give the person who picked it up. IT IS A SCAM! DO NOT FALL FOR IT!"

He is using multiple e-mail addresses, but it is the same scam every time. I have had him contact me about seven of my ads so far. Every time I post an ad, I get a response from him that says he is VERY interested in buying my item, and to please respond. When I respond, he always says for me to consider it sold, and that he will be sending me the funds via cashier's check if that is okay. DON'T FALL FOR IT! First, any and all transactions should be done in cash, and face-to-face, unless you want to go through an FFL dealer and ship a gun. Further, it is an age-old scam, where they send you a very legitimate-looking cashier's check (usually a Postal Money Order, but it varies) and the counterfeit is so good, even most bankers will not know it is fake. Very often, they will send you a check for more than the agreed upon price, and ask that you just give a small cash refund to the party who shows up to receive the item. (Car, gun, lawnmower, whatever you are selling). It is a very slick operation, and you usually can deposit the check or money order and your account will be credited with the money until it gets back to the point of origin, at which time, a few days later, your bank will inform you that the check or money order is counterfeit, and you do not have the funds in your account. So then, you are out the item you sold, and any cash you might have been dumb enough to give the person who picked it up. IT IS A SCAM! DO NOT FALL FOR IT!"

800,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1642800,For Sale/Trade:  U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown,"GLENFORD, Ohio, United States",$ 0,"Listed On: Sunday, May 19, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Amendment II. A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed!!
A well regulated Militia --  The Dick Act of 1902 also known as the Efficiency of Militia Bill H.R. 11654, of June 28, 1902 invalidates all so-called gun-control laws. It also divides the militia into three distinct and separate entities. The three classes H.R. 11654 provides for are the organized militia, henceforth known as the National Guard of the State, Territory and District of Columbia , the unorganized militia and the regular army. The militia encompasses every able-bodied male between the ages of 18 and 45. All members of the unorganized militia have the absolute personal right and 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms of any type, and as many as they can afford to buy.

Militia: = a citizen army. 

free: = independent; unrestrained; unencumbered. 

State: = a sovereign political unit; country; nation. 

the people: = the citizens of the USA. 

keep and bear: = own and carry on one's person. 

Arms: = weapons of any type. 

shall not: = in no way; un-allowed. 

infringed: = to intrude upon; to transgress (to overstep the bounds of; to break a law). 

Just what is it that Obama, Joe Biden, and the liberal Democrats, don't understand about the words in the English language, when put together to form a sentence? These are simple words, with simple meanings, that make a proclamation as to the rights of all USA citizens, which they took an oath to uphold and protect!!!

 The current background check system is being only partly utilized. Until existing law (for any issue) 
is fully implemented and found wanting, there is no justification for writing new law.

There are currently thousands of laws which restrict gun ownership ... or gun use ... in some way.
That is to say that there are thousands of laws which infringe upon the right to 'keep' ... or the right to 'bear' ... in some way.

Senator, we allow you hold a position which required that you give your oath to support all of the provisions in a certain document.
The second amendment to that document denies you the authority to restrict ownership or use of arms.
That is what it says, and that is all that it says, Senator.

Yet, you state that you intend to violate the oath you swore by further infringing on both of those rights ... fully aware that you have no authority to do so. And you trying to sell us out to the United Nations’ with the  so-called “Arms Trade Treaty” !!!! 
It requires an international license to own a gun…. It requires registration of all guns worldwide….. It bans all transfers of semi-automatic firearms ….It even requires the confiscation and destruction of any gun not approved by the UN….  


If you proceed with your intention, Senator, if you feel it necessary to renege upon your oath, you may do so after you tender your resignation to the Governor of this state so that he may appoint a replacement."

The 10mm seems to be really making a comeback in popularity with ballistics more impressive than the 45ACP.

 Comes with 2 mags and everything you would expect to receive as new.

 You know having one of these is on your list, so get it now while you can still find them new since I believe Colt has also stopped making this newer version as well.

 At this point since I am just listing it, I do not want to ship out of state right now and go through the hassle so local FTF transaction only.

 Price is $1500 FIRM Now this is a pet peeve of mine. I put FIRM, yet still get people offering less. I will not respond to these offers at all!!!

 Now, I did not just pull a random number out of head for a price. I found about 4 or 5 of the exact same model brand new over the last 2 months and monitored the auction price on gunauction.com. Some started a .01 with 30 bids usually ending at almost exactly $1500 and others with a starting price higher with a sale price again at almost or at $1500 and others simply put a flat rate for ""Buy it Now"" for $1500 and every single one sold. So I know this is what I can get. It would cost me probably $20 for gunauction's sellers fees, but it wouls cost the buyer who almost always pays for sellers FFL to ship it out which includes my FFL's fee and shipping which the price varies between $40 and $60 depending if you get insurance. Then you have to pay about $25 to $40 for your FFL to receive the gun and then if you use a credit card almost everyone charges 3% for that. So all these people paying the $1500 on gunauction after all fees are auctually paying $1600 or more. So that is how I got my price. No shipping and waiting and hoping it doesn't get damaged.

 I do not need to sell. Obviously I prefer a straight green cash money sale!!!! I am only considering a trade for something uncommon, such as a 10mm revolver, Dan Wesson 10mm,  Kimber Eclipse, Desert Eagle, high quality bolt actions preferably with octagon barrel. Other trades I might consider are: a newer model crossbow. Also may consider a excellent condition lever action, no junk!
Really not looking for anything with scratches all except possibly the crossbow.

I picked this gun up from my FFL dealer on 05/09/2013 exactly 9 days ago. I brought it home and field stripped it and lubbed it up with Frog Lube (the best!). This is the newer version of Colt's Delta Elite 10mm Brand New in Box, Never fired! Not the model from the 1980's. The 10mm seems to be really making a comeback in popularity with ballistics more impressive than the 45ACP.

Comes with 2 mags and everything you would expect to receive as new or shown in the pictures below.

You know having one of these is on your bucket list, so get it now while you can still find them new since I believe Colt has also stopped making this newer version as well they are only going to get harder to find brand new!

At this point since I am just listing it, I do not want to ship out of state right now and go through the hassle so local FTF transaction only and I will only sell to a person with a purchase permit or CPL and I will show you my ID and expect to see yours.

Price is $1500 FIRM Now this is a pet peeve of mine. I put FIRM, yet still get people offering less. I will not respond to these offers at all!!!
Now, I did not just pull a random number out of head for a price. I found about 4 or 5 of the exact same model brand new over the last 2 months and monitored the auction price on gunauction.com. Some started a .01 with 30 bids usually ending at almost exactly $1500 and others with a starting price higher with a sale price again at almost or at $1500 and others simply put a flat rate for ""Buy it Now"" for $1500 and every single one sold. Almost every single one sold for almost exactly $1500 or very close so I know this is what I can get. 

TRADES: I prefer a straight up cash sale but if I were to consider a trade here is what I may consider......Not really interested in any glocks. I am only considering a trade for something uncommon, such as a 10mm revolver, Kimber Eclipse, possible others. Other trades I might consider are: a newer model crossbow that shoots 335FPS or better, preferably a Barnett or Horton reverse limb...I really like the reverse limb styles.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

It was built on a Sestroretsk action from 1899, and is in amazing shape.  The barrel bands need to be replaced, but this rifle retains all of its original ""Finn Matched"" parts.  The bore looks amazing, only showing light wear on the lands, and shiny as can be.  I have not fire this rifle, but know enough about Mosins to know that this will be a great shooter.

A note to everyone that reads this...  If you are thinking to yourself ""What the hell... $200?  I can get a mosin from Fleet Farm for less than $100!""  You are correct.  You can get a Soviet Mosin M91/30 for that price, but never a Finn M91.  This is geared towards the collector, and is (IMHO) a steal at the asking price.  Another thing along these lines, If you are looking for a rifle to Sporterize or mutilate... please don't buy this rifle.  There are plenty of other Mosins in the sea for cutting down and bolting scopes to.

Asking $200 but will consider trades of revolvers.  Please ask any questions and I will try my best to answer them.

I will not ship this rifle.  Transaction must be face to face, and I will request to see a valid State/Govt issued ID and a current purchase permit or carry permit.  Before you contest this via email, I realize that last part isn't required by law, but I will not sell the rifle without it.

Thanks!"

Field stripped the gun and lubbed it with Frog Lube (the Best) and decided to go in a different direction for my collection.  Gun is absolutely perfect and brand new and comes with everything as you would expect a new Delta Elite to come with.
The 10mm cartridge is gaining popularity lately with ballistics better than the 45ACP.

Get it now While you can still find one unfired and new as Colt is no longer making these again. This is not the model they made in the 80's as you can tell by the grips and the trigger, but it is the model made by Colt recently manufactured in the last few years. 

I bought new from the dealer so I am the first owner. But the gun in BRAND NEW!

$1500 FIRM and not a penny less, don't waste your time with offers because I have been monitoring Gunbroker.com and everyone I found identical to this is selling for $1500 then the buyer has to pay double FFL fees, Shipping and Credit card fees. So Get a better deal here and one you can handle and inspect with your own eyes. Also no need to worry about sending $1500 to a stranger out of state and hope you get your gun.  Face to Face is still the safest way to make a deal, no doubt!
