It’s pretty well known that this is the nicest/most reliable AR15 on the market. It uses the gas piston system, which is cleaner and more reliable. The gun is made for law enforcement and SWAT team use but can also be owned by civilians. It is easily converted to an SBR (short barrel rifle), just apply for the stamp. The gun comes with a Sig red dot scope, 1-mag, tactical sling, forward grip(needs stamp to attach) and a padded case. The original owner put less than 100 rounds through it, I still haven’t fired it. It has a couple tiny scratches but it’s in like new condition.

Overall, the finish is about 97% with some scratches due to handling and use on the range. It is in perfect working order but does have extraction issues with some factory and reloaded ammo (see below). I have fired about 20 rounds through the rifle and found that some ammo (notably Federal black box XM33) tends to get stuck in the chamber and requires a cleaning rod to remove. I also found that some reloads I purchased from TMI also would not extract without cleaning rod assistance. Other types of ammo, notably Summit, PMC, and Brazilian surplus, have no issues extracting.The recoil of the rifle is significant (comparable to a heavy 12 gauge load) Heavy AR-15 Hammer Spring (to reliably ignite the .50 BMG primers)Upper Receiver Details: -Bohica FAR-50 MK III upper with 36 inch fluted blued barrel, standard .50 BMG chamber, and factory Bohica muzzle break -Bohica factory steel adjustable bipod

The ACOG’s are compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. The ACOG’s combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Every feature of its design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions. No batteries required; the tritium sight is visible in total blackness without electronics. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the RCO-M150CP features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.

This pistol has right under 1500 rounds through it and shows a good bit of character (holster wear) since it was my personal CCW for 2 years. $150 refinishing and this gun is perfect! (although I personally prefer some wear) The frame to slide fit is nice and tight. The trigger break is consistent and breaks like a glass rod at appx 3.5 lbs. with very little take up.

Bought this .32 as a conceal carry, but decided to go a different way. I bought it new and has never been fired since purchase. Comes with manual, lock, plastic case and extra clip. It also includes a Hogue hardwood grip set (shown on the gun in the photos) made from Pau Ferro wood. These grips give it a ""beefier"" feel. The original grips are there, pictured in the Hogue packaging. Priced right at $580, considering what they are going for on GunBroker without the extra grips (plus shipping/transfer fees) and the fact that these pistols are getting harder to find. For an additional $20, I will include 50 rounds of .32 auto ammunition. Indiana residents only, meet locally and will not ship. Buyer must be of legal age with Indiana driver's license and agree to sign bill of sale. Contact through Armslist or text 812four55two38five. Thanks!"

The carbine has the following upgrades: Kel-Tec stock extension, Tacticool recoil buffer and tube cover, the original plastic trigger has been replaced with aftermarket aluminum trigger - this gives the trigger a nice crisp break instead of that wimpy feel the plastic one has. The standard fore-stock has been replaced with Kel-tec compact stock, and added two NcStar quad rails in front of that. Then installed a 5-position forward pistol grip on the rails. The last upgrade (not in photos) is a single-point sling attachment. Carbine will still fold and lock as its suppose to with these upgrades.

This comes with seven Beretta 96 10-round mags, the box, and all the original parts. In addition there is two S&W magazine catches that this gun can be switched over to. (It can also be switched over to Sig mags also I believe if you get that mag catch from the company. This model cannot be switched to Glock mags however) This has maybe a total of 40 rounds through it, mostly just test firing as upgrades were added.

Gun folds up small enough to fit perfectly inside a normal lap-top computer bag (I will include one of those also!) This is/was my Get-Home-Bag gun, but I don't think I'll need it. I'm also not totally positive I want to sell it, but I thought I'd see what's out there that I might be more interested in. I've check, and Kel-Tec Subs are running about $700+ average in stock condition -with only 1 or 2 mags, so I'm guessing they are still way back-ordered through the company. Selling this one with all the upgrades and mags, I'm asking $850 firm. See below for possible trades."

.22lr, 40S&W, .38 Special, .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, .308, 7.62 NATO, .223, and 7x57 Mauser.

The Mini Mag is a cool gun that needs to go to a home that will use it more than I will or to a collector.  I'm a shooter more than a collector so hit me up with a quality firearm like any of those above and hopefully we can work something out.

Introduction
If you're looking for the highest quality and most durable Lower Parts Kit on the market with all of the upgrades, look no further. The Spike’s Tactical Enhanced LPK was designed for the end user who demands the most longevity possible out of the parts in their rifles. The core of the Spike’s Enhanced LPK is the ST Battle Trigger which is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron to give the Battle Trigger a very smooth and crisp trigger pull that breaks at around 5 lbs and gets even smoother the more you shoot it.

The Battle Trigger is held in place via KNS Gen II Mod II Anti-Rotation pins which keep the hammer and trigger pins from walking out (a problem in some 9mm ARs and full auto M4/M16s) and keeps the pin holes from enlarging and “egg-holing” after years and years of use. And we’ve also included an Ambidextrous Safety Selector, our ST Billet Trigger guard with set screw, and our Ergo grip featuring our Spike’s Spider logo.

The Spike’s Enhanced LPK also features a Mil-Spec bolt catch, mag catch, and mag catch button. As well as utilizing Mil-Spec detents, plungers, pins, and springs. We also include quality spiral roll pins for the trigger guard and bolt catch as well as a ¼” allen screw and washer for the Ergo grip.

This is the best Lower Parts Kit on the market that you can put in your lower. Everything is here that you need to save you money on parts and shipping costs. Order one today to bring your lower to its fullest potential.

This is a nice handgun. I bought it last year shortly after they were first announced back in September with all the intentions to keep it forever, but have now decided to sell. The handgun retails for about $850.00 (this is the two tone one, the all black one is $100 less) The handgun comes with 10 total high cap mags. These mags sell for about $60.00 each at Specialty Sports. (that is IF!!! you can actually find them). Anyway I'm asking $1,200 for everything. That puts the prices @ $850 for the gun (3 mags in box), and $50.00 pr individual packaged mag(7). This deal is actually cheaper than retail if you think about it (NO TAX). If you want to buy the mags only and not the gun then I'll sell the mags separately at $65.00 each or $60 for all 7.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.
