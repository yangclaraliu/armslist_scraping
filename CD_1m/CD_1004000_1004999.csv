This pistol is in perfect like new condition
This pistol is perfect for ladies or someone with a problem with their hands or grip, it is a semi auto pistol that can be operated the traditional way by pulling the slide back or if needed someone who cannot pull a slide back can hit the button on the side that pops the barrel open then simply drop the first round into the barrel, snap the barrel shut, then she shoots just like any other semi auto. Pretty neat setup, only semi auto pistol my wife could use.

I have land in Arab Al (15 miles South of Huntsville) where this gun can be inspected and test fired, you must bring your own ammo, have cash, and be ready to buy before shooting.
My cell is local area code then four two six – 49 o two

A bow is like a car, once you walk out of the store with a bow it loses value. A bow does not hold value because so many new ones come out monthly. As well as a used bow can have many problems that you wont see with your eyes. A bow does not hold value like a fireaarm so those about to post a bow drop the price its not worth 100 bucks less than what you have in it. Id rather go to a archery store and buy one new and get a free tune and a professional fit and know nothing is wrong with it. Those about to by a bow dont buy a used bow "" ready to shoot"" for a high price."

The receiver is an all-metal construction, with a Picatinny-style rail system on all receiver surfaces. This includes a barrel placement for attaching FN sights. The mussle of the precision match, 16-inch barrel is cut with a 1:28 thread to accept various muzzle breaks and flash hiders.
The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. 
Comes with 22-round magazine. The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. 
The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the gun. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage. Tan finish.

Wolf Performance 45acp steel cased FMJ seven 50rd boxes $150 for a total of 350 rounds.

I completely understand that these prices are more than what you paid 6 months ago. I bought these 9mm rounds 3 years ago for about 20 cents per round--which was also significantly less than what the ammo was selling for 6 months ago--and stored them in 50cal ammo cans. I am perfectly content to leave my ammo in my ammo cans. I am of the opinion that 4-6 months from now, the price of ammunition will settle down again, but will settle at a somewhat higher ""normal"" price. A lot of people have a gloomier outlook on the subject. 

However, I went to Bill Goodman's on Sunday. There was ZERO 9mm target ammunition to be had AT ANY PRICE. No one locally and no one online has any in stock, except cheaperthandirt... if you are willing to pay $21.19 per 50 for steel cased ammo, plus shipping. 

If you are filling ammo cans for doomsday, wait until summer, I think prices will come back down some, and probably settle around $14-15/50 for brass target 9mm. Or, keep running up to Walmart at 7am each day to check for anything in stock...they have a 3 50rd box limit, and the 9mm is just under $15/50. If you want good range ammo for this weekend, email me. I'm letting 1000 rounds go, and I am keeping the rest."

I bought it last summer and only put around 200-250 rounds through it and has been a phenomenal rifle. I hate to see it go but times are very tough for me right now. Very light weight compared to other AR platforms so it's a nice run and gun rifle and very accurate. Now most AR platforms has a dust cover and forward assist but in my years in the military and being overseas i've never ever ever used the forward assist. Yes the dust cover is a nice touch to the AR's but you dont really need it unless you're in the sandbox or dragging it across the dirt and if you do then i don't think this rifle or any rifle is good for you hahaha. Parts are painted on it with desert camo and it is chipping off a little but your enemys/zombies aren't gonna be worried about how it looks lol, so you can just paint it over or upgrade with better accessories.

I have a ton of AR mags already, so I have no use for these...

First and foremost, I'm interested in trading these for STG556 mags (black or amber, 30 round and up). Not a big deal if they are used, but please make sure they are in good condition and not beat to hell! Mine are black and are not see through, BRAND NEW UNUSED, though they are out of the package (I opened them up yesterday not realizing they have E4 on the side).

If I have to sell, I'd like to get $30 each so that I can buy more on gunbroker. Seems like they have a lot of 5 mag packs going for $150 on there, so I'm only trying to get enough to buy what I need for this rifle.

Shipping is fine, no problems sending these somewhere. Shipping is only about $5.50. I just ask that if I'm sending out, the person I'm trading with sends out the same day and provides shipping info, as I will.

Feel free to text me for fastest response: 859-760 1874. Email works fine as well, though I can't check it after hours and during the weekends (comes to work).

Of course your going to say that prices are going to stay high and make people think you won't be able to buy guns ever again. There are to many gun companies that will go under across the nation if they ban all sales of small guns and everything else. The clip size ok possible but guns and ammo will be made regardless. Our country is based around guns there's guns everywhere and always will be. The US make millions of dollars off of guns. Yet another reason there will be. People should not be asking 500 for a 100 dollar gun not 1200 to 2500 and more for 600 to 1000 dollar guns its just stupid of you am sleep at night scamming people to make a dime fine find another hobby being stupid stop ruining for people like the idiot shooters already have enough!!

Dad says this gun was what they used back in summer camp in the 50’s when he was a kid and brought back memories. Looks like a real safe gun for kids, you have to load each 22 manually with the bolt action then after the bolt is closed you have to pull the knob on the back of the bolt to cock it before it will fire. Would make kids slow down, learn mechanics of guns and probably pretty accurate, or good for nostalgia.

1982 - 1985 As with the MK III, the Mark V series was an entirely new product line of models which included Official Police, Lawman, and Trooper variants. The MK V series was based on a new, slightly smaller ‘V’ frame, similar in size to Smith & Wesson’s ‘K’ frame. Changes from the MK III models were minor and many parts remained identical. Internally, Colt did away with the sintered iron MK III lockwork in favor of cast parts, and improved the trigger action with new components and a shorter hammer fall. These improvements made the MK V triggers smoother, while the diminished lock times increased accuracy.   REDACTED"

The screw that holds the wood part of the forearm on is stripped out, also there appears to be some adjustment done to the part that cocks the hammers back when you break the barrels down. Im sure I could fix it if I had time but someone may be familiar with this issue and want a gun like this now. Probably would make a great stage coach gun with a little work.

Stop the Insanity!
This nation witnessed a tragic event on December 14th 2012 when a disturbed young man murdered twenty children and seven adults, but that is not the Insanity I am referring to. The true insanity came immediately after the shooting when gun control supporters climbed over the dead bodies of the children and used them to once again try and dismantle the Constitution of the United States. What is the goal of those once again calling for gun control? Is their goal to make a safer society or are they just pushing their personal agendas. The Justice Department concluded that the previous gun ban of 1994 had no effect in reducing gun crime, should we not learn from previous mistakes and seek a new and better path to deal with violent criminals and those who are truly disturbed and violent. Criminals do not obey laws; this is why we call them criminals. No gun control law will keep guns out of the hands of criminals and anyone determined to commit a heinous crime such as the Newtown shooting will find a way. I am not scared of being involved in a mass shooting; there is greater chance that I will be killed by a tornado. What does scare me is the Governor of New York passing a law in the dark of night when no one was watching. What does scare me is the way in which our elected officials are demonizing inanimate objects and trying to subvert the Constitution rather than look for a real solution to these phenomena. What does scare me is the total lack of logic being used by our elected officials. Banning fire arms based on how they look or how many bullets they hold is illogical and does not address the real causes of the crimes. These heinous acts are not the norm and law abiding citizens should not be punished due the action of a few disturbed individuals. As a resident of Minnesota I am offended that you would seek to punish the innocent rather than seek a real answer to these phenomena. According to the FBI there were a total of 70 homicides in Minnesota in 2011. 43 of these homicides involved firearms and only 3 of those involved rifles of all types, equal to the number killed with hands and feet. 16 times more people were killed with knives or other weapons. Demonizing guns is not the answer, making law abiding citizens criminals is not the answer. We have witnessed a continuous drop in violent crime over the last 20 years, so what is the agenda of the gun control proponents? None of the legislation being proposed will affect the crime rates in a positive manner nor will they stop the heinous acts committed by the mentally disturbed. Our nation was deeply divided before the Newtown shooting and the irresponsible acts of gun control proponents are only dividing the nation further. I urge you to abandon this reckless legislation (H.F. 241) and address the real issues facing us as a state and the nation as a whole."
