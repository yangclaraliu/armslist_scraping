I bought it new just last month (have receipt to prove it) and have put exactly 251 rounds through it.  Absolutely nothing wrong with it and it has functioned flawlessly for me, but after having a few striker fire guns I just can't get over the fact that I prefer SA or SA/DA over striker fired ones.

So, I'm interested in trading for something along these lines in .40 caliber.

I'm most interested in a SIG p239 (in .40), I've handled a few and like the way they feel in my hand and I like the thinness of the single stack design.

This is what I'm most interested in, but I may also consider a Beretta PX4 Storm Subcompact (NOT the compact) and other .40 cal options with an exposed hammer, SA or SA/DA in a subcompact or compact size.  

Would also be interested in an American made 1911, nothing against Rock Islands and the like but I want something of a bit higher quality if I'm going to be carrying it.  I would prefer a commander size but may still consider a full sized 1911. 

My M&P includes the box, lock, paperwork, backstraps, 3 magazines (one with the extended pinky grip, two with flat baseplates), and two holsters, one IWB, the other OWB.  I'd love a trade for the same number of mags, as most of us know they can be pricey and hard to come by.

FTF only in wichita, only interested in trades so please do not ask for a sale price.  I do not need to get rid of this, just seeing what else is out there.  This is my carry gun so I will want to include a bill of sale to protect both of us.
Send offers and pictures of what you have through email and I will get back to you if I'm interested, thanks!"

Use the ""Spam"" option for the Craigslist Items and ArmsList will keep them from posting anything else...

Armslist used to be a great place where good people got together and shared their passions for firearms... now it's a price-gouging, yard-sale (almost the new Craigslist) that makes absolutely no sense...

**EXAMPLE**:   a USED Glock for $800???? That's a $300-$350 firearm- no matter what model and condition. There is nothing special about it... it's not a collectible (unless it's an 18 and good luck getting your hands on one of those); they made them by the hundreds of thousands- EVERY YEAR. Not to mention- THEY ARE TRYING TO BAN ASSAULT RIFLES... NOT PISTOLS???  Again... Get real!!

ArmsList has a threshold (certain number of ""flags"") that has to be reached before it will be removed, so please don't just sit there and b*tch about these guys- Do Something About Them and FLAG them OFF of here until they come to their senses and stop trying to take advantage of their fellow Gun Owner, Neighbor, Possibly a Soldier, and American Citizen. 

So like I wrote earlier... ONE Flag CAN make a Difference cause yours might be the one that crosses that threshold.. 

Stay Vigilant.. Hold the Line... and FIRE (flag) when you see a Predator's ad up.

We have the Technology... Use it.

The fit and finish are excellent and it fits really nice in your hand. I am also including an extra Kim-Pro Tac mag as well. From what I've seen, this is a pretty hard gun to find at least around the state where I've been and I'm told the build time is pushing over a year right now. If you're looking for a great gun at a great price point just let me know!

371,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1616371,Want To Buy:  Want to Trade for a Tactical .22lr or Shotgun,"stl, potosi, sullivan, St. Louis, Missouri",Offer,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 14, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"i have a 14.5' trailer frame that i planned on building a portable mini-cabin on for hunting and camping. about a week after i got it down to the frame, i found a 32 ft. camper for next to nothing and had to jump on the deal. needless to say, i don't need to build a portable cabin anymore.

the frame is straight, has 2 descent tires that hold air and a spare that's flat, brakes work once they're wired back onto the harness, and the lights worked before i took them off, so the harness is fully functional. all you'd need to do is add some decking and a $20 light kit from autozone and you could have a nice little toy hauler or flatbed trailer. or you could do what i was going to do and build a mini-cabin, duck-blind, etc. on it and have something that's portable and handy for the outdoors.

i also have a very nice ibanez acoustic/electric guitar that i bought less than a month ago for $500. i've only picked it up once....i have other guitars that are my main players and i haven't done anything but tune it and strum a couple songs to see how it sounded. bought it as a backup, but i'm no longer going to play anywhere but family functions, so i don't have to have a backup guitar now.

also have an epiphone acoustic guitar that's worth around $200. it's been played, but there's no major wear and tear on it at all.

WILL TRADE FOR:

i'm looking for a .22lr tactical rifle with collapsible stock, scope, 30+ rd mags, etc. to teach my girlfriend to shoot on. needs to have a collapsible stock so it can be adjusted for me and her both....i'm much taller and have a much longer reach than her. needs to be a .22lr because ammo is cheap and it's probably going to take a lot of it to get her to hit the target. also, anything bigger than that would probably kick too hard for her. she can't handle my british 303 long branch rifle, and that's the only thing i currently use.

may also trade for the right home defense shotgun...that way i don't have to teach her to shoot, she can just point it at an intruder and pull the trigger and it'll pepper the heck out of them.

lemme know what you have and which of my items you'd be interested in trading it for. thanks.

please don't flag this ad and put it in miscellaneous again.  i'm posting it in the firearms section because that's what i'm looking to trade for.  i'm not looking for someone that's searching to BUY a trailer frame or guitars or i'd just list it in miscellaneous with a price.  looking to trade, not sell.  so please leave my ad where it is, folks.  i'm not being rude or mean or a jerk about it, just would like it to stay where the people that i'm looking to trade with will see it.  thanks."

Used but not abused CMMG carbine 16"" WASP upper.  Excellent trainer, setup to duplicate one of my rifles for cheap practice.  Just swap uppers and move the sling over if you have QD mounts.

It IS a 22LR upper and I love shooting 22, so this thing has seen a few 1000 rounds.  But it's 22LR, you'll be hard pressed to wear it out in a lifetime.  Built just like a standard AR so you can change the flash hider with standard stuff.  That's a real barrel, not just a plastic housing with a metal insert like some cheap ar-22 kits.

Comes with absolutely everything that it would come with from Springfield.  Including case, two stainless 7 round magazines.  All books, manuals and safety warnings.  Unused loaded coupon, chamber flag, bore brush, double mag pouch and an OWB holster.

Also has a Wilson Combat flatwire recoil spring kit and GI plug fitted.  These are rated to go 15,000 rounds before replacement and soften the recoil impulse somewhat (always on backorder too) I also replaced the torx bits that hold the grip panels on with regular flathead screw ones.  I hate having to use tools to take apart the gun at the range.  That said, the original torx screws as well as the two piece guiderod and tool are both included in sealed plastic bags.  She has a couple thousand rounds through her, all flawless without a single hiccup.  I cleaned and lubed after every range trip.

Negatives?  Just one, there is a tiny idiot scratch (1911 guys know what I'm talking about).  I took a picture with my finger right next to it.  Can't see it in normal light, and you probably would never have noticed it if I didn't say anything here.

Price for the gun is $1200 OBO.  Willing to ship from my FFL to yours.  Otherwise FTF.  I live in the Portland/Beaverton area and am self employed so meeting times are flexible.

Extra's that are available

9 CMC powermags, still have the original wrappers.  All in great shape - 20 bucks a mag, or 160 for all of them.

Milt Sparks Versamax 2 IWB holster.  Black leather, RH.  Universally heralded for being super comfy and ridiculously concealable.  I LOVE this holster and it hides a full size 1911 very well.  Current backorder if you order one is 4-8 months.  $140

G-Code Incog holster.  Also a very popular item, great for AIWB carry, fully adjustable to use IWB everywhere else.  Not sure what the suede or felt is they put on the outside, but very comfy and very well made.  Another one that takes forever to get, yours for $50

The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly.

This is a rare 1931 Colt Detective Special and not a Police Positive turned into a Detective Special.  It was delivered originally to the Peters Arms Company. This was a division of the Peters Cartridge Company with is today the ""P"" portion of Remington ammo when you see the ""R-P"" stamped into the shell casings.  Colt sold this pistol to Peters Arms on September 9, 1931.  Sometime between this date and 1939 it was imported into Germany.  This is a big deal because Hitler was in control by then and no civilian could own a firearm at that time.  I know it was not imported later than that because the proof stamps used by this armory were not used after 1939 when Germany went to war with the world.  You can do the research yourself if you like and the proof stamps are very clear as a crown over a crown and a ""U"" laying on its side (a.k.a. Cc/U or C/C/U proof marks).  This website will give more information if you wish to confirm for yourself: http://www.germanguns.com/gun-marks . This Pistol also has a ""T"" stamped over the serial number which indicated this revolver was not just test fired at the factory but was actually ""Targeted"" by the factory.  This pistol does not appear to have been fired after the factory.  It was also custom fit for someone because the ""square butt"" grips were modified to the 1933 style ""round butt"".  Whom ever did the modifications was a pure craftsman because it looks like it was done by the factory.

Anyway, I could go on-and-on about the history and uniqueness of this revolver.  I will answer any questions as best I can.  This is a serious bit of Colt and Possibly W.W.II history.  I am asking $1850 for this pistol or will trade it for a Colt Python in like condition.  Please email me with your name and contact information.  I will not respond to low-ball offers, rude people or ridiculous trade offers.  I prefer a Face-to-Face trade but if you are out of Albuquerque and have a Python I will discuss trade options with you but it may not be easy to do for either of us...  But we can talk about it."

America’s favorite pump-action shotgun.

The Remington 870 Express Compact/Youth 20 Gauge Pump Action Shotgun w/21"" Barrel Shotgun makes an excellent, fast-handling field, camping or vehicle  gun. It’s perfect for waterfowl, upland birds, small game and clays.
The classic, ageless ""870"" design also makes it an outstanding shotgun for home protection, security and defense. Like all Model 870s, it features a receiver milled from a solid-steel billet and smooth-cycling twin action bars. The 21 inch long Vent Rib Barrel with Modified Rem Choke balances perfectly with the 13 inch length of the pull stock (1 inch shorter than standard). Both the fore-end and stock are crafted from durable hardwood and feature a low-luster walnut finish and checkering. This pump action comes with a 3"" chamber, 4 + 1 capacity and single bead sight. The metal finish on the gun is matte black. The overall length is 40.5 inches and it weighs ~6.5 pounds. Made in the U.S.A."

I am open to decent offers but I am on the fence, I really like this light and wont part with it easily - I would rather keep it than let it go like I was starving and needed money for food. Will consider trading it plus cash for a good optic like I mentioned above."

You've got 600 rounds of ""vintage"" ammo? What the heck constitutes vintage? m1911 ammo is just .45 acp which is readily available, it isn't rare or only usable in one type of (still readily available) pistol. I can go to Shooters Supply here in Louisville and pay $21 for aluminum case .45 or $25-$27 (thanks to the ammo shortage) for brass. So really, where are you coming from with this outrageous price and awkward wording for this so called ""vintage m1911"" ammo?"

Shooting nearly half MOA groups with factory ammo is a real challenge even for some other high-dollar guns. The CZ-750 does not disappoint.

Although heavy, everything on the rifle feels robust, positive and is located right where it ought to be. From the action to the magazine release to the cheek adjustment knob, everything exudes durability.

(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

Included is the original hard case, the Springfield XD Essentials Package that includes a holster, speed loader and mag pouch, as well as three additional Springfield magazines (for a total of four). This gun has seen a box and a half of ammo through it on two separate range trips. I used it to qualify in my CCDW class and it was fired on one occasion prior to that. No issues at all with the gun, only reason for selling is that I've got my eye on another pistol and the wife has a ""one in, one out"" policy. I will add pictures to the post this evening. Local sale in Lexington only and must have a valid KY license (prefer a CCDW holder). Any questions feel free to ask."

 This is the predecessor to the Winchester 63, which was chambered in the more modern .22 long rifle, so ammo for these is available but not prevalant these days.
 The gun has thin blueing, but a really nice patina and has older German proof marks on the barrel that look to be 1912-1939 vintage, so was probably a pre WW1 German Import.
