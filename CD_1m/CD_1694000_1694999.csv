chambered in 9x18mm ""Makarov""

The pistol is a 1970 Circle 11 model from poland. It is all original and all serial numbers matching (including the origional magazine). It was a issued service weapon with very minimal exterior wear and doesn't seem to hardly been fired.

Ive fired about 100 rounds through it, personally. If your unfamiliar with the 9x18mm ""makarov"" round its slightly larger than a 380acp and slightly smaller than the standard 9mm luger. And the ammo is frequently available and not too exoensive.

The p64 is a very compact pistol and Ive been using it for concealed carry. Its extremely durable because its a mainly steel construction. It is basically the same design as a Walther PPK. It comes with 1origional 6 round magazine and 2 aftermarket steel constructed magazines (also 6rounds each). I am also including a BULLDOG brand shoulder holster that includes a attached dual magazine pouch, 49 rounds of FMJ Wolf ammo and 6 rounds of glaser safety slugs for self defense.

In total Im selling the gun with 3magazines, shoulder holster and 55 rounds of ammo.

Im asking $350 obo, not intetested in trades or barter, cash only and sorry but i will not ship. must meet face to face. Call or text me at REDACTED or email me.

Will not sell to anyone who cannot legally own or possess a hand gun in the state of texas or is planning on using it to commit a crime."

I have a model 629-1 (have not checked with SW, but based on serial number range should be 1980-82 manufacture. The firearm was purchased from original owner who had shot it little and placed it in his safe. At the time of purchase the stainless has obviously aged from sitting and there were a few surface rust marks with no pitting. The revolver was cleaned up and new grips added (Current SW N frame presentation/wooden grips) I also have a pair of Hogue grips for it, maybe even pachmyer. 

Timing is excellent, lock up is tight. Cylinder has some wear mark (line) but minimal. Forcing cone is in good shape and gap is acceptable (on the tighter end when compared to the newer products coming out)

I have put 200 rounds of standard 240 grain 44mag through it with no problems. Shoots straight and freehand at 30 feet/10 yards I am getting one nice big hole on the bulls eye.

I will only deal local, face to face.

20-40 rounds of ammunition (must do a count on what I have left)

The smallest back strap is integrated in the Glock MBS frame reducing the
trigger distance of the standard size frame by approximately .08 in. The
medium back strap adds approximately .08 in. - equaling the size of a
standard frame - and the large back strap increases trigger distance by a
total of approximately .16 in. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is
reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to
switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional
parts. Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual
recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces
the felt recoil while simultaneously increasing the life span of the
assembly. Additionally, the Gen4 has a Rough Textured Frame (RTF) surface
designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as
the interchangeable back straps.

Ideally I would like to get a set of VZ grips in black,black/gray, 10-8 in black/gray, or something along those lines. Since these are my only grips I would like to trade but would ask $175/obo.

There are two spots that I would point out for full disclosure. On the bottom right there is a spot that has been there since I bought them so I'm not sure if it's a factory blem or something happened. There is a small ding near the top (right above the laser) from something nicking them. See pictures for reference.

I'm interested in meeting like minded range enthusiasts who would be willing to share their land they shoot on closer to the eau clare area (hwy q maybe out by big falls?).  I am very safe, organized, respectful and clean.  I always pick up my brass because I reload.  I shoot mainly paper targets but would also like to shoot trap or plinking spinners.  Typical range fees for tilden and the rod and gun club are 15-35 dollars so I'd like to pay you that much to use your land once or twice a week throuout the summer and fall.  I typically shoot on sundays or saturdays...mainly in the morning from 8 or 9 to early afternoon.  
If you have some land that you shoot on and don't mind an occasional guest or two let me know and hopefully we can work something out.  Obviously i want to comply with all ordinances and laws so please only respond if it is in fact legal to shoot on the land in your jurisdiction.

I love the revolver but its not practical for the hog hunting we do. The package comes with the Raging bull, a set of lee reloading dies, a box of winchester factory ammo, 2 holsters, a box of brass, a scope mount and an ammo box. The brass i got from someone, most is new. he primed a few but i never loaded them so i do not know what primers are in the brass. the brass is from starline so it is small rifle primers. Magnum primers need to be used with all casull brass. the leather holster comes with the cartridge belt and then i also have a Bianchi holster for it. the scope mount is a weigand combat scope mount that is matched stainlss like the revolver with a set of weaver grand slam 1"" medium scope rings.. in total i have 100 pieces of brass. You have everything needed to get out and hunt hogs with this and everything to get started reloading for the casull. 



Im mainly looking to trade for lever action rifles or single action pistols. I might take an AR-15. you can send offers, worst i can say is no. For lever actions i really want a 45 colt or 30-30 or both

Bullets are almost as old as the gun but I have shot 20 rounds through it and it shoots fantastic. As you can see the gun has been what some people call sporterised. Basically it’s given a smaller stock causing it to jump from its past weight on 9.5 lbs to 7.8 lbs. That makes it much easier to carry through the woods. It was made in Loewe Berlin Germany and the S/N is E746 which makes this an Antique (any Mauser with a S/N between A-K are considered antique). S/N’s match on the receiver, bolt and trigger mechanism. It does have the O with the X in it on the butt cap and trigger mechanism and on the barrel telling me this was an artillery rifle and all parts are original except the wood.

I bought it from a friend a couple of years ago and have only had the oppurtunity to ride it once since then.  It comes with a pair of brand new size 12 fox racing MX boots, and a brand new fox racing helmet.  Both only used once.  I love it but just don't have the time to ride like I thought I would, and need to make some room in the garage.  There are a lot of extras on the bike too many to list.  The only thing that it needs is a new battery because it has been sitting for so long, it will start put the battery won't hold a charge because its getting old and hasn't seen much use.  I value it at 3250, and would like to do a multi gun trade.  I don't have to that in trade I will probably trade it for a LOT less if you have something nice that I want.  I just want guns and want to get rid of it.  Make me an offer, it will most likely be yes if it isn't stupid low.  Cash would work, but I would much rather do a trade for some guns.  This will be a perfect quad to go riding this summer."

The barrel on this gun is top quality. It's a 16"" heavy barrel with a 1:9 RH twist. Cold hammer forged and chrome lined, this barrel will last for tens of thousands of rounds. The bolt and chamber are also chromed.

I love this gun and will eventually buy another one, but for now I want a lighter, high quality DI AR, so the only trade I will consider is for a high end non-piston AR.

I purchased this ammo back in the early 90's as ""range pickup"" ammo. It was basically the tail ends of machine gun belts, probably coming out of Israel. I de-linked the ammo and tumbled the rounds. As you can see, the cases are not real pretty, but the price is worth a smile. The headstamps are mixed but all are NATO stamped except the ones that have what I believe to be Hebrew characters. This ammo shoots great and if you want to clean it up more, I'm sure you will find a buyer.

I purchased this gun new from Welcher's Gun Shop in Tacoma in 2009. This gun has been a great addition to my collection ever since.  This gun has had about 500 rounds down the pipe and with the exception of a few rounds during the first mag fired it has functioned flawlessly. The gun is in great shape, does have some very light wear on it but its overall 98-99% condition. It has VZ Aztec grips on it, along with the orginals. This has factory night sights marked 09, the finish has rubbed off the sights a bit but not bad. I have the factory box and all of the goodies that come with it. I am looking to get $950 for this gun, I've heard that these are no longer being made but I haven't verified with SA to know for sure.

Like the title says, we have the best deal going on AR15's in the country. We have a bunch of these DSA ZM4 Mid-Length Carbine, and they are priced to sell at $769! These rifles have a 6-position collapsible stock, fluted barrel with flash suppressor, oh so comfortable pistol grip, and an alloy lower. Not only that, these rifles come with a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer, a hard case and a magazine! You simply WON'T find a better deal on a rifle of this quality. Get them at this price while we have them! Give us a call at REDACTED to pick up at our shop in Auburn Washington, or have them shipped to your FFL for $30 wherever you are located and allowed by law. If you'd like to order on our website visit, www.americangunwrangler.com . Thanks!"

 Almost every family has great grandpa's old shotgun. It may have been in the family for generations! It is a keepsake but needs to be put into better shape. Parts may be missing. It may be rusty and the wooden parts deteriorated. You may simply want the old thing professionally cleaned -OR- you may want it put into LIKE NEW shape! Perhaps you wish to present this family treasure, fully restored for Father's Day? Or a birthday? Don't wait. It may take us DAYS to complete your project - once we get yours in line. 
 We have a huge inventory or antique and hard-to-find parts along with hundreds of stocks and forearms. If we don’t have the antique part we may have to order it or – even MAKE it. As an example, most of the guns we restore are over 100 years old! As of right now, firearms pre 1899 are considered antique and are EXEMPT from federal law & ATF rules.
 We can offer Professional Results. 
 Your family heirloom will look, ""Good as great Grandpa bought it!""
 We are not a dealer and do not sell guns. However, we can restore your family treasure to its original out-of-the box appearance. Each project is priced based upon the customer's request and the current condition of the piece. Most of our projects are old shotguns and rifles. We accept antique gun projects from all states.

965,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1694965,For Sale:  Remington 870 Express 20 gauge magnum; home defender w/ lots of ammo!,"Lincoln and Hydraulic, Wichita, Kansas",$ 600,"Listed On: Thursday, May 30, 2013",Shotguns,Remington                                                                                ,20 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This package deal comes with 700 rounds of ammo!!!  What a deal!

Since I am having a hard time selling my ceramics on time to pay rent, I am forced to sell my favorite home defender.  It is a Remington 870 Express in 20 gauge magnum.  (Of course, it will take any 20 gauge shell regardless of length.)

It features a Knoxx Blackhawk recoil-reducing, adjustable length of pull stock with a pistol grip.  It is a very comfortable firearm no matter what your build is.  It has an 18.5 inch barrel, with a magazine extension that ends flush with the muzzle.  The barrel is a smooth bore with cylinder choke.  (I think that means no choke, or perhaps minimal choke.)

It will hold 5 + 1 with 2 3/4"" shells or shorter, and will hold 4 + 1 with magnum shells.

Also included is LOTS of ammo, a soft case for storage or transport, and 121 empty shells for reloading.

Ammo includes: A box of 5 magnum (3"") slugs; 26 2 3/4"" slugs; 15 rounds of #3 buckshot; plus another 653 rounds of bird shot.  Most of the bird shot is #8 or #7 1/2 shot, but there are also a few boxes of #6; several rounds of #5; and a few boxes of #4 shot.

All total there are around 700 rounds of ammunition!  (+ / - a few for counting error.)

The shotgun functions flawlessly, and is the PERFECT weapon for home defense for ANY man or woman with a lighter frame, such as me.  Yes, a 12 gauge packs more punch, but also has MUCH more recoil.  This 20 gauge looks menacing, will stop anyone, and is a true joy to shoot.  Anyone could shoot this shotgun all day long and not have a sore shoulder.  (Just don't forget the hearing protection.)  Try doing that with a 12 gauge.

If you need a home defender now and can't find ammo for anything else, this is the tool for you!  This is perfect to have in the house for the wife or teenager, or even the man of the house.

Asking $600 for all, I will not break up firearm and ammo, so please don't ask.  

Call or text me today.  If this doesn't sell by the time I pay rent, I will take down the listing as I DON'T want to sell.  316 - seven 3 four - 5 zero 31   Please, no e-mails, as I don't have internet at the house and only check it once or twice a day.  Do not expect a quick response if you e-mail me."
