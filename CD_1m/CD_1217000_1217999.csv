The original handguard is also included in case you prefer the classic Spanish CETME/FAL/G3 look or don't need the added bulk of the rail.

I've taken this gun out a few times, less than 500 rounds through it. There's very minimal surface rust in some small crevice areas near the sling mount, and the rear sight is missing the aperture, spring, pin, and ball bearing - this can be purchased for a total of $21 at https://www.buymilsurp.com/rifle-parts-accessories-cetme-rifle-parts-accessories-c-3548_368.html?page=2&sort=20a. It's a simple installation, I just lost mine after a recent disassembly and don't want to deal with it. I've knocked $40 off my intended price to cover your time and expense.

Beyond that, this rifle is in great condition and you'll be getting 80 rounds of Brown Bear .308 and 60 rounds of Silver Bear 140 Grain SP as well.

Priced below many comparable semi-auto .308's, this is a solid ""battle rifle"" package. The weight of the rifle helps keep the .308 recoil manageable. Even out of the 16"" barrel, the .308 round still provides a great advantage over 5.56/.223 in many ways. The flash hider works well, and you'll find it's relatively easy stay on target with your follow up shots.

If you're on the fence about getting a larger caliber than the average semi-auto rifle, this is a very manageable .308 for well below the currently inflated price of an AR-15 and you'll have plenty left for ammo and range time."

I have decided to let go of my 1911 parts, which are a collection that was amassed over decades of collecting.  These are rare parts, and if you have a WWI 1911 that has incorrect parts on it, the value is hurt significantly.  

So, the investment of a couple hundred dollars to make yours correct, could increase the value by 4x or 5x that amount, or more.  When knowing collectors look at a 1911, they scrutinize every part, and expect it to be right.

Here is all I have, and the prices (the number corresponds with the tag in the photo - due to Armslist size restrictions, there is a Photobucket link below to copy / paste in your browser):

18: Two-tone ""R"" stamped (Risdon Mfg Co.) magazine = $125
19: Two-tone ""R"" stamped (Risdon Mfg Co.) magazine = $100
20: Two-tone ""R"" stamped (Risdon Mfg Co.) magazine = $100
56: Wooden 'Double Diamond' grips (pair) = $275
54: Wooden 28-row Checkered grips (pair) = $300
55: Wooden 'Double Diamond' grips (pair) = $300
57: Wooden 28-row Checkered grip (single / rt panel only) = $50
10: Vertical ""H P"" barrel = $300
9: Intertwined ""H P"" barrel = $300
31: Long Trigger = $100
32: Long Trigger = $125
44: Checkered slide stop = $110
45: Checkered slide stop = $110
46: Checkered slide stop = $110
36: Flat mainspring housing = $100
48: Long wide-spur hammer with bordered checkering = $110
49: Long wide-spur hammer with no border on checkering = $110
50: Long wide-spur hammer checkered to edge, no border = $110
27: Short-tang grip safety = $70
1: Slide, has early U-notch rear sight, narrow front sight, and ""M1911 A1 US ARMY"" on right side - complete with firing pin, extractor, and firing-pin stop = $400

If you are serious about buying, please e-mail me what you are interested in.

I will only take a USPS or Western Union money order - no PayPal, for reasons of philosophy.

As it relates to my prices, I have put them under what eBay auctions are closing at for like parts, and what I'm seeing at shows.  

I beg you, please do not send me an e-mail complaining about where I've set my prices.  I am not forcing anyone to buy them, and if you are a serious collector, you know what they're worth.  Look at what correct WWI barrels are selling for on eBay ($400+).  Grips are astronomical in price, but again, if you have an otherwise correct WWI USGI 1911, and it has after-market grips on it, it really hurts value.

If you buy multiple parts, I may work with you on price a LITTLE, but I am not going to give them away.  These are getting harder and harder to find, and are only going up in price.  We're coming up on the 100th anniversary of WWI, which is going to cause a spike in prices as well.

I will consider trades, but nothing modern.  Would need to be militaria (helmets, firearms, inert ordnance, etc) from WWI or WWII, any country.

M203 GRIP WITH BATTERY HANDLE. 2 AA batteries or 2 Lithium 123 batteries can be stored in the 71G-700. If you want a storage compartment for your batteries or other small objects, there is only one handle for your grip. The Battery Handle will hold the most popular batteries and is designed with two main objectives: keep them dry and keep them from rattling. To meet those objectives, the cap has an o-ring seal and there is a spring inside the handle compartment. The Battery Handle is 4-1/2"" long and 1-1/2"" wide. The Battery Handle has a specially contoured interior allowing AA batteries (Night Vision) to slide inside the compartment side by side. Three, side-by-side, AAA batteries can also use the contoured interior to be quietly stored. At the bottom of the Battery Handle compartment is a spring. Two Flashlight 3Volt batteries are placed one on top of the other. The resulting spring tension keeps these batteries quietly in place. The CR2 Sight batteries can also be stacked and stored quietly.

199,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1217199,For Sale/Trade:  Bushnell Zoom Dot Trophy Riflescope (1X26),"Aloha, Portland, Oregon",$ 200,"Listed On: Friday, March 8, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I bought two red dot sights for my Ruger 22/45 LITE. I decided to keep the Bushnell Trophy since it's just a few ounces lighter, has 4 reticle choices for 4X the plinking fun, and it is the less expensive of the options. The scope has only been mounted but that can can if I ever make it to the range.

So, I'm selling the Bushnell Zoom Dot Trophy Riflescope (1X26) for $200 or trade for a NAA Revolver in .22LR or towards something else fun on the range. Prefer ftf near Beaverton.

I have no complaints from my brief experience with the Zoom Dot. With the single scope mount, it is easier to balance the pistol and I do like the flip-up covers that can't be misplaced. Another plus is that the mount may work as a see through mount for open sights on a rifle."

This new MGI upper receiver is completely compatible with your M16 (small front pin) lower receiver and allows the user to change barrels in just seconds. Go from a 16"" to a 20"" barrel down to a 10"" barrel in seconds with no tools. This allows the system to be extremely compact and concealable It can fit and travel in a small backpack or laptop case as well as giving the operator the option of having multiple barrels for multiple functions. It's as simple as changing just a bolt and barrel on this system the user will be able to fire 7 plus calibers including .22 rimfire, .223 or 5.56, 6.5 grendel, 6.8 spc, .450 thumper, .458 socom, and the .50 beowolf. The best part of our QCB Upper Receiver is that it utilizes standard M16 barrels! Take a close look at the photos and you will see that the barrel is a standard M16 barrel with the Delta Ring, barrel nut, sling swivel and front handguard keeper removed. That's right, you can use standard barrels just by removing the items mentioned above! The New QCB-D model now is compatible with piston systems!!! The rails have also been changed to create less sharp edges against the shooter's hand as well as creating cleaner lines and appearance. This is the latest revision with multiple improvements such as Hard Coat Anodized Mil Spec Finish, four full-length Picatinny style rails, new locking arm retention system and more. This upper is built on to a PSA lower but if you upgrade to The Complete MARCK 15 5.56 Weapon System. The MARCK 15, also known as the ""Hydra"" with the Modular Lower Receiver, you can purchase and utilize the rest of ever-growing system including our various magazine wells and caliber conversions. Change barrels in seconds and utilize the correct magazine for the caliber you desire. With several magazine wells and caliber conversions already available, and many more coming into production, this weapon system continues to grow and become the most versatile Black Rifle platform the industry has ever seen. I have a lower you can get as well but when you upgrade to a mag well change you can get the rest of the system. To build this complete upper alone retails at $1250 if you build it.

     I looked it up, suggested retail is anywhere from 549-599, feel free to make offer, however low balls will not even be responded to.

     Not really looking to trade, but not completely closed to it either, worst I can say is no, but be advised, I am not paying inflated prices, and I will come out ahead on any type of trade.  No Hi-point Pistols need be offered, rifles ok, no 45's, no odd caliber hunting rifles etc.

It features either a Mil Dot, Tactial Milling Reticle, or P4 Reticle and you can outfit it with a variety of performance-enhancing accessories.

With either a Leupold® Mil Dot reticle, Leupold Tactical Milling Reticle (TMR®), or P4 Reticle the Leupold Mark 4® spotting scope enables a sniper and spotter to view the same targets the same way."

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable
operation and function.

Factory description: The Saiga-12 IZSL- 433 is a 030-type semi-automatic shotgun based on the famous design of standard Saiga IZ-109. The shotgun is equipped with a magazine guide (magwell) and an automatic last round bolt hold open device in order to help facilitate easy reloads and insertion of the magazine. It also has a self regulating gas system, which is unique from all other Siaga-12 shotguns. The top cover features a Picatinny rail on top allowing various optical devices to be attached to aid in sighting. The top cover is also hinged to the rear sight block in order to provide the top-mounted Picatinny rail with the ability to hold zero. An adjustable rear notched sight and front sight post are also standard on the shotgun to assist in accurate firing when no optical device is affixed.

III*) manufactured by India's Ishapore factory. Details below: 

* The rifle is in overall excellent condition. Nose cap, sights, barrel, receiver, and magazine all match. While the bolt does NOT match, this is very common for Indian rifles, often stripped of the bolt before being stored. 

* The nosecap is correct; aside from having matching numbers, the stacking swivel lug remains undrilled, as all Ishapores were. 

* Original 2000m sights, numbers-matching.

* Ishapore screw is present, this isn't one of the later hex bolts. 

* The buttstock bears the ""TDE"" stamp that signifies post-Independence manufacture. 

* The bore of this rifle is, simply put, fucking gorgeous. Seriously. I put 50 rounds of Partizan through it after acquiring the rifle a while back, and it's been cleaned and oiled ever since. The lands and grooves are razor sharp, almost brand new. 

* Brass buttplate and the buttstock show signs of regular use, very nice condition. The wooden furniture is in excellent condition overall; the only damage is a little bit of missing wood on the upper rear hand guard, like somebody tried to pry it up too aggressively and chipped a small bit off. 

* The stampings on the action's wrist really mark the rifle as special: They read ""GRI 1948 No. 1 Mk. 3*"". Prior to August 15, 1947 India was still a British colony; as such all rifles would be stamped GRI for ""Georgius Rex, Imperator"". Post August 15, 1947 rifles should be stamped RFI for ""Rifle Factory, Ishapore"". As such, this is what's known as a ""transition rifle"" due to it's being manufactured post-Independence on British tooling, by workers that were British-trained. This isn't a sloppy 60's .308, it's just as good as a BSA or Lithgow made during the Interwar years. 

* Chambered in .303. 

This is an awesome rifle that's in amazing shape and has a great history. It's all-original save for the bolt, but aside from not being numbers-matching the bolt is a proper Indian example. I'm selling to generate money for a nice Enfield .22 trainer that I've got a line on. 

I have more pictures available upon request. 

$525 is pretty firm. I might be willing to consider negotiating or trades a bit if the buyer's serious. Face-to-face meetings preferred: I will ship the rifle to an FFL, but The buyer pays shipping and transfer fees, tacked onto the final cost.

STG 44 in 22 lr with 25 round magazine. It is all metal and wood made in Germany by GSG (Only thing Poly is the mag on this gun). The StG 44 is a full weight, almost exact replica of the original 8×33 Kurz rifle that is said to be the predecessor to the Kalashnikov AK47, as well as all of the other assault rifles spanning the decades after WWII. It comes in the Amish handmade wooden crate you see here in the pictures. As a collector’s item, the original StG 44 is out of the reach of most American collectors, in part because the original was select fire and therefore banned from import by the 1986 machinegun law. In semi-auto .22LR rimfire, not only can you own a gun with the original look and feel of the real StG 44, you will be able to shoot it cheaply, and it will itself be a big collector’s item as we go down the road.

This is not a dubious late war Izevhsk, but a solid rifle.  It is one of the better Mosin Nagants, next to the Finnish Mosins with FN barrels (which I already own and love.)  This is a nice Mosin, with matching numbers and it will shoot well as is, the trigger is pretty good.  I would clean up the trigger a bit for a great trigger break ( or you could drop a Timney trigger in, but it really doesn't need that, unless that is what you like.) .  If you wanted, bedding it in a new composite thumbhole stock, isn't a bad option considering the overall barrel, receiver and trigger quality.  The magazine floor plate was armory re-numbered, but that is common.  There is still Cosmoline on the gun and I have never fired this.  I should probably keep this gun, but I need to make room in the safe as I have been re-arranging my collection."

Patriot Brown
7.62 NATO

Brand New & In Stock!! NO credit card fees!!


The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed (not included), and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

For many folks,  147gr bullets are the current way to go in 9mm ammo.  The increase in weight allows more flexibility in terminal ballistics.  The trick (for hollow points) is to find a load with adequately high velocity. That’s something the “standard” manufactures are not likely to do anytime soon in this bullet weight. 

Enter Double Tap.

The Double Tap Company specializes in doing what’s necessary to get velocities up while maintaining industry standards in pressure. Double Tap ammunition is loaded for high performance through any firearm. This ammunition is new-production, non-corrosive in boxer-primed, reloadable nickel-plated brass cases. 

These 147gr +P Double Tap rounds are about as good as you can get for any 9mm pistol. They weren’t easy to get BEFORE last December, and good luck these days. I took these in on trade in Mid-January, and allowed a bunch for them because I knew what they were.

The other rounds;, the 147gr FMJ flat-point Federal rounds will allow you to know what your weapon does with this bullet weight. The 115gr Winchester ball ammo is currently the world ""standard"" in 9mm. With this 9mm ammo lot, you have both proper practice rounds, some standard practice ammo and a comfortable supply of the best stuff.

I won’t advertise the muzzle velocity of the Double Tap rounds here, but check it
out for yourself here, along with the reviews . . . .

If you are serious about buying, please e-mail me what you are interested in.

I will only take a USPS or Western Union money order - no PayPal, for reasons of philosophy.

As it relates to my prices, I have put them under what eBay auctions are closing at for like parts, and what I'm seeing at shows.

I beg you, please do not send me an e-mail complaining about where I've set my prices. I am not forcing anyone to buy them, and if you are a serious collector, you know what they're worth. Look at what correct WWI barrels are selling for on eBay ($400+). Grips are astronomical in price, but again, if you have an otherwise correct WWI USGI 1911, and it has after-market grips on it, it really hurts value.

If you buy multiple parts, I may work with you on price a LITTLE, but I am not going to give them away. These are getting harder and harder to find, and are only going up in price. We're coming up on the 100th anniversary of WWI, which is going to cause a spike in prices as well.

I will consider trades, but nothing modern. Would need to be militaria (helmets, firearms, inert ordnance, etc) from WWI or WWII, any country.

This shotgun was offered in both aluminum and steel receiver configurations with the aluminum receivers featuring a variety of finish colors.The 3 versions offered include the Standard as the only steel receiver version, Twelvette, and Twentyweight which used the aluminium receiver. All Double Automatic's are 12 gauge. Various configurations were available for choke, barrel length, and barrel type. The firearm was produced between 1955 and 1971, with production volume of approximately 67,000.

This firearm features a unique loading port on the left side of the receiver.As the first round is loaded, the shell is lifted by a mechanism and chambered by the bolt; once the bolt is closed, the lifting mechanism returns to the resting position below the loading port, where the next round can then be loaded. Upon firing the chambered round, the shell in the loading port is automatically chambered. The total capacity is 2 with 1 chambered round and 1 in the loading port.
US Patent #2,586,509 issued to Val Browning Feb 19, 1952

Walking Liberty Half Dollars, all are in at least VG-VF condition. Some dates mixed in are ""scarce"" but none are ""rare"". This is excellent barter silver that you alone only need to know about and no one else. I am asking for no orders smaller than twenty (20) coins for ($240.00) but buy 100 coins or more and the per coin price drops to just $11.50 so $1150.00 gets you 100 US Walking Liberty HALF DOLLARS. Melt value alone is over $10.00 for Walkers. see http://www.coinflation.com/

I will meet you at a west side bank here in Tucson so there is no delivery or shipping and handling fees like if you bought them on line. Assuming a coin store has to charge taxes you won't pay any taxes either.

Compare with: Walking Liberty Half Dollar Rolls VG-XF, 20 coins $269.00 plus shipping. . .which is the best bulk coin price I can find on line for these coins.

CASH ONLY, . The price is firm, you get the number of half dollars we agree upon and we make the deal, they are selling so get your coins now. These Walking Liberty Half Dollars are a piece of history and the way I see it silver can only gain in value as the dollar drops."
