14,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1859014,For Sale:  Nearly a Million rounds of Factory brass cased .223 and .30 Carbine,"Leesburg, Sterling, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 100,"Listed On: Saturday, September 14, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am currently working with a wholesale liquidation company to resolve the holdings of the Former ammunition Manufacturer American Ammunition, or A-Merc.

A-Merc went bankrupt for several reasons, including Quality Control, and much of the ammunition that was being liquidated is scrap. However, the liquidators have a team of personnel inspecting every single round for sale. Every single round for sale gets tumbled, chamber checked, and visually inspected. Rounds that fail any part of the process are rejected, and sold off for components. Rounds that pass are sold in bulk.

The first of the rifle rounds that are part of the lot are brass cased .223 rounds. Most of the bullets (>95%) are 55gr FMJ with Boat Tail and a cannelure bullet. The other 5% tend to be 62gr FMJ Rounded nose bullets. All have a loading of approximately 23gr of powder. These rounds will frequently have hairline cracks on the neck - However, they will be safe to shoot. I've shot approximately 800 so far, with no ill effect. They are generally low quality brass, so I would not expect significant reload value from them. There are approximately 600,000 rounds of .223 that are being moved. 

The second rifle round is brass cased .30 Carbine rounds. These have a 110gr FMJ round nose bullet, and have 13 grains of powder charge. The brass on these rounds is better - you will have success in reloading the brass, though it is still not high quality. There are approximately 100,000 rounds of .30 Carbine.

There will tend to be cosmetic blemishes on some of the ammo. While the inspection and cleaning process will disqualify unsafe rounds, expect occasional dents or scratches that will not affect safety. These are from the storage and shipping of the ammunition. Both rounds will be packed and sold in bulk boxes to weight - the weight is determined to be a quantity over 1000 rounds, so expect some extra to account for variability in weight. 

Price on the .223 is $400/1000

Price on the .30 Carbine is $350/1000

I also have rounds that were rejected for sale, at deep discount. I must stress that these are for component salvage only, and not for firing. For the .223, expect to see a significant quantity of damaged casings, but a high recovery rate on the bullets (>900 per box). For the .30 Carbine, expect to see about 50% recovery on bullets or brass. Of course, all the brass is primed, which you can salvage, and all complete bullets have the powder. I do not have data on the powder, I'm afraid. Customers have reported loading the powder to the same loadings as factory with success, but I recommend disposal of the powder, without load data. 

Price on the Rejects are $100/1000, and the boxes tend to be very generous, on the order of 1050-1100 rounds. The rejects and ammo are sold completely as is. 

I conduct weekly pickups of ammo in Leesburg and Sterling. I am also happy to ship at only UPS ground shipping. Trades offers are welcome."

It has an awesome set trigger with a 2lb pull, this allows for much more accurate long range shots, extended rubber buttplate, factory scope rings, and attached 5 round magazine. In addition to the adjustable iron sights a NC Star 6-20x50 mm scope comes with it.
The CZ 550 FS features a classic Bavarian-style Mannlicher stock, steel muzzle cap and a 3-position safety. This safety is unique in the CZ line to the FS, It locks the bolt and is on 'safe' when fully to the rear, remains on 'safe' with the bolt unlocked for unloading in the mid position and is ready to fire with the bolt unlocked in the forward position.
While the aesthetics of this model remind us of rifles from times gone by, with its short 20.6"" barrel, fast handling stock and iron sights, it is even today perhaps the most appropriate configuration for quick shots required when hunting in dense cover.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A."

135,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1859135,"For Sale:  Half a Million rounds of Handgun Ammo - 9mm .38spl, .38Super, .32acp","Leesburg, Sterling, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 250,"Listed On: Saturday, September 14, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am currently working with a wholesale liquidation company to resolve the holdings of the Former ammunition Manufacturer American Ammunition, or A-Merc.

A-Merc went bankrupt for several reasons, including Quality Control, and much of the ammunition that was being liquidated is scrap. However, the liquidators have a team of personnel inspecting every single round for sale. Every single round for sale gets tumbled, chamber checked, and visually inspected. Rounds that fail any part of the process are rejected, and sold off for components. Rounds that pass are sold in bulk.

There will tend to be cosmetic blemishes on some of the ammo. While the inspection and cleaning process will disqualify unsafe rounds, expect occasional dents or scratches that will not affect safety. These are from the storage and shipping of the ammunition. Both rounds will be packed and sold in bulk boxes to weight - the weight is determined to be a quantity over 1000 rounds, so expect some extra to account for variability in weight. The handgun ammunition brass is low quality, but may offer several reloads before expiring. 

The 9mm is Brass 115gr FMJ round nosed ammunition. There are also some 117gr Hollowpoints, and 115gr frangible rounds that are generally separated, and sold separately. 

The 32acp is brass 73gr FMJ round nosed ammunition

There are two kinds of .38 Special - There is 158gr Lead round nosed ammunition, and 158gr FMJ flat nose ammunition. 

The .38Super is 115gr FMJ Round nosed ammunition

All the ammunition is packed in Bulk boxes of a 1000 by weight. The weights have been calibrated to exceed 1000 rounds, so expect several extra rounds. The prices are as follows:

9mm: $300
32 Auto: $250
38Special - Lead: $300
38Special - FMJ: $350
38 Super - $300

I also have rounds that were rejected for sale, at deep discount. I must stress that these are for component salvage only, and not for firing. All the brass is primed, which you can salvage, and all complete bullets have the powder. I do not have data on the powder, I'm afraid. Customers have reported loading the powder to the same loadings as factory with success, but I recommend disposal of the powder, without load data. Generally, rejects occur because of bad bullets or bad brass - expect a higher recovery (70%+) of brass on the 32, 38super, and 9mm. Expect no more than 50% recovery on either brass or bullets for .38spl. 

Price on the Rejects are $100/1000, and the boxes tend to be very generous, on the order of 1050-1100 rounds. The rejects and ammo are sold completely as is. 

I conduct weekly pickups of ammo in Leesburg and Sterling. I am also happy to ship at only UPS ground shipping. Trades offers are welcome."

I make each one-of-a-kind set of custom grips by hand from some of the finest domestic or exotic hardwoods and create them to precisely fit the preeminent 1911 pistol.

The grips are then polished smooth and finished with a hand-rubbed oil/oil blend.  The work is meticulously performed by hand to ensure the details expected in a distinct, high-quality set of custom grips.

I make each one-of-a-kind set of custom grips by hand from some of the finest domestic or exotic hardwoods and create them to precisely fit the preeminent 1911 pistol.

This is the same rifle as the PSA 16"" M4 Premium Carbine. It was purchased as a separate flat top upper assembly and a separate lower receiver and parts kit. I assembled it myself. The lower receiver is marked ""multi"" and can fire both 5.56 Nato and .223 Rem ammo. It comes with a Rock River Arms chrome bolt carrier group.  This rifle has 200 rounds through it (170 rounds of .223 with 40 rounds being steel cased ammo, and 30 rounds of XM855 5.56x45 62 grain ammo.) without a single malfunction of any sort. It comes with 430 rounds of ammo (390 rounds of Federal XM855 5.56x45mm 62 grain FMJ ball ammo in the ammo can, 1 box of Winchester Ranger 60 grain .223, and 1 box of Herter's 55 grain steel cased .223) along with 6 magazines (3 steel magazines with gray magpul followers, 2 steel magazines with green followers, and one Gen2 PMAG). This rifle comes with an A2 rear sight with dual aperture for both close range and longer range shooting. The rifle will come in a US PeaceKeeper nylon zip case with 4 pouches for magazines and a zip-shut pocket for other necessities while you are at the range.

There was a spot on the ejection port side (right side) where tool marks were left while installing the roll pin while assembling the trigger guard. The spot was touched up with an off brand (not birchwood casey) gun bluing by a buddy of mine....but it is still able to be seen. I've attempted to show the spot in the last picture. It could be touched up with some aluminum black for a better match with the rest of the finish. In no way does this compromise the safety or function of the firearm. Other than that, this rifle is in fantastic shape with very few other handling marks (one on the opposite side of the trigger guard, and one by the bolt catch from my ring). More pictures are available if you are interested.

I have over $1,600 into this package. That said, I don't expect anybody to pay what I paid for it. $1,100 Cash only. All State and Federal laws apply (24 hour wait, valid FOID card, record of transfer, etc). I am not looking to travel a great distance for this sale, but with that said I go to the IL QC's 5 days a week for work. Would also travel as far east as Rockford...possibly DeKalb if you are from a suburb where this firearm is legal to own. I would consider selling to an Iowa or Wisconsin resident if you have a valid permit to purchase and/or a valid ccw permit along with the record of transfer. If you have any questions, just ask. Thanks for looking."

I have shot a couple boxes of 200 grainers through it & can get about 1.25 inches at 100 yards. It will probably do better if you play with the loads. Nice recoil pad to soften the recoil.

The Protector Polymer in .38 Special +P blends a unique design with modern updates that weighs in at a scant 18.2 ounces. This smart little number draws quickly with a full spur hammer. Just like its cousins it's a best buy in its size, now in a cool new set-up with Ribber rubber grips and a red fiber-optic front sight. A transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear and the Taurus Security System consists of a keyed, quarter-turn style socket-head screw which can be set to prevent the hammer from pivoting back into the frame, thus rendering the weapon inoperative.
We will ship to the lower 48 where legal for only $25.

These Amazing CHF barrels are extremely durable with a 20,000+ round service life. These CHF barrels are turned to ST's New Optimum barrel Profile. This New profile is lighter than government profile but beefier than a lightweight profile, it's an ""Optimum"" profile. It weighs 26.4oz with M4 Barrel extension and no FSB on the 16"" Barrel. The barrels have a .750"" gas block seat with a properly sized gas port and the muzzle is threaded perfectly concentric to the Bore with 1/2x28 threads. These CHF barrels are made to the Mil-Spec for the M249 SAW. The Cold Hammer Forging process Work Hardens the steel around a rifled mandrel, which creates the lands and grooves. These barrels are chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 Twist Rate. The barrel blanks are the correct Certified CMV material and they are also Hard Chrome lined to the M249 SAW Mil-Spec, which is almost twice as thick as the Hard Chrome on a Mil-Spec M4. The End Result is a Rifle that can be Run Hard Day after Day! Each barrel is HPT and MPI. They have Mil-Spec M4 barrel extensions, Mil-Spec Phosphate finish on the outside (under the front sight base as well).

DESCRIPTION
We started by improving the optical configurations which lowered the F-stop factor and increased optical resolution. By doing this, more light travels through the lens to the tube. More light and better resolution simply means brighter and sharper image. Then we added our precision ""Red on Green"" aiming system, easy push button operation, reticle brightness adjustment and our detachable most powerful in the industry 450 mW Infrared Illuminator with dedicated windage and elevation adjustments. Our ATN Aries MK 390 Weapon Sight is the best 1st Generation scope on the market.
The ATN Aries MK 390 easily mounts onto any U.S. standard 7/8"" weaver or Picatinny rail.

Do your homework & read reviews & you will see it is a very nice Rifle. I have the original box & paperwork & the reciept from when I bought it. I'm only selling it because I found a Christian's 308 for $3, 500 that I would rather have. I have only shot exactly 100 rounds out of it . I know that because I shot 2 50 round boxes out of it. It has only just begun to start the break in process. You will save yourself a little money on a gun that's just as good as you would get in a store.

Also trigger guard has been professionally undercut to allow you to get a higher grip purchase. I am only looking to trade for a few things that I will list below all other offers will be ignored and I'm not interested in cash. The only reason I want to trade is that I carry this regularly and now that it is summer the gen4 grip is rubbing me the wrong way literally. The gen 4 is about $100 to $150 more that the gen 3 and its worth it for the reduced recoil due to the double recoil spring so I think anyone who trades with me will be getting a good deal.

Since 1999, Kahr Arms has been proud to support the legacy of the Auto-Ordnance Corporation, the original maker of the famous Thompson submachine gun. To ensure the historical accuracy of the Auto-Ordnance design, Kahr researched the original engineering drawings. Hundreds of U.S. military microfiche and hand drawings of the Thompson models dating back to 1919 were examined.

The Thompson submachine gun is a historical firearm. Each model is the union of original design, quality materials and fine workmanship. An American Legacy preserved. Thompson was carried by the gangsters in the 20’s and trusted by the troops in WWII.  Find out how it feels to carry a piece of history before legislature and politics put this design back on the shelf.

High Standard Manufacturing Corporation of Hamden, Connecticut started production on their Model 102 series. These were radical guns for their time, and attracted a lot of attention with their futuristic design features. No other .22 pistols were quite like them. There were four basic models. The Supermatic Trophy was the top of the line, with a high polish and gold-plated trigger. The Supermatic Citation was identical except for finish, and had plastic grips instead of the walnut grips of the Trophy. The Olympic Trophy and Citation models were chambered for the .22 short cartridge, and were designed for Olympic rapid-fire competition. There were two different configurations of the Olympic series, one designed as an out-of-the-box contender in ISU (International Shooting Union) competition. It had a unique 6 ¾” barrel with an integral rather than a detachable stabilizer. At the Pan-American games of 1959, the .22 rapid-fire champion, runner-up and the entire 4-man winning United States team all used Hi-Standard Olympic Citations. Captain Bill McMillan of the United States Marine Corps won a .22 rapid-fire Olympic gold medal in Rome with an ISU Olympic in 1960. The fourth model of the 102 series was the Tournament, a no-frills economy model without some of the advanced features of the more expensive guns. Each of these models would accept different barrels interchangeably. Barrels offered were a 10-incher with an integral rear sight over the chamber, an 8-incher with integral rear sight, and a 6 ¾-incher with no rear sight. The rear sight was mounted on the slide on this model, giving a longer sight radius than even the 10-inch barrels. Many tournament shooters accordingly preferred this length of barrel. At Camp Perry, Ohio in 1959, Hi-Standards were used in a clean sweep of the first 3 places in the .22-caliber championship. In fact, the Hi-Standard guns of this period routinely outnumbered all other makes on the line, and in most cases were more prevalent than all other makes combined! The High Standard company touted these facts in their advertisements in the gun press, and sales soared."
