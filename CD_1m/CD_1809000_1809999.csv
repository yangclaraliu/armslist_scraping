Rifle has 200 rounds through it and has never been outside or in the rain. Just can't justify a second 10/22 rifle for as little as I use it. I'd be willing to move a little on price without the mags otherwise it is firm. I'm not shipping but I will travel if it is fairly close to Milwaukee. Thanks

Was originally my GF's gun, she bought it back in January of this year. Had Glockmeister install a 3.5# connector and factory extended slide stop lever, had pearce +2 extensions installed on the 2 G26 mags, and bought 2 KCI 15 round G19 mags and put A&G Grip sleeves on them. Everything works great, she was just never able to shoot the Glock as accurately as other guns, so she is taking my XDm and I am putting this for sale. 

We have $500+tax into the gun, $15 each for the KCI mags, $11 each for the grip sleeves, $12 each for the Pearce extensions, $13 for the Ghost connector and $17 for the factory extended slide stop lever. (easily $650 invested) Plus I have a Lone Wolf G26 barrel that I paid $100 for. 
I have the factory G26 mag floor plates for sure, I will have to do some digging, but pretty sure I have the factory slide stop lever and trigger connector as well. 

I will let the gun and 2 factory mags with the installed parts go for $525. If you want the 15 round mags with sleeves as well then the price is $560. If you want it all with the extra barrel then I would be looking for $650."

I am not all that anxious to get rid of it but do have another rifle I am wanting.  This rifle is not a safe queen and has been around the world a couple of times.  Everything works perfectly and there has never been any major damage.  Just wear in the blueing and normal marking on the stock that comes from use.  The bore is like new.  This rifle shoots very well and the action and trigger are far better than what was made by Winchester since.

The Polish MAG 98 9mm /9x19 NATO caliber pistol is an improved variation of the original Polish MAG95. 
It was produced for the Polish Special Forces, Border Guard and Prison Guard (Straż Więzienna) in the 1990's. 
Made in the Z.M. Lucznik factory 11 at Radom Poland. 

These fine pistols feature a ambidextrous decocker safety, steel slide, alloy frame, and serrated trigger guard front strap.
In 1996 the Mag 98 was evaluated for adoption purposes by the Polish Army. It had advantages over its competition such as 
better reliability, durability and safety (better protection against accidental discharge, when dropped). 

Although the quality was deemed superior, the MAG 98 was rejected by the Army because the frame was slightly larger
than the contract qualifications called for. That was a shame because most service members prefered it and in fact 
the pistol has a good reputation among users: It is considered a precise, well balanced and durable weapon 
and its mass leads to good stability during firing. 

This double/single action pistol comes with ONE 15rd magazine."

It has the owners manual as well as a set of rechargeable batteries and changer I'll throw in along with everything it came with. YouTube this sight to get a feel and appreciation for it, along with the ability to record like a camera, but here's the website description along with the link. Oh and I am open to trades and partials.
Digital riflescope Digisight N550 is a perfect combination of the latest developments in the field of optics and electronics by Pulsar. Along with good optical characteristics (fast aperture focusable lens 50 mm ƒ1.0, 67 mm eye relief) the riflescope features a wide range of options which allow it to be tuned to one's personal needs. The riflescope uses a highly sensitive CCD array (with a range of operation illumination 0.00003 - 30000 lux), image is transmitted to a VGA display, 640x480 pixels. The Digisight N550 also has Sum Light™ function which automatically increases CCD array sensitivity under low light conditions. The screen displays information on operation status (running time, low battery indicator, camera operation mode). One of the remarkable features is the possibility of zeroing the riflescope not only in the traditional manner but also using a new “one shot zeroing” method. This makes the zeroing procedure significantly faster and more convenient.

suppressor is a natural evolution in the design and manufacture of
a firearm silencer.  This suppressor utilizes the same tube
specifications as well as the same stainless tube retaining ring as
the Mystic, but instead of using stainless steel as the material for
the core, it utilizes 6Al 4V Titanium instead.  This gives the
suppressor the strength and lightweight characteristics of titanium,
with even better suppression than that of the Mystic.

The titanium core has better thermal heat transfer characteristics
than stainless steel and therefore gains 2 to 4 dB in suppression
over the Mystic without loosing any of it's strength.  This is truly
class leading suppression!!!  We have seen meter readings below
120dBs with this suppressor design!*  This suppressor will also
carry most of the same caliber ratings as the Mystic as well as all of

This Saiga is ready to use with the Saiga hi-capacity magazines - or ready to convert with the two kits.

With these two kits you can do two different kind of conversions - you can use the Mississippi Auto Arms kit to make the gun look similar to an AR15 but still use the Saiga magazines - or you can use that kit and the B.A.S.T.A.R.D. kit to fully convert to use AR15 magazines.  The conversions can be done with hand tools - not a complicated process, videos and documentation are online.

No trades thank you - cash sale only - you won't beat this price anywhere.
Converted Saigas can sell for $1500-$1800.

Local sales only please, I don't want to ship this gun.

Because I haven't been able to buy ammo (primarily .22LR) at places like WalMart, I resorted to Gunbot & Internet retailers (Ammoman, SGAmmo, Wideners, etc) & I've had some recent success buying .22s, but all at .10/rd, but after shipping, most 500rd bricks are coming in at .11/rd or $55. Because I've always ordered the max quantity when successfully placing an order, now I'm a bit overstocked (like the 5,000rd case of ThunderBolts I received this week). So if you need .22s locally & can handle .11 to .12/rd (I have all invoices to back em up), I'm selling some. The Aguilas are a lot like CCI Stingers having velocity 1,700+fps. So drop me a line & I'll get right back with you. I will ship, ID & money order payment must be provided. $60/brick generally + actual shipping cost."

Convert your Glock 20 or 21 to .22LR caliber. Get the feel of your Glock while spending less on ammo.

Features.
1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

6.  ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTY
Warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship. (Excluding S&H Charges).

Hard Cast Wadcutter @ 1,125 fps - 20 Round Box","azusa, California, United States",$ 31,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 26, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=294

 This 225gr. full profile wad cutter, 45 auto rim +P, is the most deadly load ever devised for the 45 auto rim cartridge. It utilizes the same bullet as our 45 colt ANTI-PERSONNEL ammunition (Item 3I) and because of popular request to have that bullet loaded into 45 auto rim ammo, here it is.

This bullet will penetrate around 30 inches in flesh and bone and makes a horrific permanent crush cavity because of its wad cutter profile. This load is the power/pressure equivalent of 45 ACP +P+ (otherwise known as 45 Super) and is safe to use in all modern 45 ACP revolvers including any post war 1917 model revolver in normal operating condition.

Flash suppressed powders are used in this ammo so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire and this is a tactical advantage as roughly 95% of all civilian shootings in the U.S. happen in low light when the criminal element is at work.

The 225gr. wad cutter bullet is hard cast (not lead) and is properly lubed and will not substantially lead foul your barrel even after extensive shooting sessions, nor will the bullet fragment, smear or mushroom on impact with flesh and bone, thus insuring very straight and deep penetration with a consistent crush cavity throughout its path."

It will also hold similar carbines with a collapsible stock, a folding stock rifle, or any other weapon that is under 45 inches in overall length. This 46-inch Voodoo Tactical brand padded rifle carrying case will help protect your rifle from the hard knocks of transportation, whether in your vehicle or in the field. It can also be used if you break down your gun or to carry different uppers. 

Inside are two sets of adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case that has foam only on two sizes or the flimsy egg-crate foam of some hard-shell cases. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement. 

Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories. 

This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six standard size magazines and the center pouch is even larger. 

This Voodoo Tactical gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear.

The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six standard size magazines and the center pouch is even larger. 

This Voodoo Tactical gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

Slightly oversized pebble-textured rubber grips enable the handler to keep a firm ""leash"" on this pocket-sized puppy. The XS sighting system provides a quick sight picture and will enable the handler to direct the bite.

Personally i would change the grip and stock on it so i could get a btter more comfortable feel.

I have a BEAUTIFUL 1968 Remington 760 in 30-06. This is a pump action rifle with box magazine. The action is based on that used for the 870 shotgun. I would like to ideally trade this for a Remington 700 in .308 (really looking for SPS Tactical, but will entertain other models). I will add cash where necessary.

This rifle is pretty special due to its condition and age. For those of you who are unaware, this is the type of rifle that was used in the MLK Jr. Assassination in 1968 (Same year as this gun). I think the history attached to this gun is pretty cool, I just would like to consolidate calibers as this is the only 30-06 I have. I was torn about listing this rifle, but the time has come to consolidate...This 760 is ready to hit your collection or favorite wooded spot to drop some deer.

Rifle includes nice 3-12x BSA Scope, along with leather sling.

Must be an OH resident legally able to own a rifle such as this. CHL holders preferred."
