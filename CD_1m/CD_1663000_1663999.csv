What is an 80% receiver?

An 80% Receiver is a partially completed piece of material that requires special tooling and skills to be completed and considered a firearm. Unlike a firearm receiver it is not required to be transferred through a Federal Firearms Licensed holder (FFL).

Legalities

A lot of questions have been raised about how our 80% AR-15 Lower Receivers can be considered non-firearms. We've received a determination letter from the ATF stating that the ATF does not view this as a firearm because to complete the receiver it requires specialized skills and tooling.

Do I need an FFL to make a firearm?

In a short answer, no. As long as you can legally own the firearm in the state, county and city you reside in you are allowed to manufacture a firearm for your own personal use. No serial number is required however it is suggested to engrave a serial number, model and manufacturer on your receiver in case it is lost or stolen.

All National Firearms Act (NFA) regulations apply to your firearm. You may create a short-barreled rifle out of your firearm via a BATFE (Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosive) Form 1 after BATFE approval."

 These people have private funding from liberal contributions, and I think their ultimate goal is to bring negative media attention to Armslist. A few red flags would be if someone offers o buy your rifle for full price without any real negotiation, if they don't ask any questions during the transactions or act like they don't know their ass from a feed ramp you might re-consider doing business. Listen to what kind of terminology they use (like asking id it accepts high cap clips) or watch how they handle the weapon itself. 
 As gun owners we have to look out for one another, I would hate to see a nice rifle fall into the hand of one of these idiots and be destroyed, or worse yet, see Armslist ruined by some under-educated liberal do-gooders. Be vigilant and don't e afraid to ask your buyer questions when selling. Thanks"

I've ran 200 rounds through it with no failure of any kind for its recommended break in per factory instructions. I have 3 total magazines, two 6 round and one 7 round magazine. I also have a desantis iwb holster. I paid $525 for all mentioned. 
Looking to trade for either a 2"" barreled Ruger Sp101 or a gen 3 glock 26 but feel free to make a trade offer. I would add no more than $75 to the deal so if you have or think you have something valued over $600 you might as well stop here. Thanks for reading."

Customers have long awaited for a complete AR-15 built by Rainier Arms LLC. Finally, after building the experience and reputation to create a system that Rainier Arms is proud to stand behind, we are now introducing the Rainier Arms Urban Carbine Rifle. The RUC is light weight, starting at a sparse 6 lbs and 10 oz thanks to the Evolution Rail and a Lightweight Cold Hammer Forged Barrel that is both accurate and resilient. Target acquisition is effortless & extremely fast due to the unique design of the Diamond Head Back Up Iron Sights, and a Geissele QMS trigger offers a fluid trigger platform for smooth shooting. To accommodate our ambidextrous shooters, we have installed our Rainier Arms Raptor ambidextrous charging handle by AXTS and B.A.D. selector levers. With all of these components put together, the RUC is unparalleled in performance. All materials used are of industry-leading standards, each weapon carefully and meticulously assembled with a limited lifetime warranty. Due to popular demand, we will be offering a choice between standard / light weight barrels."

First, I would like to receive all offers and after the month I would like to consider my options.  Reason being is I don't want to trade off one gun when a deal will require all of them.  With that being said please call at REDACTED with any offers.  Now to the guns...  

1.     Arisaka that shoots 6.5 - The stock has been converted to a hunting stock and it has been chromed out.  A really bad ass looking gun.

2.     Remington 1100 - This shotgun is a bit old so the stock and foregrip have some wear (mainly foregrip).  Also some of the bluing on the rifle has some wear.  Again this was made ""I believe"" in Feb. of 1979.

3.     Revelation 22 mag - This is a pretty basic rifle almost identical to the Mossberg 640.  Not sure if I want to leave the scope on or not yet but it depends on the offers i get.  

4.     Marlin 3030 (gold trigger) - This rifle has been used alot to hunt so it has alot of wear.  This rifle is a bit older but still function perfectly.  This will most likely have the scope on which is a Simmons 3x9x40.

Alloy frame & wheels.  21 speeds, Shimano equipped.  2 water bottles & cages.  Bar end rearview mirror.  Assorted tool bags & nylon shopping bag sized basked.  Upgraded grips & pedals.  Electronic speedometer (needs battery).  Excellent condition.  Bought this about 8 years ago in hopes of using it for rehab exercise after open heart surgery, but vertigo from meds made that impossible, and it's just been sitting in the garage after one try (I did not fall, so no damage).  Tires are flat, and I don't have a pump, otherwise, it should be ready to go.  Originally cost about $850.00, so this is a really good deal.  I do not have a way to send pictures, but I am retired, and available to show it most of the time."
