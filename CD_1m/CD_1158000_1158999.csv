91,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1158091,For Sale/Trade:  Lots o' tactical/bug-out stuff or sale,"Lacey/Olympia, Southwest Washington, Washington",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, February 28, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for grabs is a pretty large quantity of military surplus and other tactical gear.  I'm selling a lot of my G.O.O.D. (Get Out Of Dodge) supplies because my wife and I will be moving soon, and I'd like to get rid of some clutter before we start packing.  This is basically my ""extra"" stuff.  Prices will be listed for individual items as well as for sets/groups of like-items.  Prices are firm if you are only interested in a couple items, but if there are several items you would like, we can work a deal.  Some items are pictured, and some are not.  If you need any more pictures of specific items, let me know.

(1) Large lot of ACU-pattern military uniforms.  All uniforms are in serviceable condition, but show some fading and/or light stains, small tears, etc.  They are in ""field condition"" at worst (ie, still very useable), and ""garrison"" (inspection) condition at best.  Selling as a lot: No less than 5 complete sets of ACU tops and bottoms, with various (matching) sizes: M-R, L-R, L-L and M-L (R is regular, L is long).  Also included are 2 ACU combat shirts, size large, and several ACU patrol caps and boonie caps.  I say ""no less than 5 sets"" because there are actually several more tops and bottoms, but I haven't sorted them yet.  You'll get them as well.  Price is $50.00 for the lot, and I'll throw in a few pairs of desert-tan combat boots (for free) in men's 10-R and 10 1/2-R if you want them. BTW, I'm 69"" and 190 LBs with a 36"" waist, and all of these uniforms it me decently...the mediums are just right, and the larges are loose but not poncho-like.
(2)  CVC liner/commo system (for tanker's helmet).  If you've ever had to buy one, you know how much the Army charges for these.  Comes with the liner, commo system, and detachable cable.  $25.00
(3)  BDU-pattern NBC/CBRN suit (jacket, trousers, suspenders).  Not in sterile packaging, so issued as  ""training"" uniform.  Pretty thick material, similar to a canvas Dickie's or Carhart.  Believe these are mediums, but may be larges (don't recall at this time).  Like-new condition, and meant to be worn over clothing, so they'd be great for hunting, working around the yard/farm, or messy chores.  $25.00 for the set.
(4)  2 field-knives.  One is a decent sized ""hillbilly toothpick,"" and the other is a small dive knife.  Dive knife is stainless, but has some build-up on it that you'll need to scrub off.  Other one has a slightly bent tip, but is still very usable.  $10.00 for both, and would be great for bug-out bags and heavy cutting that you don't want to wear down your favorite blade on.
(5)  Really nice, very large, ACU assault pack.  I'd actually call this a ""frame-less ruck sack.""  It's in really good shape, holds as much (or more) than an ALICE pack, has MOLLE and ALICE attachments, 2 large side pockets, and 3 medium pockets on the face.  Also has a removable internal frame (plastic sheet), and a built-in water resistant liner.  Only flaw is a small section on the flap where the stitching has torn, but that's a quick and easy fix.  I've carried over 100 LBs in this thing for several miles at a time along ridge lines, and it was surprisingly comfortable.  Was $140.00 new.  Selling for $50.00.
(6)  2 ACU pattern 3L hydration carriers with bladders.  One is used, and one is new.  Both are fully functional, and I'll include a new Camelbak cleaning kit with the used one.  The new one is Gerber, and I believe the used one is as well.  If not, it is the exact same style.  I prefer these to the Camelbak ones, because they're much easier to refill.  $15.00 each, or $20.00 for the pair.  Also have some ACU 3L Camelbak brand hydration pouches with bladders if you're interested.
(7)  MILSPEC ACH (Advanced Combat Helmet).  Size Large.  Comes with ACU helmet cover, band, rabbit ears, chinstrap assembly, helmet pads...100% complete.  This is the original ACH, meaning it's pretty similar to the current issue, but is slightly lighter.  $50.00 (not pictured)
(8)  ACU-pattern sleep system.  Complete 5 piece set, with 2x compression sacks, heavy bag, light bag, and waterproof bivy cover.  System is either new or like-new.  $100.00 (not pictured)
(9) 1 set of M-R BDUs (top and bottoms).  Excellent/like-new condition.  $30.00.
(10) Complete IOTV, ACU pattern (not pictured).  Slightly used, but in good shape.  Includes the entire vest assembly and the kidney pad.  Will include the throat/neck protectors, if I can locate them.  Has kevlar inserts, and includes front and back class III plates, which are commercially-available MILSPEC plates, rated for 7.62 APM2.  Plates and IOTV are size Medium, and sizes for these are pretty similar, as they are adjustable.  If you are of fairly average size (say M-XL top), it'll fit you.  $200.00
(11) 2x BDU large sustainment pouches (for ruck) and radio pouch (similar capacity to sustainment pouches).  $10.00 for the set.  
(12) All ACU: 2x large sustainment pouches, 2x med sustainment pouches, 1x 200-rd SAW pouch (great for a drop pouch, and measures 4x4 rows MOLLE), 2x 100-rd SAW (or 6x AR-15 mag) pouches), hand-held radio pouch (works as quick graw AR-15 mag pouch, too).  The large and medium sustainment pouches above are designed to utilize the entire side of a MOLLE ruck: 1x L and 1x M per side.  $50.00 for all.
(13) Holsters: ACU drop-leg holser that attaches to a duty belt (right-handed).  Multicam ambidextrous holster that has MOLLE straps on the back.  Both are designed for large sidearms.  Used, but fully serviceable.  $10.00 each.
(14) Multicam pouches: 2x large sustainment pouches, 1x Tactical Tailor ""possibles"" pouch, and 1x knife/gerber/pistol mag pouch.  $40.00 for all.
(15) Big bag o' chemlights:  Estimate 3 dozen, in varying colors, including amber, orange, red, green, and IR.  Old, but still in original wrappers.  $10.00 for all.
(16) WWII-era pack frame.  Got this for the big pack listed above.  It's a pressed frame, with a canvas backing.  I replaced the original lacing with paracord, and put on a removable padded waist band.  I really like this frame, because you can mount anything on it; bags, game, bundle of firewood...it's pretty handy.  I seem to think I saw a 1940s date-stamp on it, but don't recall with certainty.  $15.00
(17) BDU IBA shell.  Size is medium.  No kevlar or plates.  Includes kevlar groin protector.  Works as a tactical vest (MOLLE webbing), and will accept a plate from vest listed above (giving you two vests with front coverage).  $30.00
(18) Tactical Tailor ""tough case,"" and hard-shell eye protection case with safety glasses.  Both are ALICE and MOLLE compatible (tough case uses MOLLE straps, and eyepro case uses clips).  MOLLY case painted light tan to match multicam gear.
(19) 2x water/fuel cans.  Both have been used for water only.  One is a MILSPEC 5-gallon can, the other is a commercial 6-gallon can.  Both are tough, durable plastic.  Will include an unused screw-on spout that fits all MILSPEC cans.  $20.00 or the set.

Now for the best part:  Even though I'm not in a big rush to sell, I value my little bit of free time enough that if you make an offer on several items, I'll knock down the prices pretty considerably.  If I had to give quick-sell price for the whole lot (minus a couple of the smaller/cheaper items), I'd say $450.00 bucks.  Really good price, as you get one of the best bug-out bags on the market, a water-proof sleep system rated down to -40F, full protective gear, some basic survival tools (water carriers, knives, chem-lights, etc), and quite a bit of very durable clothing!  I'll even throw in some cold-weather thermal tops and bottoms, a complete IFAK (Improved First Aid Kit), including a couple one-hand tourniquets, Quik Clot, and more.

Now for the terms:  I won't ship.  You will need to meet me in the Lacey/Olympia area.  I might be willing to travel a bit for the right offer, but I value my time more than selling off a couple pouches that have been taking up trunk space in my man-cave for a couple years.  Next, I have tried to represent everything listed as honestly and accurately as I can.  I haven't gone through everything and written down all the sizes, but will for someone who wants to make a serious offer.  This is stuff my wife and I have purchased over the years, and much of it has been swapped out for other stuff that better suits our needs.  Some is military surplus from local shops, other stuff ordered online, and a few items were actually found at Value Village (the WWII pack frame and the CVC liner with cable, for instance).  It's all serviceable, though.  Point I'm getting at is that in several places I've said ""I think it's Medium,"" etc.  I listed my size above, and I can wear either a large or a medium comfortably."

Poor ad copy/photographs. Best advice look at appealing ads and mimic them.
Provide: make, model, caliber, and any other truly unique details. 
As photos go, if they don't give a good idea what the condition of the firearm is Do Not Bother. Pictures of your fingers or your 1975 beach towel are of no value to serious buyers. Take a picture of each side, any unique marks or identifiers, and any evidence for claims in the add. I also suggest blocking out the last several digits of the serial number if it is visible. Watch out for over lighting, in fact soft light from an angle may give the best results. Lastly, even cheap digital cameras have settings to help even a novice take great shots so try them out. Good luck with you sales."

Beginning at the legendary Izmash factory in Russia, this is a brand new, custom built, semi-automatic, magazine-fed Saiga 12 gauge shotgun, which was professionally converted from its original “sporting” configuration by Sierra Arms International. These are on the top of Obama’s ban list!  Professional modifications are as follows: 
Gas ports properly sized so that cheaper low-brass ammo can be used; Bolt and carrier ground and polished at contact/action points for smoother action and easier magazine installation; Fire control group replaced with US-Made G2 unit and moved forward; fire control group is also machined and polished for supreme fit and function; Trigger guard replaced with modified 5-rivet AKM unit; Pistol grip nut clearance machined into receiver and grip moved forward; The entire firearms is then coated with extremely corrosion resistant, mil-spec SSI phosphate parkerizing, which is then sprayed with Graphite Black CeraKote -  proven to be the Absolute BEST gun coating available! Most firearms have a single coating, but we integrate a Dual-Coverage System for long-term corrosion-proof usage and unmatched protection.
Premium features are as follows:
18.5” threaded barrel; US-Made ACE side-folding stock with integrated trunnion mount, Veriforce tactical pistol grip mounted with a rigid reinforcement plate; RPK-74 type K-Var handguard and mounting system; Indexed SGM AK74 style muzzle brake; modified G2 fire control group with shepherd’s hook retainer; Bolt hold-open latch; side-rail scope mount; Fitted and tested ProMag 10-round magazine.
Also includes the following original Russian OEM items:
Owner’s manual; oil can; tool/cleaning kit; long cleaning rod.
If you're in the market for the ultimate defensive weapon, a competition shotgun, or just a high-quality scatter gun, get yours while they last. This is a solid and affective Russian shotgun, and it will last for decades."

I have a Vortex Strikefire red dot scope for it I will throw in for an additional $100. ""When the situation demands fast shooting...and a big scope with a narrow field of view won't cut it, the StrikeFire red dot riflescope lets you shoot quickly with both eyes open! With unlimited field of view and eye relief—nothing gets you on target faster than this tough, shockproof and waterproof red dot scope.
Shockproof with rugged one-piece 30mm aluminum alloy tube.
High recoil caliber rating—tested with .375 H&H Magnum for 1000 rounds.
Included standard height 30mm ring puts scope's bore center 21 mm (0.8 inches) above the base height. Commonly used for mounting with most rifles, shotguns, and handguns. Allows for rapid shooting with both eyes open, without concern for parallax shooting error. Parallax free beyond 50 yards; less than one-inch error closer than 50 yards.
Operating Temperature: Rated from -40 degrees to +140 degrees Fahrenheit.
CONVENIENCE FEATURES
Unlimited Eye Relief: Non-critical eye relief for rapid target aquisition.

Red/Green Light Switch: Allows switching between red and green dot for optimum contrast with surroundings.

Adjustable Dot Intensity: Allows adjusting of the dot intensity according to viewing conditions.

Night Vision Mode: Sets the brightness to the lowest possible level—an illumination level that generally is not seen without use of a night vision device.

2x Doubler:	Screw-in doubler provides extra magnification for longer distance shooting.

Flip-up Lens Caps	The protective caps flip up from the lenses: 1.38 inches from the eyepiece and 1.75 inches from the objective lens.

312,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1158312,For Sale/Trade:  Two 20-rd Thermold mags,"Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States",$ 20,"Listed On: Thursday, February 28, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Both mags are practically brand-new, and the only thing I've done with them is dry-cycle rounds through them via my ARs. The springs are good. The followers leave something to be desired compared to other mags and they aren't as compatible with my ARs as some of my other mags have proven to be (thus why I'm selling them). The color/material is black zytel nylon. Both have the ""Master Molder"" and ""Law&Gov't use only"" markings on them. I really like how both mags are easy to take apart for maintenance purposes.

I am selling both mags for $20 total (excl. shipping). This is well below Thermold's MSRP for just one (around $25 or so). I expect this set to sell fast. I do have a few conditions regarding selling these:

Legal stuff: if you live in a state where these are banned I cannot ship them to you. I have never been in trouble with the law and I'd like to keep it that way, and I'm well-versed in the states that don't allow mags past 10-15 rounds.

Moral stuff: I don't want these mags to go to some scheming entrepreneur whose sole purpose for these mags is to resell them at higher prices. Sorry but if you're looking to resell these then I have no interest in doing business. So: the buyer must provide me a picture of his/her AR that these mags will be used with. Mags are meant to be used. They're not ""investments,"" but tangibles. That's what I'm selling them as, and for a pretty good bargain price in my humble opinion.

Regarding payment: monetarily I'll take money orders, checks (I will wait for personal check to clear first), and Paypal (discreetly).

It is now basically a new mac in an old frame. New and updated operating system, loaded with the office suite, brand new keyboard etc. You'd never know you didn't have a new Mac except for a smudge on the screen (small) which diapers when its turned on. I spent over $300 just to have it rebuilt into a great laptop. All the features you'd expect plus I added extra memory. I did it for my girlfriend's son but his dad got him a desktop instead so its been sitting in a laptop case since. I bought a new pro so have no need for it. Not sure what brand new ones cost, but I'm guessing $1,200 or more. This does everything they do, and has the new operating system so its just as fast plus has a brand new keyboard. You are of course welcome to test / play with it / have it checked out before you take possession. Great for home, office, kids, college kids etc....."

The Carrier has the letter ""J"" Stamped on the left side.  I can't remember which manufactuerer this stands for, but this is definitely a quality BCG.  Chromed on outside and inside.  Fuly auto BCG, but that doesn't mean that it won't work with a semi-auto gun.  It just means that it will work in an automatic AR-15 while a semi-auto bolt carrier won't.

Chrome Gas key staked properly.  Carrier is also the heavier fully auto model, which makes cycling rounds smoother. 

The bolt is a brand new Colt Bolt straight out of the bag as sold by Brownells.  Bolt has the letters MPC stamped, which is supposed to mean m=magnetic, p=particle, c=colt.  At least that's what my research tells me.  Anyway I have the bag and part number to prove this is a Colt Bolt.  Asking $350 for the entire group.  Will take $225 for jus the carrier.  This would be a great carrier to upgrade from your manganese phosphate chrome lined carrier, which you could turn around and sell to make this pretty affordable."

I won't pay 800$ trade or cash for your glock, you buy one brand new, pull it out of the box and shoot it one time, it's worth 450$ to me. Just like any other store you would try to get a trade or cash value put of on your glock. For instance I bought a glock 20, shot it 30 times exactly, one month later after paying 620$ cash otd, I end up getting 500$ and that's only cause I put night sights on it. Metal guns are worth more than polymer. No panic prices or any of that bs, bring me your glock and let's work put a deal.

I am offering a complete AR Package. This package has basically everything you could want/need and is turn-key ready to go (as you will read).

Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.

Throughout the world today, Colt’s reliability, performance, and accuracy provide our Armed Forces the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt’s new LE6920MP-B shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1” chrome lined barrel. With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip (with storage compartment), MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine.

Includes: (1) NIB, never fired Colt LE6920MP-B with 16"" 1:7 twist barrel, (1) 30rd magazine, cleaning kit, sling, and manual.

Accessories Included: 400 rounds of ammunition, (2) additional 30rd magazines, (1) Vortex Diamondback 3-9x40 Dead-hold BDC scope, Butler Creek flip-open caps, Burris R.E.P.R quick detach mount, 2-piece quad rail for the Colt AR, rail covers, rail mount fore end grip with storage, and a tactical gun case. All items are brand new except the case but it’s in perfect, like new condition.

The scope has been pre sighted on my personal AR using a bore sighter at 100yards. The scope will need minor final sighting on the Colt with live ammo but should be within a couple inches. The included 100 rounds of match ammo should help you with this. Ammo is hard to get at a reasonable price right now. I figured bore sighting should help you conserve your ammo so you can use it for a better purpose.

The Burris mount allows the rear flip up sight to remain in place, and the front sight is not visible at 3 or 9 power. I included a picture of that. If you want to drop the scope there are two latches to remove the scope/base in seconds without tools. It includes both smooth and picatinny rail ring tops and the Burris forever warranty.

Included is a quad rail for mounting lights or what ever accessories you desire.... The 2-piece rail is sized for the Colt AR. I included (3) rail covers and a fore end grip –all new in their packages.

I am offering a complete AR Package. This package has basically everything you could want/need and is turn-key ready to go (as you will read).

Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.

Throughout the world today, Colt’s reliability, performance, and accuracy provide our Armed Forces the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt’s new LE6920MP-B shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1” chrome lined barrel. With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip (with storage compartment), MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine.

Includes: (1) NIB, never fired Colt LE6920MP-B with 16"" 1:7 twist barrel, (1) 30rd magazine, cleaning kit, sling, and manual.

Accessories Included: 400 rounds of ammunition, (2) additional 30rd magazines, (1) Vortex Diamondback 3-9x40 Dead-hold BDC scope, Butler Creek flip-open caps, Burris R.E.P.R quick detach mount, 2-piece quad rail for the Colt AR, rail covers, rail mount fore end grip with storage, and a tactical gun case. All items are brand new except the case but it’s in perfect, like new condition.

The scope has been pre sighted on my personal AR using a bore sighter at 100yards. The scope will need minor final sighting on the Colt with live ammo but should be within a couple inches. The included 100 rounds of match ammo should help you with this. Ammo is hard to get at a reasonable price right now. I figured bore sighting should help you conserve your ammo so you can use it for a better purpose.

The Burris mount allows the rear flip up sight to remain in place, and the front sight is not visible at 3 or 9 power. I included a picture of that. If you want to drop the scope there are two latches to remove the scope/base in seconds without tools. It includes both smooth and picatinny rail ring tops and the Burris forever warranty.

Included is a quad rail for mounting lights or what ever accessories you desire.... The 2-piece rail is sized for the Colt AR. I included (3) rail covers and a fore end grip –all new in their packages.

Up for sale is a nice Galil clone, 6 30-rd magazines (4 steel IMI, 2 Orlite), and an incredibly rare STANAG (AR-15) magazine adapter.

The gun has been extensively worked on by the best Galil smith in the country, and has NONE of the typical Golani problems. The receiver is a low-number GLN prefix, and has been checked for good heat treat. It is also 100% in-spec dimensionally, so any surplus Galil parts or accessories will fit. It runs like a sewing machine and has very few rounds through it.

It has a Yankee Hill Phantom QD flash hider attached, and is ready for a Yankee Hill suppressor if you want to put one on. The original muzzle device is also included should you wish to replace it.

The STANAG adapter works great with PMAGs or GI mags, and has been fitted by the smith to lock up tight and true. The PMAG you see in the picture is NOT included with the rifle - only the 6 Galil mags.

I also dug around in the basement and came across 300 rounds of Tula 5.56 NATO - this is an increase from the original 60 rounds offered, but I haven't changed the asking price. I'm not going to gouge on ammo that I got for cheap!

No trades! I will not sell the mags or adapter separately. I will need to see some Ohio ID, CCW preferred.

More pictures and info available on request.

Thanks!"

Patent date on slide is Dec 22 1903 with a low (five digit) serial number.

This gun has probably never been fired and is in the same condition as it was when it left the factory.

I traded into this piece and then decided I don't want to be the one who scratches it...

I want to trade for something that I can take to the range and put some rounds through, conscious free.

I am interested in lever guns, not just plain run of the mill 94s or marlins unless they have saddle rings, octangular barrels,

ingravings, commemerative rifles or stainless versions. I like the idea of a lever action .410 or a .38/357 in stainless.

I also have interest in Buffalo style long guns in .45-70 or western style guns.

Multiple gun trades generaly get my attention as well.

I am open to offers from people who have a reasonable understanding of the value of what I'm trading. This is not a cheap mini concealed carry gun. Then again worst that I'll do on an unworthy offer is to politely decline so if you have interest feel free to make an offer.

I have seen these guns sale for $350 or higher that were completely rusted and frozen up. And I have seen them sale for $750 in good condition.

This piece looks as tho it is brand new. Not looking to stick it to anybody, just looking for a good trade.

You can email me offers or text me at 850-832-2420 but please no calls as I am generally pretty busy.

I am constantly looking for good deals on large quantities of new .45 ammo to resell at a reasonable fixed price, regardless of the brand of ammo. My intent is to hold the line at $30 per 50 round box during this weird shortage for as long as possible. Yes, I make a couple of dollars per box, I make no apologies for that, but a small profit enables me to locate other supplies and quickly purchase good ammo for resale.

I have no purchase limits, if it's in stock and you have the cash, I will sell as much ammo as you want. It might be a good idea to email or text message me first if more than 20 boxes at a time is wanted.

At this time I do not stock any other calibers other than .45 (sorry, no 9mm or .22), I have enough problems finding .45 to keep supplied. Thanks to all of you who have bought my ammunition recently. There are another 3 shipments coming within the next 2 weeks totaling 2000 rounds."
