This holster uses belt loops at the front and rear to pull your handgun tight against your body for better concealment. The angle this holster positions your handgun allows faster drawing with full combat grip, more comfortable wearing, and much safer use.
A regular Small of the Back (SOB) holster places your gun over the base of the spine. A fall or hard blow with your gun in that position could cause serious spinal cord injury. This holster is engineered for kidney carry to avoid that danger.
Made of waterproof foam for a comfortable carry and to protect gun from moisture. Lined on both sides with rugged Cordura® nylon for durability and a smooth, fast draw. Webbing inside the holster protects your gun’s sights and keeps holster partially open for easier re-holstering. Great for use while driving. Comes with an adjustable thumb break to keep gun secure. Fits belts up to 1½” wide. 
Black. Made in the USA. 
Holster is brand new - never been worn. Retails for $49.99 + tax. Make me an offer."

Excellent condition and has seen little use. Mirror bore. This belonged to a fellow who worked for me years ago. When he got it we took it out and shot a couple boxes through it. Then he carried it a couple times when we went squirrel and rabbit hunting. Then about 15 years ago he sold it to my nephew who shot the half box of ammo that came with it and put it up for 15 years. I had a nice pistol i was going to sell and he wanted it bad and traded me for the rifle. The pistol was worth 700.00-800.00 dollars. I have seen these listed that high and higher, but its up for trade, or sale. I'm asking 750.00 obo for it. Or would consider a nice revolver, or 1911, or something in that comparable price range. Never hurts to ask!"

If you don't mind the sporterized look, I have refinished this stock with multiple coats of walnut minwax and a few coats of polyurethane and it turned out quite nice, I also mounted a rifle sling swivel on the front of the stock so a sling could be mounted, I will include the mil-surp sling shown. Mechanically this gun is in great shape, no rust and no pitting, the bore is dark but shiney with deep groves and most of the bluing is still there, with some worn off in the high spots or where parts move against each other. All parts # match except for the bolt, however the head-spacing has been checked and is good to go. This gun is a great shooter and would make an excellent truck gun, or as I said could be put back in a full stock, nothing but the stock has been touched. Price is negotiable, and I can throw in 50rds. of some surplus 7.62x54R."

CTLM is located in the Winsted area. We are looking for any and all Patriots, Preppers, Constitutionalists, etc.  
We meet 2-4 times a month where we either conduct a meeting or training exercises. Because we are currently not at war we do group recreational/teambuilding activites such as fishing, hiking, survivalist activities, wilderness exploration, camp craft, first aid, shooting range days and many other activities such as long term bugging in and self reliance. 
CTLM so far consists of preppers, patriots, Minutemen, and outdoorsmen. We are all like-minded and you should be also if you wish to join. We do train with firearms and if you are not familiar with firearms we would be more than willing to teach you how to safely and properly operate and care for your firearm(s). We do have a field dress requirementas well as basic requirements for gear, attendance/participation and other things but the dress code does not apply to standard meetings. 
If you are looking for a NWO anti-government radical group, or some Anarchist regmine turn away now. We do not want you nor require your presence.
We do want LEGAL citizens who:
-Do NOT have a criminal record.
-support the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
- believe in and cherish indivdual freedom 
-understand and agree that the Founding Fathers believed that all free men have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
-The right to keep and bare arms shall not be infringed
-The government can ""save all of us"" from any major catastrophe, disaster or attack.

We are a not extremists or right wing radicals. We are law abiding Americans who believe that there is a need for an organized group to protect and preserve Freedom, Liberty and America. The government cannot help us all, look at incidents like Katrina or even Hurricane Sandy. It is our moral duty to ensure that when SHTF we are there for our families, friends, communities and country. We are average working residents who live among you, but we are trained and we will train you to be able to help your fellow citizens, your community and fight for your freedom and way of life (when necissary) in situations like:
Domestic or foreign terror attacks, natural disasters, industrial disasters, unlawful intrusion of an invading army, Economic collapse, riots, civil disorder/chaos.

Many of us are law abiding firearm owners but we are NOT militants or combatants. If you have special skills or training from working as an EMT, military service, etc we would love for you to join. 
**MEMBERS WHO HAVE SERVED IN THE MILITARY AND SEEN ACTION WILL BE PRIORITY ASSIGNED TO CTLM's COMMAND AUTHORITY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE 3 SLOTS OPEN** 
UPDATE: We are urgently seeking Patriots who meet the following criteria:
-Vehicle and small engine Mechanic (prefer someone ASE certified)
- Machinist familar with CNC, mill drills etc.
-5acres+ of private land.
-Computer guy/tech (web design, graphics)
-Military servicemen/women who achieved E-4 to W-1 rank. (MUST NOT BE ACTIVE DUTY! Sorry, I just don't want to endanger your Military standing or create any conflicts that could harm your reputation or anything. Once something is in black and white and put in a file, its never going to go away). 
If you would like more information please email me, Dave at the email provided.
Our next meeting time and place has yet to be scheduled and we are currently in our infancy in respects to establishment. We will not hold a formal meeting until we have atleast 10 members or people ""signed up.""

I believe everyone has the right to be prepared for whatever Nature or the gov't can throw at us. If that means being armed with anything from  a gun to a fire extinguisher, a generator or a ""doomsday bunker"" than that is how it needs to be.

In Liberty, Molon Labe. God Bless

It has the same grip angle as the distinguished Browning Hi-Power and M1911 pistols.

Current models of the Five-seven are single-action, having a short and light trigger pull of 2 to 3 daN (4.4 to 6.6 lbF). They have a Picatinny rail for mounting accessories, and a magazine safety mechanism that prevents the pistol from firing without a magazine inserted.

With the addition of the Px4 Compact in 2010, Beretta completed the Px4 family of pistols. Heralded by many as the ultimate in balance, feel and proportion, the Compact is well suited for concealed carry yet perfectly at home in a duty holster. Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range.

The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package.The 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready.

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols.

A high magazine capacity is maintained, with 15 rounds in 9mm"

I have  rounds of good South Korean Surplus 30.06 for the M1 Garand in Enblocs I am selling (there are only 6 of the bandoleers left that have 48 rounds in each). The $60 price is for 100 rounds. It is brass cased boxer primed FMJ 150 grain ammo. This is all the non-corrosive PS headstamp that you cannot find anymore. The corrosive KA headstamp S. Korean ammo that is around now is selling for more than what I am asking for this great shooting clean ammo. Brass is clean with zero corrosion on it.

I shot approximately 500 rounds of this before I sold my Garand and did not have any problems with any of it. I no longer have anything to shoot it with so I need to clear it out to make room for other calibers I do need. 

Pictures added of what I now have left:
6 bandoleers with cardboards and 6 loaded enbloc clips in each for a total of 258 rounds.
I have a reproduction Garand ammo belt in black that has 10 pockets with loaded enblocs in them for another 80 rounds. 
23 loaded enblocs for a total of 184 rounds.
7 20 round boxes that show the lot this ammo came from for a total of 140 rounds.
I also have 64 rounds of Remington 150 grain Core-Lokt PSP.
As a special bonus to anyone buying all I have I will add 2 20 round sealed boxes of Twin Cities and 1 20 round sealed box of Lake City M2 Ball ammo for the Garand.  
That comes to:
South Korean M2 Ball = 662 rounds
Remington Core-lokt = 64 rounds
Twin Cities/Lake Cities  M2 Ball ammo = 60 rounds
Total = 786 rounds

Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength. Specifications: Action: Semi-Automatic Caliber: 223 Remington/5.56 NATO Bbl Length: 16.1"" Capacity: 30+1 Trigger: Direct Safety: Lever OAL: 35.25"" Weight: 6.6 lbs Stock: 4-Position Collapsible Finish: Black"

She only has 7643 miles on her which about 80% of are highway miles. I know this because ive been the owner and soul rider since 775 miles. I had the bike converted to a chain drive to get more top end out of it on the highway and to bring down the rpms at higher constant speeds. And has done that very well. It has an EK chain and aluminum sprockets. It is a very nice clean bike that has been well taken care of! My reason for selling her is just to get a bigger bike that is better for long highway miles. I have a set of detachable saddlebags that go with along with a small windshield and low sissy bar and has the original two up seat. She also has python slip on pipes these are made by Vance & Hines just their budget brand but sound great. The original pipes come with as well. Has been a great bike just time to move bigger.

The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm. The 300 Blackout is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions. The testing of the Daniel Defense 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend.

Has fairly new tires (made in USA) standard agricultural tires on the back and hi-rib standard two wheel drive tires on the front. Three speed PTO. The low price mainly reflects cosmetic appearance of the tractor. It cranks right up and pulls whatever implement you need to use. I have had the tractor nearly nine years and in that time the only items I have had to replace were: the tires, the starter/relay, the fuel tank and the radiator overflow plastic tank. It is a two cylinder machine that produces 22 HP at the wheels. This is a vintage, grey market tractor. Specifically it was made in the 1970's and brought in to the country by third party importers rather than by a Yanmar dealer.

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case

Caliber: .40 S&W

Capacity: Three 13 round magazines included

Barrel: 4"" Cold Hammer Forged, 1:10"" twist, polygonal rifled

Dimensions: 7.3"" long, 5"" high, 1.2"" wide

Weight: 21.3 ounces unloaded, 31.1 ounces loaded

The Uberti Top Break is true to the original, designed by Major George Schofield at the Smith & Wesson factory in 1869. The Schofield revolver was created as a cavalry pistol. Its efficient, break-open design could be operated one-handed. That made it easy to eject all six spent cartridges and reload the single action revolver while on horseback.

The U.S. Cavalry was slow to see the merits of the top break, but Jessie James, John Wesley Hardin, and Wild Bill Hickok saw the fast reloading capability as a distinct advantage in their line of work. After numerous trials, the U.S. Army finally purchased three thousand top breaks with an improved top latch design.

However, it was the Russian government that truly embraced the new sidearm. The Czar ordered 41,000 top breaks with a modified grip design, lanyard ring, and a distinctive trigger spur.

We are a small independent distributor staffed by shooting enthusiasts who, because of the current ongoing situation, have decided to offer ammo direct to the shooting public at a significant cost savings over current prices. All orders will be on a first come- first serve bases and subject to availability.

Order Process:

After you place an order via e-mail and we have met our minimum requirements with the supplier a container will be shipped to us. These containers come in once or possibly twice per month. After it clears customs etc. and we know the shipment is en route to us we will contact you to arrange sending your payment. We accept USPS Money Orders ONLY for shipped orders or, should you be close enough to collect in person, cash when you come to pick it up. We ship as soon as your payment and the ammo arrives with us. YOU DO NOT PAY US UNTIL WE HAVE THE AMMO IN THE COUNTRY! Because of the way we have to do business we cannot cancel your order once placed. Occasionally we proactively over-order and should you wish to increase the quantities we will be happy to oblige but cannot guarantee we can do it each time you ask so order as many as you need up front. We shall not, however, short somebody else to give preferential treatment to one order.

Please include the following information in ALL orders:

1. Name and address of person ordering.

2. Phone number where you can be reached.

3. E-mail address.

4. Caliber and quantities you wish to order. (Be specific, no ""I thinks"" etc.) e.g. 7.62 X 1K, .223 X 2K

The components that go to make ammunition are subject to the international commodities market and occasionally we will get hit at our end by unforeseen price increases so great we may have to increase the unit prices to you. Our pricing includes a small profit for us, if it did not we would soon go out of business, and all shipping and handling charges. All orders are subject to availability of the ammunition on the international market and pricing dictated by the manufacturer.

Will not ship to anywhere prohibited by law.

This firearm is a prime example of the Mosin series of rifles. Arsenal refinished with an interesting stock with an oddly high number of stamps in the wood.  Has not been counter-bored. Rifling is in good condition. Mirror at the breech and gradually frosting for the last 6 inches toward the muzzle. Bluing is 90% or better. 

I've personally put around 300ish rounds down range with this rifle and  she fires perfectly and has the usual Mosin trait of shooting high at 100 meters, corrected by holding my POA about 6 inches low.  Feeds and ejects as it should. I personally managed 4' groups from a rest @ 75 yards with surplus ammo, and with me being an inexperienced shooter, I'm sure the gun is much more accurate than I. This example also has some Cryllic stamps on the bolt body and scattered throughout the barrel and receiver.

I am the second owner and bought this from a licensed gun shop. This was part of a large collection of guns that appeared unfired when sold.

This is, according to on-line sources, one of the oldest G-23's(Gen 2) in existence and dates from May 1990. I am not responsible for verifying on-line info, but if you'd like to this weapon is S/N ND99_. 

This may be one of the very first weapons ever chambered in .40 S&W.

I've fired it 250 times, and had one issue(a spring) resolved by a Glock Armorer. Function for me is now perfect.

This gun's box indicates factory night sights--they do still glow, but are not bright.

If you're a Glock freak, this is a good one for the collection. If you're looking for a reliable shooter/carry piece you can't do any better than this. 

Looks totally new. Glock's factory boxes in 1990 looked like Tupperware with a factory Glock sticker.

Carry permit and Indiana DL required. 

Not interested in trades. $550 

Thanks for reading, and have a good day.
