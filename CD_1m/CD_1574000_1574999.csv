Pretty interesting pistol here, this is definetly NOT a target pistol as the trigger is double action with a long slide before a crisp break, the gun has a slide safety behind the trigger but you could leave the safety off and never have to worry about it firing while you were carrying it. Straight blow-back operation (hammerless) with very deep rifling in the barrel to release gases for low and pleasing recoil. Gun was mfgd in 1981 and has been fired little, included are; original box, manual, test target, and one 18 rd. double stack magazine. I prefer cash but may consider a trade of interest. email any offers you have and text pics of trades to REDACTED. FTF transactions only. Thanks for looking in."

198,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1574198,For Sale:  LAZERMAX INTERNAL PISTOL LAZERS,"OVRLAND PARK, KS, Kansas City, Kansas",$ 245,"Listed On: Sunday, May 5, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Replaces the internal guide rod and spring and gun take down latch.
Simple installation – no gunsmith needed. As seen on Guns n Gear TV recently.

I mounted them on a SIG 226 and Beretta 92, ten years ago. I took the Beretta to an inside range about a year afterward and accidentally dropped it 42” to the concrete floor. Dings on the gun, but that lazer worked and worked for years afterward. 

They don’t have the problems of needing a special holster or accidentally turning on when in a holster. The on/off switch is ambidextrous. 

They have a big feature over Crimson Trace, which I also like – on the models with the lazer in the grip panels you can accidentally block the lazer when in safe condition with your finger off the trigger. That never happens with a Lazermax UNLESS you go crazy and start putting your hand in front of the barrel. Another great advantage is that they do not have to be adjusted for accuracy. The lazer is in the replacement guide rod which is inline with the barrel to work properly. Crimson Trace comes with mini Allen wrenches to keep them sighted in. They do eventually work loose. My cost was $265.

In the pic of inside the box there is nothing mssing. Only the parts for a particular pistol are put in the box.

Normal retail is $300 - $399 on most Lazermax pistol models.

This pistol caliber carbine is a blast to shoot, VERY accurate -- silver dollar size groups with iron sights at 50yds.  Comes with 2 factory 10 round mags.  
    Great self defense gun -- short, easy to manipulate, packs a good punch but the 9mm won't over-penetrate through your neighbors house (if you ever have to use it for self defense indoors).  
    I was getting 1300-1400fps with regular loads, and it is factory rated for +P ammunition as well.  
    It's a ton of fun to shoot and best of all, with 9mm you can afford to shoot it!

I took it to the NRA expo in Houston to try and get more info on it but found only more questions. Some took it apart and said they could not give me a date it was made. Others said it was not real but offered my 2k in trade, but not guns because at the expo you cannot sell guns so 2k in gear.

Brand New Umarex Regent Series 1911-A1 45ACP Semi Auto Pistol. This is an excellent firearm with stainless steel barrel and a lifetime exchange or repair warranty. It was rather plain in the looks department so we spruced it up with a set of Hogue Scrimshaw Reaper Grips, and a Pierce finger grip module.

The Regent R100 is an affordable semi- automatic 1911 pistol built with a level of quality that you can customize. This reasonably priced, high-quality .45 ACP caliber M1911 is one of only a few guns of its style and quality that retails for around $500.

The R100 is a rendition of the M1911A1 that is visually faithful to the original design. It has a spur hammer, M1911A1-style grip safety, and arched mainspring housing. Offered in .45 ACP only, the R100 has a matte-black finish and comes standard with Hogue® rubber grips. The slide is manufactured from CNC machined bar stock with a low-cut ejection port, the frame is steel investment cast, and the barrel is hammer forged stainless steel—all manufactured to ISO 9001 and NATO AQAP 120 quality standards.

The Regent R100 accepts virtually all aftermarket parts made for M1911-style pistols, giving you the ability to customize your pistol. Also, almost all aftermarket accessories designed for M1911 -styles can be added, whether it be specialized custom grips, added sights, tactical enhancements, or other customizations.

Winchester Model 1894 custom order Saddle Ring .32 Win Special with crescent stock.  I ran the serial number and shows this rifle as being manufactured in 1932.  Barrel, Mag Tube, and wood in great condition with a shiny clean bore. No rust or cracks.  Also has a custom ordered adjustable rear peep sight.  The bluing on the receiver is gone but no rust or pits.  It has the brownish patina that is expected of these older Winchesters.  It has been inspected by a gunsmith and given the green light to shoot.  I love shooting this old rifle.  It is worthy being displayed above the fireplace or taken in the woods as a the deer slayer it was meant to be.  I will include 180 rounds.  The price of this rifle is $1,100. 

Second is my Henry Big Boy Lever Action .44 Magnum with octagon barrel.  I am the original owner of this immaculate rifle.  I fired 4 rounds through and it's been in the safe ever since.   There isn't a scratch or blemish on her anywhere.  It is like new.  I will include 46 rounds.  This rifle is hard to find unless you have it ordered.  They sell them as soon as they get them.  Bass Pro Shop sells them for $799.95.  The price on this one is $600.00.  That's a $200.00 savings.  

I will sell them individually at the price shown or as a package deal for $1,500.00.  That's an additional savings of $200.00 and the ammo is still included.  

I hate selling them but I am trying to buy a long range bolt action and need the money.

Factory New

Model 1911-22 Semi Auto 10 Round 22LR

The Chiappa Model 1911-22 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semiautomaticpistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

Standard model with dovetail fron sights and fixed rear sights.

History

For Soviet firearm enthusiasts, Izhmash is a revered name with its legendary factory logo, the upward pointing arrow, found on a host of Russian arms throughout the nation’s storied history. The Izhmash Arms Factory, located in Izhevsk, the capital of the Udmurt Republic, has the honor of being the largest firearms producer in Russia, dating back to its founding in 1807 by the express order of Tsar Alexander I. Tied intimately to the martial history of the Russian nation, the Izhmash plant produced more than 10 million carbines and rifles during World War II, and has been involved since the end of that war with the production of the AK-47 and its variants. To say that Izhmash knows the ins and outs of Kalashnikov production would be a gross understatement.

To make such extensive changes, Legion Ltd. wanted a company with the knowledge, skill set and background to properly do this work. “They were looking for a company that would maintain their renowned level of quality. We were looking for a high-quality product that would serve as a platform for our project,” Pakhanyan explains. He pointed out that Legion Ltd. was happy to learn that Arsenal Inc. had the proper tooling and quality control required to work on their rifles. According to Pakhanyan, the partnership was easily formed.

I'm looking to see what I can get for my century arms AK 74 it is used and shoots very well out to 300 yards. No failures of any kind with any type of ammo. All six magazines feed flawlessly and comes with a red dot optic 450 rounds of steel cored ammunition and the black drag bag in the photo.The gun will come as is in the package with everything seen in the photo. I will not split up anything because this is the only one of these I have. If you have the right offer I will throw in some more ammo as I buy more periodically around each month. This gun is a money saver and it is a blast to shoot. Surplus ammo will easily cost you half of what it costs to feed a 308 or a 5.56 without sacrificing performance, every time you pull the trigger it goes bang!

IF you contact me please do so with a trade or offer that you are willing to commit to."

Factory New

The Bounty Hunter single action revolver has been sold in the USA for over 20 years. Made in Germany and available in 22LR /22WMR, .357 Mag, .44 Mag and 45 LC, it is simply one of the best single action revolvers produced. You can purchase a more expensive, or a famous brand, but you won’t be getting a better single action firearm. The Bounty Hunter is a traditional 6 shot single action revolver with traditional resting notch, but it also has a transfer bar and recessed chambers for shooting safety. Our 22LR/22WMR version is on a full size frame unlike our competition. So you can practice your Cowboy Action Shooting with rimfire or go plinking with our 6rd or 8rd rimfire cylinders. There are a lot of single action revolvers out there but none better than The Bounty Hunter from EAA Corp.

Just selling because I bought a new rifle and need the money. Trades welcome. Let me know what you have. Thanks


The G23 offers fast transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, incredible field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. The G23 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

It offers a comfortable eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand. The Flip to Side mount is incredibly durable and operates by pressing the lever on the side of  the mount causing the magnifier to ""flip"" to the side and out ofthe way. The G23 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.


 3x magnifier with Flip-To-Side mount and quick detach. Works with all existing HWS units."

Up for sale is my Tikka T3 Lite in 308.
This is a 6lb 3oz light weight rifle (without the scope) that has a guarantee of 1 MOA with 3 shots from Tikka. 
This rifle is VERY accurate and VERY fun to shoot, once I lightened the adjustable trigger I was able to get around 1 MOA at 100 yards, with some groups touching while others were around 1 MOA. I never shot it enough to really find out how contestant I could be with the rifle, but getting 1 MOA with this rifle was not difficult at all.
The bolt is insanely smooth!!!! As soon as you lift the bolt, you can tilt the rifle back and the bolt will slide to the rear. 
It does recoil more than a heavier rifle, but the stock pad does a great job at allowing me to shoot as much as I want without a sore/bruised shoulder. 
I love this thing, but since the furthest I can shoot it at the range is 200 yards, it tends to not be used since I have bought my M1a Scout.
It has had approximately 125 rounds through the barrel with the barrel being cleaned after each trip to the range. 
It is in excellent shape and is a great rifle to go hunting with (due to the light weight), or just for shooting at the range.

What is included;
Tikka T3 Lite rifle in 308 w/ 1 3rnd magazine
