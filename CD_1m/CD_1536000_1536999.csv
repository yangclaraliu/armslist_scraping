It's in almost new condition, I've put 100 rounds of federal gold match down the barrel. I get .250-.500"" moa at 100m consistently. I am wanting to trade for an AR10 308 platform weapon. I am really only looking for an AR10, but I would be open to high end 1911's if the right one is offered. 

Depending on the offer, I have a Leupold vx3 4.5-14x40 30mm tube scope on it currently. This scope is very similar to an mk4 scope, just without the turrets. 

These 5r's aren't easily found and don't come up for sale or trade often, so here's your chance. I will be pretty picky with offers, so just let me know and we can go from there.

Spike's Tactical Lowers are still back ordered for 6-12 months long with no guarantee you will get one; so take advantage and get it now. If they do pass a ban (I hope not) these Complete Lowers are going to be priceless and you will be grandfathered in with an AR-15.

This is a complete lower so all you need is a complete upper to assemble an AR15. Since the lower is the actual gun transfer need to be done through an FFL. I also know FFLs throughout the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 DOJ background check Total $35. This is also a real machined lower, not a cheap polymer one that might break! 

Specs: Spike's Tactical Lower Receiver * CNC Machined from a 7075 T6 MIL-H-6088 Forging * Low Shelf for RDIAS * Milled Manufacturer Engravings * Accepts .154"" Diameter Trigger & Hammer Pins * MIL-A-8625F Type III Class 2 Hard-coat Anodized Finish inside and out.

$695 Firm, it doesn’t hurt to make me a reasonable offer.
Local meet up around Bay Area or Outer Bay Area. FFL transfer, transfer fees and DOJ background check is $35 total.
Please E-mail me if you are interested, please include your City. We might be able to meet there.
Trades are welcome please include what you have to trade."
