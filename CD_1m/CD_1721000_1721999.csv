Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting
enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the
excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. Henry selected
the Golden Boy as the canvas for the application of fine hand engraving
which elevates an already beautiful rifle into a work of art. The result
represents the true marriage of state of the art gunsmithing with the
centuries old craft of engraving.

Two mags are the steel , the rest are polymer tapco and circle 10 mags. Rifle is in great working condition has the normal rack wear that any military weapon (not sold in wal-marts) would have. Side folding stock, two types of sights, piston driven 5.56, more accurate than an AK74, ambidextrous fire selector, NO MAG WOBBLE what so ever. This thing is solid. It's as reliable as an AK and as accurate as an M4. The flip up combat sights are nice but it also has M16 style peep sights. Also comes with an Israeli Galil scope mount which is extremely rare. The mount has a hole through the top just like an M16's carrying handle through which you can attache an M16 rail for any scope you want. $1000 obo 

EDIT: I had this rifle for $1300 obo previously. I noticed that weapons and ammo prices are dropping! This is great news. I dropped my Galil to $1100 obo respectively. It would be a lot cheaper but there are 11 magazines with it. They are usually about $60 a pair, you're getting the Israeli scope mount for free along with a couple mags.. With my rifle being $1100, that ALSO means your WASR is not a $900 gun like you thought it was 2 months ago. But I want an underfolder pretty bad, so I'll work with you. Don't low ball me though. I'm looking for an underfolder (any make other than Yugo, great rifles, I just don't like the build) and mags and ammo. If you don't have mags and ammo, I'll give you the galil for your wasr underfolder +$400. If it's an Arsenal side folder with no mags or ammo, we're even. I'd love a polish underfolder or a bulgy side folder AK74."

The barrel and receiver are hardcoat anodized and the furniture is Matte Black synthetic.There is a quad rail for attaching accessories of your choice.

The SR-556 offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants.

Every SR-556 is built with a hammer-forged, chrome-lined mil-spec 41V45 barrel that ensures accuracy and longevity. The rifles come equpped with a set of Troy Industries Folding Battlesights, consisting of an adjustable rear sight and an elevation adjustable front sight that fold down at the push of a button and can be easily removed to make room for advanced optics. A Hogue Monogrip pistol grip adds comfort when carrying or shooting. Other features include a telescoping buttstock, a chrome-plated bolt, a one-piece bolt carrier and extractor, and a set of rail covers.

Legally,these are imported as pistols,not rifles, therefore they are not bound by the regulation (usc 922r) limiting foreign made parts in assault rifles. This means that the ENTIRE weapon was made in the Romanian Cugir arsenal, where they make their military weapons. Most AK's circulating in the states have been re-manufactured, by law, from a mix of foreign and US made parts. So,while this is a Romanian weapon, and even imported by Century Arms , it hasn't been cobbled together out of mismatched,used parts by the infamous ""ham-fisted chimps at CAI"", like the sometimes-questionable WASR AK's. This is ALL genuine East Block AK, the reciever,trigger,chrome-lined barrel,etc. and everything is straight,solid and very well put together.
 I've added a few extras, like a Picatinny/tactical rail forend, a sling mount adapter and a high-end sling, a Krinkov flash hider, and a slightly larger after-market grip ( or I could put the original Bake-lite grip back on it.) I'm also including the original wood fore-grips, as well as a couple boxes of good Russian ammo.
 (Now, the usual fine print: No checks, no shipping, FTF local cash sale only, purchaser MUST be over 21 and Georgia resident, with valid ID to prove it. I will not respond to scammers asking if ""the item is still for sale"". If the ad is still up, it's still for sale. I'm the original purchaser, and Ga. resident with my Ga.

I am in need of some quick cash however, I do not plan on giving this away. The ammo is going for over 50 cents per round on gunbroker.com and, the pistol is worth $250. The 3 spare mags (total of 4) (hard to find) are worth $100. Plus im throwing in a .30 cal ammo can to store the ammo. So much ammo the pistol will not fit. There is 650-750 rounds of ammo on stripper clips. You are free to count it first. This package is worth around $650. I will take a reasonable offer. If no reasonable offer is received tonight, I am going to sell to gun store tomorrow after-noon. For all you little 9mm, .45, or .40 cal fan boys.... The 7.62x25 round is one of the hottest pistol rounds ever made. Will cut threw bullet proof vest. Has the most penetration of any automatic pistol round I know of.

Worth twice what I'm asking. Need money to pay a fine before I can move. 1340 W. Summer St in Appleton. I'm home all day so just stop by. I'm tired of all the calls asking if I still got it cause the answer is YES and I'm taking a huge loss but I need it gone by Thursday. I've got an extremely rare and fun Jeep 92XXX miles. It's my daily driver and runs great. Most Jeeps are fun cause you can take the doors off and feel the wind in your hair, but this ones better cause you don't need to find a place to tuck these doors as they slide right back and lock in place. Its a DJ-5G only 1200 made and out of that only about 100 came with the back door stamped ""JEEP"". Has a AMC inline 4 and 3 speed transmission (engine is an Audi and transmission is a Torqueflite 904 which is used in the Porsche 904 sports car). Push button start, new Weber carb, new battery and I have boxes of parts. Comes with 5 gallon Jerry can, 2 extra carbs, spare distributors, 4 bigger tires on rims, extra back door (they go for about $900). Have a spare hood as the one on it is cracked. In all the parts and extras I'm throwing in are valued at more than I'm asking for the whole deal. 100amp stick welder and gear (gloves, mask, welding sticks, grinder and cutting wheels) large 1/4inch steel plates that I was going to reinforce with. Ones 40""x40"" the other is 40""x18"" (paid $200+ for the steel). The Jeep runs great just needs the headlights wired to the headlight switch. There is a great deal of rust but its from 1979 and sat from 2000 till I got it 4 months ago. I just need to sell it cause I am moving back to Arizona on the 23rd and can't take it with me.

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine"

PLEASE CALL US AT REDACTED, ASK FOR CLINT OR ANDREW, THANKS

The Zastava M57 pistol, was the standard sidearm of the Yugoslavian army. Adopted in 1957, it was a licensed produced copy of the Soviet Tokarev TT pistol, although the M57 had a longer grip that hosted a longer magazine (9 rounds versus 8 rounds in TT). In around 1970 Crvena Zastava began production of the similar pistol.

This pistol is the M57a, it's the same as the M57 but it has an external safety. These are new pistols.

of cowboy life on the trail.  The Henry Big Boy .44 Magnum Wildlife Edition
emulates the pulse quickening thrill of a trophy buck leaping into view.
Each genuine American walnut buttstock and forearm are engraved using
techniques which combine todays engraving technologies with hand
craftsmanship passed from  generations past. After engraving, artisans
individually hand paint the buttstock and forearm using multiple acrylic
colors. The original artwork is visually used as a guide, but subtle
detailing makes each unit truly one of a kind.

The FNS is the result of years of research incorporating the most precise
engineering and product development to bring the most highly-advanced
striker-fired pistol to the American law enforcement and personal defense
market. The FN FNS is a true double-action pistol with a pivoting hinged
trigger featuring an exceptionally crisp break and a short travel to reset.
The matte black polymer frame comes with four interchangeable backstraps to
customize grip fit and is designed with a low-bore axis for reduced felt
recoil and enhanced control. The fully-ambidextrous controls are shaped for
easy access without snagging on holsters or clothing. The contoured
frame-mounted manual safety is ideally placed for positive operation by
either thumb. The FNS offers a hammer-forged stainless steel barrel. The
slide features front and rear cocking serrations and is topped with
three-dot fixed night sights. The FN FNS also is equipped with steel frame
rails that can be easily replaced.

I was hoping the community could give me a little info about the ammo that will work best for me? I know all about the .410 shells so i'm covered there, standard .410 shells are pretty worthless unless i'm shooting snakes and home defense shells have the ""defense disks"". It's the .45 I need some guidance on. I read on one forum that you can't use 45 apc rounds as well as .45 colt long. I have no clue what the difference is as this is my first experience with this caliber. I looked up on the Walmart and Bass Pro websites the different types of .45 rounds and it's more than I can process. Please, I'd love to hear your thoughts, experience, anything... even send me a link to some ammo that works for you. Thanks in advance."

two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9

Armed Forces M9 pistols. Unique M9-prefixed serial number: (M9-xxxxxx) sets
this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols. Dot-and-Post

combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling, but with a shorter and
proportioned slide and grip. The durable polymer frame is
fiberglass-reinforced with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail and a modular grip
system for a custom fit. It has a manual safety and an ambidextrous slide
stop lever. The Bruniton non-reflective black coating is offer superior
resistance against corrosion and wear.

If your not familiar with the sportster set up it means, in a nut shell, that there is no pistol grip installed. However you can very easily convert Saiga's to have a pistol grip, accept standard AK magazines and all of the other aftermarket goodies for standard AK47's. With that said my rifle comes with two magazines, one ten round and one forty round. It also has a aftermarket bracket installed to accept a scope mounting system. 

My cash price is $700 or I would trade straight across for a nice Glock G19, 3rd or 4th generation only. If interested you can call my cell at REDACTED or email through the link."

Legally,these are imported as pistols,not rifles, therefore they are not bound by the regulation (usc 922r) limiting foreign made parts in assault rifles. This means that the ENTIRE weapon was made in the Romanian Cugir arsenal, where they make their military weapons. Most AK's circulating in the states have been re-manufactured, by law, from a mix of foreign and US made parts. So,while this is a Romanian weapon, and even imported by Century Arms , it hasn't been cobbled together out of mismatched,used parts by the infamous ""ham-fisted chimps at CAI"", like the sometimes-questionable WASR AK's. This is ALL genuine,new East Block AK; the reciever,trigger,chrome-lined barrel,etc. and everything is straight,solid and very well put together.
I've added a few extras, like a Picatinny/tactical rail forend, a sling mount adapter and a very nice sling, a Krinkov flash hider, and a slightly larger after-market grip ( or I could put the original Bake-lite grip back on it.) I'm also including the original wood grips, as well as a couple boxes of good Russian ammo.
(Now, the usual fine print: No checks, no shipping, FTF local cash sale only, purchaser MUST be over 21 and Georgia resident, with valid ID to prove it. I'm the original purchaser, and have my Ga. CCW permit, so everything's cool on my end. )

Factory Fresh! New in box! 

Advanced Armament Corporation complete MPW 16” chambered for 300 AAC BLACKOUT. 

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm
caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300
AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines.

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide
extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming
chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to
accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™
flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX
III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories.
The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high
hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also
a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme
corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a
single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened
steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement
in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind
even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium
ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible
life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower
strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with
Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a
Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by
MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are
not included.

The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides
an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."

That's the info on this gun right off of the Springfield Armory website.  I have had this gun a few weeks now and put 100 or so rounds down the pipe.  I like this gun and I like Springfield, I just prefer 9mm.  I'd say it comes with everything like it would new, papers, 2 mags, cable lock, cleaning rod, speed loader, belt holster for both gun and mags.
And since this is the only .45 I have I'll be sending all the ammo I have with you.  Brand new unopened box of 100 Winchester 230 grain, and a handful (20 or so) of Hornady Critical Defense rounds, about a buck a piece.  I'd rather sell outright to help fund my next project, but I would consider trade if it leans in my favor."

First off in case you didn't know, the 5.45x39 Rd is the russian predecessor to the 7.62x39, made in response to the skinnier, longer american made .223/.556 rd around the time of the vietnam war or after. Its a lightweight and very accurate round, thus making the Ak74 a way more accurate rifle than the earlier ak47's.

I have for sale a very very nice brand new in box, fired 50rds to make sure it cycles properly, flawless response.  It comes in the original box with the Saiga AK74 (Izhmash) certificate from the factory (serial #/model # production dates) and the original accessories including 10rd magazine, mini oil can, cleaning rod, and removable brush. I oiled and cleaned the gun after test firing.

Now on to the extras, it comes with a 6 position tapco stock with 2 built in sling mounts, it also comes with 1x10rd magazine. Also throwing in a long rifle hard case and 3x30rd boxes of hollow point wolf ammo. I also have a avail to purchase few brand new tapco polymer mags that are the latest versions made for this gun so they won't jam like earlier models avail. The magazines are in the original plastic zip up sleeves.

I have 100 into the gun and I paid 950 for it brand new, so Im knocking off $55 bucks since I lost the original plastic stock that came on the gun from the factory. If  you want that one you can easily find one on here for $10 or less.

$995 for the rifle and $105 for the extra mags.

I also have a 1080 rd spam can that I purchased for $350 that I will let go for $300 if you buy with the rifle.

Im in the Niwot area. No felons or thugs, I will refuse to sell if I don't feel comfortable. We will do everything the legal way according to new colorado laws. If you want to discuss this please contact me with your questions or concerns and we will go over all the hoopla that our state now requires us to do for private gun sales."

Semi-Auto 1919


This is the last year of 1919 A4/A6 production at TNW. We are now in our final production run of the famous .30Cal semi-auto. Our guns are made of the original 1934 armored U.S. G.I. Parts kits! Over the years, many companies have tried to copy us in the production of their Israeli guns. It has been interesting to watch those companies come and go as they released shoddy imitations of the real thing. Only one company's products have held their value - TNW FIREARMS. If you have ever thought about investing in our history, the time is now. 


TNW will still be supporting the market place with all internal firing parts and limited overrun of completed side plates. Our production staff is hard at work on the next generation of TNW products and will be releasing some collectable items in near future.



The Browning Model 1919 was the work horse of the U.S. and allied armies. They were used in aircraft, tanks and front line infantry and saw action from WWII through Vietnam.



This modified original Browning 1919-A4 has been remanufactured using genuine G.I. parts to shoot semi-auto only and can not be converted to full-auto. This firearm is BATF approved and may be legally owned like any other rifle and in all fifty states.

Up for sale is an awesome Smith & Wesson SW99. Striker fire pistol, superior to glock 19 in my opinion here's why. Front Cocking Serrations, Optional Double action first trigger pull, decocker, Cocked indicator, over sized trigger guard for gloved hands, EXTREMELY ERGONOMIC, also has raised 3 dot sights not hoakie glock sights DOUBLE STRIKE CAPABILITY. Glock has none of these options. This is a walther design. However, S&W offers a life time warranty, Walther does not. If you like the PPQ or PPX you will like this pistol.

I have a Flawless 1911 Pistol For Sale or Trade- it's a Kimber Ultra Carry 2 subcompact pistol with an 8 round capacity with 3"" Stainless Steel Bull Barrel and the smoothest match grade trigger I have ever felt. It's a bearutiful gun with aluminum frame and stainless steel slide so its lightweight and the easiest to carry and conceal and most comfortable gun to carry I've ever had and I've had just about every kind of gun imaginable over the years. MOST RELIABLE AND SMOOTHEST FUNCTIONING GUN I'VE OWNED, PLUS ITS BEAUTIFUL. It has got the most reliable feeding and ejection system ever made by Kimber and has always functioned absolutely flawlessly,  not issues whatsoever.  Includes $200+ worth of ammo- both hollow points and regular ammo and 2 Kimber/Kimbdr Pro Tactical magazines that funtion flawlessly.  GUN IS IN SHOWROOM CONDITION AND ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS AND HAS BEEN METICULOUSLy MAINTAINED AND HAS ONLY FIRED PREIUM FACTORY AMMO. Comes with original box and accessories including 2 holsters-one inside waist band bolster and one belt holster that holds the gun and the extra clip. I've got the Kimber tool and a custom tool i ordered online made for super easy disassembly/field stripping the gun to clean/lubricate it but I find it very easy to take apart with no tools at all but some people prefer the takedown tools. Its just as easy to take apart as a Glock or anything else intake by hand and no tools needed in my opinion. The gun was broken in and maintained properly and has been my personal.carry/defense weapon and has been treated with lots of care and I'd trust it with my life anywhere/anytime because it has always went boom every time the trigger was pulled and has always fed all bullets properly with no jams/stovepipes/FTF/FTE or anything.  A Quality Weapon as you would except from Kimber- this gun was quite expensive but once you shoot it you'll see why- it's the smoothest gun I've ever shot and can be carried fully loaded with 7 bullets in the clip and 1 in the chamber with no worries-it's totally safe. Great Gun and none nicer- lets make a deal!"

This pistol has an all black finish with a Red Star near the muzzle on both sides of the pistol and it comes with two 16 round mags. It has glow in the dark sights, not Tritium. There is a Soviet hammer and sickle laser engraved on the right hand side of the frame above the grip. The trigger pull appears to be similar to the original Cold War era hefty East Bloc trigger pull. The rollmarks are in Cyrillic script and state “ Model 75 Cal. 9 Para” and “Manufactured in Czechoslovakia” in Russian. The serial number is preceded by CCCP, which is Russian for USSR. This is a Cold War commemorative and, as such, it is important to remember that the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia) was a member of the Warsaw Pact."

Looking to go another direction towards bench shooting so I'm interested in a trade if it involves a 40 or 50mm variable 3-9 or 3-12 or 4-12 or 4-16 scope with a (preferable QD) scope mount and swivel bi-pod.  I'll entertain all reasonable offers, but I believe this is a VERY good price for what you are getting, considering getting all this today from LT would cost well over $1300 after everything is said and done.

Each piece has been babied like my unborn children, and even still uses the original battery.  This setup maybe has 1000rds of 5.56 rounds under it's belt.  I will post pictures when I get home tonight, but in the mean time either email me or call Josh at 817-two two nine-8206.

Please note: You can use any full size or compact handgun with a rail. It does not have to be a Sig Sauer in order to operate this awesone platform.......The SIG SAUER® Standard Adaptive Carbine Platform (ACP) allows any handgun with an accessory rail to be quickly modified into a personal defense weapon or carbine style firearm. Regardless of the brand, most pistols equipped with an accessory rail can be mounted to the ACP without the need for modification to the base gun. ACP will accept most railed guns with barrels up to 5"" in length. This basic model allows for fast, easy conversion and works with most railed pistols, equipped with a QD sling mount. Fabricated from solid aircraft-grade aluminum, the ACP sports M1913 rails at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions with a full-length top rail at the 12 o’clock position. Compatible accessories such as lights, red dot sights and lasers can be mounted for additional functionality. The ACP brings Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) features to almost any handgun.

Sig Site:
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.
With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.
Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.
The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.
Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents."
