* .204 Ruger
* 6mm BRM
* 45-70
I am moving away from (too many rifles) and prefer trades for handguns....or maybe AR15?

This is a great way to have a multi-season/multi-game hunting set-up....from Prairie Dogs to Elephants!

First.... I will NOT sell barrels or scopes separately.

You WILL get rifle with ALL three Barrels and your CHOICE of ONE, Two, ALL or no Scope.

These are UNFIRED barrels that I bought new from EABCO.

1) .204 Ruger E.A.B Accuracy Barrel 26""...cost me $325 +tax/shipping

2) .6mm  Bench Rest  E.A.B Accuracy Barrel 26""....cost me $325 +tax/shipping

3) 45-70 Encore Barrel...Made by Thompson, cost me $271 +tax/shipping

I sent the receiver to Jim Hendershot who is recommended by Mike Bellm (Encore Guru) and had him
do a Trigger-Job set ~2lbs!

Now for Scope Choices:

1) Redfield Revolution 4-12X40 Accu...cost me $250
2) 8.50-20x50mm Mueller Eradicator Scope cost me $260
3) Leupold 66550, VX 3 Scope, 6.5-20x40mm Variable, cost me $780

I do not care to hear about how you can buy these for 'whatever'.....I am simply telling  you what I paid.
These are new, with boxes and papers...never used.

You can chose to Not pick a scope and we will adjust accordingly.

So...I have $1400 in the rifle, barrels and trigger job.

I will price this like this:

No scopes....$1200 FIRM
add $200 for either Redfiled or Mueller.....
add $500 for Leupold.

I prefer trades.....HANDUNS ONLY....

45.acp
9mm 

This is NOT a ""Fire-Sale""...I do not need the money...so lowballers save my time and yours.

All serious trades will be responded to promptly.

I can and will ship..FFL to FFL only.

Thanks."

Black Hills produces factory new ammunition equal to some of the best handloads and is quickly becoming one of most popular manufacturers of ammunition. Used primarily by all branches of the United State military, this ammunition is also used by competitive shooters and hunters. This 5.56 load was developed for AR-15 platform firearms.

MatchKing rifle bullets are super-accurate bullets with very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight. Their accuracy has been acclaimed worldwide and they have been used to win more target competitions than all target bullets from other manufacturers combined. Each bullet is designed with a very small meplat in order to achieve the highest ballistic coefficient possible. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

Please Note: While the 5.56x45mm NATO will fit in a .223 Remington chamber, the 5.56 is a military round that runs at higher pressures than its .223 counterpart and is not recommended to be fired in a .223 Remington chamber.

For target shooting, tactical training, action-pistol competition, or any other high-volume shooting activity, UMC handgun ammunition offers outstanding performance without any compromise in quality or reliability. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a better value anywhere. Many of the most sought-after calibers are available in convenient bulk packs"

Box of 250 rounds CCI 22 Maxi-Mag. Autographed by Swamp People Troy and Jacob Landry.  Someone started to pull the tab off the top... Still unopened

I just purchased this at Gander Monutain.  Retailed for $65 with tax; it's their price wihout the signatures.  I am going to shoot this ammo, so If you have unsigned same ammo I will trade you even. I think Gander Mountain rips people off selling this ammo for $65 with tax... Maybe it's a find if you want the signatures.

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance.

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers.

Turns out I'm basically one of those bigger is better type people when it comes to guns, so don't think I'll be shooting much 9mm any more, selling off the 6 extra boxes (50 rounds in each box) I have at $24 each, this is at cost so I can get my money back and the ammo doesn't go to waste during these hard times. 

This is very high quality ammo, unlike the other eastern European ammo PPU is brass cased and is of super high quality (arguably better than most American brass), you might know them also as Privi Partisan, their brass is used by Hornady for much of their super premium hunting ammo and some of their 'critical defense' line of premium self defense ammo, Graf & Sons also uses PPU brass for much of their custom ammo line, Wolf uses PPU brass for their ""Wolf Gold"" premium line of brass cased hunting ammo. 

If your a reloader, you might be interested to know that PPU's brass is of such quality that the legendary Norma line from Olin/Winchester sometiems uses PPU brass instead of brass from Winchester, that means that for some calibers in their super premium norma line the Winchester corporation actually chooses to use PPU as a subcontractor over creating their own brass. In my reloading I often try to use PPU for my medium/high power rifle cartridges over other brands, because the brass is a higher quality alloy when compared to some, is often substantantially thicker than most and the case necks are annealed to a higher standard that any other company I know of because unlike other companies PPU creates their brass products with reloaders specifically in mind. If you reload you probably know what I'm talking about and realize that a thicker case means more reuses before case web/head seperation and a thicker shoulder/better annealing means you can get more reuses from each case before you get cracks in the neck/shoulder area. 

If you don't reload, then all you need to know is that PPU ammo is great stuff, definitely better than Winchester white box, almost as good as Fiocchi, but not quite as amazing as Sellier&Bellot. 

Also willing to trade for .22lr (depending on what it is and its age), most any .17 HMR, some other centerfire ammo, or for reloading supplies/equipment, especially bullets in certain cals, IMR4064, WIN231/HP38, and any primers."

The bore is clean and mirror-like. My 39A's condition, made in 1947, is well above the average for a gun that is about 66 years old. It fires .22 short/long/long rifle ammo. The barrel is 24 inches long. You can see by the pics that the external metal and wood finish still looks very good. There are limited basic scratches and wear on the metal, a few small nicks in the wood, and someone in the past bunged up a couple screws. This gun is a take-down model and can be separated quickly. The gun’s serial number starts with the letter ‘D’. The attached era Weaver G4 rifle scope was produced from 1947 to 1954. Included is the American Gunsmith Marlin 39A Technical Manual on DVD. I have more pics to send. Just ask.

He got probation and had to surrender the firearms he still had.     
To my understanding you can sell in Illinois as a private party to another private party as long as both parties have a FOID card. Thats what I found on line anyway. 
This guy was tried in federal court.  So did the feds come in and over rule the state laws and made this guys life suck even worse than it already was?

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness

If you have one of these in full or semi auto you probably can use these.
These originally had 1969 Lake City .30M2 ball in them and that was pulled for rifle use....so these have never been used and don't have a scratch or mark on them.
Black parkerized milspec finish, 264 in the bag (and I might have more).

Hey! Even if you don't have a belt-fed gun, you can link together loaded strings to hand on your wall or make ""Rambo Belts"" out of.....or empty casings for similar cool uses. The last batch I saw at a local gun show were priced at 25 cents apiece....mine are WAY cheaper than that at less than a dime each!

Great price on genuine US 30.06 links
$10.00 cash takes the entire bag. Thanks for looking!"

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance

It has one range trip and fifty rounds on it.  I purchased this for my wife at a gun show a few months ago for her to carry.  She loved the ergonomics of the grip because it fit her small hands.  (surprisingly, it fits my huge hands pretty well because of the lip on the mag.)  

Anyway, after talking about it some more, she doesn't feel comfortable carrying a firearm and wants a compact stun gun instead.  I carry an compact 1911 so this gun just doesn't have a lot of purpose for us.  It shoots great and feels really good in your hand.  The recoil is also very minimal.

The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

In the accessories packet there are three rail covers by Knights Armament and they have Colt 30 round magazines, orange saftey plug, and  manual.

This has never even had a round in the Magazine, never a round even in the barrel, IT IS THE CLOSEST YOU WILL GET TO THE FULL AUTO M4 THE MILITARY USES. 
IT IS HEAVIER THAN THE LE6920 DUE TO THE BETTER BARREL. 

TRULY AWESOME WEAPON BY COLT, I HATE TO GET RID OF IT BUT NEED THE CASH NOW. 

** DON'T BE FOOLED BY FAKE SOCOMS , THEY WILL HAVE THE M4A1 MARKING AND THE BARREL IS NOTICEABLY THICKER UNDER THE HAND-GUARDS. **

PLEASE SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY , ******NO TRADES CASH ONLY*****"
