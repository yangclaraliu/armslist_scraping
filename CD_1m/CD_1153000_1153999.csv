Exactly 200 rounds through it to break it in. This beast is a tack driver at 300 yards. 12 year military vet, so I know how to build and take care of rifles. This puppy has been babied ever since I built it and have had nearly no time to take it to the range. It is sitting in this brand new voodoo tactical bag and is ready for a new home. With the way the gun control scare is these days, rifles like this are becoming nearly impossible to get your hands on. Do not hesitate. This rifle is amazing and priced to sell quickly. 


I live in Buena Vista, CO. I am willing to drive a ways to meet up, but you are going to have to meet me at a location I am comfortable with. 

If meeting from Denver, I will meet in Fairplay CO

Other arrangements might be possible, but we would need to discuss them in detail via phone.

I will require a drivers license showing you are a CO resident and must be at least 21 years of age. I will also ask that you sign a bill of sale to show proof over ownership transfer.


Cash only. No IOU, no PayPal, no Checks and no Trades! Cash is king! Price includes scope. If you do not want the scope, the price will drop by 200.00 bucks. No lowballs please. AR's are hard to come by and only getting harder with all the ban talk. Thanks for looking!


UPDATE: Would consider a partial trade for a newest generation glock and cash. Still prefer a full cash deal, but make me an offer if you have a like new gen 4 glock."

 The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS – which stands for 1911 Compact SAS – comes from the SIG SAUER® Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability"

P-3AT
The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Car is in really good condition! Outside is about a 8.5/10 Couple of small scratches and rims need to be redone on a couple (Scratched up). Inside it's a 8/10 Couple scratches, leather is starting to crack but other than that it is a really nice car. I get complements all the time and the car rides AMAZING! I have taken it on a few road trips (FL, Charleston, Myrtle beach, Gatlinburg) There is nothing like a convertible blowing through your hair and cruising! Also Tires are only about 6 months old. so well over 80% Tread. Also the  Steering wheel control I think short circuited and all buttons except for Pwr button works.

The reason I am selling is because I need a bigger car for more people and more room. I love this car it is properly quick and rides so good! There will be no Joy rides. If you are under 18 I will ask you to bring a parent, insurance. Also like I said about Joy rides I will request if you are really interested to have payment in hand if you expect to drive this car. I would be glad to drive it for you but If you want to drive I will need payment!
I will also include a single/double din kit for aftermarket radio and a Steering wheel aftermarket kit (120.00 Value)

Price is 20,000.obo
The lowest cash I will take is 19,000.00+ 1,000 Trade

It’s time to act.

Today, Senator John Morse is expected to add his Backdoor ""Assault Weapons"" Ban to the list of anti-gun legislation about to be heard in the Senate.

Capitol sources tell us that committee hearings could come as early as next Monday or Tuesday, with initial floor votes following as early as Thursday.

In addition to Morse's Backdoor ""Assault Weapons"" Ban, Senate Committees are likely to hear:

HB-1224: Bans all magazines that hold more than 15 rounds.
HB-1226: Bans armed self-defense on college campuses; expanding criminal safe-zones to all state college and university campuses.
HB-1228: Imposes a Jim Crow-style gun tax on all purchases. This legislation has no limit on the amount the CBI could charge for a background check.
HB-1229: Bans the private sale of firearms and expand background checks/gun registration for all Colorado gun owners.
Gun owners -- like YOU -- must be heard. The only way we have a chance to defeat these radically anti-gun bills -- and the East Coast money that's pushing them -- is to put grassroots pressure on the politicians.

Members of the Colorado State Senate MUST know that their constituents -- law-abiding gun owners -- DO NOT support more gun control. 

New York's billionaire-playboy Mayor Michael Bloomberg is pumping untold millions into Colorado to fund his gun control agenda. He and his anti-gun lobbyists have found willing conspirators in the White House and Senator John Morse's office. 

There are a number of Senators who we believe may be wavering in their support of Bloomberg's New York agenda. 

That's where you come in. It's imperative these Senators hear from Colorado's law-abiding gun owners -- people like you and me. 

Politely and respectfully urge them to oppose ALL gun control legislation's in Colorado. Tell them to stand up for Colorado's gun owners, not New York lobbyists. 

These Senator's need to hear from you today via phone AND e-mail:

These Senators could be key votes that decide the fate of this legislation. 

Not sure what to tell them? 

Here's what I recommend: 

Dear Senator NAME, 

Coloradan's DO NOT support more gun control: 

NO Magazine Bans 
NO ban on private firearms sales 
NO Gun Tax on gun purchases 
NO universal background checks/gun registration 
NO ""Mental health"" database to deny gun rights 
NO Backdoor ""Assault Weapon"" bans 
Please vote with Colorado gun owners, not anti-gun lobbyists from New York. 

Signed: (Your Name)

Once you've contacted these Senators, please forward this e-mail to ALL of your gun-owning friends and urge them to call and e-mail these Senators as well. 

Your activism -- TODAY -- could make the difference. Please don't put off for tomorrow what we must do today.

Call and e-mail these Senators TODAY. 

For liberty, 



Dudley Brown, 
Executive Director 
P.S. The Colorado State Senate will be hearing a host of anti-gun measures next week. Gun owners must make their voices heard at the Capitol. 

Please contact these Senators today. Politely and respectfully urge them to oppose ALL gun control legislation's in Colorado. Tell them to stand up for Colorado's gun owners, not New York lobbyists.

The bore is good, it feeds well and is a blast to shoot.  I've got the bayonet, the oil can, ammo pouches and a TON of stripper clips.  Also, I've got 880 rounds of surplus ammo in the sealed containers still along with probably close to 100 rounds of misc. Wolf and other surplus.

Again, there's nothing wrong with it I just want something a little more modern.  I tried to take a couple pics of the armory stamping, but they wouldn't show up very well.

In good condition other than when we were riding it a rock flew up and cracked the windshield in the middle, but it is still ride-able though. It was recently greased up as well. We paid $1500 for out from an older couple who took really good care of it. It has about 5.5k miles on it. we only drove it about 100 miles when we owned it. Works well if you are looking for a good price on a snowmobile. We have the titles as well and the manual that came with it. Also comes with a pull behind sled that can attach to a stationary hinge on the back of the snowmobile that we paid $150 for.

Has the Mercruiser Alpha 1 Gen 1. New Gimbal bearing and boots. A solid boat. Temp Gauge works but is sticky, Trim/Tilt gauge does not work, possibly switch. All other gauges function as normal, cosmetically boat is in decent shape for its age. Vinyl does have some cracks in it, the seats are overall great it is mostly the tanning deck that has the cracks. Comes with everything I have for it, one person tube, ski rope(no skis), and various life vest and safety equipment and a spare prop, the one on it is a little dinged but extremely functional. All lights work, horn is spotty so kept a air horn on stand by new horn on ebay is $20 just have been busy. Comes with a load rite roller trailer that is in good shape. I don't really want to sell the boat but if I am able to get a fair amount for it than I will let it go. It is winterized and in storage but I can get at it anytime. A rebuilt engine is about $3000 alone add in the fact this boat is very solid and since rebuild has never seen salt water.

By completing this class you will then be eligible to apply for your Kansas Carry Conceal License through the Attorney General's office.

The class covers CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Self Defense, and Interaction with Law Enforcement. 

There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

It has a full, crisp mum and an original (though not matching) dust cover. It is not import marked. I bought this rifle as a big chunk of rust in a duffle cut stock. I cleaned up all the metal and found a series correct Nagoya stock. The barrel and receiver still have a nice blue with some freckling while the rest of the metal has a very nice patina. The bore still has some shine and the rifling is pretty crisp. I have fired it and it is a pleasant shooting accurate little bugger. In the interest of full disclosure the firing pin did pierce a couple primers though from what I have found this is not a headspace issue as these rifle are known for their generous, strong chambers.

The 92FS, Beretta's premier full metal gun, most resembles the military M9 9mm pistol. Accurate out of the box, this workhorse features an open slide design that virtually eliminates jamming, a safety system that combines de-cocking with a slide-mounted positive thumb safety, and a combat muzzle crown. Beretta's proprietary black, non-glare Bruniton finish gives your 92FS a wear-resistant coating, which means it will stand up to any special duty.

(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years."

Willing to meet FTF in the Tacoma area. Cash is King, but I will trade if it is in my favor.  Any questions or need more pictures, just ask. She shoots bang on at 25 yards and with Springfield's lifetime warranty there isn't much you need to worry about. Has fed every single type of ammunition I have ever put into it without a hiccup. I'm probably going to regret this one, but no sense in keeping something around that I'm not shooting as much anymore."

It drops right onto a standard AR15 Lower.  All NFA Rules apply.  comes with 2 28 round mags, and original box.

Here's the catch:  The firing pin on this unit was too short, causing light primer strikes.  I welded 1/8"" of weld to the firing pin, and almost all of the misfires went away.  The problem I now have have is almost all of the .22LR I have left is mostly older, non-reliable ammo, so I can't tell if the misfires are because of crappy .22LR ammo.  I did take the ""FTF"" ammo, and ran them through an SR22 pistol, and about 1/2 of them did go bang, and half didn't.  So I believe the problem is now ammo related, but I'm not able to say 100% for certain.  If you're one of those people that likes to tinker with things and make them work, this could be one completely bad-ass little AR15 upper.  I just don't have enough ""consistent"" 22LR ammo to trouble shoot to 100%.  I'm not interested in troubleshooting it further, so it is being sold AS-IS.  I do not wish do ship.  This upper could be the tinkerer's dream.

*Lakonia, named after the region of Greece ruled by Sparta, was one of the primary weapons of the hoplite. It was second only to the spear and was used when their opponents came in close. These very small short swords featured the oak-leaf blade shape common to most Greek swords. They were not much more than daggers, but in the hands of a trained hoplite, they were unbelievably deadly."
