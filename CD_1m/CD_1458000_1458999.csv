Hogue contour grips, no-snag ramp sight, basic Uncle Mike's IWB holster.  Includes original box and keys for internal lock, as well as a cable lock and factory test cartridge.  Lots of bark, a bit of bite, and the lightest magnum-cartridge revolver you'll ever see.  This thing is so light and small in profile it's a dream for a CCW or a backup gun.  No external hammer, DA-only.  Certainly not an ideal range gun, but perfect for defensive carry.  Even if you miss, your target will be blind and deaf.  If you read the online reviews, you'll get the impression that this gun with full load 357 will make your hand bleed.  This is only true if you have never shot a round-butt J-Frame before and choke up high on the grip.  It's not nearly as bad to shoot as you might expect, but certainly not for a novice revolver shooter either.  Low round count - less than 50 rounds, mixed between .38 spl and .357 magnum.  Hate to part with it, but haven't been getting as many hours in at work, and the bills need paid.  As such cash is king, and trades will be of no interest.  Buyer must be 21+ and willing to sign an affidavit stating that there is no reason why they cannot legally purchase or possess a firearm."

I have placed the gun on a Gunbroker Ad due to limited response on Armslist.  If you live in Ohio and wish to purchase I am willing to meet halfway from Lewis Center up to an hour of drive time.  If you are further away and wish to purchase I will drive an hour to meet if you cover the rest of the distance.  This would save significant shipping and FFL costs.  If you are interested please contact me about the details of meeting before placing a bid.  

Will sell for $2200 FTF and end auction if no bids have been placed.  Once a bid is placed on gunbroker will sell through auction only.

In case you're not familiar, this rifle is based on the Pre-64 Winchester model 70 action, which is generally held by real shooters to be one of the finest rifle bolt actions ever made. It's rock-solid and designed to outlast me, you, and your kids. :)

Hogue fully overmolded stock with a solid aluminum bedding block/pillar system, free floating the barrel.

The scope is a cheap NCStar, but it's VERY high powered (10-40x!) and worked well the day I tried it out.

It includes a Harris-type bipod (not sure of brand, may be a Harris, not sure) and a really nice padded tactical (shock) sling.

The metal has been Duracoated in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) inside and out to protect from the elements, should you decide you need to shoot in foul weather.

This is an extremely rare rifle. There is exactly 1 like it for sale on gunbroker, and none that I can find on Armslist, if that tells you anything.

I've only had it to the range once (got it in trade a while back), but it shot just over 1 MOA with cheap steel case FMJ ammo at 200 yards in a nasty gusting crosswind. All the reviews and range reports I've found say that it's easily sub-MOA with decent ammo. I have no reason to doubt it.

The previous owner told me he had some bolt work done to it, so it's supposed to be slicker than stock. I don't have anything to compare it to, but the action is very smooth.

The trigger is adjustable. I'm not sure how it's set at the moment, but my ""finger scale"" says it feels like around 3.5 lbs with very little travel, so I'm happy.

I'm not really looking to trade, since that would defeat the purpose of ""getting rid of a few guns"", but you're welcome to offer if you have something you think I might like."

The Delton DT Sport carbine chambered in 5.56x45mm ( 5.56Nato, .223Remington ).  We took the standard black furniture off this rifle and outfitted it with a complete Magpul MOE kit from Matrix Diversified Industries.  Finished in an A-TACS type camo, the “High Desert” pattern works well in a variety of situations.  This is a huge upgrade to the rifle, the ergonomic handguard has slots where rail sections can be easily installed for mounting lights, lasers, etc.  The vertical grip installed can be repositioned or removed all together if desired.  MOE pistol grip has a storage compartment for spare parts, batteries, treasure map, whatever.  The adjustable buttstock has a removable rubber pad.  MOE trigger guard gives you more room around the trigger, great if using gloves.  Also includes a matching ATACS 30-round P-mag from Magpul (they offer these magazines pre-finished in the matching High Desert camo pattern). 


We are including a brand new Sig Sauer CP1 Sport Prismatic Rifle Scope, 3x magnification, illuminated green or red range-finding reticle.  This is a great CQB optic, similar to an ACOG but doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.  Easily attaches to the top rail of the weapon as shown.  We are going to also include the original black furniture that came with the rifle, and of course the black 30-round magazine that Delton provides. 
If auction is won using “Buy Now”, we’ll throw in 2 extra 30-round magazines, black Magpul Pmags ( P-mag ) and free shipping to your dealer.  Please be certain that this rifle and high capacity magazines are legal in your area.  Thanks for your support of a Veteran-owned business.

I just bought a brand new Sig Sauer 1911 TACPAC so I no longer have a use for this one.  It's in excellent condition.  I've fired about 200 rounds through it and cleaned it thoroughly after each time at the range.  I take excellent care of it.  It's very accurate and great to shoot.  It comes with an XDM carrying case, the pistol, paddle holster, double magazine holder (attaches to your belt), 3 magazines, reloader, pistol lock, owner's manual, and two extra back straps.  Like I said, this pistol is in excellent condition and looks brand new.  I also have two boxes of 100 rounds each plus a box of 25 hollow points.  I'm asking an extra $120 for all of the ammunition.  All together I'm asking for $770.

(In the picture there is a small white rectangle behind the chamber which I put there to block the serial number.  This is just to safeguard myself and whoever buy the pistol to ensure that no one else has the serial number.)"

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel (Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

This is a very RARE gun. Note that it is not a Stoger, or a PX4. 

It is a full metal frame but does have the rotating barrel like the PX4's.

Comes with 3 fifteen round mags all are factory, 2 are brand new in packaging (never used). Gun has small holster wear on the front of the slide. Gun has 100 rds through it, shoots really well just like my 92f, but the mags aren't innerchangable like I was told when I bought it....

I'd like to sell but will entertain trade offers. Things I would be interested in are automatics in .45ACP, and revolvers in .357 mag.

This is a complete package of one gun with everything you need to easily swap back and forth from .45acp to .22lr. And you actually get a top shelf gun as part of it. Crisp trigger, great reset! .22lr upper is a ""reverse"" upper-the barrel stays in place and the steel slide moves backward against a fixed feed ramp on the barrel. It feels like you're shooting a ""real gun"" compared to all the 1911 .22lr's that have very lightweight full aluminum slides that weigh nothing. The .45acp upper half gives you everything you would expect in a Rock Island .45acp. They have proven themselves for the past few years as being one heck of a pistol for half the price of anything that compares to it. Even comes with a mainspring housing that is fit to a specific upper so they are fine tuned to the caliber you are using.

SINCE I HAVE HAD NUMEROUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE “PRE-BAN” HERE IS A LITTLE INFORMATION I HOPE HELPS EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND BETTER

The TEC-9 and, eventually, TEC-DC9 variants were listed among the 19 firearms banned by name in the USA by the now expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB).[1] This ban caused the cessation of their manufacture, and forced Intratec to introduce a newer model called the AB-10, a TEC-9 Mini without a threaded muzzle/barrel shroud and limited to a 10 round magazine instead of a 20 or 32 round magazine. However, it accepted the high capacity magazines of the pre-ban models.
 The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB), or Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, was a subtitle of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a federal law in the United States that included a prohibition on the manufacture for civilian use of certain semi-automatic firearms, so called ""assault weapons"".[1] The 10-year ban was passed by Congress on September 13, 1994, and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton the same day. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the date of the ban's enactment.
 In the former U.S. law, the legal term assault weapon included certain specific semi-automatic firearm models by name (e.g., Colt AR-15, TEC-9, non-select-fire AK-47s produced by three manufacturers, and Uzis) and other semi-automatic firearms because they possess a minimum set of cosmetic features from the following list of features below:
 • Pistol Grip (Tec 9 has)
 • For end Grip (Tec9 has)
 • Flash Suppressor (Tec9 has)
 • Grenade Launcher (does not have)
 • Magazine that attached outside of the grip (Tec9 has)
 • Folding stock (does not have)
 • Bayonet Mount (does not have)
 During this ban, your weapon was legal with only 2(TWO) of the accessories. As you can see this PRE-BAN weapon has 4!!!!!

II. The Tec-9 Is A Semi-Automatic Version Of A Military Submachinegun

 The TEC-9 is a semi-automatic version of a military submachinegun. Although it has been marketed under various names -- the KG-9, the KG-99, the TEC-9, and the TEC-DC9 -- and by various companies owned and operated by the Garcia family, the basic design of the weapon has remained virtually unchanged. The company decided to manufacture the KG-9 because of the growing market for military style guns in the United States. The KG-9's manual described it as: 
Combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.The term ""assault pistol"" was coined by the firearms industry to describe the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.


A. The KG-9 Was Banned as a Machine Gun, and Renamed the KG-99

 In 1982, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ruled that the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.

 The company redesigned the KG-9's bolt to make conversion more difficult, and renamed the weapon the KG-99. Otherwise, the design remained essentially unchanged. Intratec confirmed that like its predecessor, the KG-99 could be fairly described as ""combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.""

 Intratec U.S.A. (""Intratec"") manufactured a vertical foregrip for use with the KG-99, which it marketed as an ""Assault Grip."" Intratec used the term ""Assault Grip"" in marketing the foregrip, ""[b]ecause you basically hold the gun with two hands like you would as assault weapon, a military weapon.""

 In November 1982, and again in March 1985, the ATF notified Intratec that it was unlawful to possess a KG-99 and an attachable foregrip, even though the pistol and the foregrip were disassembled. Although Intratec understood that they should not be selling the assault grip, he continued to sell it as an accessory for the KG-99, stamping on the order form that ""ATF has ruled that the KG-250 assault grip may not be attached legally to the KG-99 or the old model KG-9.""

 B. Intratec Rename the KG-99 the TEC-9, and Continued to Sell the ""Assault Grip.""

 Intratec renamed the KG-99 the TEC in August 1985. The TEC-9 was substantially identical to the KG-99, with just a few cosmetic changes. The company resumed marketing the assault grip without any warning, advertising that it ""Attaches to All TEC-9"" Intratec advertised the TEC-9 as a ""High-spirited"" weapon that is ""as tough as your toughest customer."" The company’s brochure emphasized the weapon’s ""paramilitary"" appeal, its ""Military blowback design,"" and its ""Combat-type"" sights. The brochure depicted a smoking target of a human being shot dozens of times through the head and the heart in what appears to be a fusillade of automatic weapons fire. In April 1987, Intratec was sued by the Estate of David Bengston in Connecticut state court. The complaint alleged that the decedent, a school custodian, was fatally shot in the head with a TEC-9M [""Mini""], and that Intratec ""knew or should have known that the TEC-9M gun was and is primarily suited for an/or used in criminal activity,"" and that it ""lacks legitimate use, such as sporting, law enforcement of self-protection."" In November 1987, Carlos Garcia formed Navegar in order to take the assets of the business back from his father and avoid Intratec’s liabilities. Navegar continued to manufacture and market the TEC-9, and continued to do business as Intratec. Intratec U.S.A. declared bankruptcy in 1989, with the Bengston and Alicki lawsuits as its only significant liabilities."

The bag was made for the 2013 Whitetails Unlimited Banquet and bears the WU logo on the top cover.  Inside there is an INCREDIBLE amount of storage space.  I have a Browning Broken Birds range bag which has enough room for all of my skeet shooting gear, but the WU bag has at least 35% more storage space, without being too big or bulky to carry and is absolutely LOADED with features.

If there wasn’t any sentimental value in my Broken Birds bag, I would switch to this one in a heartbeat.  It has all the neat features I want in a bag, plus tons of storage space with multiple separated pockets and closeable compartments.  I would highly recommend this bag for any type of shooter looking for a bag with maximum storage and features, while keeping the bulk to a minimum.  Please feel free to ask for any additional pictures, I tried to show as much as I could in the allowable space.  Thanks for looking!"

She was able to buy some land and open a business in southern Indiana close to her home with the money she made. She has a full gym, indoor lap pool, hot tub and sauna as well as a tanning salon and massage therapy rooms. Her only job before this was selling t-shirts, hats, and sweatshirts with custom logos at trade shows in her area. So its a highly profitable business if you put fourth the effort! I'm a college student, paying my own way, so can't really afford to buy the supplies and such needed to start this all up. Much less the time or space! I live in a small 1 bedroom apartment and this equipment is taking up my entire office space right now. Time to get it traded or sold. 

Comes with

Futura 100 Graphics machine (originally over 20,000$)
Shinko CHC-545 Thermal printer (this prints the transfers)
Sony Commercial Grade Thermal Scanner (scan in logos or images)
Hitachi Thermal Printer (for smaller transfers)
RGB TV
Ex/press Heat Press Machine (heats transfers to clothing)
Panasonic Digital Camera
Tripod with dual extensions
Flash Unit


All of this was well over 40,000$ back when she first invested. She told me it was paid off within the first 6 months, and I believe her seeing as she paid probably 150,000 or so building her business by her house. 

I have it currently all set up and ready to go. I have videos that show how to select the image, print it, and press it. If you have spare time or are self employed but looking to fill up more of your time with another venture, then this is for you!

Product Description
MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver is one of the most recent AR-15 Lower Receivers to hit the market. The MAG Tactical Systems AR-15 Lower Receiver is about 35 percent lighter than a standard aluminum receiver, and it is not plastic! The MAG Tactical Systems Generation 4 Lower is made of a proprietary magnesium alloy. The patented coating process that MAG Tactical Systems owns gives their lower extreme corrosion resistance characteristics.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver incorporates a machined in triggerguard that is larger than a mil-spec trigger guard, which allows the trigger to be accessed with thick winter gloves.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver front and rear pivot points are reinforced to avoid breakage of the receiver even when high torque is applied when it is in the break down position
Today’s warrior has been looking for a lower receiver that has the low weight and high feature list that the MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver has to offer.

If you look back to the 1990's they did the same thing with Bill Clinton. The old assault weapons bans was ""defeated"" and then they just passed it by tagging or ""dog earing"" it to a different law. 
I'm not selling anything to make a profit off of this information... I just want to spread what I've heard and read. 
Check it out for yourself..... But you have to dig deep to find the truth.
Check out the NRA's grassroots alert website or contact senator Lindsey Graham's office and ask to be put on their email list."

How about a gun with the same old plain wood or wood substitute stock with a blued barrel at the range?  Ever considered turning your standard hunting gun from looking like a sore thumb in the woods to a camouflaged weapons system? How about showing off your pride for your favorite sports team? Or cleaning up that rusty old shotgun that has sat up in the attic for the past three decades?

Well, you have found the right place…I take ordinary guns and turn them into custom finished firearms.  I have helped many friends and family members take guns that have sat in their attics or garage, neglected for years and turn them into restored, respectable firearms.  If you would like your duck gun camouflaged, a sport rifle to show off you team’s colors or just restore Dad’s old gun…I can take care of all of them in house.  I start by meeting with you and deciding what you would like to see when the project is finished and discuss the possible options to get the desired results.  Once we have a plan, I go to work and get the firearms back into shape, taking pictures to send to you as updates along the way so you can see the progression of your firearm’s refinishing.  When it is all said and done, we meet back up again for you to inspect the firearm and give it the final approval.
If you would like a new stock, I can give you a number of options including synthetic, traditional wood or wood laminate as well as choice of coloring.
If you would like to have your gun colored I use Duracoat finishes, which provide one of, if not the best and most durable finishes available for a firearm.  Once cured for the appropriate time, the gun becomes VERY difficult to scratch or rust and is very difficult to remove.
The typical process goes something like this:
Disassembly
Removal of rust or other foreign matter
Deep, thorough cleaning of all parts
 Apply any new coatings or colorings that are to be done
Second cleaning
Oiling/greasing of critical parts
Reassembly
Final cleaning and touch ups

Prices vary depending on services to be performed.  The pictures are of firearms I have done for outside clients to their specifications…I have not yet had a single complaint or request for re-work to be performed.  All work is guaranteed to function per manufacturer’s specifications.  I truly enjoy doing this type of work and am very meticulous in my procedures, if there is anything you are unhappy with once your firearm is complete, simply let me know and I will remedy the situation immediately. 

Attached are pictures of a standard Ruger 10/22 that I customized for an Ohio State fan.  Unfortunately I can upload only three pictures per listing, if you would like to see other examples of my work, please shoot me and email and I will be happy to send some to you.  Thanks.
