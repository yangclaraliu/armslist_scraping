 The Firefield Riflescope with Red Laser is equipped with a Green/Red Illuminated Mil Dot reticle that is used for range estimation to help find the distance between the shooter and the target. Precision multi-coated optics are the distinguishing feature of the Firefield Tactical Riflescope line and offers the clearest view in both bright and low light situations. Featuring a built in 5mW red laser, the Firefield Riflescope, is used for quick target acquisition in rapid changing environments, so it hits the target every time with precision accuracy. The lowest magnification setting at 2.5x can be used for scanning, while offering a much broader field of view, while the highest settings in the magnification range are more than adequate for mid to long-range shots.

Features and Accessories


Colt Defense and Bill Rogers have teamed up to engineer the most advanced, third generation of the Super-Stoc, using innovative technologies and proprietary materials. Designed to be as lightweight as possible while maintaining durability, the Colt Super-Stoc weighs 6.56 ounces, ranking it among the lightest stocks available. The stock is designed specifically for the new Colt rifles to give an unequaled fit and survivability during the most extreme conditions.

A unique Cam-Lock system is a new design feature that, when operated, securely locks onto the buffer tube like a solid stock. This Cam-Lock system completely removes any slop or play commonly inherent with aftermarket collapsible stocks as well as eliminating any movement due to wear. The Cam-Lock lever also features a convenient reversible design, enabling the user to customize his or her stock to suit the desired preference. Other features include a removable recoil pad, sling loop, quick detach swivel sling mount and Quick Release lever which unlocks the Cam-Lock and indexing pin with one motion.

For some reason it automatically changed the Manufacturer on here to Glock and wont let me change it. Obviously its NOT A GLOCK, so I dont need you to tell me. Im not really a jerk, just tired of stupid people that have nothing better to do than pick apart ads, and waste my time. Its a chrome pistol, works fine as far as i can tell but I have not fired it, I have no idea of the round count, and it only comes with the pistol and 1 clip. if you want ammo with it I will sell you a 100 round box of Winchester for $35, but only if you buy the gun too. Im not a Walmart. I did however buy the bullets from Walmart for $30 plus tax, so you can either buy the gun and pay 35 for the bullets, or you can go to Walmart. I hope this answers all your questions. Thanks"

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation.  The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle.

GUN GRABBERS TRY TO HIJACK CONCEALED CARRY

YOU MUST MAKE PHONE CALLS IMMEDIATELY

Rabid gun grabber Rep. Kelly Cassidy has introduced amendments to HB0831 which hijack the court’s requirement to enact concealed carry and transform concealed carry into gun control.

IT’S IMPORTANT THAT YOU ACT IMMEDIATELY TO HALT CASSIDY’S SCHEME.

Kelly’s vision of concealed carry is absolutely unacceptable to law-abiding citizens. Her proposal contains all sorts of impediments to self defense – the worst of which is that carry licenses would be issues on a “may issue” basis.

UNDER KELLY’S PROPOSAL, YOU WOULD HAVE TO CONVINCE SOME POLITICAL HACK THAT YOUR LIFE IS WORTH DEFENDING.

That’s right, under Kelly Cassidy’s version of “concealed carry,” you would have to go down to your village hall and beg some civil servant for the right to defend yourself and your family from vicious street thugs. Of course, your chances of success will depend greatly on what you look like and how many checks you had written to your local sheriff’s reelection campaign committee.

HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO PRESERVE YOUR RIGHT TO SELF DEFENSE:

1. Contact your State Representative immediately and politely tell the person who answers the phone that you are a law-abiding firearm owner and that you oppose Kelly Cassidy’s amendments to HB0831. If you do not know who your state representative is, the Illinois State Board of Elections has an interactive search page here:
www.elections.state.il.us/DistrictLocator/DistrictOfficialSearchByAddress.aspx

If you know who your representative is, you can find their contact info here:
www.ilga.gov/house/.

2. Inform your State Representative that you will only support a state-wide “shall issue” concealed carry bill, such as HB0997. Advise him/her that you will not accept “may issue” concealed carry under any circumstances.

3. Pass this alert along to your gun-owning friends and family and ask them to make phone calls as well.

4. Post this alert to any and all Internet blogs or bulletin boards to which you belong.

DON’T LET KELLY CASSIDY DECIDE WHETHER YOU ARE WORTH DEFENDING OR NOT"

Real Bushmasters... not fakes or knock-offs (yes... the Chinese do make them- They say ""Somewhere, NY"" not ""Windham, ME"") or the ones made by the new company that bought Bushmaster. Uppers and Lowers match up nice and tight with no slop whatsoever. BCG has great ""staking"" and cocks the hammer with the bolt, not the firing pin like some ARs. BCG has the full end almost like a Full-Auto carrier and is nice and heavy. Compared it to the S&W and it had better staking and a little bit more weight to it. These rifles are ready to rock... pick an upper and head out.

My Bushy's have NEVER jammed, stove-piped, or even hiccuped and I'll swear that on a stack!

689,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1472689,For Sale:  .308 / 7.62x51 ammo CHEAP!!!,"Akron area, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, April 22, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale: 1,000 rounds of 7.62x51mm training ammo made in Germany. These rounds have a plastic case and bullet and are non-corrosive. These are used for training by the German Army and Special Forces - but you can use them where ever (within reason of course :)

These are a ton of fun to use - virtually no recoil, much quieter than the full-power ammo and much lighter. I have shot 1,000's of these rounds of the past several years and they are awesome! I got rid of my .308 rifle, so now I don't have a use for them. I personally used this ammo for sighting in new scopes, target practice, small game hunting, plinking, etc. I have taken out ground hogs, rabbits, squirrels, etc. at well over 150 yrds with this stuff, no problem. This ammo will easily shoot right through 3/4"" plywood at 150 yrds.

One of the many things I like about this ammo is you can shoot much more of it than traditional ammo, and faster, without heating up/warping your barrel or breaking your wallet. Not to mention, it produces very little carbon or other metallic build ups like traditional ammo does. You can shoot 100's of rounds and cleaning is a breeze. As far as accuracy goes, the manufacture claim is this stuff is accurate past 300 yrds. I have tested up to 250 yrds and can confirm it is very accurate at that distance. Perfect for teaching young or new shooters. That being said - THESE ARE BULLETS THAT CAN KILL JUST THE SAME AS METAL BULLETS. These are not a toy and need to be used in a responsible manner. According to the manufacture, this ammo reaches speeds of 4300+ FPS. Again, this is not a toy and CAN KILL!!!

Note: I have only ever used this ammo in a bolt action rifle, not sure how it would act in a semi-auto.

Here is a YouTube video of this exact same ammo. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnEdwZv9WsU

The case I have is factory sealed, never opened. I would like to keep it that way. Not really interested in breaking it up. Price for the 1,000 round case is $325. This is less than a 3rd of what traditional 308/762.51 ammo is going for. Using this ammo in place of full-power ammo even a third of the time will same you lots of money. 

FTF cash sale ONLY. No shipping. I live in the Akron area; please keep this in mind when replying. Not really looking for any trades, but the worst I can say is no thanks. Must be at least 18 to buy rifle ammo in OHIO."

It is a Strider with the Strider name and logo on the blade. I do not know what model it is. The blade is about 3 1/2 inches. The handle is black and about 4 1/2 inches long. That makes the knife about 8 inches overall. It has a very rough textured black handle (on one side) and is missing a small screw on the bottom of the handle. This does not affect the fuction of the knife at all only the apperance. Other than the missing screw, the knife is in very good condition. It opens smoothly. There is no blade play.

This gun was made in 1996 and is an ex-Swiss law-enforcement weapon. The slide is the heavier milled stainless steel part instead of the earlier stamped one, and has the Swiss canton regional crest(Vaud) on the left side. The sights are tritium but glow very faintly, so I painted over them with white paint. Since it was a duty weapon there is some finish wear, but this doesn't affect anything. In fact I think it gives the gun some character. This gun was made in 1996 so it avoids the problems that some newer post-2004 Sigs have with QC. It was made at a time when Sig made nothing but the best. I carry this gun every day and trust it with my life.
