The serial number identifies it as the first variation that was made somewhere between 1921 and 1924. It is nickel plated. I'm not sure if it is the original nickel or if it's been replated. The finish looks a lot better in hand than it does in the pictures. There is some light loss to the plating. I have shot it, and it functioned just fine. The rifling is nearly worn smooth, but is still lightly visible. The grip medallions have been replaced with small rubber discs. I'm not sure why this was done. I do not see any screws attaching the grips, so I suspect they may be glued on, or they are under the rubber discs. The grips have pulled away slightly from the frame at the bottom. It comes with three magazines, two of which are original, the other is aftermarket (I think). This pistol is being sold as a collectible only. If you decide to shoot it, you do so at your own risk. I am asking $225 for this pistol, plus $15 shipping to your FFL or C&R. I can do PayPal, postal money order, or meet face to face in Southern Indiana. Thanks!"

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of Sig's popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm. The SP2022 – the only polymer framed pistol engineered to perform, built to protect and good enough to be called a SIG SAUER.

 I am selling the stock, barrel, and scope for a Ruger 10/22, . Everything fits perfectly, the rifle turned into a safe queen once I added the upgraded parts. The sock is no longer in production, and is in very good condition, minor scratches shown in the pictures. The barrel shoots very well and looks awesome, minor scratch on the muzzle brake also shown in the pictures. It was advised by the manufacturer not to shoot CCI stingers through this barrel, I don't know why, and have never tried. The scope is the newest addition, it fits the rifle well with about an 1/8 inch space between the barrel, not a scratch on it. If your interested text me at 408 821 six two seven nine

 I am selling the stock, barrel, and scope for a Ruger 10/22, . Everything fits perfectly, the rifle turned into a safe queen once I added the upgraded parts. The sock is no longer in production, and is in very good condition, minor scratches shown in the pictures. The barrel shoots very well and looks awesome, minor scratch on the muzzle brake also shown in the pictures. It was advised by the manufacturer not to shoot CCI stingers through this barrel, I don't know why, and have never tried. The scope is the newest addition, it fits the rifle well with about an 1/8 inch space between the barrel, not a scratch on it. If your interested text me at 408 821 six two seven nine

 I am selling the stock, barrel, and scope for a Ruger 10/22, . Everything fits perfectly, the rifle turned into a safe queen once I added the upgraded parts. The sock is no longer in production, and is in very good condition, minor scratches shown in the pictures. The barrel shoots very well and looks awesome, minor scratch on the muzzle brake also shown in the pictures. It was advised by the manufacturer not to shoot CCI stingers through this barrel, I don't know why, and have never tried. The scope is the newest addition, it fits the rifle well with about an 1/8 inch space between the barrel, not a scratch on it. If your interested text me at 408 821 six two seven nine

I think there were only 2000 of these made. This gun has had exactly 70 flawless rounds fired through it. The gun is in pristine condition with no marks or scratches. I have all the factory paperwork and box etc. It comes with 2 mags an it is chambered in 357 Sig. The gun is a very accurate and a joy to shoot. If it weren't for having to shift my hands forward to compensate for the grip I would NOT get rid of this gun. However, it is not smart on my part to hold onto it when it is not made for my hand. Bill of Sale will be completed and buyer must have a CCH or permit I can retain with the bill of sale. Thanks!

I have both factory stainless mags that came with the pistol but I can't find the box. I never store my firearms in their boxes because they take up way too much room in my safes. I have several Kahr pistols and, in today's economic times, I can use the same one in my nightstand as in my car. This pistol actually isn't officially broken in yet. Kahr says it takes 200 rounds to break on in. I've fired 100 rounds through this pistol. Just look down the barrel with the borescope pic. There is zero wear or deposits in the rifling. For the same size and weight of that .380ACP pocket pistol you are betting your life on, you can have a man stopping full power .40 caliber that most police forces carry as their main firearm.

Face to face locally. I'd prefer you have a LTCH, but insist you have proper ID. This is a CHEAP price for a high end Kahr; especially with NIGHT SIGHTS. The night sights are an additional $100 value.  Again, it's not a economy ""W"" series Kahr. Wouldn't you rather have a .40 Hydroshock protecting you than an anemic .380? Here is your chance!

This is an HK MP5 .22LR clone.  It's so much like and HK, that HK sued ATI over the likeness.  These guns are hard to find and very accurate, reliable, and fun to shoot.  I got this one after shooting a friend's.  It has a fake suppressor on the gun.  It's legal and is a full length .22 rifle.  The fake can is for aesthetics ONLY.  For those that follow these guns, this one has the ""ATF approved"" fake can, so you won't get in trouble.

I'm not going to sell this, but I do have a hanker'n for a shotgun.  Please do not offer to trade if you expect me to throw in additional cash for your item.

I'm looking for a nice semi-auto shotgun, prefer something with a tactical look or something I can accessorize.  As long as it's in great shape, I'd be interested.  I'm mainly interested in .20 gauge, but I'd go for a 12 if it was the right one.  PM me with trade offers and pics or links to what you got.  A Mossberg SA-20™ Tactical is about exactly what I am looking for.

I'm 15 minutes on the east side of Indianapolis, so please do not offer trades if you live in Evansville and aren't willing to drive.

Person w/ CCW preferred. Bill of sale will be written out and signed. Anyone trying to hide from this has obvious issues and can move on to another gun.

Will accept trades for a triathlon bike and can add cash for the right bike. Not a road bike with aero bars, a real tri bike Cervelo P2/P3, Quintana Roo, etc… Size 56 to maybe 58."

Below is some information from SIG:
The SIG SAUER® SP2022 with Laser is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

 The Sturm Ruger GP 100. The GP100 was an evolution of an earlier Ruger double action revolver, the Security Six. The first significant change was introduced with the Ruger Redhawk and that involved a new locking mechanism with a lever on the crane rather than using the end of the ejector rod to lock. Another change was the shape of the frame. Traditional revolver frames had exposed metal at the front and rear of the grips, with the frame determining the shape of the grips. This meant that to have a round butt concealed carry version and a square butt holster or target version of the same gun usually meant having two different frame shapes. The GP-100 series, instead, used a small rectangular ""peg"" grip large enough to enclose the hammer spring and strut. The grips could then be any shape desired, as long as they were large enough to enclose the peg. The stock grips are made of Santoprene, a soft, chemical resistant elastomer that helped absorb the recoil of firing. Panels on the side, made of black plastic, goncalo alves wood or rosewood, provide contrast to the flat black of the Santoprene. The GP-100 shared the crane lock from the Redhawk that was later used in the small frame SP-101 revolver. All of these models use the same thickness on the solid frame and double latching system as used on the heavy .44 Magnum. Because of these features, the GP-100 series is widely described as one of the strongest medium frame revolvers ever made. The GP100 is manufactured in .357 caliber. In Stainless Steel finish with 4” barrel. The Firing pin of the GP100 is mounted inside the frame. The Transfer bar of the GP100 is connected directly to the trigger. The transfer bar must be present between the hammer and the firing pin in order for the cartridge to be fired. The transfer bar only assumes the required position when the trigger is pulled completely rearward.  When the cylinder is closed and the gun is at the point of firing, the cylinder crane is locked into the frame at the front and rear of the crane and by the cylinder lock at the bottom of the crane opening.The GP100 disassembles into three major modules with only limited use of tools. This allows the user to easily clean the revolver after shooting. The design of the gun eliminates the need for a frame ""sideplate"", a feature which contributes to the GP100's reputation for strength.

Also included are 2 SGM thirty round polymer magazines, tactical Picatinny quad rails, and an ergonomic vertical grip.

I have put about 200 rounds through this rifle, and it is in like new condition with the exception of a small scratch caused by the safety that all AK-47s have. This AK-47 variant was manufactured in the famous Izhmash factory where the original AK-47 was designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov, who still works there. The receiver and barrel are obviously of much better quality with a much better finish than other variants like the Romanian Century International Arms WASR or the Yugoslavian Zastava Arms.

The pistol is not new but is in great condition. Cleaned after every trip to the range. It's an M&P full size 9mm with competition sights and an APEX trigger job. The sights are Seviegny comp sights with a blacked out rear and a fiber optic front. Larger cut on the the back sights makes picking up your target easy. The trigger is from APEX and though I don't remember the type, it smooths out the trigger pull, shortens the reset and gives a slight 'click' when reset as well. 

Included with this is the original box with all the paper work, lock, the fired test shell, and four magazines with 17 round cap. I'm also including a left hand leather holster.

I also have the original rear peep sight w/ all mounting hardware which will be included. Enfields are known for their great accuracy, and No.4 Mk.1's are generally the best shooters. This is a great fun rifle, I just don't shoot it much anymore. A great hunting rifle. Comes with (1) original ten rd. detachable box magazine.
 The stock was refinished in a high gloss, and I'm not sure if the bluing is original, but it does look very sharp.
 This rifle is dated 1942, so it is from WWII era (41-45)
