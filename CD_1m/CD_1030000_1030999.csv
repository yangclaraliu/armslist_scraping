Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.

Throughout the world today, Colt’s reliability, performance, and accuracy provide our Armed Forces the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt’s new LE6920MP-B shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1” chrome lined barrel.  With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip (with storage compartment), MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine.

Includes: (1) NIB, never fired Colt LE6920MP-B with 16"" 1:7 twist barrel, (1) 30rd magazine, cleaning kit, sling, and manual.

Accessories Included:   400 rounds of ammunition, (2) additional 30rd magazines, (1) Vortex Diamondback 3-9x40 Dead-hold BDC scope, Butler Creek flip-open caps, Burris R.E.P.R quick detach mount, 2-piece quad rail for the Colt AR, rail covers, rail mount fore end grip with storage, and a tactical gun case.   All items are brand new except the case but it’s in perfect, like new condition.

The scope has been pre sighted on my personal AR using a bore sighter at 100yards.   The scope will need minor final sighting on the Colt with live ammo but should be within a couple inches.   The included 100 rounds of match ammo should help you with this.   Ammo is hard to get at a reasonable price right now.   I figured bore sighting should help you conserve your ammo so you can use it for a better purpose.

The Burris mount allows the rear flip up sight to remain in place, and the front sight is not visible at 3 or 9 power.   I included a picture of that.   If you want to drop the scope there are two latches to remove the scope/base in seconds without tools. It includes both smooth and picatinny rail ring tops and the Burris forever warranty.

Included is a quad rail for mounting lights or what ever accessories you desire....    The 2-piece rail is sized for the Colt AR.   I included (3) rail covers and a fore end grip –all new in their packages.

I'm asking for $3,100.00 i am not looking for trades.   Contact me if you are interested,   Thanks for looking."

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. 

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.

XCR-L incorporates heavy duty components such as a sturdy oprod, a beefy three-lug bolt, a locking extractor, and a fixed ejector. These elements and others ensure reliable performance with minimal maintenance.

The XCR-L is the most ergonomic rifle available anywhere. Professoinal users report that the XCR has the fastest magazine change and clearing times of any rifle.

Whether the rifle is supported by the right or left hand, the operator can manipulate all the controls while keeping his eyes on target and index finger near the trigger.

Many rifles claim to be modular weapon systems just because they have a 1913 standard rail system used to attach accessories. The XCR-L is truly modular.

With one XCR-L Lower Receiver (the serialized part), the operator can configure the XCR as a shorty for close quarters combat, a light weight carbine, or a longer marksman's rifle.

The XCR-L's quick change barrel system is unmatched in terms of ease of use and repeatability. Barrel and caliber changes can be made in less than 5 minutes.

Some more information about this rifle:

PSL rifles are made at the Fabrica de Arme Cugir SA Cugir arsenal in Cugir, Romania. Their primary purpose is to be used by a designated marksman and is used to extend the range of the average soldier beyond the capabilities of their issued AKM carbines. It is built around a stamped steel receiver similar to the RPK light machine gun's receiver. The PSL's operation is the same short stroke action of the Kalashnikov family of weapons. Its appearance is similar to the Dragunov Sniper Rifle though the Dragunov uses a different action altogether. The PSL is chambered for the same venerable M1908/30 7.62x54mmR (rimmed) cartridge as the Dragunov, and feeds from a ten-round detachable box magazine. The magazine used on the PSL differs from that of the Dragunov in that it is stamped with an X shaped pattern on the side, rather than the waffle style stamp found on the Russian magazines. The magazines, though they look similar in shape and size, are not interchangeable between the Dragunov and PSL without modification.

The PSL is typically issued with a version of the PSO-1 telescopic weapon sight, this version lacking the battery compartment and IR detection screen. The reticle is illuminated by mildly radioactive Tritium rather than the lamp of the Russian PSO-1. The optical sight is of 4X magnification and the lens is 24 mm in diameter. It shares the basic design and rangefinder found in the reticle of the original Russian PSO-1 scope.

The scope can be easily removed from the receiver of the rifle by swinging the locking lever open, then sliding the scope mount to the rear. This allows easy use of the iron sights and storage and protection of the scope when in transit or at other times when it is not needed.

PSL rifles have some notable features, the skeleton stock is somewhat similar to the Dragunov's but included an interesting corrugated and spring loaded stamped steel buttplate. When the rifle is fired this helps reduce the felt recoil to a degree.

The PSL's scope is made by the I.O.R. firm in Bucharest. I.O.R. Valdada is a Romanian company which has been making optics since 1936. They currently use German made Schott glass coated with the Carl Zeiss T-3 system to eliminate glare and maximize light transmission. It is unknown what glass and coatings they used at the time they produced the PSL's scope, however I.O.R. had a long association with western European optics manufacturers and maintained these despite being caught within the Iron Curtain. In 1967 I.O.R. collaborated with various German manufacturers and in 1975 an association was established with Carl Zeiss which led to even more expansion and modernization. Initial versions of this scope were more or less identical to the Russian PSO-1 with battery powered lamp reticle illumination. Shortly afterward the scope was revised to eliminate the electrical illumination and replace it with a radioactive based glowing light source, thus simplifying the maintenance and construction of the scope. The scopes found today typically show no illumination because the lifespan of the tritium has expired. Original examples of the scope with the battery powered illumination are rather rare today and collectors pay a premium for them.

Sporting version

A sporting version of the PSL, intended for export, is offered as the PSL-54C, Romak III, FPK, FPK Dragunov or SSG-97. This weapon is identical in almost every respect to the original military version of the PSL except for modifications to comply with the U.S. import laws.

971,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1030971,For Sale:  New Beretta PX4 Storm 9mm - Two 17rd Mags - DA/SA,"Central Business District - Downtown, Wichita, Kansas",$ 519,"Listed On: Thursday, March 21, 2013",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
The Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
