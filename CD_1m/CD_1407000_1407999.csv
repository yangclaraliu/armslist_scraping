I've taken very good care of it and doubt I have more than 30-50 rounds through it. I've owned this rifle since it was new. This rifle was not built by Century Arms. It was built in Romania and imported by Century Arms. It does have the original chrome-lined, cold-hammer-forged barrel and it looks new - having strong rifling and a nice shiny bore. WASRs are known to have issues such as canted sights, mag wobble etc. This rifle has zero issues. Let me state this again - this rifle has zero issues. Everything is perfectly straight, the bolt/bolt carrier rides smoothly on the rails and a variety of mags lock in nice and tight. I only shot this rifle on one occasion and, aside from that, it's been collecting dust. When I did shoot this rifle, I used iron sights and was able to consistently get 3-4"" groups at 100 yards with Golden Tiger and Tula. Included with this rifle will be a Tapco Saw OD Green Grip, Tapco Intrafuse OD Green forend, cleaning rod, rifle sling, Romanian forend, bayonet and grip (see the last two photos that I've provided). This particular rifle was finished in ALuma-Hyde II Matte Black. If you are not familiar with Aluma-Hyde II, it is awesome. The stuff is very durable and looks great as you can see in my photos. Do a quick Google search and find out for yourself. Most of the complaints you'll find will be the price (nearly all other complaints stem from people not following Brownell's instructions), but aside from that, it's good to go.I did not repaint this rifle for any other reason than to cover up that unsightly Romanian finish. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing either and I am very picky when it comes to my firearms. If you are familiar with Romanian rifles, you'll know what I mean. Most of their rifles are great from a fit and function standpoint, but majority of the time, the finish leaves much to be desired. One thing that seems to wear out from shooting these is the underfolder hinge/trunnion. However, that's not really an issues since I have barely shot (or even handled) this rifle. The stock on this rifle has little to no play and locks up tight when open or closed. I am confident that this is the nicest WASR you'll find on GunBroker. It is my understanding that WASR UFs are no longer being imported. This rifle will come with one 30-round steel mag. If you would like extra mags, I will include them for $20 per mag. That's cheaper than they can be found anywhere as far as I have seen. I will sell you a maximum of four extra mags with this rifle as I do not have a ton of mags.The 6 US parts on this rifle are the muzzle brake, trigger group, grip, and forend. This keeps the rifle in compliance with 922r and will allow you to use any foreign mag in this rifle without being in violation of 922r.. Email me if you have any questions, Thank You"

These guns list for $750 in ""new"" condition.
This gun is not in ""new"" condition. It has a couple of dings on the stock, and the forestock needs to be repaired or replaced. The forestock has a large split in the wood, so it is no longer functional as a forestock. See pics.
The metal and fit and finish is beautiful! The gun functions flawlessly, and was only used as a trap shooter.

Forward Optic Mount for Yugo M70 Series AKs Replaces gas tube. Clamps directly to barrel for maximum stability and accuracy. Solid, one-piece 6061-T6 hard anodized aluminum body. Comes with 4140 steel clamps, screws, allen wrench,	and instructions. No Gunsmithing installation. Overall length: 7.515 inches. 

This is the best optic mount you can have on an AK and will hold zero unlike many other AK mount options. I bought this for my Zastava PAP AK-47 but ended up selling that gun to get a Saiga AK-47, which requires a different version of Ultimak. This part has never been used. I put it on my gun to check the fit but never shot the gun with it on. I sold the gun without the part hoping I could return it, but I don't have the packaging.

This part is $110 shipped on Ultimak's website and can sometimes be found for $95 on other sites, don't miss your chance to get it at a great price, $50 shipped.

Please check the Ultimak website and make sure this fits your gun before ordering. It fits all Yugo M70 Series AK-47s, this includes the Zastava PAP rifles. 

Please know what you are ordering."

Also comes with sidesaddle that holds an additional 6 rounds on the side. its been a great gun, like I said it was my turkey gun so Its probably had about 100 rounds or less on it, its in great shape and nothing is wrong with it. I have over $100 in extras added to the gun with the top rail, side saddle, knoxx stock and forend which evens out the price of purchasing a new barrel for it so dont try and lowball me, I'm really looking to trade for a fulll size handgun preferably 45 acp or 9mm not really interesting in smaller calibers but just tell me what you have, will also entertain cash offers. text me at 843 5ninenine 6one8one or just email me."

The Lock-N-Load AP with NEW EZject system loads at a rate of up to 500 rounds per hour, and features the quickest change-over of any progressive press.

The Lock-N-Load AP is a professional-grade, auto-indexing, 5-station progressive press that features Our patented Lock-N-Load bushing system as well as a host of other features -- detailed below -- that make it much more attractive than other, more expensive presses, such as the Dillon XL650.

** Due to extremely high volume, the Lock-N-Load AP is not currently available for sale on the Internet. Please contact your local dealer, distributor or retailer. Thank you, and sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. **

Features:
EZject™ System
The EZject system delivers 100% reliable ejection of every cartridge, every time, without any adjustments.



Priming System
The Lock-N-Load AP can be changed from large to small primers as easy as 1-2-3.

Change the primer seater punch. 
Change the primer shuttle. 
Change the primer feed tube. 


Case Activated Powder Drop
Case activated powder drop will dispense a powder charge ONLY when there is a cartridge case present. No more messes.

Quick Change Metering Inserts
The Lock-N-Load powder measure uses quick-change metering inserts that allow you to switch from one powder to another with the push of a button. Add one to each dieset for the ULTIMATE quick change-over.



Quick Change Lock-N-Load® Bushing Systems
The Lock-N-Load AP has a 5 station quick change bushing system, which allows the Lock-N-Load AP to be changed very quickly; from 223 to 45 in less than 5 minutes. Compare that to any other popular progressive presses on the market.


Universal Case Retainer Spring
The Lock-N-Load AP has an ingenious case retainer spring that allows you to quickly and easily remove and replace a case at any point in the loading process AND they are universal. Compare that to ""other"" progressives... they are not so progressive.

Automatic Indexing
Each station moves 1/2 a stage on the upstroke and 1/2 a stage on the down stroke and the up stroke, making for ultra-smooth function. This process is much smoother than presses that do all their indexing on the down stroke.


Large Capacity Hopper
A large capacity hopper comes standard with the Lock-N-Load AP Press. An extra large capacity hopper is available as an option."
