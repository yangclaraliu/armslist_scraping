If I recall correctly these were police shotguns, used somewhere in Africa (see link below).  It's a super simple gas operated semi, ideal for defensive use.  It's hard to read in the last picture, but the shotgun was manufactured in Italy.  The stock is hardwood.  The shotgun is amazingly lightweight. 

The barrel is 28"" long and reads as follows:
- P.-Beretta, Made in Italy
- O (assume Open?)
- Musgrave (which would indicate the following history: http://www.shotgunworld.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=183898)

Notes on the sale.  Thanks for your understanding.
- I will only sell face-to-face on the North end of Atlanta (400).  If you want me to ship elsewhere, you must have an FFL available and cover transfer costs.
-  If local, you must have a GA firearms permit, as I do not have the means to do a background check.

This 1911 has had less than 200rds fired through it and has been cleaned thoroughly.

Gun has quite a bit of time put into it to make it a great looking gun as well as a great functioning gun.

Gun has a very unique look with the custom grips and skelotonized aluminum trigger. This is a great gun to display and/or fire every day.

Functionality has been significantly improved with Wilson Combat parts.
Wilson Combat competition trigger significantly reduced trigger pull.
Wilson Combat Bullet Proof Sear Spring maintains its tension far longer than a factory spring.
Wilson Extended Magazine release makes it MUCH easier to (one handedly) lock and release the slide.
Wilson Combat recoil buffer slightly reduces recoil and adds to the life of the gun.
Wilson magazine release is stronger than the original (original strips easily).
Pearce finger groove grip insert gives the gun a great feel and helps with recoil and staying on target.

Wilson 7rd Service Magazine included which feeds rounds flawlessly.

Gun also has custom hand painted night sights on the stock GI style sights. The paint can be removed if desired or the sights can be replaced aftermarket.

The gun looks and fires great! I have only seen positive reviews for the TISAS 1911s and this one has been significantly improved.

Tisas 1911-A1 adds a stunning value to this famous reproduction 1911 classic pistol with such high quality materials, workmanship, fit and finish is just what you want. Made in Turkey by Tisas accordingly to international standards such as ISO 9001 and NATO AQAP, also tested in every stage of production for many challenging situations this gun may face. This is the reason Tisas products are very popular worldwide by delivering reliability.

By using cold hammer forged stainless steel barrel, Military Specification black finish (parkerized), with beautiful Turkish walnut grips, hard plastic case, this makes Tisas 1911 .45 a stunning deal all around.

NO CLASS 3 Needed! (legal to own pre-ban)

The Interdynamic KG9 pistol was made in Miami Florida for a short time in the 1981-82 timeframe by Interdynamic of America, Inc. ATF decided in January 1982 that the gun was too easy to convert into a machine gun, and therefore decided that an unmodified open bolt semi-auto KG-9 was a machine gun. ATF exempted unmodified semi-auto KG-9 pistols made before this ruling from the scope of the ruling, so there are so-called grandfathered KG-9 pistols available in the USA. The KG-9 was based on a Swedish designed machine pistol, the MP-9. After the ATF ruling the gun was redesigned into a closed bolt, striker fired pistol, the Interdynamic KG-99, which was sold in the 1982-83 timeframe. After that Interdynamic went out of buisness. The original gun the cheap tec-9 was made to copy. Rare! Less than 1000 made! Look it up. I will trade for handguns too. There is a hairline crack in the bottom. It still works/shoots fine.

“Low price point. Great suppression. The suppressor that launched a company. The Guardian 22 was the first suppressor in the Huntertown Arms lineup. From its earliest inception the goal was simple - create a great quality suppressor with best-in-class suppression that could be purchased for the price of a tax stamp. You could spend hundreds more for another .22 suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, multi-caliber usage, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 22 has it all. Suppression The Guardian 22 compares favorably to suppressors costing twice as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible. The Guardian utilizes K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest suppressors available. Maintenance Just because you can take a suppressor apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable suppressors, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted an extra $50. Even if the tool worked, you can't get the suppressor apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired. And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever. Longevity There are several features designed into the Guardian 22 to ensure safe and enjoyable use beyond a lifetime. Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. Our end caps are made of softer aluminum so that if there is an end cap strike, the end cap will give way causing minimal if any damage to the rest of your Guardian 22 suppressor. The affected end cap, and any damaged baffles can be easily replaced without having to replace the entire core. Upgradability The Guardian 22 shares the same dimensions as our Kestrel 22, a premium level, heavy duty suppressor providing best in class suppression along with unparrelled maintainence and longevity options. Your Guardian 22 can be upgraded at any time to use the Kestrel core, giving you a path to to most capable rimfire suppressor we offer. Multi-caliber What's your caliber of choice? 22LR? 22 WMR? 17HMR? Whatever it is, rest easy knowing your Guardian 22 was designed to handle the pressures generated.” –huntertownarms.com

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Your “Match” incorporates many features of Tanfoglio’s competition guns into a streamlined, no nonsense, practical pistol. The “Match” serves equally well as a sport shooting pistol or defensive carry sidearm. It is an excellent alternative to those who prefer a single action pistol, but do not choose the 1911. The “Match” is loaded with the same high quality features you’ll find on other Elite series pistols. Custom features include a 4 3/4 ” match grade barrel, single action trigger with over travel stop, adjustable rear sights, interchangeable front sight posts, extended safety, extended magazine release, hart shaped hammer, and custom two tone finish.

These rifles were born of a need to arm second line troops, civil guard, and policemen when Spain adopted the G3/Cetme but did not have enough of them to go around. To solve this problem, Spain had all available Mausers on hand converted to 7.62x51, using CETME parts. The barrel, at 17.7 inches, is fitted with a flash hider that is compatible with then-NATO standard grenade launchers. The front sight is your standard CETME triple frame, with the barrel running through the middle hole. The bottom hole retains the cleaning kit, which resembles a gas block. The rear sight has one V notch and three apertures, the notch being for 100 meters, and the peeps progressively 200, 300, and 400 meters. The rifle holds 5 rounds of .308/7.62x51 in an internal magazine.

This rifle has been in storage since the mid 1980's. The parkerized finish is good, the wood is good and the barrel is clean. I have test fired it and it works as it should. I will include 200 rounds of 7.62x51 with purchase.

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups."

The new Signature Series from Richard Heinie combines some of the best features of he previous Heinie models into new platforms designed with three types of shooters, Concealed Carry, Tactical and Competition. All models come standard in 9mm with 45acp available.

The Signature Compact Model features many of the Signature Series attributes such as a proprietary thinned frame and mainspring housing that are scalloped to provide a positive grip without the abrasion some people feel from checkering. The grips are a new pattern of G10 that are thinned to make concealed carry even easier, and feature a relieved area on the side to allow easy access to the magazine release. Add to that the soft shooting 9mm caliber and you have an ideal carry gun.

The barrel / bushing combination make for an easy take-down without the use of any special tools.

Just like all newly manufactured Nighthawk Custom handguns, the new Signature Series Compact features our ultra hi-cut frame that allow shooters with very large hands to get that pinky finger to rest firmly on the frame while shooting. It also allows a more natural point when you extend your arm since your hand goes up into the frame much further.

Features
Forged Officer size Frame and 4.25"" Slide
Match Grade 9mm Barrel (also available in 45acp)
Lightweight Aluminum Nighthawk Custom Trigger
Thin G10 Proprietary Grips
New Ultra Hi-Cut Front Strap

I say that only because some loudmouth moron from toledo was flapping his herpes raddled gums complaining about people with high end guns wanting to trade down to glocks or another lower priced gun.  His main gripe was the people with the high end sigs and kimbers shouldnt be asking for cash.   The glock is more reliable.... therefore worth just as much.    Damn they must have good dope in toledo.   Sure the glock is reliable.   Thats why i want one.   But so is my godamn sig u numbnut...and furthermore.... the whole goddamn thing got manufactured out of metal. Its alot cheaper to squeeze super high quality polymer into a mold than it is to stamp and forge and mill.   Im sure u knew that because a you have an amazing intellect and b you might have enough of your brain left to remember the last time u shat your pants and the other half of your brain came out... u dolt...   oh wait i know what happened... u got scared that guns were gonna get banned... so u and all ur nincumpoop buddies went out and paid 675 for a 500 glock.   Now that u realize that u got played so u wanna take out it on decent people who once had the money for a high end gun, but have fallen on tough times, and now want to free up a few bucks but not completely give up their gun.   Shame on u sir.  I hope ur as angry as i was when i read what u wrote..  how does it feel...?? nevermind i really dont care.   So i want to trade my sig for a glock...yea if im gonna give up my prized sig im gonna trade it for another gun thats JUST AS RELIABLE BUT COSTS LESS SO I CAN PUT A FEW BUCKS IN MY POCKET... AND U WANNA COMPLAIN ABOUT IT WHY..??   Steaming pile of mastadon dung."

Winchester Black Talon law enforcement and self-defense ammunition has an interesting history. Black Talon is a black bullet with a silver case. It was pulled from shelves after bad press and many people still think it is banned or illegal to own. It is not banned or illegal however, and anyone who can own ammo can own Black Talon. The black coating on the jacketed hollow-point bullet is Lubalox (a proprietary oxide process). The Black Talon bullet has a star shaped perforation on the black tip which is designed to expand into sharp edges upon impact ."

NO CLASS 3 Needed! (legal to own pre-ban)

The Interdynamic KG9 pistol was made in Miami Florida for a short time in the 1981-82 timeframe by Interdynamic of America, Inc. ATF decided in January 1982 that the gun was too easy to convert into a machine gun, and therefore decided that an unmodified open bolt semi-auto KG-9 was a machine gun. ATF exempted unmodified semi-auto KG-9 pistols made before this ruling from the scope of the ruling, so there are so-called grandfathered KG-9 pistols available in the USA. The KG-9 was based on a Swedish designed machine pistol, the MP-9. After the ATF ruling the gun was redesigned into a closed bolt, striker fired pistol, the Interdynamic KG-99, which was sold in the 1982-83 timeframe. After that Interdynamic went out of buisness.

The original gun the cheap tec-9 was made to copy. Rare! Less than 1000 made! Look it up.
