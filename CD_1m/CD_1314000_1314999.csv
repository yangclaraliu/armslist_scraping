 I recently sent it into Smith to have it looked over, they x-rayed the frame and confirmed that it was without any damage and they replaced the titanium cylinder. This revolver has had less than 150 rounds through it. The fact that its aluminum and scandium with a cylinder made of titanium makes it easily the lightest revolver for the .357mag at 11.4oz.

I will include a blackhawk in pocket holster as well as a galco ankle holster as well as a small lock box for it.

The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military and law enforcement professionals around the world. The innovative design of the removable steel frame housed in a polymer grip module allows agencies and units to change caliber, pistol size (subcompact, compact and full), trigger length and grip size without changing the issued serial number. The steel frame controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip, as in other pistols. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with laser/light accessories mounted to the polymer grip's accessory rail.

From Kel-Tec’s website:

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members.

 Loaded magazine: 6 oz.

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

Freedom Munitions: 

    FREEDOM MUNITIONS inspects all cartridge cases for defects. The Scharch Range Master machines are fully automated and cases are checked for any debris and pressure tested for any splits or cracks. Primers are removed, flash holes are cleared, and primer pockets are reamed to accept new primers.

    FREEDOM MUNITIONS then washes cases in an acid wash specially designed to remove all remaining burnt powder from the flash hole and interior of the case which tumbling doesn't remove. Then cases are tumbled in a dryer for a factory look and finish.

    FREEDOM MUNITIONS roll sizes all cases on our own designed machines to meet S.A.A.M.I.specification. This method is the industry standard for commercial sizing, insuring the case wall is sized down to the rim which insures new component performance.

    FREEDOM MUNITIONS then loads these processed components on the same fiber optic-controlled Ammo Load machines as our premium new ammo. These are the same machines used by some of the largest manufacturers in the industry. These machines assure S.A.A.M.I. specifications for priming depth, pressure and overall cartridge length.

It is a 80's Westernfield 850 which is a copy of a mossberg 350 (takes the same magazines, same parts, etc) It is missing the little riser to adjust the elevation on the rear site, but I never shot it at distances where I needed that part. I also replaced the rear site adjustment screw. The wood stock is in very good condition and it shoots very accurately. The top of the receiver has been tapped with grooves for scope mounts. I don't have a scope for it. I don't really want to get rid of it but like I said I'm running out of room in the safe. The 7 round mag that comes with it is capable of taking 22s, 22l, and 22lr which is nice if you cant find 22lr ammo in times such as these...
The rifle has had 0 issues since I've had it with no ftf, fte, jams, ect. It is extremely reliable. Please don't try to lowball me. These rifles are pretty rare, especially the magazines. Just the magazine alone for one of these is going on gunbroker for over $50 with three days left as of the posting of this auction:

This competition ready Glock 35 is chambered in .40 S&W and has two 15 round capacity magazines. Additionally Glock has incorporated adjustable sights, 5.32"" barrel, and ""Safe Action"" trigger system into the proven G35 design. Trigger also has a 3.5 pound pull and extended mag release and slide lock. I bought this new not long ago with the idea of dropping in a 9mm conversion barrel. Decided against that now I want a 34. Brand new never fired, payed $705 for it.

Synthetic stock. Also has the hard to find adjustable muzzle break. You can turn this muzzle break so that it is ported .360 degrees around the last 3 inches of the barrel or you can close it. The barrel on this model is also thicker than regular, not a full bull barrel but very close. I do have a Leupold VX-1 3-9x40 currently mounted on it. I am wiling to negotiate if you do not want the optic. No BS I have shot less then 20 rounds through this gun. I used around 10 shells to sight the gun in and since then have shot I think 2 deer with it plus a few shells at the range for fun. I love this gun and caliber I just have too many guns right now and like to sell and trade for new ones.  This gun I will only take cash for though. I do some light gunsmith work on the side and have completely stripped this gun down and cleaned it. It wasn't very dirty anyways because I clean after every time I shoot, but when I sell a gun like it to be in perfect clean condition. I have shot the cheaper models of Savage and have been impressed, but was really impressed when I spent the money on this gun and how accurate it really was for a Savage firearm. Please feel free to email me back for any questions/ more pics. I live in LaCrosse Wi, but I do drive up to the cities in Minnetonka Mn quiet often. Anywhere between here and there could work for me to meet. Thanks for looking.

Don't forget that he has used the executive order to by-pass congress more than any prior president. If he can't get congress to do it, expect him to do it by executive order.

You have heard of DoubleStar, right?!
Maybe not. They don't spend as much on marketing as Colt, Daniel Defense, PSA, Rock River, Bushmaster, Spikes, Olympic, etc.

DoubleStar Corp’s Origin
Many people ask “where did DSC come from?” After 25 years of success with J&T Distributing selling black rifle parts and accessories, Teresa and Jesse Starnes (Double-Starnes’) decided to create a full line of complete weapons to satisfy the thousands of requests to build an AR-15. The J&T Distributing customer base demanded a rifle that incorporated the versatility and quality that J&T had been providing them for so long.

Manufactured in Winchester Kentucky, DSC has continued to supply not only the commercial market but military and law enforcement forces across the world with high quality firearms they can depend on. Every rifle built uses only US made parts, and is built with precision, care, and pride. Each rifle is built, test fired... not just some rifles... all of them.


Differences in AR-15 type rifles?
Some general info provided by an FFL that specializes in black guns...
USGI and/or mil-spec.: 
Commercial parts are made by casting and stamping, which requires weaker, softer steel to do. Parts wear out faster. USGI and mil-spec are forged and milled, much harder steel. And commercial parts don’t always work with mil-spec if you need a replacement, whereas all mil-spec works with all mil-spec. 

The DoubleStar costs more, but it is all USGI, all mil-spec. The DS-4 is a rifle with flattop. It does not come with a rear sight. They do that due to differences in personal preference. 
The DS-4 Comes with magazine and manual. 

The DS-4 bolt and carrier are be far superior to most commercial ARs. Many commercial AR vendors say they have a mil-spec bolt carrier... probably not completely. The DoubleStar is USGI, M16 blueprint (no others can say that), all parts x-rayed and particle tested. Carrier is internally lined for the bolt travel and typically has a chrome firing pin. 

Finish and machining on the DS is far superior to most all manufacturers, and they use a higher grade 7075 aluminum. Most commercial manufacturers use 6061 aluminum, substandard and not mil-spec. 

I can go on and on. Only the billet and really high dollar manufacturers can really even compare to DoubleStar… And if I was to stake my life on it, I would want it to be the DoubleStar…"

Will sell both bundles together for a discounted price of $395 or will sell the bundles separately, the xbox bundle for $315 and the Wii bundle for $115, but not splitting it up more than that so don't ask. I've lowered the price way under what its worth used.

You won't find a bundle/bundles this size for this low anywhere and you couldn't buy it all at gamestop for anywhere close to my price either. Due to a recent family crisis I need the money to help out in anyway that I can and Im not a gamer anymore so all of this is just taking up space.

If you want to try the systems before you buy them bring a small tv and a way to supply power to it and the console.

Up for sale is a used Interams 1911 A1 model in .45 acp silver cup edition. Its a clone of the military version of the Colt 1911 Gold Cup model made in the 1980's by Interarms Corp. Weapon is complete and fully functional. It shoots perfectly without any hiccups and has flawless action. The only downside is that the blueing is coming off from wear and scratches and there is some minor pitting near rear of the slide but its mainly surface issues. nothing that cant be sanded or polished off. Gun currently has pachmayr grips on it nut original GI style grips are included too. Weapon comes with 1 magazine and the original box. Box is worn and torn but cool to have. This is a routine shooter but bore is still in good shape. Item would be a great resto project or base for a upgrade build. Any questions feel free to ask, i tried my best to describe it all the way. More pics available upon request.

Today I have a very good condition Smith and Wesson model 4506-1. It has the silver hammer and trigger, not the MIM or blued ones that rust from merely looking at them.

Gun has a few carry marks but hasn't seen much shooting, I would guess at less than 250 rounds including 50 I've put through it since owning it. 

It will come with 3 magazines if you pay the full $700, but I can let it go for $650 if you would be fine with one magazine. Has a case, but not the factory one. My prices are always ""or best reasonable offer"" unless otherwise noted.

These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

PSA M4 Carbine, Geissele SSA Trigger, Nickel Boron Enhanced BCG, BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle, Magpul ACS-L Stock, Magpul Trigger Guard

Read on for all the INFO on each component:

The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) trigger is a semi-automatic-only version of Geissele Automatics’s Super Select-Fire trigger. The SSA is a non-adjustable combat trigger that performs like a match-grade two-stage trigger and allows precise and accurate trigger control. It is recommended for demanding applications such as Squad Designated Marksman (SDM) rifles, Law Enforcement use, and Close Quarters Battle (CQB) and mid-range carbine work. 

Barrel:  16"" chrome-lined mil-spec chrome moly vanadium barrel, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine gas system.   M4 style profile is phosphate coated to mil-specs, and is High Pressure tested, and Magnetic Particle inspected, to ensure quality and dependability.   Barrel is finished off with a standard carbine hand guard, pinned f-marked front sight post, rear Magpul Back Up Sight, and A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer, and are marked with the Palmetto State Armory logo on the left side, up front, just below the rail.

Lower:  These forged lowers are quality made using 7075-T6 aluminum and are marked ""MULTI"" for caliber.  Finish is Black Hardcoat Anodize per MIL-8625 Type 3 class 2.  Mil-spec sized buffer tube is forged of 7075 aluminum, is dry film lube coated on the inside, has 6 adjustment positions, Standard carbine buffer is Black anodized.

The AR-Stoner Enhanced Bolt Carrier Assembly features a fully staked gas key. The carrier body has a relief cut at the rear to allow for the installation of a carrier weight system (like the Tubb CWS). This cut eliminates the need to remove both takedown pins to slide the recievers together, the gun pivots on the front pin as normal.  Nickel Boron:  Microscopic ""Nano Domes"" formed at the surface provide dry lubricity and affords hundreds of hours of salt water protection. Nickel Boron coating is easy to clean and resists fouling. 

Introducing the BCMGUNFIGHTER™  
(VLTOR Patent Pending)  The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle and extended latches feature internal redesigns to direct the force off of the roll pin and into the body of the charging handle during support hand only manipulations.  This new design has a built in backstop engineered into the extended latch and into the charging handle.  As the latch is opened up, its’ travel is limited by these flat surface backstops.  With this travel limiting feature, the stress is taken off the roll pin, and is now redirected into the entire body of the charging handle.

The Magpul Adaptable Carbine Stock - Light (ACS-L)  collapsible buttstock is a more streamlined version of the popular ACS stock. The ACS-L does away with the dual battery compartments to save both cost and weight, but still features a center storage compartment in the tail of the stock for batteries, small parts or cleaning gear. The stock also maintains the enhanced cheek weld, shielded operation lever and supplemental friction lock of the original ACS as well. Additional features include a reversible, push-button QD sling swivel mounting point and removable 0.30"" thick rubber butt pad.

The Magpul MOE Trigger Guard is an enhanced polymer drop in replacement for the AR15/M16 weapons platform. It features a shallow ""V"" shape for better use of gloves in tactical shooting or cold weather operations. The MOE Trigger Guard is non-folding, has rounded edges, and fills the annoying ""gap"" at the rear of the standard trigger guard.

Will NOT accept any less than this, as it is a brand new, never used scope. While it came mounted on the rifle, it has since been returned to its original box, as have the mounting rings. This scope is calibrated and designed to be fired with the .223/5.56 round, with range adjustments that will allow you to correctly adjust fire out to 800 meters. This is a $200 scope with $70 rings, and I already paid the tax, so for me it was around $300 for this setup. So price is FIRM.
As with all of my sales, I generally include a free AR-15 30 round magazine, just as a little bonus.
