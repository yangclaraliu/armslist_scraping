This is CONVERTED with the trigger group moved forward. It has a Tapco G2 trigger group, Tromix trigger guard, Tapco adjustable stock, Tapco SAW pistol grip, upgraded trigger reset spring, and upgraded recoil spring. The gas puck was been replaced with an MD Arms booster puck. The gas regulator has been upgraded to a DPH 6-position adjustable. This features a Tromix shark brake on the end of the barrel. The rail is a CHAOS USA Titan Quad Rail and is also equipped with the CHAOS USA HK style sights. 

Included is everything about as well as the original components, paperwork, and box. This has 6 magazines with a factory 5-round mag and 5-10 round SGM Tactical mags. These are not the cheap pro mags. These are the best you can get for hi cap mags. 

This gun is fully 922 compliant. It will also shoot Federal low brass in the bulk pack from Walmart with no issues. It can also run any high brass you wanna throw at it.

An FNX45 Tactical pistol is preferred over all.

Picked this up from my LGS two weeks ago thinking it would become my new EDC but I just can't give up my lighter weight and more pocket friendly CM9. I bought a brand new Desantis Superfly pocket holster for it a few days later and other than carrying it around the house for a few hours it's good as new. Only thing I've done with the pistol was take it down and clean and lube it. 

I'm selling both for $550. (I paid $571 out the door for the pistol and $33 for the holster.) Will not travel out of the Indy area and prefer to stay on the north or east side of town. Only trade I'm interested in is a Commander size 1911, and I can add cash if you have a higher end one that catches my eye.

279,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1944279,For Sale:  Heckler and Koch (HK P7 M8),"Smiths Grove, Bowling Green, Kentucky",$ 950,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 31, 2013",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,no type,no type,Pistol,"SOLD - PENDING PICKUP

The P7's spring extractor is contained within the slide, while the fixed ejector is a surface on the slide catch.

The grip of this pistol features a built-in cocking lever activated by gripping the pistol handle. Before the pistol can be fired, this lever must be squeezed. Thus this lever acts as a safety. The pistol has an innovative trigger (with a squeeze cocking lever located at the front of the grip, beneath the trigger guard) and is striker fired.[9] Squeezing the cocking lever with a force of 70 N (15.7 lbf) cocks the firing pin. Once fully depressed, only 2 pounds of force are required to keep the weapon cocked. The weapon is then fired by pressing the single stage trigger rated at approximately 20 N (4.5 lbf) As long as the lever is depressed, the weapon fires like any other semi-automatic pistol. If the lever is released, the weapon is immediately de-cocked and rendered safe. This method of operation dispensed the need for a manual safety selector while providing safety for the user carrying the pistol with a chambered round, and increased the speed with which the pistol could be deployed and fired. The trigger and firing mechanism's method of operation (and the unique slide catch) were protected by U.S. Patent 4,132,023, issued on January 2, 1979.[10]

The P7 is fed from a single-stack box magazine with a capacity of 8 rounds,[11] which is held inside the firearm's frame with a release located at the heel of the grip. After the last round has been fired, the slide will remain open thanks to a slide catch that can be released by pulling the slide further back or pressing the squeeze cocker.

The firearm uses a fixed, polygonal barrel (hexagonal with a 250 mm twist rate) and a fixed notched iron sight with contrast dots that enable shooting in low-level lighting conditions. The pistol is completely ambidextrous and two-handed use is enhanced through the use of a profiled and enlarged trigger guard.[2]

Between 1982–1983 the P7 received several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications resulted in the P7M8 model. A new magazine release lever (available on both sides of the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine.[12] The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The firing pin and its bushing were also changed."

 This is a 300 BLACKOUT (7.62X35) upper receiver that mounts to an AR-15 platform. if you have an AR-15 you can add this upper without buying any other parts, uses the same bolt, lower, magazines, etc... as an AR-15. 
Gas system has been customized to allow it to shoot 220gr. unsuppressed. The round itself is a 7.62 round in a re-sized 5.56 casing. This gun is flying off the shelves at any gun store. I have only put about 15 rounds through it. 
I have some ammo for this as well, I will count what i have when i get home. Asking 800$ firm or willing to trade for something of equal value, let me know what you've got!

This rifle has a 24” barrel that is bright & shiny. There are several scratches and some wear in the blueing on the barrel and trigger guard. The stock has scratches & dings in the wood but nothing too deep, there are no cracks or chips. Mounted on top is an old steel tube scope, I believe it is a fixed 4 power. The make of the scope is unknown due to the lack of any manufacturers markings, the optics remain relatively clear and it has a set fine cross hairs within. Overall this long gun is in very good condition.

Im not really looking for trades but high end tactical bolt guns would be considered. Price is 1600.00 for the rifle without scope. if you want a very nice scope i will sell you a weaver tactical 5-15x50 that retails for 1200.00 i will take 700.00 with rings. Here is how the price breaks down so i dont get rude comments saying im 900.00 over priced lol

low profile gas block-$60 
Tactical changing handle-$15

that comes to 1857.68(probably more after shipping) 
I have fired exactly 40 rounds through this gun. you also have to factor in installation of parts and even being able to find all the parts. so 1600 is a VERY fair price. I appreciate you reading my add!

There are a few of these floating around, but not many. They made 210,000 Winchester model 77's in the 1950's and 60's, which is quite a few.. But only 10 percent of those were tube-fed...that's 21,000. This is one of those Tube-fed models. I saw one sell on GunBroker last week for $455.00 without the scope.
This one is in very good condition...very good, and it functions perfect and has every modern feature. They stopped making the Model 77 in the 1960's.
It is grooved for mounting a scope. (same size groove that is on the Ruger 10/22 and all .22 rifles). It has fully adjustable iron sites also. The bolt is on the left side, which is one of the tell-tale model 77 characteristics. It functions flawless and looks great. It will shoot cheap bulk ammo as fast as you can pull the trigger without a hiccup. This is a collector's gun BUT, it is ready to be an everyday shooter also. It looks and feels better than a Ruger. It is a Winchester, back when they were the best. It's not overly heavy and it lacks nothing that a brand new .22 rifle has. You don't feel like your holding an old outdated gun.

I am looking to buy a reasonably priced 9mm Hi Point that is in good working order. Long story short my girlfriends mom just broke up with her abusive alcoholic husband and he's been threatening her and she's still scared even with the order of protection she got so I gave her one of our .380s to hold onto. I rather just buy her a $150 Hi Point in a 9mm and let her keep it and get my little ruger back. So if anyone has a Hi Point 9mm that is in good working order I would like to purchase it for a reasonable price and just let her keep it. Please email me with the details and how much you want and I will get right back to you. Thank you

Arsenal, Inc. introduces the all-Bulgarian SLR-106UR Pistol in 5.56x45mm NATO. Arsenal Arms is a US manufacturer that produces firearms of the finest and most authentic examples of the time proven AK type assault rifle design. The SLR-106UR Pistol is manufactured entirely at Arsenal’s factory in Kazanlak, Bulgaria using components specifically engineered for accuracy and reliability in a short-barrel configuration. The SLR-106UR pistol includes many features not found on any similar 5.56mm pistol, and is as close to a semi-automatic AKS-74U (or ‘Krinkov’) as American shooters may possess without ATFE approval. Unlike many others replicas this, is a new production model and not a Kit build, is the best AK-47 you can get on the market.

NO TRADES

This pistol is unfired since purchase, and therefore in the same condition as when I received it from Hilton. I was able to get one of the 2012 10-8 Operators, so I never used this pistol. I will include the receipt from Hilton and 10-8 Performance.  

Below is the text from the 10-8 Performance Newsletter for the sale announcement: 

This circa 2006 build from the Springfield Custom Shop was part of a custom run that served as the concept gun for what we now know as the Springfield 10-8 Operator. Back then, the only 10-8 parts were the trigger, .125"" notch rear sight, and signature grips, here in an uncommon green/black G10. This gun is either unfired or only fired about 100-200 rounds max, and the finish appears as new. The gun was a SHOT display gun for several years, and has been retrofitted with an early production 10-8 mag catch.
