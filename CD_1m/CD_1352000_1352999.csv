Maybe you will realize your ak was never worth more than 700 dollars and drop it to a reasonable price lmao.

""I proudly live in georgia, a state with one of the largest growing ports in the world, Savannah.

I respect no law that goes against the constitution that I love. And I never will. I would fight until death to protect that statement, Without a shadow of doubt in my heart. To follow a treaty such as this in an event of it being approved is downright treason.

 **Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality


--ITEM 1  ***MOE® Carbine Stock – Mil-Spec Model***

The Magpul MOE Stock – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

--ITEM 2  ***MOE® Hand Guard, Mid-Length – AR15/M16***

The Magpul MOE Hand Guard for AR15/M16 rifles with mid-length gas systems combines the light weight of a standard hand guard with modular flexibility. Designed with versatility in mind, slots at the two, six, and ten o'clock positions allow the attachment of optional Picatinny rail sections and other accessories for mounting tactical lights, slings, grips, etc. Reinforced, heat-resistant polymer construction provides operational durability without the weight and expense of an aluminum rail hand guard. Front extensions and lower lip provides additional operator protection from hot front sight assembly.

--ITEM 3 ****MVG® - MOE® Vertical Grip****

Designed for use with MOE Hand Guards and Forends, the MVG is a basic, light weight, cost-effective vertical fore grip that attaches directly to these hand guards without any rail needed. Shape is ergonomically designed for use as a traditional vertical grip. It has also been optimized for use with the ""thumb break method"" of shooting as taught by Magpul Dynamics.SM.

This sixgun is a stainless steel New Vaquero model in 45 colt that has never had a live round fired through it (only blanks!).  It comes with everything as new (plastic box, paperwork, fired shell casing etc.).  

The original Vaquero was refitted with a stainless steel Bisley grip frame and trigger.  The Hammer in and of itself is Rare as it is the Montado Hammer which was designed specifically for mounted shooting.  
The Bisley trigger has been lightened and the Laminate Rosewood grips have been hand stained and sealed.  This truly is a RARE piece and you will not find another one like it!
The 4 5/8 in. barrel is the perfect length for SUPERB balance Especially in the NEW MODEL VAQUERO!

Him-U just feel guilty or wouldn't respond 


Me-Msrp is not overpriced. 

Him-And no I only call out the outrageous ads that are grossly overpriced ... Those kinda people are the worst society has to offer.... But hey to each is own.... When people figure out they for screwed they won't come back anyways.... 


Me-Was just on their sight and they only had aftermarket barrels in stock for a Glock. Glock was not even listed on their manufacture list of guns they carry. Either way, my price is MSRP on my Gen 4 glocks. The fact that I’m listing it locally and not trying to get $700 plus on Gunbroker seems like a good deed. Do you go through every ad up and e-mail people how cheap you can get every thing they list?

If you're looking for a  carbine that is easy to use and is compatible with your Glock 17/19 pistol....this is for you.

The 9mm round will produce  a 25-30% increase in balistic energy through a carbine over a 4""pistol ,which equates to a pretty damn effective self- defense weapon.

I just want a basic GI model 1911.  I have a Llama IX-a that I might be willing to trade if you want to keep a .45 but I'd rather just pay cash.  My Llama is extremely reliable, never had a single issue with it but I just want a 1911 that I can interchange any and all parts with, that's the only downfall with my Llama, not all parts are interchangeable.  I will consider offers on other 1911's but I'm mainly looking for the basic Springfield.  I would be even more interested in a Ruger but I know those aren't the easiest to find.  I would really like a mil-spec 1911 made in the USA but I'm not trying to pay $800+ for one.  I don't care about the finish on the gun as long as it functions properly and the internals are in solid condition.   So if you have a Springfield or any other 1911 you think I might be interested in get back to me here through armslist or text REDACTED.  I live in Valparaiso and I really don't want to drive all the way to southern part of the state so please be North of Indy.  I will travel for the right deal.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX2kT8KAmIg

This firearm and the Pmags are 2013 production run.  Here are the specifications for this firearm and the Magpul Mags.

FEATURES
• Gas piston operating system
• Four-position gas regulator
• 5.56 x 45mm NATO
• Free-floating military grade chrome lined barrel
• M1913 Picatinny flat top upper
• 7075-T6 Aircraft grade aluminum upper & lower receiver with hard coat anodize finish
• Flip-up iron sights

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Made in U.S.A."

I could say this is worth a gazillion dollares but At NON-STUPID Prices this is about $80-85 worth of ammo in any reputable store.  I will take $60 cash FIRM (no need to offer $59.99 or less because it's no).  If you need a box of target and 2 boxes of self defense here is a chance to save yourself $20-25 (~30%) then here's your deal.  If you're like Washington and our politicians and money is no object you are welcome to go pay retail + tax haha.  I personally like to save a few coins where I can.

Will trade for anything or a combination of anything listed below.  (NOTE if trading it's a retail for retail value no discount sorry)

Update:  If you are offering a trade, unless it is a combination of these calibers your trade must be exactly what I have listed not 1 or 2 boxes of 45 like some have offered (RDTRK U KNOW WHO U ARE)  Not being a butt it's just the price is fair and the trade is fair, I haven't asked STUPID PRICES like ATP gets or others selling here, it's the same price pretty much it was before the stupidity.

This was made to pass the last import and assault weapons ban. This rifle can only accept the 10 round magazines made for this rifle and includes all 3 magazines sold with the rifle. This is the most accurate 7.62x39 AK-type rifle I have shot. The bi-pod is aftermarket and is fast to remove as it is a barrel clamp-on style. The barrel is hard chrome lined and the muzzle brake is pinned on at the factory. It has a factory-made Choate branded thumbhole-type stock. This rifle feels extremely solid. It has less than 300 rounds total through it and is very accurate and 100% reliability. I have owned it since 1999 and have enjoyed every trip to the range. I hate to sell this rifle but it is too nice to let it grow old in the safe!! Give it a good home.

Here is a cheap alternative that will give you a better rifle. 
Assemble your own AR 15 for $600-$1000 depending on your options.
Go to gunbroker.com, buy a stripped lower receiver for anywhere between $100-250. It may take a while to find a good one, but you can get a forged aluminum receiver for under $200 or a polymer for $150 with the complete lower.
Then go search sites like Rguns for the upper and lower or other parts sites. There are over a dozen sites out there with inventory in stock for parts. You can get complete uppers or get it in parts, same goes for lowers. 
This is a great way to customize your rifle and really get to know it. Not to mention you can at least get the upper assembled while you wait for the receiver to go through background checks.

Some of these rifles out there are going for $1,500-$3,000 and you could build a better rifle easily with $1,000. A build is easy, you can follow youtube videos for instructions. You also get to pick stuff like polymer vs aluminum receiver, 1/7 vs 1/9 barrel twist, wide variety of sights, stocks, handrail options out the wazoo, all black vs a bi-tone. 

Dont pay these outrageous prices. If you want a good reference as to what rifles should cost, look below. If you see a stock rifle going for more than the below price, I suggest you pass and build your own!

I have shot it a few times and fired great but like I said on the last gun I do not hunt I just thought it would be cool to own a shotgun but really it just sits in the closet also so I think I can let it go.

This is the most accurate 7.62x39 AK-type rifle I have shot. The bi-pod is aftermarket and is fast to remove as it is a barrel clamp-on style. The barrel is hard chrome lined and the muzzle brake is pinned on at the factory. It has a factory-made Choate branded thumbhole-type stock. This rifle feels extremely solid. It has less than 300 rounds total through it and is very accurate and 100% reliability. I have owned it since 1999 and have enjoyed every trip to the range. I hate to sell this rifle but it is too nice to let it grow old in the safe!! Give it a good home.

They would not split so I had to purchase entire cases.
Yes, I got laid away but like I said I love to plink so I paid it. I purchased a case of Centurion 40 g LRN for $720 plus $30 shipping and a case of Federal 36 g CPHP for $920 plus $30 shipping. That comes out to $75 per box (qty 500) of Centurion and $94.50 per box (qty 525) of Federal.
If anybody would like a box for what I paid so I can recoup some of my money let me know. I didn't need this much ammo but if nobody wants any I will just keep it stored until I do need it as eventually I will.
I know this is not for everybody but if you are like me and have to shoot then it is what it is in todays climate. I don't like it either but I am not going to let this mess stop me from what I enjoy."
