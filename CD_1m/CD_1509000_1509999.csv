As the title says...I'm looking to potentially buy a nice little 22 revolver. I like Heritage Revolvers a lot, but would absolutely be open to other brands. I'm a big fan of shooting these little revolvers and want a couple more around.

I don't mind if they're a little roughed up from normal use, but i'm not good with abuse. I'd really like to have one with adjustable sights in stainless as I already have a couple that are blued.

I'd like to stick around $100 or so as a top price if anyone has anything for that price range, that's what they were priced at new before this crazy pricing broke out (See here for reference: http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/21_577/products_id/4115002/Heritage+Rough+Rider+.22lr+3%22+Blue%2C+%24100+DELIVERED+%21%21+%2A%2ASPECIAL)....So if I have to pay much more i'll just wait it out and get another one later on.

I am selling my awesome condition 2007 G3 1548DK boat set up. it comes with a 2010 super low hour mercury 20HP four stroke. Starts and runs perfectly. recently installed a new hydrofoil on it, boat planes out in the mid to high 20's with 2 people and gear. also installed fishing pole holders, both for transport and for fishing, 5 in all, for a full price offer i will include my brand new lowrance mark 4 fish finder with GPS all mounted and ready to go. Also included is a near new 50LB thrust minkota trolling motor bought new in 2012. comes with two seats, 3 life jackets, paddle, brand new spare tire with new mount, and trailer.has a new custom paint job, had my other boat done by the same guy and it has held up awesome for 5 duck/fishing seasons, still looks new. also had a $200 jack plate installed so you can run a long shaft outboard on it, it can be removed/customized to run any length shaft motor. 

the wheels are coated with truck bed liner, along with the front deck portion of the boat for awesome grip while stand up fishing off the front of the boat. I am open to trades plus cash, but be reasonable. this set up cost around 11K new, and is in like new operating condition, so its a heck of a deal already.

I thought someday it may become something unique following the expired ban. I have noticed through the years several other types of the AR pistols have become available on the market. 

The latest Type 97S offered by Bushmaster has a ribbed hand guard, whereas this one is smooth. There are other variants of the Bushmaster pistol without hand guards, and one without the lower rails. These were offered for less money.

Before posting this Bushmaster for sale, I searched other websites offering these Bushmaster pistols for sale and haven’t been successful. Not in stock and no back order. My best guess is if you want a Bushmaster 97S pistol like mine you are likely to buy one here on Armslist or another auction.

I believe I priced this one $100 below all other listings for a quick sale. I am asking $1000. If you can find one in stock at a lower price please send me the link to verify and I will let the Bushmaster go for that price once verified.

I thought someday it may become something unique following the expired ban. I have noticed through the years several other types of the AR pistols have become available on the market. 

The latest Type 97S offered by Bushmaster has a ribbed hand guard, whereas this one is smooth. There are other variants of the Bushmaster pistol without hand guards, and one without the lower rails. These were offered for less money.

Before posting this Bushmaster for sale, I searched other websites offering these Bushmaster pistols for sale and haven’t been successful. Not in stock and no back order. My best guess is if you want a Bushmaster 97S pistol like mine you are likely to buy one here on Armslist or another auction.

I believe I priced this one $100 below all other listings for a quick sale. I am asking $1000. If you can find one in stock at a lower price please send me the link to verify and I will let the Bushmaster go for that price once verified.

I will include 5 new 20 round magazines with the 30 round factory magazine for the right price. Again this is new unfired and flawless.

Hand grips replaced with golf ball style 1911 grips from Nighthawk Custom
Hammer and sear replaced to eliminate trigger creep
Buffer and guide rod replaced with shorter GI model to reduce weight
Factory spring replaced with 18.5 spring so it can shoot factory and hand loads better.

As a note, you will receive all of the replaced parts with the gun as well if you prefer them, aside from the recoil spring which I do not have.

Aside from those added features, the gun also has an ambidextrous safety, an 8 round magazine, a holster made for it, and a padded case for the gun itself. It will also include just over 50 rounds of 45 ACP, all brass cased.

For those interested, please email through the site or text REDACTED. Please, text before you call. Another issue I've had recently with Armslist is people not responding via the built in email. Please check your spam folders, just in case my reply is captured, as I am usually pretty prompt about responding.

Pistol will only be sold to people with valid Arizona ID over the age of 18.

Thank you!

A note about the picture: This is before the hammer was replaced, and the hammer was replaced with a stainless steel that matches the trigger.

**Note: I, the seller, am under 21, but I've checked with law enforcement on two occasions to ensure that the sale of this gun private party is completely legal to anyone over the age of 18.

I thought someday it may become something unique following the expired ban. I have noticed through the years several other types of the AR pistols have become available on the market. 

The latest Type 97S offered by Bushmaster has a ribbed hand guard, whereas this one is smooth. There are other variants of the Bushmaster pistol without hand guards, and one without the lower rails. These were offered for less money.

Before posting this Bushmaster for sale, I searched other websites offering these Bushmaster pistols for sale and haven’t been successful. Not in stock and no back order. My best guess is if you want a Bushmaster 97S pistol like mine you are likely to buy one here on Armslist or another auction.

I believe I priced this one $100 below all other listings for a quick sale. I am asking $1000. If you can find one in stock at a lower price please send me the link to verify and I will let the Bushmaster go for that price once verified.

I will include 5 new 20 round magazines with the 30 round factory magazine for the right price. Again this is new unfired and flawless.

I thought someday it may become something unique following the expired ban. I have noticed through the years several other types of the AR pistols have become available on the market. 

The latest Type 97S offered by Bushmaster has a ribbed hand guard, whereas this one is smooth. There are other variants of the Bushmaster pistol without hand guards, and one without the lower rails. These were offered for less money.

Before posting this Bushmaster for sale, I searched other websites offering these Bushmaster pistols for sale and haven’t been successful. Not in stock and no back order. My best guess is if you want a Bushmaster 97S pistol like mine you are likely to buy one here on Armslist or another auction.

I believe I priced this one $100 below all other listings for a quick sale. I am asking $1000. If you can find one in stock at a lower price please send me the link to verify and I will let the Bushmaster go for that price once verified.

I will include 5 new 20 round magazines with the 30 round factory magazine for the right price. Again this is new unfired and flawless.

I have added spin-on oil filters and secondary fuel filters.  My friend Kenny helped me replace all of the o-rings which were leaking either oil or fuel under the Hydraulic head.  Both batteries have been replaced in April of last year.  The cargo cover had a rip in it, was fixed and from the outside you can hardly tell.  I bought the truck from Joe Czarnick in Appleton WI a little over 5 years ago.  He had just sandblasted the truck and painted it with CARC paint and it looks as good today as it did the day that I bought it.  The spare tire is a 11.00-20 Michelin XL, as is the extra mounted spare that is in the bed.  When I bought this truck it was running singles. I did all of the work to return it to duals. The truck does have a cab heater and I recently replaced the in tank fuel pump with a 24 volt inline unit.  Both front inner axle seals have been changed and the differential was drained and refilled.  Over the last year I have had all the wheels off at one time or another and the brakes are in excellent shape yet.  The front tires are G177’s as is one tire on the rear, the rest are G188’s.  All of the rubber rope for the cargo cover has been replaced.  I expect to get the truck from the storage building hopefully sometime before May 1st.  I’ll have no access to it until that time.

There is a lift in the back that is included,  I have a brand new tan cab cover for it also.

This one has factory Metrolight night sights and a Glock grip plug installed. I had the Glock Armorer install a 3.5 lb trigger kit including the connector and all 3 springs over the weekend. Its actually a little less then 3lbs I think. I have a couple of other Glocks done exactly the same way and this one has the lightest trigger. The factory trigger parts are included. This gun also includes 2 hi-cap mags, the box and all factory accessories. 

These EXO Glocks are extremely hard to find especially brand new. The chance of you walking into a gun dealer and them having one are almost impossible. The last few Glock EXO's that sold on Gunbroker went for around $700. And that's without the extras that are on this one. Im asking $775 or best offer.

Since then, something completely different fell in my lap and now I don't need it!

If the ad is up, it is for sale.  This is an incomplete fire arm.

Ak-47 7.62x39 Maadi (Egyptian Army) parts kit.  Egyptian AK's are made on Russian equipment in Cairo, and are considered as close to a Russian AKM as you can get.  (That means they are very good quality).  Do your due internet research.  Or if you are a builder and already know what's what, never mind. :D

The Egyptian AK's are sought after for the Egyptian lettering on the rear sight and on the barrel trunion.  The 'crutch' stock (sidefolder) is also highly sought after by collectors (says the internet).  They are perfect for someone who wants a REALLY good AK, but doesn't want an Arsenal like everybody else.

All numbers I can see are matching.  It does not appear to have been fired much, if at all, based on my untrained eye's view of the bolt face.

When this arrived in the mail, the bag had popped, so I removed all the parts, got most of the cosmo off of them and re-applied a healthy dose of lithium grease mixed with synthetic oil.  The barrel trunion has light surface rust.  This can easily be remedied with treatment before building, does not affect function, and is just a fact of life with the bare steel.

All parts included are what was shipped to me.  All parts are represented in the pictures.  I haven't built an AK before and was going to have this pro built, so if you don't see a part, it probably didn't come with it.

  There is no barrel, no receiver.  There are a few chopped up bits of receiver in the upper right.


Price is firm, prefer FTF but will ship with DISCREET paypal.  This is not a firearm, but prefer local sale to resident who doesn't creep me out.

If interested, respond with availability to meet and your suburb so I can cut out about 10 emails back and forth about where and when :)"

I thought someday it may become something unique following the expired ban. I have noticed through the years several other types of the AR pistols have become available on the market. 

The latest Type 97S offered by Bushmaster has a ribbed hand guard, whereas this one is smooth. There are other variants of the Bushmaster pistol without hand guards, and one without the lower rails. These were offered for less money.

Before posting this Bushmaster for sale, I searched other websites offering these Bushmaster pistols for sale and haven’t been successful. Not in stock and no back order. My best guess is if you want a Bushmaster 97S pistol like mine you are likely to buy one here on Armslist or another auction.

I believe I priced this one $100 below all other listings for a quick sale. I am asking $1000. If you can find one in stock at a lower price please send me the link to verify and I will let the Bushmaster go for that price once verified.

I will include 5 new 20 round magazines with the 30 round factory magazine for the right price. Again this is new unfired and flawless.

One guy promised me he would buy after BEGGING me to hold a rifle until ""I get my pay check"" a whole week later even though I said ""I WILL NOT HOLD"". Against my better judgment I did and he set up a time and never showed.. I sat there an hour.

Another guy set up a time, I sat there half an hour and he never showed either.

I then had 4 other people get me to hold for a few days or string me along for over a week only to say ""SOmeone just died in my family sorry""(If that really happened I am truly sorry.. But I wasted an hour of my life digging through my considerable collection to find you something I did not even plan on selling because you INSISTED and then you string me along a week only to say you cant meet me the next day because someone died?)

Whats with people? Are your names and words mean nothing? Is that how it is these days? Because you dont know me and its just ""armslist"" aka craigslist of guns, you feel you can promise or agree to something and then just abandon it when you find it cheaper somewhere else?

I can only imagine people like this during a crisis.. These are the same kind of people stealing TVs from walmart during hurricane katrina because they KNEW they could get away with it.

I thank god every day there are honest people out there.. Because after dealing with people this last week I have to question my faith in humanity.. I have never broken a deal I agreed on because ""I found it cheaper elsewhere"".

And unlike a jerk recently who agreed to buy(after bugging the crap out of me) if I could not show to a scheduled meet I would  email the person instead of being a coward(because you knew you were wrong in backing out and did not want to face that by saying sorry) and ignoring someone I would say ""Sorry I changed my mind"".

THIS IS NOT CRAIGSLIST, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, BE RESPECTFUL OF PEOPLE. IS IT SO HARD TO KEEP YOUR WORD?

I really am ashamed of several of you on here.. 9 people over a cheap $200 mosin rifle.. I just cant believe it. What makes it worse is a few of them promised and gave me their word that ""I will be getting these"" because I explained why I could not hold rifles. ANd against my better judgement I held the rifles for whatever reason they had until they were ready..

I have lost my faith, im done being polite, nice and respectful. I will never again hold a rifle for a single day for someone. I will never again drive to meet someone somewhere. I will never again bother being nice and replying to people who clearly cant read ""NO TRADES"" ""CASH ONLY"" ""MUST HAVE NC ID"".
Im done.. Being an honest straight forward person has rewarded me with a slap in the face and an hour sitting in a walmart parking lot waiting for some loser who was to cowardly to call and say ""Changed my mind"" after scheduling to meet 3 hours earlier.

SHAME ON YOU

--
No.. Do not message me asking me ""Hey are those rifles available"" because im frankly done.. Im tired of being lied to. Im tired of the ""Hey im sorry some people are jerks but I promise I will come get them I get paid friday is that ok"" because every time I trust someones word they waste my time.. So NO, these rifles are not available. Its clear the level of craigslist has come to armslist. These rifles are not $100.. SO dont change my mind. The ""100"" price was to make sure all the cheap losers who decided to back out on me read this..

The fit and finish of Vepr's are truly a step above most Ak's. This model also comes with the more rare 20.5"" barrel for increased accuracy and bullet velocity. Unlike many Ak's Vepr's have a lifetime warranty. Included are 2 magazines. A 10 round and a 5 round. The gun can easily be upgraded to hold higher capacity magazines.

420 rounds of 5.45x29 Silver Bear cartridges, which is some of the highest quality 5.45x39 ammo you can buy.

This firearm is built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. This makes this one of the most accurate AK's you can buy. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. Vepr in 5.45x39 caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 16” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope. Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage.

The VEPR Rifle in 5.45x39 is the top of the line in Kalashnikov action semi-automatic rifles. With features such as; Hammer forged heavy barrel, (including a chrome lined barrel bore, chamber, gas block and gas piston), 1.5mm thick receiver, RPK front trunnion, spring loaded firing pin, side scope mount, hand made walnut thumbhole stock and the Wolf Lifetime Warranty. The VEPR is simply the highest quality rifle based on the Kalashnikov design. The VEPR Rifles and Carbines are sporting arms based on the famous Soviet designed RPK. VEPR rifles are manufactured at the historic Vyatskie Polyany Machine Building Plant (a.k.a. ""MOLOT""). Molot has been building excellence into their firearms for over 50 years."

I bought this gun new last month. It has a custom stippled frame with a new RockYourGlock chrome pin kit, a RockYourGlock chrome trigger housing pin, a hand polished locking block, a hand polished trigger bar, a hand polished ejector, hand polished slide rails and a Ghost Ultimate 3.5lb trigger connector. The slide features chrome filled factory engravings, a black anodized aluminum slide cover plate with the Glock emblem engraved in it, a hand polished striker, a hand polished extractor plunger, a hand polished striker safety button and a hand polished reset/guide rail. The gun has Glock tritium night sights on it! I have a new leather IWB holster that I'll include in the sale that I gave $50 for when I bought the gun. The gun will come with the factory case, 2 magazines that I've installed Pearce finger extensions on and all the papers and lock. The gun has only had 11 rounds fired through it! After I finished all of the modifications, I took it out and ran 11 rounds through it to make sure that it functioned properly and felt like I wanted it to. It's a sweet little pistol!  Asking $750 OBO. For more info or to make an offer, call or text REDACTED. Mainly looking to sale but will consider trade offers. Thanks."
