It comes with everything new from the factory (case, brush, backs).

HEADS UP - the bottom picture showing the Gen 4, it shows a piece of something on the pistol but it is just a piece of lint or something, the gun is spotless.. which is why I included the barrel picture

Comes with a custom IWB holster from PJ Holsters.  I used this holster with my gen3 glock 26 but sold that one because I switched to the G30 and this 26 just sat in the safe.  I bought it on a wim because I liked the gen 4 model and just never did any thing with it and now I carry only 45.

It does include 1 of the mag extensions that will allow you to have a smooth grip on a glock 19 mag being used in the glock 26.  It shows two but one is my brother in laws.

comes with 5 mags, 3 have +1 extension, 1 is stock and the other has the GAP ( http://www.concealablecontrol.com/products.html ) end that gives you a steady grip with the stock length mag.  you can see it has a small extension out instead of down in the pictues

Would like to trade for a gen 4 glock 19 FDE with multiple mags as well.  --- would consider a stock gen 4 glock 19, would just prefer the FDE.

I can send more pics via email but it is easier for me to send them via phone since they are already on my phone.

The Thunder Pro UC is a smaller version of the Thunder Pro. Compact and powerful, the Thunder Pro UC is an excellent choice for those who need stopping power without bulk. Preserving the best features of the standard Thunder Pro, the Thunder Pro Ultra Compact is a superior value in a compact, service grade handgun.

Like the standard Pro, the Thunder Pro UC features an improved Browning Petter barrel locking system which provides reliable feeding and ejection. The safety, cocking lever, slide stop levers and magazine catch are completely ambidextrous making this a perfect fit for right or left handers. The Thunder Pro UC maintains the Bersa tradition of accuracy, reliability and durability and is an excellent choice for anyone needing a tough, reliable, compact sidearm."

As stated above I'm thinking about selling this AR-15, it is an RRA with a heavy 5.56 barrel, This is a sweet looking, feeling and shooting gun.....It's been well kept and has had 350 rounds through it.....
     As you can see, it has a nice quad rail with covers, an Eotech 552.A65 Holographic sight, an adjustable stock, a very smooth, light trigger job (not sure on specs, but very nice), sweet ergonomic foregrip, magpul flip up front and rear sights, a Magpul 30 round mag, a black recoil pad and a nice tactical sling...I'll also throw in this plastic carrying case and  300 rounds of Federal .223
  NO, I don't want to sale the ammo by itself
     I'm not desperate, so don't waste our time with silly offers, I have alot invested in this gun and will just keep it if no one wants it....but it is a quality gun....If you want or need to pay less we can start taking add-ons off if you'd like to make it more affordable

No parts missing. 30rd Troy Battlemag rebuild kits available to ship today! These are exactly the same as standard Battlemags only disassembled.

Super Fast Shipping!  Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate.  All items ship via USPS priority mail.  

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.

The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits!  Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

No parts missing. 30rd Troy Battlemag rebuild kits available to ship today! These are exactly the same as standard Battlemags only disassembled.  

I accept PayPal ""gift"" payments or Postal Money Orders.
Super Fast Shipping!  Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate.  All items ship via USPS priority mail.  

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.

The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits!  Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and
interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense."

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements.

 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate.

The body is designed with a constant-curve inside dimension and a self-lubricating follower for reliable feeding.

The impact cover also allows loaded magazines to be stored long-term (over 1 year) without compromising the integrity of the feed lips. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using the impact cover or simple punch for cleaning and maintenance."

The HK MP5 A5 Semi-Automatic Rifle in .22 L.R. is manufactured exclusively by Walther under license from HK. It is the only genuine HK tactical rimfire replica available in the world.
This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It’s built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.

The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load
The .22 caliber HK MP5 A5 operates on a blowback system. The bolt holds open when the magazine empties"

With that said, I believe very few rounds have been fired through this weapon because the ejection port flange retains the majority of it's bluing. Hk's are known for their violent ejection which dents your brass and beats up the ejection port flange. This rifle was made in 1976 and was imported for SACO by H&K. The receiver has the Eagle N proof with the date code HG. The rifle comes with the factory H&K collapsing stock. A standard black fixed stock is also included. The gun is in excellent condition showing only very minor use and storage marks. The ejection port shows almost no dings or wear from firing. It has the standard rear diopter sight and the circular front post. The H&K bi-pod is included and is attached to the forearm. There is also an extra set of green furniture consisting of the pistol grip, rear fixed stock and forearm. A brown H&K leather sling is attached to the green stock set. The top carry handle with mount is also included. There are 14 magazines included in this sale. All mags are used and in various states of condition. Some are steel while others are aluminum. Also included is a six mag carrier with shoulder harness (might be a surplus BAR mag carrier). A military jump case is included in this sale.

This is chambered in .22 long rifle. It comes with box and 1-magazine. These are made by Walther, imported by Umarex and licensed by Heckler & Koch. These are excellent quality target or plinking rifles. MFG part #5780311. Check out the spec's below: 

The H&K MP5 SD offered by Umarex USA is a rimfire rifle authentic in looks, feel, and operation. This HK clone is engineered as a dedicated .22 Long Rifle. It’s built with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK MP5-style sights. The sound dampener (SD) is actually a compensator. It is attached to conceal the 16.1 inch barrel that extends the full length of the gun and compensator.

The MP5’s magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed for ease of loading with dual grips for holding the spring when loading. A 25- and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. 

Operation: 
A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK MP5 SD. When the magazine empties the bolt remains open. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. The safety switch rotates 90 degrees, as does the 9 mm MP5

This machined aluminum trigger is a direct replacement for the factory M&P centerfire pistol trigger. It can be used in conjunction with any combination of M&P internals presently available from Apex Tactical* as well as any configuration from the S&W factory.Reduces Trigger Pre-Travel and Over Travel by approximately 20%. The Center Mounted Pivoting Safety bar prevents unintended operation by creating a trigger block that will not disengage unless the shooter places their finger directly on the trigger face. The flat target style trigger causes the shooter to place their finger on the center line of the trigger and encourages trigger manipulation directly to the rear (in line with the bore axis).
The Apex Fully Machined Sear (Hard Sear)* was designed to enhance the performance of what we consider an outstanding pistol. Our modified geometry will not only improve the over-travel and sear reset characteristics, but dramatically reduce the trigger pull weight in most pistols. This sear is made from heat treated A-2 tool steel for durability and long service life."

The Remington 710 series is a modified version of the popular Remington 700 rifle, and has been manufactured by Remington Arms from 2001 to 2006 at their Manufacturing plant in Mayfield, KY. 
Based on the same frame as the Remington 700 series the Model 710 uses a centerfire bolt action cartridge with a 4 round detachable magazine and can be equipped with a bipod and sling, and comes equipped with a gray  rugged all-weather synthetic stock, and a mounted Bushnell Sharpshooter, 3-9 × 40 scope which is bore-sighted from the factory. The Remington 710 is a moderately priced rifle. With the synthetic stock and the already mounted scope, it makes a good gun for the novice shooter or hunter.
The Remington 710 has been renamed with the Remington 770. The 710 model is now discontinued.

The M3 Convertible is a no-nonsense shotgun that military and police all over the world depend on. This shotgun can be quickly changed from a fast cycling semi-auto for conventional loads to a manual pump action for low energy special purpose loads such as gas, beanbag and rubber bullet loads. For semi-auto action, merely rotate the selector ring 1/4 turn, push the forend forward and release the selector, to switch back to pump action simply reverse the procedure by pulling back after the selector ring is rotated to lock the forend to the action bars."
