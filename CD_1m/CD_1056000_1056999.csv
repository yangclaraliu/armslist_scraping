adjustable 6 position stock w/integrated pistol grip
cycles well, shoots well.

cons:
i ""chopped"" the barrel to 18.5 inchs. you can throw a diff. barrel on it if wanted but thats the length i wanted and didnt want to spend 100 more on a barrel.
its an older mossberg 500,its not new condition so dont expect it. however it is a good gun for the money.
its got a few scratchs on it
the pump has a little shift left and right from the tactical kit, i mean very minimal.

Alexander Arms® is the originator of the large-caliber, .50 Beowulf®, AR-15 style weapon concept. As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. We have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead. The .50 Beowulf® was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf® to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results. Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf® has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf® cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf® can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry. The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf® rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal."

I bought the 45w solar kit from harbor freight about two months ago for about $180, and I have had the batteries longer, I think I paid $70 each a while back. 

This system is very portable but heavy. If you separate it from the box, it is very easy to take camping or whatever to have lights and if you use an inverter like you plug into your cars cigarette lighter, you can run small appliances and charge cell phones, etc.  The way it is mounted on the box, I have it hinged so you can change the angle of the panels through the day, and turn the box (which is on casters) to follow the sun for maximum charge.

Shoots 308 Win. and 7.62x51 NATO. Easily used as battle rifle, sniper rifle and/or for hunting just depends on what you want. Want to trade for AR-15 for wife to shoot but will consider other offers.

We all know CA has the strictest laws and what they are proposing is flat out ridiculous!
We all know the US and the internet is all completely out of AR Lower Receivers and back orders are 6-12 months long. Also, complete built new or used AR-15s are ridiculous in price so why not buy a lower and complete the rest when prices are normal.
The Reason why the price is at a premium: I've been looking for an AR Lower for a month and a half now, I've spent countless hours trying to locate one and I actually had to camp out 10+ hours to get it. I bought 2 (1 to keep and 1 to sell). I also know FFLs around the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 for the background check. This is also a real machined lower, not a polymer one.

My preferred calibers are .380ACP, .40S&W, and .45ACP. I do like the P64, Tokarev, Makarov, etc, but will not pay inflated prices. I also enjoy 1911's, M&P's, etc. Bottom line is, I want an affordable one. I could pay cash or I do have some rifles and handguns I could use as trade. Send me an email with what you have. Thanks!"

This is the market, nothing else. Obama has stated publicly that he is making this a priority for the first quarter of this year. Once anything gets underway, the stock that is out there is all that will remain as they will not be manufactured or imported any longer. Get them while you can, I know I did...and paid for it being late to the party. Now I have done the legwork and have a few too many.

Check out the new state legislation going through.  Go to Magpul's facebook as well, they are VERY concerned about their future here in CO.  Come and get them before I convince myself to hold onto them!!

From RGuns:

Complete with charging handle and bolt carrier group. Features a air gauged, MP tested, 16"" 4150 Steel Chrome-Moly Barrel w/ 1:9"" Rifling and a true 5.56mm military chamber.

The custom machined match barrels used in RGUNS rifles and uppers are made from 4150 chrome-moly vanadium steel manufactured in the USA. Each 5.56 NATO/.223 barrel is properly head spaced with an M4 feed ramp extension installed.

Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and muzzle threaded 1/2-28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion when the barrel heats up, and hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life.

Each barrel has an eleven degree crown, polished chamber and lapped bore, as well as a pulled-button rifling, producing a superbly accurate bore diameter with uniform rate of twist. Fluted models feature unique fluting designs to improve rigidity and aid in barrel cooling.

I have plenty of additional pictures, so just ask if you would like some more."

It also includes 1 15 round mag and 1 30 round mag.   I purchased it and a P89 at the same time.  I have enjoyed the P89 and just never got around to using the P94 which is almost an Identical gun.  The P94 is a little smaller and thinner but you could beat someone to death with either one if you ran out of bullets.  Both guns are all metal with a beautiful finish, not like the newer plastic guns.  The gun has a de-cocker so you don't have to worry about letting the hammer down if you have cocked it and did not fire it.  All you have to do is press the de-cocker lever and the hammer goes down safely without any effort.  This gun has been used by many law enforcement agencies because of the reliability and durability.  All I can say is it is a great gun and one that you can depend on and be proud of.

     It is double action with an easy to use safety so you can keep a round in the chamber and fire it by just pulling the trigger or cocking the large hammer back and then firing.

    It is a great gun and worth much more than I am asking for it.  You must see it to appreciate it.  I can email more pictures if you request them."
