These BLACK Teflon 30 round magazines are considered some of the BEST AR15, M4, M16 magazines made.  They have the Magpul Enhanced Followers and the silicone coated heavy springs.

These magazines are not only manufactured for the government, but are de-branded Colt, Bravo Company, PSA factory mags

Yes the price is more than normal but it's cheaper than driving to a gun show paying to get in and then paying local taxes for something of lesser quality or spending hours looking on line hoping to find something in stock.  So here's your chance to have something shipped within 24 hours of purchase and a guarantee to beat the pending magazine restriction that is coming

Pistol caliburs:

9mm x 1,000 + pcs once fired brass cases

30/30 x 3 30/30 20rd ammo boxes ( 1 Win. , 1 Fed. , 1 Rem. )

.243 x 5 .243 20rd ammo boxes ( 3 Rem. , 2 Fed. )


This lot of brass has a lot of the main caliburs that is in high demand and hard to get a hold of right now, And is used on a daily bases by a lot of you guys out there...

I am asking $500 for the whole lot together, Please do not ask me to seporate it just because you only want one or two calibur sizes out of it...

And please do not try to lowball me as I know what the different calibur brass is going for, And I am selling it below what it would actually cost to replace it, So my price is set at a fare price for all of it together...

So it must all go at once to get it out of my way for some remodeling that I am getting ready to do, You can keep what you want or need out of the lot, And sell off what you do not want or need, As there is always some one looking for brass to reload...

I will consider trade/trades and partial trades with cash, So just let me know what you have and we can go from there, The worst that I can say is no thank you...

Also these items are to be picked up in person, Payment to be made in cash or trade only, And in person by the buying party, I do not take checks, bank transfers, or money orders, Nor will I give out any of my banking or personal information for online money transfers..."

One point the NRA failed to make which I think bears making is that with so called ""universal background checks"" the government can stop all gun sales nationwide at will simply by taking NICS offline. Do you trust the Obama administration with that power? I don't. Local governments have already halted gun sales during periods of civil unrest and after Katrina even used the National Guard and police to confiscate them. I do not believe the Obama administration would hesitate to do anything in it's power to halt gun sales if given the slightest excuse.

LNIB  Sig P245 is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses a typical Browning-style cam operated barrel, which locks into the ejection window in the slide. The slide is made from stamped steel, and has a separate breech block held within the slide by the cross-pin. The frame is made from aluminum. The trigger is double action, with external hammer and a decocking lever on the left side of the frame. There's no manual safety, but P245 is provided with automatic firing pin safety."

508,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1102508,For Sale:  Overpriced Firearms,"south, Alabama, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 19, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"I've read a number of these angry postings on here where people are aggravated that Other people are trying to sell overpriced guns. This isn't always a bad thing. While I want to be quick to say I have neither listed or sold an overpriced gun on Armslist, I do believe these overpriced guns and ammo call attention to the need to stay armed and well stocked with ammo. If you were of age to buy an ""assault"" weapon during the Clinton administration and didn't ( but you meant to ), and just kept putting it off. These people need an incentive to buy an AR, AK or the weapon of their dreams.

If the ""assault"" rifles all dropped in price today, you would have a bunch of people that would decide to wait to get one. And the way it looks to me, every ""assault"" rifle sold gives me a better chance of keeping mine. If you don't HAVE ONE you might not be as concerned about others keeping theirs. We all need to be of one mind in this current gun grab attempt, and that is come hell or high water we are going to KEEP our rifles.

For some reason, when I see an AK priced at $1200.00, it just doesn't make me that mad. Why? Well because I won't buy it. I see overpriced cars on craigslist, I see overpriced steaks at the grocery, and lord help me if I have to buy medicine anywhere but Walmart. This is still America and the same constitution I believe in allows these fellows to ASK any price they want. 

And as far as reporting ANY gunowner for ANYTHING short of murder......well I just have to pause and give that a lot of consideration. I keep remembering the stories out of WWII of the German children that had been schooled by the government to report their families for infractions of the rules. Any person that is a gun owner is a friend of mine. I might not know your name or where you live, but I might need to borrow a few rounds one day or maybe loan you a few. So I guess if these boys want to sell a $3000.00 AR that walmart gets $600.00 for, I'm just going to read the ad, be proud I didn't have to spend that much on mine and let it blow past me. And if you NEED to be mad at someone, that fella that ""stays"" in the Whitehouse should be enough to work off All your mad."

Direct barrel-slide locking system design delivers a low barrel axis that reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise. Its stainless steel barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance, a great choice for a concealed gun kept close to active, perspiring bodies. The PX4 Storm's durable frame includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating provides superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. White 3-dot sights provide quick acquisition of the target. Weight: 26.1 oz. Capacity: 13+1 rounds.

Extremely low round count, stainless steel barreled Noveske in 14.5"" Afghan beadblasted with a KG Gun-Kote black finish. This is a factory rifle, not an aftermarket build. At $2850, it represents exactly what it cost before the election, and the panic. 

Let's go through what this would cost if you could actually get one right now [go ahead and click on the two links to confirm]: 
Noveske Left Handed 14.5"" Afghan Stainless Steel - http://lefthandrifles.com/cgi-bin/imcart/display.cgi?item_id=rifle14&cat=4&page=1&search=&since=&status=&title=

Optional Upgrades at bottom of page - Norgon Ambi-catch, KG Gun Kote, and Geissele SSA trigger  - http://lefthandrifles.com/cgi-bin/imcart/display.cgi?cat=4

RIFLE - $2485 

GEISSELE SSA TRIGGER - $160 
Geissele Non-adjustable SSA Trigger. We will install this on your rifle if you add this upgrade to your order. 
This upgrade is only available with the purchase of a new rifle. 

NORGON AMBI-CATCH MAG RELEASE - $90 
Norgon Ambi-Catch Mag Release - upgrade for complete rifle. Allows ambidextrous magazine release manipulation. 

KG BARREL COATING - $65 
This UPGRADE is for the barrel only in a rifle or upper. Colors available are Black and FDE. 
KG Industries Gun-Kote is a thin hard coating that will give excellent abrasion resistance, exceptional heat dissapation and corrosion protection. 
This option is available with the purchase of a rifle or upper. 

SOG armory graphite VFG - $50 

Finally, my rifle comes with the VLTOR EMod stock, not the less expensive IMod, and an ambidextrous safety versus the lefty safety. 

That's $2850, and Noveske doesn't discount it because they are the only source for their lefty rifles. This price is unchanged from before the election.

My price is $2850, FTF in Houston, or add $40 shipped to your FFL, $70 if FFL is needed on my end (I'm sorry about that, but local dealers charge a ton for transfers).
