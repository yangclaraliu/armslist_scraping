    Up for sale is our family camper and boat. We are offering these as a combo deal. 
The camper;
It's a 1983 23ft Winnebago Brave Class A Motorhome. It comes with a Chevy 454 engine that has only 70,000 miles on it and runs great. It has new tires on it that only have 5500 miles on them. the inside is clean and everything works. The appliances were replace within that last 2 years. The stove is gas/LP, the roof mounted A/C / Heater unit works off Gas/LP or electric (plug in or generator) The Refrigerator is either Gas/LP, AC or DC and also works great. It comes with an Onan Generator that will run everything. The camper sleeps 5 people (2 in the full bed in the rear, 2 on the fold down table, and one in the pull down bed over the drivers/passenger seats) The camper is fully self contained with Water, Grey water, and Waste tanks. It has a full rear bathroom, tub/shower, sink, and toilet. We drove it to California last summer without any problems. I will throw in a newer Garmin GPS into the deal as well. 
The Boat;
It's a 1976 Tri-Hull boat. It seats four in the main area and 3-4 on the bow. It has a 40HP outboard motor which is great for tooling around the various lakes and reservoirs. It sits on a newer fully adjustable Magic Tilt Trailer. The boat has drivers controls with a key start. It comes with a very nice Fish Finder as well. It also has a fold down sun cover that covers the main passenger section of the boat. 
Both the Camper and boat are in very good shape for their age and will bring many, many more years of service to you. We are asking $7000 for the package deal or Best Reasonable Offers! My name is Mike...if interested you can either call or e-mail. My number is Eight-Five-Zero -420-Four-Five Zero Nine! Thanks for looking. More pics available on demand!"

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

**INFO FROM ARMALITE**
Tactical Flexibility was the innovative force behind the development of the AR-10A4 Special Purpose Rifle line.  Whether the rifle application dictates the need for iron sights, red dot or magnified scope, the SPR line is the efficient platform for all sighting options without sacrificing durability or accuracy.

And accuracy is the point, isn't it?  At ArmaLite, we believe it is, so we build all our A4 and A2 rifles with nothing less than a double-lapped barrel for accuracy and chrome line it for corrosion resistance.  In the Era of AR Innovation, we will not be outdone.

There are exactly 50 rounds on the barrel.  Its trigger is about 2.5-3 lbs.  Condition wise it is very good.  The bolt is brand new, and the barrle has a few knicks on the stainless metal but other than thst it only has 50 rounds on the barrel its not even broken in.  The reciever on it is anold donor reciever, its in fine condition but used obviously.   The rest of the parts are brand spanking new.  The barrel is the carbon fiber Volquartsen, id argue its the best barrelon the market ready for your suppressor.  The bolt is a scalloped KIDD black bolt, it has 50 rounds on it.   the charging handle is rimfire tech, and all the internals are volquartsen or kidd.   The stock is a Rhineland arms leopard stock which is a clone of the AICS stock.  its retty boss.  This rifle is more accurate than you are :).  Do your part and it will do its part.

Pre-2008 production.

If you buy ammo produced now in the current shortage, they are running production so fast that reliability and consistency is compromised.  Just like anything else.  What you want is production lines running at a nice comfortable pace.

This means - if you can find ammo made before the current shortage, especially pre-2008, your quality will be higher.

Gun is brand new, chambered for 5.56 will shoot .223, purchased locally, comes with case, brochures, transferable lifetime warranty and one 30 round black teflon coated black metal magazine. 

, I have a Windham Weaponry AR-15, never fired in factory hard case with factory paperwork. It came with a transferable lifetime warranty. It is completely mil-spec except for the commercial buffer tube which is a good thing if you like to change out parts and accessories. I bought it before the big vote on the gun laws just in case but I already have another Windham AR's so I'm now looking to trade it or sell it.

Windham Weaponry is the same company/employees/factory building that made the bushmaster AR's for decades prior to the name being bought by Remington. This is why all Bushmasters say ""made in Windham, Maine"" on the lower receiver. They have the most experience in the industry and and reputation equal to Colt too. I listed it as Bushmaster because the menu didn't have an option for Windham Weaponry

This is the M4A3 model which is exactly the military flat top version except for the fact that it does not have the 14.5"" barrel but instead a 16"" barrel due to the laws for civilian rifles.

It also comes with the rear sight cover that has a rail on it, so that you can mount a scope.

In case you were wondering about the paint, I have painted it similar to the weapons I used in overseas combat in iraq. I served as a medic for a scout/sniper reconplatoon the paint on the weapons serves two main purposes. 1) an all black weapon allows someone to use the black weapon slung across your body as a perfect measurement reference for range estimation. 2) basic camouflage purposes, a painted weapon blends better in the environment, essentially makes it harder for the enemy to acquire you in their optic as a potential target.

This is a very high quality upper built by the pioneers of the now famous SOCOM line. It shoots a variety of rounds from 300-600 grains out of your regular AR lower using any of your 5.56 mags. No special mags, buffer assembly, or buffer spring required like other large bore calibers. This upper has a stainless target crowned barrel and a stainless BCG. The upper was also purchased with a set of factory matched dies that loaded the test ammo used to tune it before it left Tromix. 
Parts included:
-complete Tromix upper with BCG
-1 extra bolt
-factory die set
-(100)new never fired brass
-(50) 325 grain polymer tipped Hornady bullets
-2 boxes of new Core-Bon 400 gr ammo 
-extra fixed sight/gas block (originally equipped)
-1 30 round PMAG with matching camo

The camo is plasti-coat and cleared with matte clear coat. It is new and unscratched, but it does not have the durability of powder coat, so it will scratch. This was a hunting rifle, not a range queen. Aprox 400 rounds have been fired through it. I will consider trades, full or partial, for a nice tactical 12 gauge. KelTech KSG, Saiga, etc...or maybe pistols, or $1500 cash. Thanks for looking, I can send plenty more pics, just give me an email."

I've put approximately 1000 rounds through it and have NEVER had so much as a mis-feed. I'm selling this because my primary use for guns is self defense and I'd like to downsize a little bit. Great for most concealed carry situations but I'm replacing it with a Kahr PM40 which fits my needs a little better. Awesome little gun and I'm going to be a bit teary eyed to see it go but if it means someone else gets to enjoy this gun at a $100 discount from what you'd pay new, I can let it go easier. I travel north to the Marshfield/Eau Claire areas often so anywhere between Milwaukee and there I can deliver. Price is firm but see trades below. I'd prefer to work with someone with a CCW but if you send me a scan of your driver's license so I can see your DOB and license number that would be fine (I encourage you to black out your address, not your name though). Also I'm going to have you sign a statement saying that you took control of the firearm on such and such a date."

From what I understand, the barrel was pressed part way into the receiver and it was oversized. It will need to be pressed out of the receiver and turned down.

The receiver, when available, sold for $350. It is made in the Czech Republic and is superior to the currently available U.S. made receivers. The parts kits available now are selling for around $300. I realize there is a little extra work involved in pressing the barrel out, so my trade value for this set is $550-$600.

This will require machine and rifle building skills to complete. Please do not buy this if you have not built a rifle before.

All the parts required to build a complete rifle are included. To complete the rifle, you will need to:
-Press barrel out, turn down, press back in. Drill and press barrel pin.
-Rivet trigger guard in.
-Modify trigger group or buy a new semi U.S. group.
-Permanantly attach the included muzzle brake to bring the length to the legal requirement.
-Paint
