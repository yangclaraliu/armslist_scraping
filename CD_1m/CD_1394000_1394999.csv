Very disappointing to me, and at $400 I'm loosing money on a like new gun."

I'm not an expert on Lugers at all, and I bought it as a shooter, which it does quite well. I've had an expert look at it at a gun show, and he told me it had been reblued in Germany a long time ago, the first tit on the rear sight was broken, which is most common on these guns, and it was a good $1000 shooter, but wasn't a collector's piece. This inspection took all of 10 minutes, and how  he came to these conclusions I have no idea. So if you want a nice Luger to shoot and also one that could be worth a lot more money, this is it."

Got several items for sale, so bear with me.

First up is my new AR15. It's been test fired a few times in order to check that it can cycle steel cased ammunition and brass cased ammunition. It has a 16"" barrel with a carbine length gas system.  

Specs:
Palmetto State Armory 16"" upper, barrel is chrome moly vanadium chrome lined. M4 chamber/feedramps, magnesium phosphated to the standard black color. A2 flash hider, fixed front sight block with tritium front sight post (glows in the dark!). Magpul MOE flat dark earth carbine length handguards. T-marked upper receiver. Bolt and carrier are Colt manufacture, charging handle is standard charging handle but unknown manufacture. Rear sight is a Troy Battlesight flip-up BUIS diopter with tritium in flat dark earth to match furniture.

Lower is built on a GAR Arms (Local to Las Cruces, NM) forged aluminum lower receiver. Lower parts kit is a Palmetto State Armory parts kit with Magpul MOE stock, MOE+ grip (I believe) and trigger guard in flat dark earth with standard selector and trigger. 

On top of the rifle sits an Elcan SpecterDR 1-4x gunsight. This is a top of the line gunsight, and it really shows. It doesn't have traditional magnification; instead, changing your magnification from 1x to 4x is done by flipping a throw lever. It has small iron sights sitting on top. The reticle is etched into the glass and has a ballistic drop compensator built in. Illumination goes two ways, adjust one way and it illuminates a 1.5MOA dot, adjust the other way and the entire reticle is illuminated. Very night gunsight, has been mounted but not zeroed yet.

I am asking $4300 for the rifle, that will include a couple 30rd magazines, an aftermarket trigger (Geissele SD3G trigger, used for competition shooting), original grips and front post, and a SIRT training bolt (replaces regular bolt and charging handle and allows the operator to practice trigger discipline, snap shooting, etc. by emitting a green laser every time trigger is pulled). This rifle is truly badass.

Next is an FN FS2000, bought in 2010 and has 500 rounds through it. It has both the smooth foregrip and the railed FN foregrip. This bullpup rifle is pretty badass and fits a full length barrel into a relatively compact space. Flattop with Magpul MBUS flip up sights.

 Asking $2500 for the rifle+ things that came with the rifle, for an extra $250 I can throw in an Eotech holographic sight that was zeroed with this rifle. 

Next up is a Gen 3 Glock 26 with brand-new Meprolight night sights. These are bright as HELL, and you can literally see the gun across the room at night. It has roughly 75 rounds down the pipe and comes with two 10rd magazines, box, lock, etc. Comes with a 3.5lb Ghost Rocket trigger bar and Glock factory extended slide release installed. 

Asking $625 for the Glock. 

Lastly, I can part with some ammo if I am made a good enough offer. I have:

130rds Winchester military-issue (green hull, blacked out rim) 12GA 00 buckshot. This stuff shoots about 9 00 pellets at a ridiculous ~1325 FPS (or something like that.) I am asking $175 for this lot of ammunition (it's all in 5rd nondescript cardboard boxes from the factory.)

400rds Winchester White Box 115gr 9mm FMJ. (brass cased/reloadable.) Asking $175 for this lot.

100rds Winchester White Box 230gr. 45ACP FMJ (brass cased, reloadable). Asking $60 for this lot.

50 rds PMC Bronze 230gr. brass cased .45ACP. Asking $30 for this.

4 boxes Speer Lawman TMJ .40SW TMJ. This is about 250 rounds,  brass cased and reloadable. Asking $100 for this lot.

Finally, if you want to take EVERYTHING in this lot, I will accept $7500 cash for the entire thing. This will include delivery to anywhere in the state of New Mexico. By making an offer you are relinquishing me of any and all liability for anything once the ammunition and/or firearm changes hands from me to you. By making an offer you also state that you are a New Mexico resident, United States citizen, and that there is nothing that would prevent you from legally possessing these items (domestic abuse conviction, drug charges, mental illness, felony convictions). If you want, I will write a bill of sale and would prefer to see New Mexico ID of some sort- Identification card, driver's license, or New Mexico Concealed Handgun License at the time of our transaction.

Thanks for looking, more pictures will be available upon request. If you don't like my prices, then make an offer- all I can say is no.

I am not taking trades, but I will say that the only thing I'm currently interested in is a Benelli semi-auto shotgun. 

I will be at the gun show in Alamogordo on Saturday, April 6 at 9am. I will be wearing a  plain gray shirt with ""ASK ME ABOUT MY STUFF FOR SALE!"" written on it. It would be easiest to make a deal there, but I can be reached through this ad as well."

Got several items for sale, so bear with me.

First up is my new AR15. It's been test fired a few times in order to check that it can cycle steel cased ammunition and brass cased ammunition. It has a 16"" barrel with a carbine length gas system.  

Specs:
Palmetto State Armory 16"" upper, barrel is chrome moly vanadium chrome lined. M4 chamber/feedramps, magnesium phosphated to the standard black color. A2 flash hider, fixed front sight block with tritium front sight post (glows in the dark!). Magpul MOE flat dark earth carbine length handguards. T-marked upper receiver. Bolt and carrier are Colt manufacture, charging handle is standard charging handle but unknown manufacture. Rear sight is a Troy Battlesight flip-up BUIS diopter with tritium in flat dark earth to match furniture.

Lower is built on a GAR Arms (Local to Las Cruces, NM) forged aluminum lower receiver. Lower parts kit is a Palmetto State Armory parts kit with Magpul MOE stock, MOE+ grip (I believe) and trigger guard in flat dark earth with standard selector and trigger. 

On top of the rifle sits an Elcan SpecterDR 1-4x gunsight. This is a top of the line gunsight, and it really shows. It doesn't have traditional magnification; instead, changing your magnification from 1x to 4x is done by flipping a throw lever. It has small iron sights sitting on top. The reticle is etched into the glass and has a ballistic drop compensator built in. Illumination goes two ways, adjust one way and it illuminates a 1.5MOA dot, adjust the other way and the entire reticle is illuminated. Very night gunsight, has been mounted but not zeroed yet.

I am asking $4300 for the rifle, that will include a couple 30rd magazines, an aftermarket trigger (Geissele SD3G trigger, used for competition shooting), original grips and front post, and a SIRT training bolt (replaces regular bolt and charging handle and allows the operator to practice trigger discipline, snap shooting, etc. by emitting a green laser every time trigger is pulled). This rifle is truly badass.

Next is an FN FS2000, bought in 2010 and has 500 rounds through it. It has both the smooth foregrip and the railed FN foregrip. This bullpup rifle is pretty badass and fits a full length barrel into a relatively compact space. Flattop with Magpul MBUS flip up sights.

 Asking $2500 for the rifle+ things that came with the rifle, for an extra $250 I can throw in an Eotech holographic sight that was zeroed with this rifle. 

Next up is a Gen 3 Glock 26 with brand-new Meprolight night sights. These are bright as HELL, and you can literally see the gun across the room at night. It has roughly 75 rounds down the pipe and comes with two 10rd magazines, box, lock, etc. Comes with a 3.5lb Ghost Rocket trigger bar and Glock factory extended slide release installed. 

Asking $625 for the Glock. 

Lastly, I can part with some ammo if I am made a good enough offer. I have:

130rds Winchester military-issue (green hull, blacked out rim) 12GA 00 buckshot. This stuff shoots about 9 00 pellets at a ridiculous ~1325 FPS (or something like that.) I am asking $175 for this lot of ammunition (it's all in 5rd nondescript cardboard boxes from the factory.)

400rds Winchester White Box 115gr 9mm FMJ. (brass cased/reloadable.) Asking $175 for this lot.

100rds Winchester White Box 230gr. 45ACP FMJ (brass cased, reloadable). Asking $60 for this lot.

50 rds PMC Bronze 230gr. brass cased .45ACP. Asking $30 for this.

4 boxes Speer Lawman TMJ .40SW TMJ. This is about 250 rounds,  brass cased and reloadable. Asking $100 for this lot.

Finally, if you want to take EVERYTHING in this lot, I will accept $7500 cash for the entire thing. This will include delivery to anywhere in the state of New Mexico. By making an offer you are relinquishing me of any and all liability for anything once the ammunition and/or firearm changes hands from me to you. By making an offer you also state that you are a New Mexico resident, United States citizen, and that there is nothing that would prevent you from legally possessing these items (domestic abuse conviction, drug charges, mental illness, felony convictions). If you want, I will write a bill of sale and would prefer to see New Mexico ID of some sort- Identification card, driver's license, or New Mexico Concealed Handgun License at the time of our transaction.

Thanks for looking, more pictures will be available upon request. If you don't like my prices, then make an offer- all I can say is no.

I am not taking trades at this time, but I really want a Benelli semi-auto shotgun.

I will be at the gun show in Alamogordo on Saturday, April 6 at 9am. I will be wearing a  plain gray shirt with ""ASK ME ABOUT MY STUFF FOR SALE!"" written on it. It would be easiest to make a deal there, but I can be reached through this ad as well."

200,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1394200,"For Sale:  For Sale: New AR15 w/ new Elcan SpecterDR, FN FS2000 5.56 Bullpup rifle, Glock 26 with night sights, some ammo","New Mexico, New Mexico, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, April 4, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi. Got several items for sale, so bear with me.

First up is my new AR15. It's been test fired a few times in order to check that it can cycle steel cased ammunition and brass cased ammunition. It has a 16"" barrel with a carbine length gas system.  

Specs:
Palmetto State Armory 16"" upper, barrel is chrome moly vanadium chrome lined. M4 chamber/feedramps, magnesium phosphated to the standard black color. A2 flash hider, fixed front sight block with tritium front sight post (glows in the dark!). Magpul MOE flat dark earth carbine length handguards. T-marked upper receiver. Bolt and carrier are Colt manufacture, charging handle is standard charging handle but unknown manufacture. Rear sight is a Troy Battlesight flip-up BUIS diopter with tritium in flat dark earth to match furniture.

Lower is built on a GAR Arms (Local to Las Cruces, NM) forged aluminum lower receiver. Lower parts kit is a Palmetto State Armory parts kit with Magpul MOE stock, MOE+ grip (I believe) and trigger guard in flat dark earth with standard selector and trigger. 

On top of the rifle sits an Elcan SpecterDR 1-4x gunsight. This is a top of the line gunsight, and it really shows. It doesn't have traditional magnification; instead, changing your magnification from 1x to 4x is done by flipping a throw lever. It has small iron sights sitting on top. The reticle is etched into the glass and has a ballistic drop compensator built in. Illumination goes two ways, adjust one way and it illuminates a 1.5MOA dot, adjust the other way and the entire reticle is illuminated. Very night gunsight, has been mounted but not zeroed yet.

I am asking $4300 for the rifle, that will include a couple 30rd magazines, an aftermarket trigger (Geissele SD3G trigger, used for competition shooting), original grips and front post, and a SIRT training bolt (replaces regular bolt and charging handle and allows the operator to practice trigger discipline, snap shooting, etc. by emitting a green laser every time trigger is pulled). This rifle is truly badass.

Next is an FN FS2000, bought in 2010 and has 500 rounds through it. It has both the smooth foregrip and the railed FN foregrip. This bullpup rifle is pretty badass and fits a full length barrel into a relatively compact space. Flattop with Magpul MBUS flip up sights.

 Asking $2500 for the rifle+ things that came with the rifle, for an extra $250 I can throw in an Eotech holographic sight that was zeroed with this rifle. 

Next up is a Gen 3 Glock 26 with brand-new Meprolight night sights. These are bright as HELL, and you can literally see the gun across the room at night. It has roughly 75 rounds down the pipe and comes with two 10rd magazines, box, lock, etc. Comes with a 3.5lb Ghost Rocket trigger bar and Glock factory extended slide release installed. 

Asking $625 for the Glock.

The pistol, a full-size (“’ barreled) 1911, chambered for .45acp, has a nickel finish and genuine Ivory grips. The engraving was done by Frontier Classics in Texas, and the work is excellent, and covers about 95% of the pistol, however all of the original Springfield markings remain. The pistol may have been test-fired, but it is in truly MINT (98%) overall condition inside and out. The pistol comes with the original factory plastic box, serial-numbered to the gun, and with a factory plastic holster, mag holder, cleaning rod, and manual (no extra magazines, however). This engraved Springfield Armory 1911 looks just like an engraved Colt, the only real difference is the price, which is quite a bit less than what a similarly-engraved Colt would sell for"

The filter on the connector holds a little more than 1/3 qt of solvent
The largest for this thread holds more than a quart

I recommend punching a hole in the end of the filter and plugging with a rubber plug (not included) to allow easier draining without removal while cleaning.
Do NOT drill the hole. That will contaminate your filter. I would use a metal rod from the inside of the filter and punch it through to the outside. Usually slightly larger than the bore of the firearm to allow proper draining.

It has a traditional wood stock with grip checkering. The Barrel is 26"", free floating and blued, along with the rest of the receiver. The rifle also has a muzzle brake that is fastened to the end of the barrel. The brake is very effective due to the high recoil of the 300 RUM round. The Rifle has had about 100 rounds fired, actually a little bit less than 100. The rifling in the barrel looks pretty much perfect, the wood stock has only a couple very small scratches. 

The scope is a Nikon Buckmaster 3-9X40 with the bullet drop reticle. It is in essentially perfect condition and I will include the box and original packaging with the scope... 
The sling is a Butler Creek padded rifle sling. It is very comfortable and has loops for holding extra rounds. The Caldwell bipod is a 6""-9"" spring loaded bipod that is mounted on the front sling loop. The bipod can swivel and is also essentially brand new. The rifle will also come with a RedHead soft zippered rifle case.

-180 rounds of various 300 RUM (20 Nosler Trophy, 20 HSM Trophy, 100 Remington, 40 Double Tap)

-Padded rifle sling
-Soft rifle case
-Caldwell 6""-9"" Swivel BiPod

I am willing to sell the ammo on it's own however the rifle and it's accessories will only be sold as a package. 

Price for ammo only: $300

I prefer a in-person cash exchange, however under the right circumstances I would be willing to send it out of state through an FFL... assuming you cover the fees and pay in advance. Make me an offer...

Includes all the factory accessories like the extra grips to fit it to your hand, the holster and mag holster, speed loader, lock, action block, and two 19-rd magazines.  

Also included but not installed are two mag blocks that, in case it coes to pass that high-cap mags are banned everywhere, reduce the capacity of the factory mags to 10 rds.  Also also included are 5 SnapCaps,

Also also also included are 1500 (one thousand five hundred) rounds of 9mm ammo.  These are mostly factory brass cased FMJ, a few factory zinc plated steel cased FMJ, and 350 factory reloaded (not my or some guy's basement reloaded - an actual factory) brass cased FMJ.

I will ship to an FFL holder anywhere high-cap mags are legal.  If you're not in such an area, please don't ask me to ship to you as I don't keep track of where such things have been banned.  Local pickup in the Tampa area is fine too, with a CCWP or Transport permit and other picture ID.

Receiver came off a standard M1A. I do not recall who the rifle was built by, I bought it second hand. I do know that the individual was a US Army shooting team armorer in the 70's and 80's and this gun has several of the features used back in the day. The trigger group is all USGI and tuned to a perfect 4lb break. The gas system is unitized via the screw method. The barrel is heavy profile 1:10"" twist and is blued, I believe it's Criterion. Oprod is a Winchester, bolt is forged SA. Scope mount is a bassett high, and a Leupold VXII 3x9x40 tactical sits on it. Stock is a vintage Boyd's M21 type, but it is NOT opened up for a rear lug like most of these. It has never been bedded. For a non-bedded gun, this rifle shoots very, very well. Holds a consistent 1MOA with 168gr Sierra match kings. Function is flawless in every aspect, scope is zeroed and ready to rock and roll. Comes with an OM and BRW-S1 marked mags and sling. interested buyer to contact me for more deatails"

There is a lot of overpriced ammo right now, on this site as well as many others. Part of the reason for this is the profiteers who find ammo cheap and then want to sell it for 500 - 600% markup. 

A 500 rd box of 22 lr. for $60+ a box. ARE YOU SERIOUS. Good thing I bought 225 round boxes at WalMart yesterday for $10 a box. Yes I had to wait a few days but not that long and no it's not for sale.

It is and will come back. They will not stop making 22 LR as these profiteers want to promote. 

If you are fed up then start taking action. When you see one of these ads, hit the Flag as Over Priced link on each listing. Enough flags and they pull the listing. Make these profiteers eat this ammo by not buying it. When it's back in stores, I hope said profiteers have a ton they have bought up and have to take a loss to even get rid of it.

God Bless

And the reason the word profiteer was used so frequently? It replaced another word I was tempted to use to describe these people. :-D"

Imported during the early 1960's (older import mark  on barrel knox), it was sporterized for hunting not long after. 

Overall, this gun is in excellent shape: the original stock was cut down very neatly, and the old swivel butt mounts were well filled in. The original fore and back sights are still present, and the barrel has not been counterbored or cut down. The bore is very, very clean. 

This gun has a numbers-matching action and barrel, and the mag/bolt/backsight all have identical (but different from the action) numbers. This is typical for factory-refurbished weapons coming back from repair. Of course, it's chambered in .303 British

The screw heads throughout the gun are aligned North and South. Note the wood inletting around the long tang on the English model and the wood-to-metal fit where it joins the receiver. Note that the Elite Gold forearm has a case hardened latch to match the receiver finish. The 9-1/2” length of the forearm is helpful by encouraging you to shoot a longer left arm -- which in turn helps keep your head down on the stock. The elite Gold has “Birdgun” built into it. The balance point on the 28” model is right at the hinge pin. Ideally suited for pass shooting on duck, doves and pheasant, where the left hand doers the guidance and benefits from the momentum built up on the swing. The 26” barreled guns have a balance point closer to the right hand, making it easier for the left hand to make faster sighting adjustments on woodcock, grouse and piney woods quail. Shorter barrels are often preferred by women, who usually have less left-arm strength. The raised concave rib has a midpoint bead, a feature not usually associated with birdguns. It’s main benefit is that it provides an instant sighting que when you bring the gun to the target. If you can see both mid- and front sight stacked as an “8” -- the message to your brain in that you don’t have the gun all the way up to your shoulder and will probably shoot over the target. It works with the longer forearm. This rib tapers from 7/16” and the breech to 7/32” at the muzzle. A kind of optical illusion that makes you think you are shooting a longer barreled gun. Cast-off, about 1/4” on these guns, will help make a right-handed shooter an “intuitive” shooter. The idea is that when you bring the gun up, it is pointing where you are looking. These guns can be altered for cast-on to accommodate the needs of left-handed shooters. In addition to good, standard specifications these Elite Gold guns have: automatic ejectors, 3” chambers and chrome-lined bores. The checkered butt is designed to stay in place on your shoulder is a second shot is required. This gun has a manual safety, a useful feature to have when the doves are coming in or when you are trying to reload on the run while chasing a pheasant. But you have to remember to put the gun back on safe when you’re done. Then the world changed. Companies shed unprofitable divisions. In S&W’s case, they couldn’t make handguns fast enough, while their shotgun business languished. The market failed, not the product. And so we find ourselves with an opportunity to own a S&W Gold Elite --fully backed by S&W’s Heirloom Warranty -- for little more than half it’s original retail price."

I'll throw in 2 boxes of unused ammo. My Marlin has been shot a couple of times, but is as new as new gets. Looks and functions perfect. It's beautiful. It has a gold trigger. It has a see-through Marlin scope mount, so that the iron sites remain visible...and has a 2-6x zoom low profile scope installed, scope is a very specific design to compliment this type of lever action rifle. Gun is perfect, but I want a smaller Henry for my wife... to shoot at paper with.  Marlin in the box is 489.50 plus tax with no scope and no ammo. Mine is cheaper and comes with scope and ammo. WIll take $450.00 cash"

The answer lies mostly in ammunition. Most of the self loading shotguns in my gunsmithing shop (same in my shop)are there because they aren’t functioning properly with the ammo that the user wants to shoot (usually cheap birdshot). Some “tactical” loads like reduced recoil buckshot or the so-called “beanbag” less lethal loads will fail to cycle most semi-autos regardless of how clean or lubricated they are. Add in the possibility of a fouled or muddy gun in tough real world conditions, and the idea of being able to manually pump a tactical shotgun by flipping a switch starts to make a lot more sense.""
