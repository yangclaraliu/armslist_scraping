I have his discharge papers showing the 45 and 38 checked out to him. The 45 and M1 carbine come with extra stuff. The 38 is a S&W made for the government in October of 1943. I am selling all three for $1000, no trades.
The 45 is a Remington Rand. According to the serial no 1016319 and what I have been told it is a sand cast model. All the items that are in the picture with it were brought home at the same time except for the pair of grips on it,camo holster and the extended clip. The US holster is the one my Dad got with the gun. The rest was all my Dads personal gear issue to him. The three clips are the original clips that came with the gun.
The S&W 38 serial no is V424979 and according to that it was shipped in October of 1943. Guns without a top strap marking usually shipped per contracts with the Defense Supplies Corporation or the U.S. Maritime Commission. This would make sense as my Dad picked up the Mine Sweeper from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Washington around Christmas 1943. I know this because he shipped out on the Mine Sweeper right after he married my Mom in Puget Sound. He only had a week before he shipped out.
The M1 Carbine was issue to him at the same time. It is an Inland Division of General Motors serial no 46458. The receiver was made somewhere between October, 1941 - April, 1942. The barrel is marked 5-43. The carbine was usually assembled and tested within two or three months after the barrel date. This is a very early one and is quite rare in this shape."

Make: Smith & Wesson 

Model: The .41 Magnum Military & Police – Model 58 

Year of Manufacture: 1968-1969 

Caliber: .41 Magnum 

Action Type: Single and Double Action Swing-Out Cylinder Revolver 

Barrel Length: 4” 

Sights / Optics: The front sight is a fixed, serrated ramp pinned to the solid rib. There is a square notch rear sight milled into the top strap. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are smooth varnished wood with finger grooves. The grain is nicely bookended on the bottom of the grip panels. There are no notable marks, chips, cracks or scratches on the grips, just light handling marks. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Blue 

Finish Originality: Probably refinished. 

Bore Condition: The bore is dark and the rifling is sharp. There is no erosion in the bore. 

Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 99% of its metal finish. There is a drag mark on the cylinder and some very light handling marks and that’s about it. The finish is so good that we have questioned it ourselves, and now believe it to have been re-blued. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. The sides of the hammer and trigger have been nicely jeweled. Overall, this handgun rates in about Excellent condition. 

Mechanics: The single and double actions function correctly. This is a Square Butt, N Frame revolver with a pinned barrel and recessed cylinder. There is a .265” wide checkered service hammer that has had its sides jeweled as well as a .265” wide serrated trigger that also has been jeweled. We did not fire this handgun. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None 

Our Assessment: This is one really pretty revolver! We did some research to try to determine if it had been re-blued at the factory, but came up empty. The lower left side of the grip frame (towards the rear) is marked “ENG” which is unusual in our experience. We wonder if this is related to its being refinished? In any event, this is a .41 Magnum with fixed sights and would make a very sturdy service sidearm, if you were willing to take the chance that it might get scratched. This a very versatile revolver for shooters who are reloaders, with published loads for everything from light accurate target loads to serious self-defense loads to hunting loads. We know there are people who hold a special fondness for this caliber, and expect the successful bidder to cherish this particular Model 58."

I have his discharge papers showing the 45 and 38 checked out to him. The 45 and M1 carbine come with extra stuff. The 38 is a S&W made for the government in October of 1943. I am selling all three for $1000, no trades.
The 45 is a Remington Rand. According to the serial no 1016319 and what I have been told it is a sand cast model. All the items that are in the picture with it were brought home at the same time except for the pair of grips on it,camo holster and the extended clip. The US holster is the one my Dad got with the gun. The rest was all my Dads personal gear issue to him. The three clips are the original clips that came with the gun.
The S&W 38 serial no is V424979 and according to that it was shipped in October of 1943. Guns without a top strap marking usually shipped per contracts with the Defense Supplies Corporation or the U.S. Maritime Commission. This would make sense as my Dad picked up the Mine Sweeper from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Washington around Christmas 1943. I know this because he shipped out on the Mine Sweeper right after he married my Mom in Puget Sound. He only had a week before he shipped out.
The M1 Carbine was issue to him at the same time. It is an Inland Division of General Motors serial no 46458. The receiver was made somewhere between October, 1941 - April, 1942. The barrel is marked 5-43. The carbine was usually assembled and tested within two or three months after the barrel date. This is a very early one and is quite rare in this shape."

I have his discharge papers showing the 45 and 38 checked out to him. The 45 and M1 carbine come with extra stuff. The 38 is a S&W made for the government in October of 1943. I am selling all three for $1000, no trades.
The 45 is a Remington Rand. According to the serial no 1016319 and what I have been told it is a sand cast model. All the items that are in the picture with it were brought home at the same time except for the pair of grips on it,camo holster and the extended clip. The US holster is the one my Dad got with the gun. The rest was all my Dads personal gear issue to him. The three clips are the original clips that came with the gun.
The S&W 38 serial no is V424979 and according to that it was shipped in October of 1943. Guns without a top strap marking usually shipped per contracts with the Defense Supplies Corporation or the U.S. Maritime Commission. This would make sense as my Dad picked up the Mine Sweeper from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Washington around Christmas 1943. I know this because he shipped out on the Mine Sweeper right after he married my Mom in Puget Sound. He only had a week before he shipped out.
The M1 Carbine was issue to him at the same time. It is an Inland Division of General Motors serial no 46458. The receiver was made somewhere between October, 1941 - April, 1942. The barrel is marked 5-43. The carbine was usually assembled and tested within two or three months after the barrel date. This is a very early one and is quite rare in this shape."

I have his discharge papers showing the 45 and 38 checked out to him. The 45 and M1 carbine come with extra stuff. The 38 is a S&W made for the government in October of 1943. I am selling all three for $1000, no trades.
The 45 is a Remington Rand. According to the serial no 1016319 and what I have been told it is a sand cast model. All the items that are in the picture with it were brought home at the same time except for the pair of grips on it,camo holster and the extended clip. The US holster is the one my Dad got with the gun. The rest was all my Dads personal gear issue to him. The three clips are the original clips that came with the gun.
The S&W 38 serial no is V424979 and according to that it was shipped in October of 1943. Guns without a top strap marking usually shipped per contracts with the Defense Supplies Corporation or the U.S. Maritime Commission. This would make sense as my Dad picked up the Mine Sweeper from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Washington around Christmas 1943. I know this because he shipped out on the Mine Sweeper right after he married my Mom in Puget Sound. He only had a week before he shipped out.
The M1 Carbine was issue to him at the same time. It is an Inland Division of General Motors serial no 46458. The receiver was made somewhere between October, 1941 - April, 1942. The barrel is marked 5-43. The carbine was usually assembled and tested within two or three months after the barrel date. This is a very early one and is quite rare in this shape."

143,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1209143,For Sale:  New .308 Nickel Boron Bolt Carrier Group 350.00 + 6.00 Shipping.,"Hesperia, California, United States",$ 350,"Listed On: Thursday, March 7, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 10. 
Complete match grade .308 bolt carrier group, DPMS style.
Drop-in bolt and carrier group has a hard Nickel Boron self-lubricating surface that eliminates the need to apply oil or grease that can attract dirt, dust, unburned powder, and carbon and lead to cycling failures. Nickel Boron finish produces an exceptionally hard surface (68 Rockwell C) that’s 40% more wear resistant than chrome plating, with an ultra-low friction coefficient. Surface is actually harder than the substrate underneath and will not peel, flake, gall, or rub off.

Nickel Boron finish bolt/carrier groups have been tested to function reliably without additional lubrication up to 50,000 rounds. Reduced friction also means less heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer. Easy to clean, too - fouling brushes right off.

Before treatment, parts are shot peened for surface uniformity and magnetic particle inspected to make sure there are no hidden flaws. Gas key is hardened to USGI specs, NiBore lined to resist erosion, and comes already staked to the carrier. Complete Bolt/Carrier Group comes fully assembled and ready to drop into any DPMS styled upper receiver.

INCLUDES:
Carrier with staked key & MIL-SPEC screws

Assembled Bolt (ejector, extractor, cam bolt, firing pin etc.)

Completely assembled and ready to put in your gun!

I have his discharge papers showing the 45 and 38 checked out to him. The 45 and M1 carbine come with extra stuff. The 38 is a S&W made for the government in October of 1943. I am selling all three for $1000, no trades.
The 45 is a Remington Rand. According to the serial no 1016319 and what I have been told it is a sand cast model. All the items that are in the picture with it were brought home at the same time except for the pair of grips on it,camo holster and the extended clip. The US holster is the one my Dad got with the gun. The rest was all my Dads personal gear issue to him. The three clips are the original clips that came with the gun.
The S&W 38 serial no is V424979 and according to that it was shipped in October of 1943. Guns without a top strap marking usually shipped per contracts with the Defense Supplies Corporation or the U.S. Maritime Commission. This would make sense as my Dad picked up the Mine Sweeper from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Washington around Christmas 1943. I know this because he shipped out on the Mine Sweeper right after he married my Mom in Puget Sound. He only had a week before he shipped out.
The M1 Carbine was issue to him at the same time. It is an Inland Division of General Motors serial no 46458. The receiver was made somewhere between October, 1941 - April, 1942. The barrel is marked 5-43. The carbine was usually assembled and tested within two or three months after the barrel date. This is a very early one and is quite rare in this shape."

I have his discharge papers showing the 45 and 38 checked out to him. The 45 and M1 carbine come with extra stuff. The 38 is a S&W made for the government in October of 1943. I am selling all three for $1000, no trades.
The 45 is a Remington Rand. According to the serial no 1016319 and what I have been told it is a sand cast model. All the items that are in the picture with it were brought home at the same time except for the pair of grips on it,camo holster and the extended clip. The US holster is the one my Dad got with the gun. The rest was all my Dads personal gear issue to him. The three clips are the original clips that came with the gun.
The S&W 38 serial no is V424979 and according to that it was shipped in October of 1943. Guns without a top strap marking usually shipped per contracts with the Defense Supplies Corporation or the U.S. Maritime Commission. This would make sense as my Dad picked up the Mine Sweeper from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Washington around Christmas 1943. I know this because he shipped out on the Mine Sweeper right after he married my Mom in Puget Sound. He only had a week before he shipped out.
The M1 Carbine was issue to him at the same time. It is an Inland Division of General Motors serial no 46458. The receiver was made somewhere between October, 1941 - April, 1942. The barrel is marked 5-43. The carbine was usually assembled and tested within two or three months after the barrel date. This is a very early one and is quite rare in this shape."

Additional Info:
The Lee Auto-Disk Powder Measure automatically dispense charges more uniformly than any other powder measure. The case itself actuates the measure as the neck is being flared. The measure is actuated during the presses maximum mechanical advantage. This assures the smooth, even action of the measure. Built-in baffle and precisely molded, glass reinforced charge disks contribute to the charge uniformity. Four disks included, with 6 cavities per disk for a total of 24 cavities.

Also included is a chart that lists capacity of each cavity with each type of powder. Lee says you can reduce listed charge capacity 10% and safely use data without test weighing charge. For safety, MidwayUSA does not endorse this. This measure is activated as the case neck is being flared and measures powder ranging from 2.7-14.4 grains of Unique and 4.0-21.1 grains of IMR 4064. This powder measure can be used with Lee Rifle Charging Die or Pistol Powder Through Expanding Die

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are one piece wood. The panels have thinned, especially at the edges and darkened from age. No cartouches can be seen and the grips have likely been sanded.

14.7 inch 

The new M6-SL is a replacement of our base model M6 rifle of old. The SL, which stands for 'stretch-lightweight', incoroprates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifle. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date. 

The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. 

The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight. 

The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated Advanced Combat Bolt, one piece EXO coated carrier, and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a Daniel Defense A1.5 fixed rear sight and a fixed A2 front sight post. 

The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price.

I am asking $3,800 or best offer. It has the Chevrolet Vortech 5.7L V-8 (350) I have had this truck for a little over two years and has been the most dependable vehicle I've ever owned. It has exactly 226,482 miles on it but that is subject to change since it is my daily driver. I've been working out of town more and more and I am just looking for something better on gas, though for a 350 it does fairly well, getting roughly 15 mpg city 18mpg hwy.

Here is a list of all parts I have replaced that I can recall: power steering gear box, high pressure line assembly for the power steering, tie rods, brake pads(last month), starter, water pump, distributor and rotor plate, fuel pump assembly, and both catalytic converters.

It has nothing wrong with it that I am aware of other than it taking a moment for it to crank. It starts fine, you just have to turn the ignition for a moment. It has an older battery in it that will need to be replaced before this winter since the cranking amps have dropped, causing the delay in starting up.

I put on two new rear tires rated for 35,000miles on January 3rd of this year and changed the oil less than 500 miles ago.

As much as I hate to get rid of it this truck is ready for it's new home. I am open to possible trades for a newer model 4 door car that gets around 25mpg or more and has less than 160,000 miles on it. Will also accept cash and partial trade on remington 870's or mossberg 500-590 pump action shotguns. So just let me know what you have. My cash price is somewhat negotiable so just shoot me an offer. The worst I can do is say no.

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases  serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient.

.............................................................................
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. 

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7 - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

Features:
-The slings are 1.5 inch wide light-weight polypropylene with a 900 lb breaking strength. 
-Polypropylene does not stain, absorb water or stretch when wet & it's mildew resistant.
-The front mounting has a 1.0 inch wide strap (600 lb break strength) to fit the SKS sling eyelet. 
-The rear mounting has a band attachment for the 6 position stock similar to other 3 point slings.
-The mounting points are silent with no metal to metal attachment.

STG 44 in 22 lr with 25 round magazine. It is all metal and wood made in Germany by GSG (Only thing Poly is the mag on this gun). The StG 44 is a full weight, almost exact replica of the original 8×33 Kurz rifle that is said to be the predecessor to the Kalashnikov AK47, as well as all of the other assault rifles spanning the decades after WWII. It comes in the Amish handmade wooden crate you see here in the pictures.  As a collector’s item, the original StG 44 is out of the reach of most American collectors, in part because the original was select fire and therefore banned from import by the 1986 machinegun law. In semi-auto .22LR rimfire, not only can you own a gun with the original look and feel of the real StG 44, you will be able to shoot it cheaply, and it will itself be a big collector’s item as we go down the road.

Someone did an excellent job of polishing and plating and the finish looks to be an easy 98%. The only thing they seem to have missed was the “dummy scratch”. Luckily the gun is from before they were required to have serial numbers. Then they plated everything down to the grip screws and the two tone lanyard loop magazine. For contrast the hammer and thumb safety are gold plated. The bore is excellent and the grips look like an excellent quality reproduction of the double diamond Colt grips. The plating is in super shape and has no bubbles or pealing. This is a nice shooter Colt with a little bit of flash."

From H&K:
A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.
Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. 
The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.
During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

Key Features:
 •Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates
 •MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories
 • Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
 •Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

I think the gun store might keep your transfer fee if you fail the check but I am not sure.

The Glock 30 in the legendary .45 caliber offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of a genuine big bore caliber. The smooth design and the simple operation of this Glock pistol allow a quick draw. Because of these advantages and especially because of its compact dimensions, the Glock 30 is the first choice of plainclothes officers and protection personnel. 

I have a Glock G30 45ACP with 2ea 10 round mags, mag loader, original hard case, lock and keys, cleaning brush, test shell and all papers that comes with it. Basically this gun is new, I purchase it last month and only two people fired this gun, me and the dealer. Test shell is sealed in enveloped and stamp with the date the dealer test shot the gun. It is a good size carry weapon with a knockout power.

I purchased this new less than one month ago and it has only been out of the box to check its condition. I also fitted one of the grip extenders onto the back to see how it changed the firearm's profile, but once again, this handgun has never been fired. Everything is sealed in its original packaging (aside from the grip extenders, as I obviously had to open the package to try one) and there is not a single scratch or blemish on anything. 

The reason I purchased this was to have access to a 9mm handgun to teach my girlfriend how to shoot with, since the ammunition was considerably cheaper up until a couple of months ago. Now I can't even afford to shoot what little 9mm ammo I can find, so there isn't any real reason for me to keep this. 

One quick note on the price: yes, it is high, and no, I am not price-gouging. I purchased this handgun new for far more than I should have paid, and I am simply trying to recoup my losses as I am not planning to keep the gun. I am willing to discuss a lower price, but I am not willing to get any less than I paid for it. If it isn't worth it for me to sell, I will simply keep the firearm.

The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.

 good first: tires, brakes, new custom headliner, magna flow dual exhaust with crossover and stainless steel tips, sounds great, real Cragar s/s chrome mags, some interior refinished, vinyl tonneau cover, tinted windows, edelbrock carb and intake, all new air conditioning that works great, not r-134. Custom taillight covers, led dome light in original housing, rear view mirror with map lights, MSD ignition, Chrome and billet aluminum engine dress up, new front shocks, air shocks in rear, some new weather stripping, trailer hitch, extra parts and original stuff. Has turbo 350 transmission newly rebuilt with a shift kit, shifts perfect and strong. 

bad: body needs paint, look good from a distance, interior needs finishing, some rust in floor rear

I have the original rally wheels, they are in VERY good condition with 95% good tread tires, choice of the cragars or rally wheels

It is just as described, I could get in it today and drive it anywhere, except for the icy roads. It need to be restored if you want it really nice, as I have been working on it I always kept it running. One thing I did not mention in the ad was that it has a new master cylinder and brake booster. The tailgate is the worst metal and I have another one to replace that. 

I have a GM crate engine 350 c.i. 4-bolt main, street performance Summet cam, VERY VERY much like new, not totally assembled, just needs the heads cleaned and a new waterpump. It has a new oil pump and seals. It is a 1992. The 305 has always ran so good that I have not been in a hurry to finish it. It has a polished intake. It is now on an engine stand. I would need at least $600. If purchased with Elcamino I will drop the price some.
