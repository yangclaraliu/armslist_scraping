TangoDown LLC's new vertical grip features the next generation of life-saving utility and strength. Designed to fit any Mil-Std 1913 rail, this product can withstand punishing abuse mounted on weapon systems from the M4 Carbine to the Mk. 48 SAW.
Vertical fore grips are often called upon to mount pressure switches for lasers and tactical lights. In the past, Velcro or adhesive tape were less- than satisfactory methods of securing the pressure switch to the grip. Heat, rapid movement and heavy gloves often rip the switch loose with obvious consequences. The Tango grip features a novel pocket that appears when needed, to positively mount pressure switches without movement or damage. Just remove the threaded end cap, slide out the filler panel and place inside the grip for storage. Just replace the panel with your pressure switch and replace the end cap to lock the switch in place. Quick and easy, allowing fast mount and dismount of lights and lasers.
The Tango grip has internal storage to spare, for spare weapon bolt assemblies, extra batteries, medical supplies or any other mission specific items. The threaded end cap has a large diameter O-ring to protect its contents to 66 feet. 

Storage compartment will hold three CR123 batteries.

TangoDown LLC's new vertical grip features the next generation of life-saving utility and strength. Designed to fit any Mil-Std 1913 rail, this product can withstand punishing abuse mounted on weapon systems from the M4 Carbine to the Mk. 48 SAW.
Vertical fore grips are often called upon to mount pressure switches for lasers and tactical lights. In the past, Velcro or adhesive tape were less- than satisfactory methods of securing the pressure switch to the grip. Heat, rapid movement and heavy gloves often rip the switch loose with obvious consequences. The Tango grip features a novel pocket that appears when needed, to positively mount pressure switches without movement or damage. Just remove the threaded end cap, slide out the filler panel and place inside the grip for storage. Just replace the panel with your pressure switch and replace the end cap to lock the switch in place. Quick and easy, allowing fast mount and dismount of lights and lasers.
The Tango grip has internal storage to spare, for spare weapon bolt assemblies, extra batteries, medical supplies or any other mission specific items. The threaded end cap has a large diameter O-ring to protect its contents to 66 feet. 

Storage compartment will hold three CR123 batteries.

I am asking for $200. I feel the price is quite fair given that the light has seen maybe 3 minutes of use, and that it has an upgraded lamp and mount.

Looks and works like brand new, was mounted for about 250 rounds (performed amazing, mount is good to go as well). I stripped one of my AR's down to just iron sights, only reason Im selling. $60 with mount cash price.

3. Magpul MBUS sights, black. The front is new in the package, the rear was used in conjunction with the red dot listed above. I looks and works like new. These are the weapons grade/Made in USA products, not the airsoft version. $45 for the set."

I have for sale my custom built AR-15. I hate to sell it but I lost my job and can't really justify it since I don't get enough range time. It has maybe 1000 rounds through it. All Magpul parts are FDE. Included in the sale will be an Allen rifle bag, Magpul MS2 sling and 3 PMAGs. A parts list is below:
* Del-Ton Industries lower
* PSA  16"" mid-length upper (1:7 twist, light profile, chrome-lined barrel, F-marked FSB)
* PSA LPK/buffer tube (Mil spec buffer tube)
* BCM BCG
* BCM Gunfighter Mod 5
* Magpul MIAD
* Magpul rear MBUS
* Magpul CTR stock with Magpul Enhanced butt pad
* UTG drop-in quad rail (standard forearm will also be included with sale if desired)
I estimate that there's about $1100 into the build so far, and feel that $800 is a fair price. That being said, please feel free to make an offer, the worst I can do is say no. The sights were zeroed at 25 yards and it's a good zero to hit a torso-sized steel target  at 100 yards every time.

The p250 is a modular gun, the trigger assemblies can be removed and placed into different size frames and/or calibers very easily.
They are DA only and very accurate. I bought the compact model used with low round count from local gun shop and I have put about 100 rounds through it, no issues, very smooth and accurate.
I then bought the subcompact X change kit from Sig Sauer and I have never shot it.
They both have the factory Siglite night sights and the factory Nitron finish.
You get the p250 compact model and the subcompact model, one trigger assembly, four 13 round magazines, one 10 round magazine, two X grip mag sleeves (so you can use the 13 round mags in the subcompact frame), and a Foxx hybrid IWB holster for the subcompact set up, the original box and paper work for the compact model, and the original box for the sub X change kit.
No ammo included.

Date of Manufacture: 1983 

Caliber: .38 Special and .357 Magnum 

Action Type: Single and Double Action Revolver With Swing Out Cylinder 

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “Python 357 / * .357 Magnum Ctg. *”. The right side of the barrel is marked “Colt’s PT. F.A. Mfg. Co. / Hartford, Conn. U.S.A.” The flat under the crane and the crane are marked “T19819”. The left side of the frame is marked with a Rampant Colt logo. The left side of the grip frame at the top of the trigger guard is marked at the front with “VP” in a triangle and at the back with a “C”. 

Barrel Length: The vent rib barrel with full underlug is 6”. 

Sights / Optics: This revolver is mounted with a square notched rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation that is pinned to the top strap of the frame. The front sight is a serrated ramped blade pinned to the top of the rib. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are checkered walnut with gold colored Colt medallions on each side. The right grip shows two compression marks on the back surface. The left grip shows a very shallow chip in the finish at the bottom inside edge of the grip, with a slight ding in the bottom outside edge of the grip. The checkering is sharp and without flaws. The grips rate in about Fine to Excellent overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Stainless Steel 

Finish Originality: All Original 

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. There is no erosion. 

Overall Condition: This revolver retains about 98% of its finish. There is a shiny wear mark on the crane from rubbing on the frame and light scratches on the bottom of the trigger guard. The cylinder has a very light drag line. The knurling on the ejector rod and the checkering on the hammer are sharp. The screw heads all sharp. The markings are clear.

Mechanics: The lock-up on this revolver is PERFECT, with no play. The trigger is Extremely smooth in double action and crisp and light in single action. The action functions correctly. We have not fired this revolver. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: This revolver comes in the original factory box. The box has a cardboard sleeve with a dark brown finish marked “COLT” on the top with gold colored letters. The sleeve shows light surface loss on the edges with minor fraying at the corners. One end flap is torn at the fold with a tear about 1 ½” long. The box is white Styrofoam that is fitted for this revolver plus accessories. The Styrofoam is intact with only light discoloration from oil. Overall, the box and sleeve are in Fine condition. The factory label that was originally attached to one of the end flaps on the sleeve is also included. It is correctly marked for the make, model, finish, barrel length, caliber and serial number of this revolver. It is in Excellent condition. 

Our Assessment: The Colt Python was first introduced in 1955, the same year as Smith & Wesson’s M29 .44 Magnum. The now discontinued Python targeted the premium revolver market segment. Some firearm collectors and writers such as Jeff Cooper and Ian V. Hogg have described the Python as the finest production revolver ever made. If this revolver is any example, they were certainly right! The tight lockup, smooth action and heavy barrel make this a perfect choice for the competition revolver shooter. It can also be used for home protection and the Excellent condition of this revolver makes it a great gift for the man who always wanted one but never thought he could afford it. 

CA Legal or CA Private Party Transferable: This pistol CANNOT be transferred as a dealer sale in California, but CAN be sold as a Private Party Transfer (PPT) at our Simi Valley shop. All cartridge firing handguns (even C&R's and antiques) sold to a California resident must be DROS'd. This does not apply to out of state residents.

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: This revolver comes in the original factory box. The box has a cardboard sleeve with a dark brown finish marked “COLT” on the top with gold colored letters. The sleeve shows light surface loss on the edges with minor fraying at the corners. One end flap is torn at the fold with a tear about 1 ½” long. The box is white Styrofoam that is fitted for this revolver plus accessories. The Styrofoam is intact with only light discoloration from oil. Overall, the box and sleeve are in Fine condition. The factory label that was originally attached to one of the end flaps on the sleeve is also included. It is correctly marked for the make, model, finish, barrel length, caliber and serial number of this revolver. It is in Excellent condition. 

Our Assessment: The Colt Python was first introduced in 1955, the same year as Smith & Wesson’s M29 .44 Magnum. The now discontinued Python targeted the premium revolver market segment. Some firearm collectors and writers such as Jeff Cooper and Ian V. Hogg have described the Python as the finest production revolver ever made. If this revolver is any example, they were certainly right! The tight lockup, smooth action and heavy barrel make this a perfect choice for the competition revolver shooter. It can also be used for home protection and the Excellent condition of this revolver makes it a great gift for the man who always wanted one but never thought he could afford it. 

CA Legal or CA Private Party Transferable: This pistol CANNOT be transferred as a dealer sale in California, but CAN be sold as a Private Party Transfer (PPT) at our Simi Valley shop. All cartridge firing handguns (even C&R's and antiques) sold to a California resident must be DROS'd. This does not apply to out of state residents.

It Has Original Box and Nice New Versa Carry In Pants Style Holster.This is Perfect Conceal Carry Piece that you will for get your wearing. It also comes with add on pants clip perfect for inside or outside carry. I have owned several Keltecs in 380-9MM-40 Cal and they are Great Guns. Perfect as Backup or for Wife or Daughter to Carry. My Wife and Daughters all Have this same Gun except in all Black and theirs have Crimson Traces. Here are Details and Specs listed Below:
The P-3AT is a locked breech, double action only .380 ACP pistol designed and manufactured by Kel-Tec based on the P-32. The frame is made of polymer with an aluminum insert, and the slide and barrel are steel. It is the lightest production .380 ACP pistol in the world,[1] weighing only 8.3 oz (240 g) empty, and is roughly the same size as many .22 and .25-caliber pistols.

Design details[edit]The P-3AT cartridge capacity is 6+1, and trigger pull is 5 lbf (22 N). These attributes have made it popular for citizens with concealed carry permits and with police officers as a back-up or off-duty pistol. The P-3AT lacks any sort of slide stop—it was omitted in order to keep the size similar to the P-32. The similar size and weight of the P-3AT results in increased felt recoil over the P-32 due to the more powerful .380 ACP cartridge (the P-32 fires the smaller .32 ACP cartridge).

The Kel-Tec P-3AT is available with blued, parkerized, or matte chrome slide. The polymer frame is available in black, grey, navy blue, or olive drab green solid colors, as well as 'Urban Blue/Grey' and 'True Timber' camouflage. Current production is the second generation model, with improvements over the first generation. The most easily distinguished difference between generations is the extractor. The first generation has a traditional external extractor parallel to the side of the gun, while the second generation has a button-head hex screw to the rear of the extractor, which is at an angle to the side of the gun.

In a Guns & Ammo review, Wiley Clapp said, ""Ingenuity is often nothing more than a combination of existing principles applied in unique ways. Kel-Tec's new P-3AT has no single feature that is not established in modern pistol design, yet it has no competition in its niche."""

If you purchase this handgun from me and want the stipple done above the trigger guard for index finger placement, that isn't a problem. I have hand sanded and hand polished the slide, takedown lever, ammy slide locks, barrel(including feed ramp), and magazines. This gun is in otherwise LNIB condition. This gun comes with the brown small backstrap showed in picture, small/med/large black ones, and a total of two magazines with original paperwork in a hard plastic carry case. I have only ran a few clips through this gun to confirm that firing this gun will in no way remove the nice polish job I have done on this. I also own one with the optional ambidextrous thumb safety if you would prefer that model. Serious inquiries only please. Sale will be done via a Bill of sale, however I do require buyer to have a CCW Endorsement on a valid MO state ID.
