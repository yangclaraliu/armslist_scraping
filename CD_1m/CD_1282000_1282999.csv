Shoots excellent ... it is a Hi Point, and when I first shot it, I had a failure, but I just press down on the back of the magazine (bullet) after I load the bullets, and I shot 90 more rounds through it without one failure.  and as I explain below, this was my first real shoot, and I want to be honest.  Research the C9 before purchase.  but again, being a beginner, I was able to clear and continue, and had no more issues ... gun is so fun.

This is basically the first semi-automatic pistol I have ever shot, and the only one I have ever owned, but now I am kind of addicted, and am looking to upgrade to a S&W 9ve, and also looking for a 380 for CCW, so this one has to go!!

While we still can, I will negotiate on 2 Kriss Super V 30 round magazines that will fit this Glock.  Ammunition:  Around 500 rounds of Winchester white box; a box of Federal Premium hollow points (20 rounds) and a box of Hornady Critical Defense hollow points (20 rounds).  Lastly, a Bladetech magazine holster that will hold 2 of any of the above listed mags including the Super V's.  Everything except the Super V mags I will let go for $800.00.  If you want the Super V's, I'll let you have them both for another $100.00.  I only ran the 30 round mags one time at the range.  So they are practially new.  The 2 13 round mags are brand new as well as the most recent model.  If you want pictures I will do my best to upload some as soon as possible, let me know."

Here is a nice and reliable shooting EXCEL ARMS semi-auto pistol.   It started life as a .17 HMR but we (excel and myself) could never make it function as it should.

The gun is marked .17 HMR when indeed it is a .22 WMR.

Full diamond plate and leather interior. Led lights, fully adjustable shelves and barrel rests, it has a large fireproof safe inside for documents or jewelry. Currently I have it set up for 15 long guns, umpteen handguns and all ur reloading and clearing supplies. Truly limitless in the different ways u can use the massive interior. I store army ammo cans in the bottom also. This thing is crazy heavy and designed to be bolted to the floor or wall. So don't worry about some thug carrying it off. I haven't painted the outside yet (I could paint it whatever color to match ur decor or ur favorite beverage) i kinda like the weathered look because it's in my garage and looks like all my other weathered projects so thieves wouldn't suspect that it's a safe. These are not cheap to build due to cost of fire proof safe and diamond plate, lights, etc etc. I enjoy a good project and have built a few of these recently so if ur looking for a specific type of machine or custom design let me know. Thank's for looking. Price is negotiable and i do trade for the right stuff."

Go to BassProShop in Leeds,AL and add your name and caliber of ammo you need to the call list and they will call you as soon as a shipment comes in and will hold it for you until you arrive. That's what I do, and I've been buying Federal brass 420rds boxes for a little over $200 every time they call. Or try your local gun stores to see if they are or will do the same thing.

If I had the time or the desire to get up early and stand in line for ammo at Cabelas or Gander Mountain, just so I can turn around and sell it for 100-200% profit, I probably would. That's not robbery, it's just business. It's not these people's fault that ammo prices are so high. It's our fault, the consumers. 

Do yourselves a favor, STOP BUYING FROM THESE PEOPLE. Go without shooting for a couple weeks if you have to. If there's no demand, the prices WILL go down. The only reason these people go to such lengths to purchase ammo and supplies is because they know people will pay. If we stop paying, they'll stop clearing off the shelves before the delivery truck leaves, and there will be some normally priced ammo left for the rest of us. The supply is there, it's just being bought up by all these price-gougers (Many of whom don't even buy the ammo to shoot it, some of whom may not even own guns) and sold at ridiculous prices to suckers like us. Don't encourage them, DON'T BUY! I guarantee you they'll get tired of buying up ammo that is useless and worthless to them. Get yourself enough to last through a SHTF situation, then stop buying. See what happens.

To all the price-gougers....like I said, I'm not here to bash you all, if people are willing to pay double the retail price, why wouldn't you buy up as much as you can and then sell it for a profit? But seriously, don't get up at 4:00am, be the first one at the door when the local Gander Mountain opens, buy all the ammo before anyone else gets a chance, and then act like you're doing us a favor when you sell it for double and triple what you paid. You'll be doing us a real favor by only buying what you can shoot, and leaving the rest for someone else.
