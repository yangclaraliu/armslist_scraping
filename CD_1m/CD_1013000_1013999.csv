I actually picked this up as the fully loaded 995TSFGFL-LAZ (Black with forward grip, flashlight, & laser), but I'm keeping the light.  I've also added a couple additional things to it.

Hi Point 995TS includes:
3 magazines (all 10 rounders)
Stock magazine holder (holds the 2 extra mags)
Standard peep sights
Flash suppressor/muzzle compensator
Forward folding grip
Lazer sight (never sighted in - needs new battery)
Bipod
Sling
Original box/paperwork
Have a hard case I can throw in with it

I've shot this several times - it's a blast to shoot and very accurate (I love open peep sights).  I'm thinking I only have 2-300 rounds through it (definitely less than 500).  It's very solid/sturdy, so recoil is minimal.  Cheek weld and sight picture also make it much more comfortable/ergonomic to shoot compared to the Kel-Tec Sub-2000 (I owned both).  I can't say this has been absolutely flawless (a few jams early in the break-in), but it has been very reliable (especially recently).

Feel free to make offers, but I won't consider anything under $400.  I'll also keep some of the accessories (primarily forward grip and bipod) if I sell for anything less than my asking price.

P556 Pistol features a 10” button rifled barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The flash suppressor uses a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The receiver is made of high strength steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron® finish. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The pistol comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR magazines.

The red dot sight is pretty useless on the P556 so I put it on my 522, the original Sig polymer magazine is pure garbage so I shot it with no issues using steel magazines. Using steel magazines makes this pistol 100% reliable, never ever had any issues using them. It is quite heavy but the weight keeps it from climbing even when shooting one handed.

Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.
Throughout the world today, Colt’s reliability, performance, and accuracy provide our Armed Forces the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt’s new LE6920MP-B shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1” chrome lined barrel.  With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip (with storage compartment), MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine
Includes: (1) NIB, ever fired Colt LE6920MP-B with 16"" 1:7 twist barrel, (1) 30rd magazine, cleaning kit, sling, and manual.
Accessories Included:   400 rounds of ammunition, (2) additional 30rd magazines, (1) Vortex Diamondback 3-9x40 Dead-hold BDC scope, Butler Creek flip-open caps, Burris R.E.P.R quick detach mount, 2-piece quad rail for the Colt AR, rail covers, rail mount fore end grip with storage, and a tactical gun case.   All items are brand new except the case but it’s in perfect, like new condition. The scope has been pre sighted on my personal AR using a bore sighter at 100yards.   The scope will need minor final sighting on the Colt with live ammo but should be within a couple inches.   The included 100 rounds of match ammo should help you with this.   Ammo is hard to get at a reasonable price right now.   I figured bore sighting should help you conserve your ammo so you can use it for a better purpose.
The Burris mount allows the rear flip up sight to remain in place, and the front sight is not visible at 3 or 9 power.   I included a picture of that.   If you want to drop the scope there are two latches to remove the scope/base in seconds without tools.    It includes both smooth and picatinny rail ring tops and the Burris forever warranty. Included is a quad rail for mounting lights or what ever accessories you desire....    The 2-piece rail is sized for the Colt AR.   I included (3) rail covers and a fore end grip –all new in their packages. I'm asking for $1,950.00 Price is firm and am not looking for trades. I want to sell .. You can email me and then i will leave you a cell you can text or call me on anytime.. Thanks so much for viewing...."

Yeah, ammo is over priced...that is why I am not buying. I want to buy a super cool optic for my new long range rig, and the best way to do that is to sell this ammo at CURRENT MARKET VALUE. I would never pay this much for ammo, so I don't! But if you feel you need it that bad at this point, I am willing to sell at current market value.

It was used by a friend of mine who was a contractor while I was in Iraq (I was with him throughout the deployment so I know how he treated it). The inserts are rated to with stand a 9mm shot and the plates are rated to withstand a shot from a 7.62x51. It comes with 2 neck and throat protectors (1 set is new one set is used but still good). It comes with 3 groin protectors (2 are ACU camo and 1 is BDU camo). Also included is a set of shoulder and axillary protectors. The following are missing the side plate holders (just the covers). I do have the inserts and the plates for them though. You can buy them off of ebay or amazon for $50 a set. And one of the front soft armor inserts and the back soft armor inserts.  The front and back plates are in VERY good condition. The side plates do have some small tears on the bottom. These tears are from when it was set down on the ground and from getting in and out of vehicles. The plates themselves are in excellent condition and are not cracked. I have the ACU covers for all of the inserts shown and a couple extra. I took the covers off so I could clean them off (you're not supposed to get the inserts or plates wet for an extended period of time). So you actually get more then what is all in the picture. I'm asking best offer so just email with your cash offer. I may take a firearm or a combination of both. Please do not low ball me though I know what this is worth and I'm in no hurry to sell it.

The Most Up-To-Date & Reliable Civilian Magazine Available 

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups. All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. This mag has our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.”  .223 / 5.65 AR-15/M4 Color: Military Gray. 30-Round

This pistol is extremely clean and comes equipped with a set of super smooth multi-patterned authentic buffalo horn grips, which in my opinion are too beautiful to describe in words. This pistol will be housed and shipped in the same aftermarket aluminum carrying case featured in our photographs.


This Colt 1902 is a rare find, and the only one of its kind in existence. Every firearm Master Engraver Santiago Leis creates is unique, and contains no similarities to another, making each and every one of his firearms a 1 of 1 in the World of Guns. A numbered certificate of authenticity signed by Master Engraver Santiago Leis will also be accompanying this one of a kind pistol, for your own personal records or for possible future resale purposes. This pistol is in 100% working condition, and should be treated like any other operational firearm.


Never forget that owning a Colt firearm is the dream of dreams for firearm enthusiasts, and can also double as a perfectly safe and reliable investment for both financial and security purposes.


The photographs I've included provide this masterpiece with only a fraction of its true beauty, so I encourage all potential buyers to contact me ASAP if you have any further questions pertaining to this amazing piece of weaponry."
