It is a ""RRA Mid-length A4 LAR-15"" to be exact. It is in awesome condition, only about 100 rounds through it, and cleaned after every range trip. These are very, very hard to find right now due to the gun craze, and most places that sell these are back-ordered for 3-12 months or more!
It has a 16"" barrel with a mid-length gas system, which gives better accuracy and lower recoil than the short-length gas systems. The barrel is chrome-moly and has a 1:9 twist. As you can see I am including a Red (or Green) Dot Sight that has 8 different reticle options. I am also including a flip-up MBUS (back up site) which is co-witnessed with the red-dot (meaning either or both could be used, they both point to my zero at 50 yards), its a really great setup for some closer-range tactical shooting. If you wanted to put a scope on it its pretty easy to do as well (Note: There is no scope included in this package). It has a 6 position adjustable stock. The accuracy is up to 1 MOA (meaning with a shooting rest, high quality ammo, and a good shooter, you can put 5 rounds within a 1"" circle at 100 yards).
I am also including the tactical sling (partially seen to the left of the stock) as well as 5 - 30 round polymer magazines, 4 of which have a handy window to see how much ammo is remaining. I will include these LOADED at 29 each (can fit 30 but its not very good for the mags and can cause problems) for 145 rounds! [NOTE: NOT SELLING ACCESSORIES/AMMO SEPARATE for this package] The ammo is 55 grain brass cased, not aluminum or steel cased garbage you see nowadays in the current craze. I am able to sell some additional ammunition for additional $.

This has everything you need to start tactical target shooting or even survive the zombie apocalypse!

List of everything included: Firearm, tactical sling, 5 LOADED magazines (29 x 5 = 145 rounds in magazines), red/green dot sight (Truglo, will include a back up battery too), back up sight, original RRA case.

I am NOT looking to trade, looking to sell only. Must be able to meet in Eau Claire, face to face, and have CASH. Will not ship. I can have additional pics and/or information on request. CCW a plus, Wisconsin ID a must."

Product Information
 The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always ready sight. Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year pesronal use warranty.

PRODUCT DETAILS
The shortest of the non-NFA models with a removable muzzle device, the PWS MK116 Rifle is a crowd favorite. The MK116 is designed for a multitude of uses and retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a PWS FSC556.

Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK116 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 handguard and free-floated barrel.

The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS2 sights.

The performance of CompM4s sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology. The clearest, brightest image possible Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD). Ready for use around the clock With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4s sight is ready for round the clock use.

Accuracy is ensured by the match grade barrel, chamber and trigger, along with pillar bedding on all models and glass bedding on rifles in big game calibers.
The Model 84M action was designed with minimal dimensions to accept the .308 Win. family of cartridges. No compromise was considered. Most production rifles simply shorten their bulky, full-sized actions to accommodate these shorter cartridges, and their rifles end up weighing the same as a magnum. Worse, many do the only other thing they can to save weight; shorten the barrel below optimal length. That takes the rifle out of balance and reduces velocity.
The Kimber Model 84M Montana weighs just over 5 pounds, and the Model 84M Classic, Classic Stainless, Classic Select Grade and SuperAmerica weigh about 8 ounces more. Heavier rifles in varmint calibers are also available. Like all Kimber pistols and rifles, the Model 84M is built entirely inside the Kimber factory right here in America.
Model 84M rifles are designed for two distinct purposes. Classic, Classic Stainless, Classic Select Grade, Montana and SuperAmerica models are light sporters made for hunting North America's big game. Available in a wide selection of popular calibers, they are the finest mountain rifles offered today. Varmint, LongMaster Classic, Pro Varmint, SVT and LongMaster VT are available in several flat-shooting varmint calibers. Lighter models are designed for predator calling and walking long distances between stands. heavy-barreled models are for wearing out your welcome at a prairie dog town. Model 84M rifles are unequaled by any other production rifle, no matter how you weigh the options
The Model 84M action is designed with absolute minimal dimensions for the .308 Win. family of cartridges. This is the primary reason Model 84M rifles weigh some 2 pounds less than those from other manufacturers.
Model 84M actions are bedded to the stock on twin aluminum pillars for strength and accuracy. Models in big game calibers also have glass bedding. Sculpted steel bottom metal has a floorplate release inside the trigger bow.
Proper stock design and a recoil-absorbing 1-inch Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad on most models diminish felt recoil. Straight comb stocks slide back, not up and into your cheekbone.
All Kimber rifles feature match grade barrels with match grade chambers and target crowns for exceptional accuracy. Barrels are optimum length to maximize velocity and maintain perfect balance, not cut to save weight.
Model 84M rifles are the lightest production hunting rifles available today. The Model 84M Montana .308 Win. weighs just 5 pounds, 2 ounces. Models with walnut stocks weigh just 8 ounces more."

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year. 

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose. 

The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

The variable-output M720V RAID WeaponLight produces brilliant 150-lumen white light or 240 milliwatts of infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps. Simply push and twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between white light or IR illumination—or select the ""disable"" setting to prevent accidental discharges. In either spectrum mode, the M720V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for close- to medium-range applications with sufficient peripheral illumination for situational awareness. The highly efficient LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. 

The M720V comes with a pressure-activated SR07-M720V tape switch (with a 7"" cable) that can be positioned where you choose. If your remote switch becomes damaged or disconnected, rotate your RAID WeaponLight's white-light selector switch to "";flashlight"" mode and activate it directly via its integral pushbutton dome switch. (This same pushbutton switch provides low navigational white light when ""flashlight"" mode is not selected.) This selector switch also lets you choose three different white-light output settings: high, medium, or strobe. The IR selector switch, located on opposite side, offers high-, medium-, and low-output settings when IR mode is selected on head. 

The M720V attaches solidly to your Picatinny rail via our Swing-Lever™ clamp, which self-adjusts to out-of-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from recoil or impact. Built to withstand the rigors of combat, the M720V is constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and optically coated tempered glass for durability and maximum light transmission. It's also O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture.

BILLet Option for Wilson Combat ARs
Designed by Bill Wilson and the Wilson Combat design team to be the base for the ultimate precision tactical AR-15 rifle, the BILLet-AR matched upper and lower receiver is 100% machined in our Berryville, AR facility.
The Wilson Combat BILLet-AR receiver was engineered from the ground up to address structural design weaknesses in standard USGI receivers and enhance overall tolerances.
The BILLet-AR upper receiver has a precise bolt raceway for smoother chambering, more rigid receiver walls to reduce firing flex, an oversize magazine well for quick reloads and an integrated trigger guard for gloved use and added lower receiver strength.
Our extensive experience as a premier custom builder of AR-15 rifles will ensure your satisfaction with this next generation precision tactical shooting platform.

Multi-Function Tail Cap Switch: SureFire Scout Weapon Light
P/N: 44700G01 

The Wilcox Multi-Function Tail Cap Switch for Various SureFire Tactical WeaponLights is designed to easily replace the existing flashlight Tail Cap Switch on the SureFire Millennium Universal, Classic Universal, and Scout Light WeaponLight systems. This replacement switch assembly allows the SureFire flashlight to easily integrate with the Wilcox Total Control Vertical Grip TM by means of a Remote Connector Cable. A double-tap switch located on the back of the switch provides momentary on or constant on operation when used independent of the TCVG, for operation similar to the ATPIAL. The Tail Cap eliminates the need for tape switches that easily break and fail. The Tail Cap features a connection port on the back for connecting the Remote Cable to the TCVG and is made of a high strength polymer.

Akribis – Greek for Sharp and Precise, is a fitting name for this finely crafted folding knife. This titanium and S35VN folder is the fruition of intense development and refinement. Spartan set out to create a knife that embodied all that is right in a modern folding knife. Form, function, and craftsmanship are all words that come to mind when you hold this knife. During the development of Akribis, Spartan reached out to the best and brightest in the industry for guidance and technical insight that is very evident when holding this knife. The Akribis was put through a series of refinements, engineering reviews and changes that culminated in this precision cutting tool. The craftsmanship of this folder is self-evident, from the chamfers on the frame to the intricate machining of the blades jimping. The Akribis is light weight and is created using only the best of modern materials; such as, titanium, double deep cryogenically treated and tempered S35VN blades, and ceramic bearings in the locking bar to ensure positive closing bias for tip up carry. All surfaces are coated with the best PVD coatings available to protect the working surfaces of the blade and frame. The Akribis is meant to break convention by serving not only as a “tactical” knife but as a blade that can just as easily be carried in business attire. You should be comfortable carrying an Akribis on the battlefield, the boardroom or any of your daily adventures.

Ok last shot before july 1. Here i have a colt m16 in .22 lr new condition with 2 30 Round mags the retail on this gun was $600 with a 10 round mag plus tax and fees and the 30 rounders are impossible to get at all. This rifle id the exact same size weight and feel of the mil spec m16 same exact specs all metal const. It is a very rare m16 model that is inpossible to get there are 3 others on armslist in the country all asking over $1000 the m4 version of this rifle is all over and only has a 16"" barrel this one is 21"" and is much more accurate. It has a removable carry handle so you can put optics on it ( i have a simmons 4x scope i could let go with it if i feel the trade or price is right. I know for all you tac guy that you can get collaping stock and for grip rails to tac it out this is the best .22 lr ar platform out there its a colt the best and not availible after july 1. Hell before that if people start to panic again lol. Now its worth around $800 with the mags keep that in mind. I will not put a price i want it does not fit my needs so if something peaks my interest i may trade down a little or up for a nice metal frame sig. Will consider cash guns multiguns guns and cash ammo at pre panic prices nothing else let me know i may be interested. I dont have to sell and will not get robbed on it ill just keep it. Plan ftf loveland area and by answering you are stating you are legal to own this weapon. Cheap to shoot and as deadly as a .223 or 5.56 inside 100 yards"

This SA/DA Webley was manufactured in 1917 and besides the loss of blueing this pistol looks great. It could have spent time in the trenches of Europe in the closing years of WW1, or perhaps in the jungles of Asia in WW2. This model had its cylinder shaved to accept .45acp to streamline British and US ammo supplies. It also fires .45 Autorim cartridges without the moon clip. Included are assorted .45 acp ammo some shells are from WW2 and have steel casings from the Evansville ordanace plant and a few .45 Autorim shells. Also a holster and web belt.

Very rare gun used by the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard , Merchant Marines and other organizations to throw rescue lines over the bow of disabled ships.

This gun has an 1884 dated Civil War Springfield lock plate.These Springfield Line Guns were used in the Spanish American War and World War One eras and so saw some serious action. They were later decommissioned and replaced after the wars with inexpensive single barrel shotguns converted to line guns .

The fitted wood case measures 33 inches long. Included are ten brass bolts, three rope cans, all of which are full, empty box of ammo.

Because of their rarity it's a bit difficult to find comparable sales of these Trapdoor Springfield Line Guns but I was able to verify one sale for $2150.00 a few months ago. Excellent investment opportunity and a rare piece of Naval history."
