7,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1451007,For Sale:  CNC milled aluminum 80% lower AR receiver,"Phx, Pennsylvania, United States",$ 175,"Listed On: Saturday, April 13, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"These are milled out of a solid piece of aluminum block, not forged or cast in a mold.

These are some beautiful lower receivers, 80% complete to military specifications. These are NOT considered receivers yet by the ATF and are not serialized - meaning there's absolutely no tracking of these units and even if purchased through a gun shop, no background check is required and no paperwork filled out. 

 These are completely legal to own and complete into working receivers - 
 however, as will all things gun related, know the local, state, and federal laws that apply to your particular location and circumstances. You are responsible for You!

 All that is needed is a drill or drill press, some end mill bits (basically drill bits with flat ends) , and the jig; here's a few links to places selling the jigs:
 http://ar15jigs.com/drilljigs.html
 http://www.cncguns.com/tooling.html
 http://www.apex-brass.com/ut-arms-drill-jig-fixture.html

 Of all the places selling the jigs (and there are many more), I highly recommend CNCguns. Those guys have been there, done it (right) and now offer the proper pieces of equipment, videos, and first hand experience. Plus, their just plain nice guys and will take time out of their day to get on the phone and talk you through any problems.

 I ordered 5 of these when all h*ll broke loose earlier this year and I'll end up building out 3, that leaves 2 to sell. 

 Again, these are mill aluminum works of art that you can build into flawless operating guns that you'll be proud to own.

 I am able to accept payment via CC through Google Checkout (add 3.5%) and will only charge actual shipping (no ""handling"" fee), and these do not have to go through an FFL - they ship straight to your door."

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

This gun was made in the mid 90s and is an ex-Swiss law-enforcement weapon.  The slide is the heavier milled stainless steel part instead of the earlier stamped one, and has the Swiss canton regional crest(Vaud) on the left side. The sights are tritium but glow very faintly, so I painted over them with white paint.Since it was an issued weapon there is some finish wear, but this doesn't affect anything. In fact I think it gives the gun some character. This gun was made in 1996 so it avoids the problems that some newer post-2004 Sigs have with QC. It was made at a time when Sig made nothing but the best. I carry this gun every day and trust my life to it. 

With the pistol comes 5 high capacity mags: 3 factory 15-rounders(including one '94 Ban-era 'zipper-back'), a new Mec/Gar 17-rounder, and a Mec/Gar 20 round mag. If you are left-handed I will include a kydex OWB holster by Shadow Holsters of Minnesota. Ammo in the mag pic not included."

Interarms, long ago, imported a number of these hard to find classics.  To identify these carbines as ""theirs"", they scrubbed the year of manufacture commonly found on the breech and roll marked ""Interarms G33/50"".

The barrel is 18 inches long making this ideal for those of you who brush hunt deer, etc.  Add maneuverability to the legendary accuracy of the 6.5 x 55 cartridge and what's not to like.

The action rests in a sporterized Mauser stock as you can see from the photos.  The receiver has NOT been drilled or tapped, it's in its as original condition.  Magazine capacity is 5 rounds and this is one caliber that hasn't gone through the roof in terms of ammunition prices. 

The action, bolt, shroud, and safety are all matching numbers.  I've fired this rifle, it's accurate as all get out even with the iron sights and fun to shoot.

 I've got some taxes to pay and, if you have any familiarity with Swedish Mausers you'll see that the price is quite attractive as stated.  Not interested in any trades at this time.

Cash is king.  I live in the NW burbs of Milwaukee and will drive up to 30 minutes if you're a serious buyer.  Drop me an email with any questions and we'll go from there.  I have additional photos if you're interested."

I talked with a Browning Historian and he had told me that Browning didnt bring it into this country and it was specially made for someone by Browning. It has been in the safe for years and only brought out to show it off. Im looking to see if there is any interesting trade offers out there. I will not sell it, only entertain unique trade offers and i dont mind if i keep it in the family forever either. If whatever your offering can currently be bought in a gun shop, im not interested unless it is of high value."

I have used this for several years and sort of lost interest over time. Then due to lack of interest didn't use it at all last year until fall. When I filled and started it last fall I found that the pump motor were bad so it and the pump and wet-end were both replaced brand new at that time but I had drained it for the worst of winter by December so there are almost no hours on the pump motor or wet-end at all. It alone are worth about what I am asking for the whole hot tub so it is worth at least what I am asking or more.  

It is not full now but if you have a trade that is interesting, we can arrange a time when I can fill and heat it so you can see it run and see it work if you would like.

I do not have a trailer to haul but will help load. It is really heavy and will take several people to load.

For sale is an Intratec AB-10 with a 30-round magazine.  

The AB-10 model was created when the Clinton administration banned TEC-9’s.  The “AB” reportedly stands for “Anti-Ban”; bless those folks at Intratec.  

If you’re looking for a highly accurate weapon with sub-MOA results - this ain’t it!  However, if you’re more of the “spray and pray” mindset then this is the tool for you.   

The AB-10 mechanicals are similar to those of the WW II era grease gun (which is still in limited use today by the US Army) but in 9mm.  It has a large bolt, a firing pin, two main springs, and that’s about it.  It’s simple and it’s reliable.  

This is a fun range weapon.  It’s not designed for surgical shooting.  It’s the kind of thing you pull out of the case, load, launch lead in a rapid downrange direction, and watch as folks gather around to take a peek and try it out.  

The firearm is only 10 ½” wide x 6 ¼“ high at the widest and tallest points without the magazine.  It takes up very little space and stores easily.  This makes it ideal for tucking into a bug-out bag, squirreling it away in a small lockbox, or even securing it in a vehicle.  

I am including the following with this sale: AB-10 firearm; 30-round magazine; 200-rounds of brass ammo (as listed above); and directions for assembling and disassembling the AB-10.  

I will need to see a PTP or conceal carry permit and valid ID.  I will fill out transfer paperwork for my records only, not to file anywhere else.  A copy of the transfer paperwork will be available for you as well. 

Although cash is king, I will trade this for a nice bolt action Savage with a decent scope in either .17HMR or .22LR.  If there is a difference in values we can work that out with additional trades or cash.  

Thanks for looking – see you on the zero line."

It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

This is a piece of history and with the gun ban/registration/etc BS going on, get it while you can and before I can't legally sell it.

It's an original RPB Industries M10 made in Atlanta, Georgia. Chambered in .45 ACP. and fires 'semi-auto' from 'Open Bolt' position

Here's what comes in my bundle:

* The gun itself W/ nylon grip support & low original serial number (Serial # 0003660)

* Barrel extension with shroud

* 8 - 35 round mags (all original grease gun style in great shape)

* 1 - 16 round mag

* 2 original nylon/canvas/leather magazine pouches W/ shoulder slings (each pouch holds 4 - 35 round mags)

* Shoulder sling for the gun itself

* Book 'Full Auto Volume Three'. This is the bundle topper. It's a book on how to convert your semi-auto M10 into a Full-Auto M10. It shows many different ways it can be done though I personally do not condone doing it, as doing so would be a Federal crime if caught. Book is completely legal as is the knowledge of the mods and is meant to be for novelty/collection only.

The Nambu Type 94 pistol was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1934 (year 2594 of the contemporary Japanese calendar). It was developed to complement and eventually replace the older Type 14 Nambu pistol in military service, but limited industrial capabilities of the Imperial Japan didn't let it happen. Total production of these pistols between 1934 and 1945 is estimated at 65 - 70 thousands guns. Nambu Type 94 pistol is short recoil operated, locked breech weapon. The breech block (bolt) is made as a separate item and removable attached to the slide by a cross-bolt. The trigger is of single action type, with internal (concealed) hammer. Manual safety lever is located at the left side of the frame, above and to the rear of the grip panel. The single stack box magazine has capacity of just 6 rounds, magazine release button is located at the base of the trigger guard."
