So I am sad to say I will not be a party to these ridiculous laws and pray that Sherrif Maketa's lawsuit overturns these laws.

Personal sale Coming out of my safe for sale to fund purchase of higher caliber Colt. This particular rifle had 90 rounds through it to sight in and plinka few magazines.  It was thorouhgly cleaned and placed in my safe. It is being taken out to sell so I can buy a higher caliber rifle. 
It has the original box, with it's matching serial # manual, and the extras are  THREE ( not one) Prancing Pony clips with Lake City ammo, 60 rounds of 552 green tip and also included for extra price , the A2 carry handle with a built in rear adjustable site that includes a picatinny rail attachment, a sling and a rare hard to find Colt field cleaning kit.

You want to pay less, I will remove the A2carry handle and accesories to bring down the price.   Just let me know. 

This is an awesome price and awesome weapon as well. Lightweight and packs a punch. Also the new models are not coming with cleaning kits, or slings.

Get this great package before background checks, fees and  ridiculous laws for 15 round clips go into law JULY 2ND.  After the 2nd I will not be participating in what I feel is 2nd ammendment violations, so I will not sell weapons anymore as i will not do background checks etc.

ABOUT THE PISTOL
The USP was developed at the same time as the SOCOM MK23, the pistol underwent much of the same rigorous testing. The barrel is cold-forged from chromium steel for increased life. During testing, a bullet was deliberately lodged in a USP barrel. Another cartridge was then fired into the obstructing bullet. The second bullet cleared the barrel, resulting in a barely noticeable bulge. The pistol was then fired for accuracy and the resulting group measured less than 4 inches at 25 meters.[18]
Temperature testing required the USP be frozen to −42 °C and fired, frozen again, and then be heated up to 67 °C and fired. These temperature tests were continually repeated with no adverse effects on the USP.[18]
The gun was also subjected to NATO MIL-SPEC mud and rain tests, which were passed without difficulty. Water immersion and salt spray also presented no problems. German Navy combat divers have used the USP for two years without any signs of corrosion.
Safety testing exceeded the ANSI/SAAMI requirements adopted in May 1990. These included dropping a USP with a primed cartridge and decocked hammer on a variety of hard surfaces without discharging. The USP surpassed these commercial requirements, as well as German Army and police tests, including repeated drop tests from six feet (1.8 m), hammer first, onto a steel backed concrete slab. Proof round firing resulted in no cracks, deformations, or increase in head space. Attempts to fire the USP pistol with an unlocked breech proved unsuccessful.
Testing with a variety of ammunition proved the USP meets these high standards. During the USP testing phase, it was shown the recoil-reduction system reduces the force on the USP grip to approximately 300 newtons (67 pounds-force). Peak force shock on competing .40 caliber polymer and metal framed pistols was around 5,000 newtons (1,100 pounds-force). The primary benefit of low peak shock is a decrease in wear and tear on pistol components, a great concern with the +P cartridge in 9 mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. Reduction of peak shock forces also contributes to softer recoil for the shooter, although these ""felt recoil"" values are much more subjective."

This is absolutely one of the premier self-defense pistols available from any manufacturer. The XD(M) line by Springfield has gathered huge acclaim, and here is your chance to own one at way below retail in a merket that is selling way above retail!

DESIGN
Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.
(M)odel Contour Frame(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations
(M)ega-Lock Texture

TECHNOLOGY
Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. 
With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.(M)elonite®(M)atch Grade Barrel
(M)inimal Reset Trigger
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. 
Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. 
The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. 
Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. 
New! 3.8 model with slip resistant slide serrations.
The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. 

INNOVATIONS
The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M)® line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M)® series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.
(M)aximum Reach Magazine Release
(M)inimal Error Disassembly
(M)ega Capacity Magazine
The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip. 
Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster. 
The new XD(M)® Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR™ Mag 
X-Tension™ (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)® is the largest capacity production polymer pistol available.
.

PERSONALIZATION
Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.
(M)ould-Tru Backstraps
(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™
(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case
(M)agazine X-Tensions™ (USPAT.7191556)
With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit. 
A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. [Zoom]
With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions™ , SPRINGFIELD ARMORY® has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)
Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M)® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)® pistols.

Perfect for suppressor folks and even unsuppressed, as the noise is much lower coming out of a rifle barrel than standard high velocity .22lr.

The P2000 SK model is a small ""sub-compact"" version of the P2000. This American version of the P2000 SK will accept the longer USP Compact magazines which provide higher capacities; up to 12 .40 S&W cartridges; if one decides to use one of these magazines, a small percentage of the gun's compact size will be compromised as these longer magazines will stick out approximately 1/2"" below the bottom of the P2000SK's grip. Lower capacity 10-round magazines are the same size as the higher capacity USP Compact magazines.

The P2000 was designed specifically with improved ergonomic characteristics over the extraordinarily acclaimed USP; it has features that reduce the handling related stresses, while at the same time increasing user handling and shooter comfort. The Heckler & Koch P2000 is a German semi-automatic pistol introduced late in 2001 and intended primarily for law enforcement, paramilitary, and commercial markets. It is based around the technology used in the USP Compact pistol with further improvements.

DESIGN DETAILS:
The P2000 is a short recoil-operated locked breech pistol with a modified Browning-type linkless cam action with a vertically tilting barrel also employed in the USP series of self-loading pistols, as well as most modern linkless semi autos.

The cold hammer-forged barrel has a polygonal profile while the slide is made from a solid bar of nitro-carburized steel. Following recent trends in modern pistol designs, the P2000 makes extensive use of impact-resistant polymers to reduce weight and production costs.

As with other recent Heckler & Koch pistol designs, the P2000 is modular to suit individual needs. For instance, the grip is modular with exchangeable backstraps to adjust to individual grips, allowing the user to customize the pistol's grip size. There is an interface for accessories built into the frame in front of the trigger guard; the universal accessory rail on the dust cover that allows for the use of tactical lights, laser pointers and other accessories. Attachment is positive and does not require any tools. This is in contrast with the USP series, which uses a proprietary H&K mounting rail that limits the types of accessories that could be used with the pistol.

The P2000 is a hammer-fired pistol with an exposed spurred hammer; a bobbed hammer is optional. It has ambidextrous slide locks and a fully ambidextrous magazine release installed in the trigger guard, on both sides. Various trigger and cocking systems offer the possibility of converting the trigger firing mode from one type to another.

This Version 3 (V3) is their most popular configuration, yet it can be easily changed to other Versions. 
V3: SA/DA trigger with a decocking lever mounted at the posterior of the slide to the left of the spurred hammer. Single-action trigger pull of 20 N (4.5 lbf) (+4/-2 N), double-action trigger pull – 51 N (11.47 lbf) (±5 N).

This model, the PPS-43 was made between 1943 and 1946, after WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world and manufactured in those countries. The Polish model that we offer has been redesigned as a semi auto version and shoots from a closed bolt, it is ATF approved and made of all new parts of the famed Radom plant in Poland. The stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the weapon is classified as a pistol, furnished with two 35rd mags and cleaning kit."

This gun has been used but is in very good condition id give it 95 percent. The 2.5 is the most desirable and rarest of the diamondback guns. This gun was said to be a special order in coltgaurd finish which was not cataloged by Colt on diamondbacks in 1967 when this gun was made. It also has a different color sight insert from the traditional guns of that period. It is very possible that this was a custom shop gun but also possible of being refinished at some point. A colt archive letter is the only way of proving one or the other. Gun was manufactured in 1967 serial # D 43xx and did leave the factory as a 2.5 inch .38 diamondback but nothing else is certain without letter. I personally did not care to get the letter nor have I shot the gun.

Here is what I have done to it to alleviate issues.
Fixed all three mags to feed properly.
Polished feed ramp, firing pin ramp and surrounding parts, which has also improved the trigger pull to a nice smooth light trigger.
These are all the things that normally have to be done(should be done at the factory?) to really improve the reliability of the Hi Point

Tight with walnut grips in excellent condition..For Sell or trade for Beretta or 20 gauge semi auto shot gun

BTJ stoof for Bellmore Johnson Tool co.. It is my understanding that American Derringer picked up the rights to make this derringer and is in Blue Book under DA 38 Special...I found the following info on this derringer below which appears to be accurate..It was under a Gun Brokers blog.
The original DA 38 Derringer was made only in 38 special chambering.
The logo ""BTJ"" stands for Benjamin Johnson Technologies. (the ""T"" is in the middle as a stylized logo)

I do not know if BJT bought the right to manufacture from High Standard. But in less than a year the company was gone with no fowarding address. If anyone knows the reason, please post it.

The DA frame is aluminum and the barrels and latch are stainless steel. The stainless castings were made by Pinetree Castings, the same company that Ruger often used.
The original BJT derringers did not actually have wood grips but are made from a composite wood look-alike. 
Later, the rights to manufacture and leftover parts were bought up by American Derringer Corporation, who began making these in 38 Special and 9 mm para. The earlier ADC-DA derringers have the BTJ logo and the Hamden CT address since they were leftover and already stamped by BJT. 


There is a difference between the ADC derringers and BJT that you can see at a glance: the Safety on the ADC derringers have a center screw to adjust the safety tension. The BJT derringers have a solid safety piece and do not have or need the screw."

This is no safe queen; there are some knicks and scratches on the finish, as well as some paint missing where the trunion was re-riveted.   Why?  Because I fucked up and accidently cut it off (doh!).  A local gunsmith with the proper ak rivet press installed a new rivet for me, its all good!  This gun LOVES high brass shells, and has no trouble cycling high quality low brass.  The fedral walmart value packs work awesome, the Winchester not so great.  I have gone trap shooting with this, and even with such a short barrel and no choke it worked great!  This gun seriously draws small crowds at the range.  So much fun!
