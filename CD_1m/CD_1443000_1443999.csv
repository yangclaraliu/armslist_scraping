The AR-57 is a American tactical version of the PS-90. It takes the same 50rnd mags but has a higher velocity than the PS-90!

Like I said this is a brand new never fired AR-57 if u have ever heard of one then u know exactly what your looking at! This shoots the 5.7x28 rifle round known to be (even the normal round nose) armor piercing ammunition. (Google it!) I have another just like this I built for me this was my girlfriends. I can tell u first hand this thing packs a hell of a punch on what ever your aiming at! 

This package comes with:
6-50rnd mags (5 nib 1 loaded)
300rnds of American eagle 40grain ammo (AP)
1 1-point sling (and proper sling plate installed)
1 AIM reactive site (red/green and 4 different rets)
1 set of MAG-PUL flip up back up sites! 
1 MWG (mag well grip) by fab defence 
1 ""catch can"" hollowed out mag to keep all 50 shells in a nice place for your convenience!!
1 forward grip with side rail and button activated bipod 
1 tac light with silhouette. Low light, high light, and strobe(mounted to forward grip)
And 1 just flat out scary flash guard with 6 fairly sharp points on it in case u just need to push some one away and not waste a round this will work perfectly! 

So like I said all new never fired. AR-57 upper on a fully polymer lightweight ATI Omni lower with a Plum Crazy internals kit!!! 

Please if your interested look at the videos on YouTube and see how remarkable this weapon truly is before offering me a lowball price or trade. I have alot of time and money into this unsung rifle! 

Oh yea it comes with the case behind it too! Fits everything u see here even the 5.7 manual

The resulting lower cost allows the buyer to select their own preferences in advanced aiming devices, specialty rails, custom grips. etc.

The SR556E has a single top Picatinny rail rather than the quad rail present on non-E models. The ""E"" handguard is drilled and tapped on 2"" centers at 3:00, 6:00, and 9:00 positions to facilitate mounting additional rails that Ruger sells separately

The SR556E is supplied with lightweight, folding, rapid deploy sights as opposed to iron folding sights supplied with the VT and non E models. A set of folding, quick detach aftermarket A2 type sights were installed on the SR556E, pictured left, for the purpose of live fire assessment.

The SR556E has a non-fluted Mil-Spec 41V45 alloy barrel; 4150 chrome moly with the addition of Vanadium for increased tensile strength. All other model SR556 firearms, with the exception of the VT utilize the same. The varmint rifle SR556VT's barrel is made from a slightly harder 410 stainless alloy. All model barrels, except E and VT series are chrome lined. All E series guns have a black oxide finished bolt carrier group, all other are chrome-plated

Popping away at 50 yards, using the sights small aperture, ended up with mostly 1.5"" to 2"" 3 shot groups. I flipped to the large aperture and shot... 1.5"" to 2"" 3 shot groups. Wasn't that exciting? 100 yard groups opened up to 4"" +/-. The combination of eyesight and iron sights resulted in groups not worthy of, and certainly not the cause of, the SR556.

Installing the Aimpoint ComML3 on the Ruger was like putting the last piece of a jigsaw puzzle in place. For me, it brought another dimension to the SR556. With the Aimpoint in place, the Ruger would shoot well inside of 1"" at 50 yards and under 1.5"" at 100 yards just by covering the center of the bullseye with the red dot.

The both eyes open shooting technique, combined with an absence of parallax, is such an asset when it comes to acquiring a target and following a moving target. If the dot is on it, the target will get hit and it is so much easier without the confines of a scope tube or an optical field of view. Double tapping a Folgers 32 ounce plastic coffee can at 30 - 40 yards was easy with the combination of Ruger SR556 and Aimpoint CompML3."

 The Bushmaster facility in Windham was closed and the employees were laid off. Soon afterward the original owner stepped back into the picture. He still owned the facility as he had been leasing it to Freedom Group since selling Bushmaster in 2006. He also had a 5 year non-compete agreement that was expiring soon. He must have felt as I do, that no one can make these rifles better than the folks in Windham, Maine so he decided to put another company together and put the workers back in business making these fine rifles. The new company was named Windham Weaponry and commenced manufacturing operations over the summer of 2011.

Also, you can quickly swap out barrels of nearly any size and even easily change calibers.  Note: This gun is the preferred and harder to find piston gas system.   

$2245 - Denver metro area, face to face, must meet all legal requirements, have I.D., etc. etc. Will also ship to your FFL if you pay for the actual shipping costs. In that case I'll accept discreet pay-pal or postal money order.

Designed and manufactured by Lewis Machine & Tool Company, the patent-pending Monolithic Rail Platform, or MRP, is the most radical variation of an integrated rail system ever conceived. This one-piece receiver/free-floating handguard/rail system is precision machined from a solid aluminum forging for absolute strength and consistency. The MRP completely replaces the upper receiver and provides an unprecedented level of versatility to the operator.

 - Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
 - 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
 - Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
 - Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
 - Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
 - Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
 - Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
 - M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
 - Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation

This is very rare gun because of its low serial number (5 digit) and fat trigger (NJ State Police Trigger).

It is a beautiful piece of German engineering, no warranty card  or box and (1) 13 rd mag. Everything is in near mint condition!   

The compact HK P7M13 can be drawn, cocked, and fired accurately, faster than any other pistol. With an overall length and width close to many .380 pocket pistols, the full-power 9mm has a full-length four-inch barrel enclosed in its low profile steel slide. The unique HK cocking lever allows it to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers around the grip.

Releasing the cocking lever decocks the P7M13 immediately and renders it completely safe. The gas system retards the movement of the recoiling slide during firing and eliminates the need for a conventional locking mechanism or heavy slide. 

The low profile slide contributes to the balanced center of gravity and compact size of the pistol. Made of high-grade steel, the low profile slide  keeps the recoiling mass as small as possible. Combined with the optimal grip angle of 110°, the result is a compact, accurate, and low recoil pistol well suited to civilian and law enforcement users.   

Features:

• Polygonal rifling for increased barrel life • Fluted chamber aids in extraction

• All steel construction •  Extractor also doubles as a loaded chamber indicator

• Fixed barrel ensures accuracy • Trigger guard heatshield

• Ambidextrous magazine release • Cocking lever control means complete ambidextrous function.

Bought a stripped rifle with the intent of building it. Is a lower and upper from an M&P 15-22. Of course I did my homework and contacted S&W about everything that was missing. As of last week everything BUT a front pivot pin was available and ready to ship. This included the bolt assembly. I was even quoted a price of $70 plus S&H. Was told the bolt assembly could be sent to me since the extractor was already fitted to the bolt, but separate bolt parts were a NO GO.

The new story now is the bolt assembly is a ""in house"" part only because it needs to be fitted to the rifle??? 

Anyhow, I need a whole bolt assembly. New, used, I don't even care if somebody has the connections and can get the thing to me. I'll pay them back for S&H. It just needs to work, and be complete.

Imported into the U.S. by H&K early to mid eighties (Has h&k import stamp) 1 of 5000 brought into the country and snatched up strictly for law enforcement / military use. This is the grand pappy of Benelli shotguns and arguably the fastest cycling shottie Benelli has ever produced. With this being a retired police gun don't expect a museum quality collectors piece but be assured this stout workhorse is in nice shape and runs like a machine when you get her going.

I bought the rifle 3 years ago and might have put 2 boxes of shells through it. I shot it 2 times this past hunting season and killed 2 deer. Very accurate and well taken care of gun. I bought the bow after 4+ years of not bow hunting and realized the reason I got rid of my last one in the first place. This bow is used but is in LIKE NEW condition. I took it out and hunted with it 5 times max. It has never been dry fired nor dropped and is in fine working order. I just dont have the passion to deer hunt anymore and would like to see them go to someone who does. I'm wanting to trade for an AR-15 but I'm also open to some other decent trades. Just let me know what you have. Call or Text REDACTED.

These are almost impossible to find, and I have one that I can get rid of.  Would like to trade for 4 boxes of FMJ .40, .45 or 6 boxes 9mm FMJ.  200 rnds of brass cased factory .223 works also, or 250 rounds of 7.62X39.  I am taking offers on this mag, so let me know what you are offering, worst I can say is no. $100 cash OBO.  Thanks for looking.  Here is a description of the magazine-
--This is a Ruger BX-25 X2 10/22 50rd. Magazine. Ruger came up with an innovative design to couple two magazines together. It comes with a rubber dust cover to prevent the intrusion of dirt and debris for the on deck magazine. Once the first 25rds. are used, all you have to do is remove the dust cover and flip the mag. over. As reliable as the standard BX-1 10-round Ruger rotary magazine. Stainless steel feed lips are designed to present cartridges into the action at a 30 degree angle for better feed reliability. Stainless steel, constant force spring provides feed consistency round after round. Anti-tilt follower is injection molded from a high lubricity polyacetal for consistent reliability."

From the Sig Sauer website:

Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220® Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights.

I am not too familiar with this series of rifle so forgive me if I don't provide a whole lot of helpful info. It appears that it was made in 1917 (By steyr), originally as an M95 long rifle and then cut down to carbine length as a lot were. All parts that I could find that were numbered are matching, front band, barrel, receiver, bolt and stock. Has the big ""S"" on the barrel shank behind the rear sight base. I found a ""K"" stamped on pretty much all of the parts as well (K = code letter for Steyr?). The barrel is in very good/excellent condition, very strong rifling and a sharp shiny bore. I've heard from a few people these carbines sometimes have minor cracks in the stock, this one has none, the stock is actually real nice. The trigger is also pretty nice as well, a little bit of creep but not as much as other owners seem to have in theirs. Very nice little gun in original condition. Also comes with a Nazi marked enbloc clip. I have never shot this rifle but have ammo to go with it. Link to pictures is below, sorry for the quality on the pic of the bore, I used my phone to take the pics so its pretty fuzzy but helps get an idea of the condition. INCLUDES 40 ROUNDS OF NEW SP PPU AMMO

1943 Izzy 91/30. One of the cleanest 91/30s I've had or shot. The bore is MIRROR sharp, not a single defect in it, looks like the rifling was just cut yesterday. All bluing is %100. Serial numbers are truly matching too, meaning all the parts have the matching cyrillic prefixes followed by the serial number. Bolt is so smooth I almost can't believe this was made in Russia during ww2. INCLUDES 80 ROUNDS OF CZECH SILVER TIP AMMO (30 are on strippers)

I have had this gun for less than two months.  I've only put 50-100 rounds through it.  Ten used to sight a scope, one through a pig's brain, and the rest just screwing around at the range.  It's in the same exact condition as when it came out of the box, except for a little brass kiss on the deflector.  I love the gun truly...LOVE it, but I saw something else I want.  So if there's interest I'll sell it, but I won't be low-balled because I'd be fine with hanging onto it.

Included will be everything that came with the rifle.  Rifle, clean as I can make it...my OCD helps with this part.  Bag, original PMAG 30 with dust-cover and paperwork (manual, Ruger ads, etc).  I snagged a Troy Battlemag a while ago, so you can have that as well.  I kept the box it was shipped in, so I'll put the back + extras in that.  If you need some ammo as well, I have various brands .223 and 5.56...we can talk about that if necessary.

It will not come with the Magpul stock or back up sights  as pictured.  I've got those sighted and this is my go to rifle until I get it swapped.  I'll sub back on the original stock before the sale.

$1400 O.B.O., Cash only.  I'll have a counterfeit marker to check it.

I prefer someone local, or I could ship through a dealer to your local FFL, you would pay transfer fee.

If FTF possible, I prefer someone with a CHL so I know you're not some asshole or junkie.  I just want to look at it, make sure it's not a photocopy...I won't record any of your information."

I shot a friend's G30 and was deadly accurate with it, but his sights were low and it drove me crazy.  The Gen 1 Glock adjustable sights were worse than horrible.  They were plastic and hung off the back of the pistol!  This was right when they changed to quality iron sights that came with a little tiny screwdriver to adjust the sights.  The way they are adjusted now, I put 10 rounds within a 2"" circle (from a Ransom rest) at 25 yards!!  Unbelievable accuracy, especially from a 'sub-compact' .45ACP pistol.

I've never carried the pistol, so it shows basically no wear.  What you see in the one picture on the rear groves is dust inside the valleys of the gripping points for racking the slide.  I didn't notice until after I'd taken the pics and put it away.  Otherwise, it's pretty well like new with the 2 factory ""commercial"" (don't really know what that means) 10 round mags and the sight adjustment tool in the original box that even says ""ADJ"" for sights on the box label.  I'm pretty well thinking that with this Glock being rather unique with the factory adjustable sights on it and it being unbelievably accurate, that I'd want to get $550 out of it in cash or trade for a similar value pistol.

I'd trade for a compact (not sub-compact; already have those) Beretta PX4 Storm, FNS in either .40 or .45 (already have one in 9mm) or an XDS in 45."

This non-expanding, deep-penetrating bullet has a lead core enclosed by a strong metal jacket. It provides smooth, reliable feeding in all types of semiautomatic handguns. All PMC cartridges must pass through rigorous inspection at an electronic powder check station. This station accurately measures the propellant charge in each round. If the propellant in any cartridge varies by just two tenths of one grain, the system stops and that cartridge is discarded. Few other ammunition manufacturers can truthfully assure you greater uniformity and reliability."

I have spent the last year and a half building this light machine gun for my “end of days gun” and I despise the idea of parting with it but something has come up that I can not ignore so I must part with it.  For those of you who don’t know the galil arm is a .223 caliber light machine gun model of the galil family, and is fitted with an integrated bi pod/barbwire cutter and a longer barrel than any other model. It is also fitted with a ventilated wood hand gaurd to keep it cool during sustained fire.  The arm model was normally used with the 50 round magazines of winch I have 3 but they will only be included as a result of a “buy it now” otherwise it will come with a standard 35 round magazine,  but the interesting thing is that there is an adapter to make it accept any M16 or AR15 type magazine winch is one of the many reasons I chose this particular gun to defend myself and everything I care about.  Weather its the rock solid AK action or the flip up tritium night sights or even the built in bottle opener (yea it relay has one) the galil arm is the gun that I wanted by my side but I have more pressing matters.  The gun itself is nearly complete only a few minor finishing details, the biggest of winch is that the receiver still needs to be Parkerizing.  Other than that its minor thing that only the most detail oriented of us need worry about.  If you are willing to wait I will Parkerizing the receiver for you but I must receive payment as soon as possible but if you decide to “buy it now” then I only need half now and the other half later.
