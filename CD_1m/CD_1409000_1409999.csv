This rifle will come with 4 magazines. (2) 20 round Tapco Magazines and (2) 30 round ProMag magazines. ALL ORIGINAL PARTS included. You can have a classic military surplus style rifle or a modernized tactical rifle. It's nice to have that choice.

Magazines shoot great. They are a little touchy with hollow-points. Nothing serious though. The fixed magazine will shoot anything you feed it always no matter what. 

There are two rails on the top and bottom on the Tapco stock allowing optics, foregrips, or bipods. In case you can't see in the picture, the finish on the stock is olive drab. There  is minor wear on the stock and gun itself. Nothing unusual though. 

This gun is fun to shoot in general. Accurate. If you want an SKS that is versatile, get this.

I'm selling because I can afford an AK now. My dream gun!!

I'm reasonable so don't be afraid to shoot me any offer.

Thanks and God Bless."

Since it was an issued weapon there is some finish wear, but this doesn't affect anything. In fact I think it gives the gun some character.

Only reason I am thinking about selling it is because I ended up owing the IRS taxes this year, otherwise I would keep the gun. I know you can buy a new one for around $600 to $650 but add the laser guard sight and 7 rd mag and I have $909.00 invested. Not willing to go down much in price, $850 would be my bottom dollar.

We’ve designed our SKS Detachable Magazines with serious shooters in mind. The mag body, made of high strength composite, has horizontal grooves cut into it for an enhanced gripping surface. We’ve used the highest quality interior components and incorporated a metal floorplate so you can expect maximum strength from this magazine. That, plus the fact that this mag is made in the U.S.A. so it counts for three compliance parts, you could say we’ve really thought of everything. Counts as 3 U.S. 922r Compliant Parts.

I took it home, cleaned it, fired 35 rounds through it, cleaned it again and haven't touched it since. The gun shoots the 5.7x28mm cartridge, a very capable cartridge that was designed by FN with the intent of penetrating soft body armor. The gun uses the standard Five-seveN magazines. The standard 
magazine holds 20 rounds, however, there are 30 rounders made and 10 round extensions to increase your magazine capacity to 30 rounds. The gun has a muzzle brake/compensator, non-reciprocating charging handle, and a picatinny 
rail on top for mounting a red dot or other optics. The gun utilizes the MAC design which means it is very reliable and built like a tank. It uses a straight blowback design which means that there is very little to go wrong. The gun is also very accurate (For what it is.) because of the low recoil nature of the round. The gun is also very fun to shoot. (I know from experience.) The bolt assembly is all CNC machined, further enhancing the gun's reliability. I deal in cash only.

A hard plastic case is also included with the gun.

The innovative high strength stainless steel CTA baffles allow it to be disassembled with ease and make it the most versatile and durable suppressor on the market. The Octane 45's interchangeable pistons mean caliber versatility as well. It can be used on 9mm, .40, or .45 cailber host firearms simply by swapping pistons.

The Octane 45 HD has a unique design for easy disassembly and user serviceability. The CTA baffle stack makes it the easiest .45 silencer on the market to clean. The unique click together design keeps debris from reaching the tube of the suppressor, which allows it to be disassembled with ease.

Here is a J-frame Snub Nose S&W model 38 Bodyguard.

Bodyguard
Next line of compact S&Ws began from S&W ""Bodyguard AirWeight"" model 38 revolver of 1957. This gun was a modification of a basic Chief Special revolver with the main intention to improve ""carry-ability"" and ""draw-ablity"". It was the same 5-shot, aluminium-frame, side-open cylinder revolver in .38 Spl, but it featured shrouded hammer with only a small tip of the hammer exposed. This allowed for manual cocking, which could improve accuracy, but prevented the hammer from snagging into clothes or other obstaces during the fast draw.

Good condition - small tight gap between cylinder and barrel (that's a good thing), the cylinder is solid and does not wobble. It shoots very well.

I have put maybe 60 rounds through it, although I've only owned it a few years.


Excellent weapon for conceal carry - flat hammer is unlikely to be caught on clothing, etc. Small, light and concealable. It's extremely safe (much more than a semi-auto). Perfect for a backup gun too.


I bought this weapon for $425.  without accessories at Tanner.


I have the original wood handle with diamonds for collectors that will be sent with the weapon, but also included is a crimson trace grip w/batteries and red lazer. It has slightly extended grip for comfort and accuracy. It sells for $299 new (Though you might be able to get it for $250 on ebay, based on my latest google for it).

I also have a galco right hand ankle glove holster, with extended second leg strap and the boot extender. It's some of the best, really comfortable!
The ankle glove sells for $94

The Calf Strap is $22

and the boot extender is $29

I also have a De Santis internal Belt Holster Pro Stealth - $40
as well as a pocket holster, about $20 in vale.

Total Value : about $900. You get it for $600 (local special, I'm selling it for more than that on gun broker).  (plus I had to pay separate shipping on most of those items - you only pay one shipping fee or none if we meet in person)
For my next CC I can use the calf strap and boot extender, and maybe the pocket holster. So I will take off $50 off if you don't want those.     

I am willing and interested in trades too!"

Compact, concealable, secure and versatile, the open-muzzle design of the Silhouette™ makes it a favorite of gun carriers who own multiple barrel lengths of the same firearm model. 

Hand-molded to fit specific handgun frames, the Silhouette features a reinforced thumb break for security, combat grip accessibility for speed, double-stitched seams for durability, and covered trigger guard for safety. 

Its unique two-piece construction is contoured on the body side to the natural curve of the hip, keeping all the molding on the front of the holster, allowing for significantly more comfortable carry and a narrower profile than an ordinary pancake type holster."
