All the reliability of a buckmark pistol in a short rifle platform. The 18 inch bull barrel adds accuracy to an already accurate firearm with the extra weight keeps it very well balanced and it will not loose accuracy from the barrel heating up during rapid fire. The larger circumference would allow the barrel to be threaded for a compositor or suppressor to make this one dirty gun. This is a perfect learner gun for a young adult or a car gun because of its small size. The top rail will accommodate anything from small red dots to scopes.* I am becoming a river guide this summer and need some extra cash to pay for training. This is a loved rife and does have a couple of nicks but all are small as happens when trudging around the woods. It was well kept and cleaned. I will strip and clean it before selling it to anyone.

I am wanting to sell my Redfield Revenge 4-12x44 Varmint ""Range Finding"" Reticle Scope.
The scope is in Excellent condition. Has great glass for the price range and the reticle is very nice to have for coyotes and p-dogs. The scope has see 400 rounds out of a 22-250.

The only issue with the scope is I lost the Elevation Scope Cap switching between coyote stands and has a slight scratch on top of the objective bell. Other than that the scope is in perfect working condition, and has good clear glass. I just re-barreled my 22-250 and would like to invest in another scope. If you are intereasted and need pictures I will be more than happy too send you any!. I do have the original box and possibly the original owners manual that came with it. If you would like the rings I will give them to you for 15 dollars extra to the price, they are weaver steel grand slam rings (Medium Height) Thanks for looking and have a great day!

This is a beautifully example of a professionally done conversion of an original H&K 91 semi-automatic rifle into one of the desirable ""HK51"" short barreled fully automatic rifles. Conversion performed by ""Fleming Firearms"". They started with an original HK91 rifle with a ""IB"" date code receiver (1981), as the base weapon. The original ""H&K 91"" receiver markings were removed and the receiver was faithfully remarked ""HK51"" directly in the same area, while retaining all the remaining original markings. During the conversion this rifle was upgraded with a military style G3 ""paddle"" lever magazine release and was fitted with an original ""Clipped & Pinned"", ""S-E-F"" metal trigger housing. During the conversion the original barrel was shortened to the current 9 inch length. It has been fitted with an original H&K sliding paratrooper buttstock with a short laminated handguard/polymer plastic vertical front pistol grip and a solid walnut rear pistol grip

BBL: 9 inch round
Caliber: 308 

Registered Receiver

Condition: Excellent with 99% of the black finish overall. The bolt head and bolt face show no firing marks, however it was probably test fired by Fleming after their conversion. The sliding buttstock and pistol grips are all excellent. NOTE i only recievers money order"

The SAR ARMS K2P Semi Auto Pistol is truly amazing. The K2P has a square barrel / slide lock up (for greater surface locking area), DA / SA trigger (for fast accurate shot to shot repeatability), locked and cocked carry safety system (for a simple and safe manual safety), auto firing pin block (for the added feature of a blocked firing pin unless the trigger is pulled), Low Barrel Axis (for reduced felt recoil), Three Dot Sight System (for fast target acquisition), Integral Accessory Rail (for the ability to add accessories as desired) and a grip that is amazing considering the capacity.

The good;
Starts and runs great. Can sit for weeks and still fire up first try.
Shifts smooth.
New wires ran for head unit and speakers.
Great interior (one rip in driver seat, rest is intact, just needs a good cleaning.)
No rust, no dents.
The bad;
Paint is bad
Needs the upgraded band to shift into overdrive (never got to the shop for the recall on the old band, other than that no problems with the transmission)
No speakers or radio, just wires ran.
Power locks not working, all other power options work great.
Egr valve will need to be replaced within the next few months, goes in and out right now. Last I saw about 50 dollars from autozone.


Would be a great car for city driving or DD with the new band. Or a great 5.0 conversion as the body is straight. Asking 900 obo may trade for the right stuff (aka partial trades on guns or ps3, no xbox's anything will be considered, worst I can say is no.)

Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic

**As of 2012, Aimpoint has removed their LE/Govt/Security ONLY restriction to the PRO.**
Designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in a emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique Features
Always red - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.
In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking and maintenance easy.
Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared to iron sights and magnified scopes.
Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with Aimpoint 3X Magnifiers and Concealed Engagement unit.
Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).
Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.>
Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with both covers closed in an emergency.
Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.
Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles. (Adapter available for carry handle mounting)
Removable spacer. Remove for use on shotguns and sub-guns.
QRP2 rail grabber mount. Snap knob three times for a perfect mount. Will not deform your rail like many other mounts.
Recessed lens openings helps prevent against impact damage, fingerprints and scratches.

Any offer that is of fair market value will receive a return email and placed on a list for May 31st. at which time the best offer will get the chance to purchase.

NEAR MINT CONDITION Lee Enfield, this is a 1919  British Australian Lithgow built just after WW1 and probably never saw war, although it does seem to have been arsenally rebuilt. Was purchased in the 90's and has been sitting in a safe ever since. I have shot it very little. It has strong to perfect rifling in the barrel. It head spaces correctly and leaves you with reloadable brass. Has many cartouches and is marked under the rear sight JJ CO. This rifle is just to nice to be sitting in a safe. It should be hanging on a wall in someones hunt club, cabin or man cave.

If this post is up it's still availible.
I'm willing to answer any questions, just ask. Just ask before May 31st

Pretty decent Forest Service green paint. Not perfect, just decent. Nice interior, seat was reupholstered not long ago. Still needs finishing on a few things like running lights and markers.

NO ENGINE! It's got an electric motor from a forklift instead! Linked directly to original four speed manual (a clutch is not needed for EVs) Meth addicts stole all but 2 of the batteries, so it's NOT moving at this time. According to the previous owner (who was someone I got to know and trust, not just a random craigslist weirdo) what it needs to move under it's own power is for the throttle switch to be hooked up and of course batteries. How many batteries the truck needs depends on how far you want to go. In theory, one battery could move it, you would just have a short range. I have been told that you can buy twice the number of 6 volt batteries, which cost more, but you get better range out of them. Tires are good.

Email is the best way to get a hold of me, or call 659-5599 and ask for Mark. I'll show it any time I'm not at work or out of town. Truck is located in Merlin about 6 miles off of I-5 on a friend's property. Will need to be towed or hooked up the rest of the way.

REGISTRATION STATUS: Truck does NOT have plates on it. Not sure if they're in a box of parts or MIA. Comes with a clean Oregon title in the previous owners name.

Rare gun (as keltec is not making any gun) .  Here's a few info from keltec website...
The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

This is a beautifully example of a professionally done conversion of an original H&K 91 semi-automatic rifle into one of the desirable ""HK51"" short barreled fully automatic rifles. Conversion performed by ""Fleming Firearms"". They started with an original HK91 rifle with a ""IB"" date code receiver (1981), as the base weapon. The original ""H&K 91"" receiver markings were removed and the receiver was faithfully remarked ""HK51"" directly in the same area, while retaining all the remaining original markings. During the conversion this rifle was upgraded with a military style G3 ""paddle"" lever magazine release and was fitted with an original ""Clipped & Pinned"", ""S-E-F"" metal trigger housing. During the conversion the original barrel was shortened to the current 9 inch length. It has been fitted with an original H&K sliding paratrooper buttstock with a short laminated handguard/polymer plastic vertical front pistol grip and a solid walnut rear pistol grip

BBL: 9 inch round
Caliber: 308

Condition: Excellent with 99% of the black finish overall. The bolt head and bolt face show no firing marks, however it was probably test fired by Fleming after their conversion. The sliding buttstock and pistol grips are all excellent. N OTE: This is a Fully Automatic Weapon, which is registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44 and 27 CFR part 478."

New Gun Laws Took Effect July 1! 
Here's what I've learned that the news is not disclosing---

State law limits the amount the FFL Dealer can charge for Background Checks to only $10. It's basically a tax; the store must turn it over to the State.
The store must retain records for 20 years

With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots."

This rifle in excellent condition overall and has only some minor handling marks from being bumped in the safe. It has seen very little use as evidenced by it's ejection port that has little to no wear. The rifle is based on the famed AUG A2 platform with a few key modifications that allowed it to slip in under Clinton's assault weapons ban. These rifle are rare and unique with only 3000 ever imported into the US. They possess all of the great attributes of the AUG A2 plus a heavy match grade 20"" barrel making this the most accurate AUG ever made. This particular rifle has been modified with the quick change barrel button seen on A1's A2's and A3's. To be clear, This is the genuine factory Steyr 20"" heavy barrel that came with the weapon. The only modification to this rifle was the addition of the barrel change button. It originally came with a lock screw to get the rifle in under the 1994 assault weapons ban so that owners couldn't do quick barrel changes to barrels with flash suppressors.The scope is also the genuine SWAROVSKI that came mounted on the rifle and has never been off. The rifle comes in a nice black case with it's factory scope adjustment tool, sling, factory accessory rail to mount iron sights or non-factory optics, two (2) thirty (30) round magazines, and it's manual.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly.


    MUR-1A (with bolt assist) showing the right side. Mounted to the MUR-1A is a CASV-S rail/handguard system.


The MUR comes in two models: one with Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector (part# MUR-1A) and the second with Shell Deflector only (part# MUR-1S). Vltor offers the selection at the time of purchase, but does not offer a service to exchange the Bolt Assist or Shell Deflector. 

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door.

some ammo available, but running low on that. I have enough rifles for your friends as well, so fuel costs are minimal if 2 or 3 of your friends want a rifle and want to split the gas!  Or get an extra one to sell and offset your fuel costs.  It seems these guns sell for more than 200 in both LA and the bay area.

6 available as of this morning, in addition to that I have a few with Hex receivers, some ex-snipers, some MO marked guns, etc.  those would be slightly more expensive.

these are 50+ year old guns, so they do not require a dealer transfer. Take them home with you same day.
