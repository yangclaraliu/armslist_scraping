No pics yet, since I really want to get a feel for interest in this gun.  But it's a no joke barely used like new condition Rifle Dynamics full upgrade AK-47.  About as good as it gets.

This post is not for the 99% of people on this site just looking for an AK, if you know about Jim Fuller then I don't have to say anything else.  I don't need to sell it, I'm not even sure I want to sell it, but for the right price and to someone who knows what they're actually getting, I would sell it.

Description
This is absolutely the best upper receiver on the market and is perfect for your custom AR 15 build!

Product Description of the Vltor MUR-1A Upper Receiver
- The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

- Fits all AR-type lower receivers made to Milspec standards. Will fit all select-fire AR-15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. Will fit most of the semi-auto AR-type lower receivers (currently available).

- Height of rail (from the centerline of the bore): 1.215”. Weights (10 oz)

- The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

Refer to pictures and description for information, it is all the information I have on this item.  Price is firm.  Would consider POSSIBLY trading for a nice mosin nagant, preferably a carbine (T53, M44, M38) or sks (I would include cash).  Cash is king though and I will sell to first $160.  Once again, price is firm, I will delete any low ball offers or any other BS e-mails.  Hopefully there is someone out there who like me just wants to complete their AR15 build with a still scarce part.  Thanks for looking.

Tango Down Website:

""A basic problem for plastic magazines is that they have to have a constant curved interior to be molded in one piece. There is no other way. But the magazine well of the M16/AR-15 weapon system is straight. So much compromise has to be reached from a design standpoint to make the two work together. So side effects of magazines not dropping free, are often seen. The optimum solution would be a straight upper section to properly present cartridges through the magazine well, and a constant-radius lower section to accommodate remaining ammunition. However, this design has been impossible to produce in polymer… until now.

The patent pending two-piece modular construction allows us to create the ultimate magazine for many reasons. In addition to the proper magazine form, we are able to achieve maximum strength and integrity when the components are molded. Precision molding is achieved much easier on two small parts versus one large one. We can also mix materials, impossible with conventional plastic magazines. We can offer transparent-solid color lowers/high tensile strength upper sectioned magazines that avoid the brittle feed lip issue of all-single material construction. Modular construction makes perfect sense for the unprecedented strength- we eliminated the removable floor plate, so the magazine becomes a five-sided box. ARC Mag survives the impact that crushes metal magazines.

ARC Mag takes full advantage of the latest polymers available from the aerospace industry- materials impervious to the effects of solvents & lubricants. After molding, we permanently bond the two sections together with advanced adhesives during manufacturing, so no disassembly is possible, or required. ARC Mag has a unique low-friction semi-floating follower that is slotted to allow for easy magazine cleaning. Just dunk the ARC Mag in hot soapy water, rinse and invert to drain. That’s hassle-free maintenance. ARC Mag also features a premium stainless steel spring. Life expectancy for this spring is 100,000+ cycles.
The Tango Down design team created a magazine that could be handled by the operator in any condition- note the aggressive ridges front and rear. They allow a positive purchase when seating the ARC Mag. The deep waffle pattern on the magazine’s sides assist in rapid extraction from mag pouches. Every surface on the ARC Mag was given careful consideration to help out the operator.”"

The trigger mechanism operates in selective DA and SA mode depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI P accommodates 14 rounds of 9mm Luger in an extended magazine...a lot of pirepower for a conceled carry gun. With a 3” barrel, and unloaded weight of less than 24 ounces, the black polycoat. The rear sight is adjustable and this gun is very accurate even at 50""  I was shooting tight patterns separated by less than 2"" at that distance.  The gun has about 800 rounds through it. The gun comes with two 15 round magazines.  The CZ Rami has a a solid feel when shooting especially witht he extended magazine.  Firm on the price but will entertain a trade for a Glock of equal quality/value. This is a great conceiled carry or range gun."

You can load everything except 50bmg on this kit. Add a bullet and pull the lever; all other operations are automatic. One loaded cartridge with each pull of the lever. Every operation is automatic. Primers, like the powder, are fed only if a case is present. No wasted primers or spilled powder. Alternate loading sequence lets you load only one case at a time. Makes learning easy for the first time user and great for fine adjustments or experimenting. You can start reloading good ammunition minutes after the press is bolted down. Change calibers in just 3 minutes. Comes with turret ready to run 45 ACP, and a second turret with 38 SPL (38 SPL dies need the flare funnel for the auto charge), shellplates for both calibers, disks for powder measure, large and small primer feeders. Also comes with a new rifle charging die if you are going to convert to small rifle. This thing is ready to rock.

12 GAUGE / 3-inch

Made entirely of 18-2 polished stainless steel and select Walnut, this custom shotgun has exquisite fit and finish. It is from a limited production run of only ten ever made, and has a single-digit serial number, 20-inch barrels, 3-inch chambers and a gorgeous Grade 2 wood stock set with engravings. It's slim and nimble, and an absolute pleasure to handle. 

German-made quality throughout. Please don't confuse this with what passes as ""coach guns"" these days. This one has the precise, Old World quality levels associated with guns of the past - with some added benefits from the modern age. 

The Coach gun style of shotgun will probably be one of the very last types to be included in any new, mindless anti-gun legislation. It's also one of the most effective and history-proven personal defense weapons ever designed. This particular one should last several lifetimes of serious use due to its superior craftsmanship and the material from which it is made.  

Maybe the ultimate SHTF firearm . . . ? 

I cannot get any further (proper) photos of this one,  but will meet to show."

They are hard to find. Don't overpay for a Bushmaster. CORE 15 is new to the AR market but they are making an amazing rifle. Please do your own research and you'll will see what I have learned about them. The term mil spec is over used in my opinion but CORE does use manufacturing processes like MPI to ensure the highest quality parts. No i don't work for the company but I was sold on their guns. I was originally going to buy a Bushmaster and hadn't heard about CORE 15. After looking at their rifles it is was a no brainier between the two. It's not a Colt, but for the price you can't beat them. Their current price is $1299 and the wait is at least 6 months minimum. I have listed the specs from their website. It does come with one 30 round PMAG. This gun has been used only 3 times for coyote hunting. It has less than 50 rounds fired throug it. I'm only selling it because I need the money for a down payment on a new house. I'm firm on the price; I love this gun and will not let this gun go for cheap, so please no low ball offers. It does come with a Bushnell red dot sight and case. If you don't like the camo paint job it's easy to remove to the original Black Rifle.

These are American made 47 round magazines for the AK-47 7.62x39 round. Made by Master Mold N.C. USA.

All have been used once and a couple twice. They work great, with no hang ups or jams. I am trying to tighten up what I have for magazines, so these fun ones have to go. I also have the inside spring, bottom slide and rail that holds the rounds from an additional one that had the mis-fortune of being run over (they are poly style plastic not steel). 

These go for roughly 14-20 new plus shipping, when they are in stock of course. I have done my research and am merely trying to get fair market value (basically what I paid or them). No need to be crazy with prices, like a lot of listings on here. 

They have been tested in a WASR-10, Maadi AK and Norinco Hunter AK and fit good (all have needed to be filed a bit to fit).

I purchased this firearm off of a dealer at gunbroker.com 1 month ago and despite having HARDEST time trying to find a glock right now in florida I have decided to either trade or sell my glock 26 gen 4 because I have fallen in love the colt pocketlite .380 

I am selling the firearm with ALL original items (3 ten round mags, speed loader tool, 25 corebon hollow points and 25 speer gold dot hollow points, also a glock range bag, the stock glock hard case, the safety lock, paperwork)

The gun is in perfect condition. No scratches and only 150 rounds were put through it the day I picked it up from my local ffl one month ago. I have not shot it since. 

Please email me if you want me to send pictures. Also email me your highest offer and I will keep you posted.

thanks for your time and enjoy. Buyer will have to fill out a bill of sale for precautions. I will also sign the bill of sale and give you all the required info like my name address and D.L. number. 

This is my first private sale of a firearm. Looking forward to buying my colt .380 after I sell this gun.."

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016
