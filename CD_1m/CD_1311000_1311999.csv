Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

 A favorite of many hunters and shooters, the Short Rifle was fast to the shoulder, quick-swinging, lightweight and a pleasure to shoot. It was a favorite of the range rider who could snatch it from his saddle scabbard and fire faster than prairie lightning. The new Winchester® Model 94® Short Rifle has a compact 20"" deeply-blued round barrel and a straight grip walnut stock. It has a rifle-style forearm, black grip cap and a full-length magazine. It’s drilled and tapped for scope mounts, and a hammer spur extension is included with the rifle. The sights are traditional with a semi-buckhorn rear and a Marble Arms® gold bead at the muzzle. With the new Short Rifle Model 94 there’s a lot of fun waiting in the saddle, in the field or at the range.

It has a deburring tool, a digital powder scale, a powder thrower and trickler, an electronic caliper, and dies for a 30-06 in it. It has a powder funnel, a hand priming tool, and even an almost new spray bottle of case lube. All I have done with this kit is de-prime some spent brass I had just sitting around. It is in new condition and has everything needed besides powder, primers, and bullets. This kit came with a Nosler reloading manual so that will be included as well. I am putting this up for sale because I am very interested in buying a tractor. Spring is here and the garden needs plowed and our gravel driveway is awfully washed out.

Mossberg is joining industry heavyweights in the AR-15 market such as Remington, Ruger, and S&W. Mossberg wants to differentiate themselves in the market by going with a A2-style (carry handle) receiver instead of the A3-style. Featuring A2 front and rear sights with a carry handle picatinny rail if you want to mount optics. Most tactical .22s have a 16"" barrel, but Mossberg has decided to go with an 18"" barrel for a better sight radius and a more traditional look. Also featuring a full length picatinny rail hand guard and a 10 round or 25 round magazine. Mossberg is offering these guns in a fixed and an adjustable stock.

It is a highly desirable ""pre-HK lawsuit"" model. Let me explain a little about what is meant by ""H&K lawsuit"": in 2009, H&K brought suit against German Sport Guns for 'trade dress' infringement. Essentially, H&K sued because the GSG-5 looked exactly like the real MP-5 manufactured by H&K. The lawsuit was settled and GSG subsequently changed a few things in the design to make it look different from the MP-5. Among the changes, the post-lawsuit guns have a slotted rear sight and open front sight. So pre-lawsuit guns like this one are as close as can be to the real MP-5."

    A rifle is a firearm designed to be fired from the shoulder, with a barrel that has a helical groove or pattern of grooves (""rifling"") cut into the barrel walls. The raised areas of the rifling are called ""lands,"" which make contact with the projectile (for small arms usage, called a bullet), imparting spin around an axis corresponding to the orientation of the weapon. When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile and prevents tumbling, in the same way that a properly thrown American football or rugby ball behaves. This allows the use of aerodynamically-efficient pointed bullets (as opposed to the spherical balls used in muskets) and thus improves range and accuracy. The word ""rifle"" originally referred to the grooving, and a rifle was called a ""rifled gun."" Rifles are used in warfare, hunting and shooting sports.

Typically, a bullet is propelled by the contained deflagration of an explosive compound (originally black powder, later cordite, and now nitrocellulose), although other means such as compressed air are used in air rifles, which are popular for vermin control, hunting small game, formal target shooting and casual shooting (""plinking"").

In most armed forces the term ""gun"" is incorrect when referring to small arms; in military parlance, the word ""gun"" refers to an artillery piece or crew-served machine gun. Furthermore, in many works of fiction a rifle refers to any weapon that has a stock and is shouldered before firing, even if the weapon is not rifled or does not fire solid projectiles (e.g. a ""laser rifle"").

Formerly, rifles only fired a single projectile with each squeeze of the trigger. Modern rifles are capable of firing more than one round per trigger squeeze; some fire in a fully automatic mode and others are limited to fixed bursts of two, three, or more rounds per squeeze. Thus, modern automatic rifles overlap to an extent in design and function with machine guns. In fact, many light machine guns (such as the Russian RPK) are adaptations of existing automatic rifle designs. Generally, the difference between an automatic rifle and a machine gun comes down to weight and feed system; rifles, with their relatively light components (which overheat quickly) and small magazines, are incapable of sustained automatic fire in the way that machine guns are. Modern military rifles are fed by box magazines, while machine guns are generally (but not always) belt-fed. While machine guns are often crewed by more than one soldier, the rifle is an individual weapon.

The term ""rifle"" is sometimes used to describe rifled weapons firing explosive shells; for example the recoilless rifle."

Just like brand new put around 300 rounds down the barrel. The Rifles not even broken in yet. Actually I barely got it warmed up.Like any gun enthusiast you know it shoots the 762 X 39. I call it the destroyer because any target you shoot it destroys. Every time you pull the trigger the bullet comes flying down the barrel. This rifle works perfect no hiccups just perfect. this rifle has been well well taken care of and I am the only owner. This AK 47 comes with (3) 10 round magazines. The only reason I'm selling this rifle is because I have two kids to take care of.Thank you for looking at my list!!!!!!!
