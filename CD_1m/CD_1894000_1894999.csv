 This pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Details:

This GG&G ACCUCAM Quick Detach Locking Lever is designed specifically for EOTech 511, 512, 551, & 552 Holographic Sights. The ACCUCAM assembly replaces the EOTech's socket head screw or thumb nut cross bolt quickly and easily with the included tools. Once installed, the EOTech sight can be mounted to, or removed from, your Picatinny or Weaver rail in seconds by rotating the ACCUCAM Lever.

Unlike many other attachment systems, the ACCUCAM does not add any height to the EOTech. This maintains the operator's ability to co-witness the host firearm's iron sights, and preserve the all important perfect cheek-weld. The repeatability of the ACCUCAM has been tested and proven to hold within 1/2 MOA, this creates a negligible change in point of impact for all but the most critical of situations.

The design of the ACCUCAM is ergonomic and virtually snag-free by virtue of its sleek rounded design. Operators wearing gloves will have no problems removing or installing their ACCUCAM enhanced EOTech.
    -Does not raise the height of the EOTech
    -Rounded design is ergonomic, & virtually snag-proof.
    -Applicable to EOTech 511, 512, 551, & 552 holosights

These guns are virtually identical with slight differences.  Apparently Armalite was the original developer of this firearm for use in the war.  It was then sold to Charter Arms and they built it for some years until selling it to Henry.  The Charter Arms is used and I will take 200.00 for it.  The Henry has never been fired, comes with an extra mag and I will let it go for 260.00 .  These are pretty cool guns, they completely disassemble and store in the stock for storage, fitting in a packpack or other go bag.  They will even float if dropped in the water, I have never tested this but seen it online.  My prices are firm.  Thanks for looking"

We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied. 

I paid right around $450 shipped to the door for the pair of these. I will let them go for $350 for the pair. I also have available 1 gallon of Zinc Phosphate Parkerizing Solution and 1 gallon of Post Treatment Solution, both new and unopened I will sell with the tanks for $75 additional.  I paid $62 + shipping for the Zinc Phosphate and $35 + shipping for the Post Treatment Solution. Located in Dublin and you must be willing to meet in the Dublin/Northwest Columbus area for the sale."

Includes 7 often difficult-to-obtain lower finger adjustable (pinky) 13-rd magazines, original case, a tactical carrying case, and a new (never been used) Crossbreed Inside the Wasitband (IWB) Holster (see photos for all).

PISTOL INFORMATION:  This Beretta PX 4 Sub-compact has often been called the ""Snubnoise pistol"" of the Semi-Auto genre.  It is an exceptionally comfortable pistol to both hold and shoot - excellent for home defense or legal concealed carry.  It's a very accurate firearm and I made it a point to obtain additional magazines that have the adjustable finger (pinky) extender, thus allowing you a great grip on the pistol.  Each magazine holds 13 rounds.  I am also including an excellent tactical carrying case and a new Crossbreed Holsters Inside-the-Waistband holster made for the PX-4 (again, see photos below for all).

REASON FOR SELLING:  Just have too many firearms - am not shooting much anymore, so I've been steadily downsizing.  Please note that the magazines alone cost close to $50 each (depending on where you purchase them from).

SELLING PRICE:  $595 for all - Cash.  Please - no trades are being considered.  Will sell only to those who either have a valid NC pistol permit or a concealed carry permit.

LOCATION:  I live in Fuquay Varina, which is 30 minutes south of Raleigh, NC off of highway 401S.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.
Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.
The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.
Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents.

The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0 g (93 grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge—making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.

One of the design intents of the SS190 variety of this cartridge was that it have the ability to penetrate Kevlar protective vests—such as the NATO CRISAT vest—that will stop conventional pistol bullets. When fired the SS190 is capable of penetrating the CRISAT vest at a range of 200 m (219 yd), or a Level IIIA Kevlar vest at the same range. However, sporting variants of the 5.7×28mm are classified by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as not armor-piercing. Which means civilians can legally own, fire, and carry the ammo.

The FN Five-seveN® pistol was developed in the early 1990s and features a cold hammer-forged barrel that is chrome lined for extended service life. The polymer-framed FN Five-seveN® offers single-action operation, low felt recoil, 20-round magazine capacity and is equipped with an ambidextrous, forward-mounted manual safety and an accessory rail that accepts tactical lights and lasers

THIS WAS AMAZINGLY FUN AMMUNITION TO FIRE OFF AT THE RANGE!!!!!

I am asking $99 per box and I have 2 total boxes available as of this posting.  I will accept $190 total for both boxes.  I'm sorry, but my price is firm.

This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable nickel-plated brass cases.   This is top of the line, American-made defense ammo designed for Law Enforcement and now available here!  It doesn't get any better than this for personal protection.

Winchester made the ""Black Talons"" that were labeled ""cop killer"" bullets and after a fury of media backlash simply made a little tweak to the ammunition and now here they are again.  LEGAL.

Winchester Ranger 9mm T-Series 127grain +P+ Hollow Points.  This is the *MOST* powerful 9mm ammo you can buy!  If you thought 9mm was hard to find right now, these are nearly impossible.  

The T-Series (Talon) is designed to be one of Winchester's highest performing loads with it's nickel plated case, reverse taper jacket design, and reliable expansion through a variety of barriers.  

Winchester has set the world standard in superior handgun ammunition performance and innovation for more than a century. And to millions of hunters and shooters worldwide, the name ""Winchester"" means quality and performance - and the most complete, versatile and high-performance line of handgun ammunition in the world. 

In addition, for more than a century, Winchester has been the first to answer the call to arms by producing billions of rounds of small-caliber ammunition for the United States military and its allies. So, no matter what the sport, game or circumstances, you can always depend on every handgun cartridge in the Winchester Ammunition line to perform - as promised

Once again, innovation is the ""watch"" word for 5.11 Tactical Series. When we set out to design a watch we wanted one that would truly serve the needs of law enforcement. The Field Ops Watch has all of the features needed for day to day activities and includes our revolutionary SureShot calculator. In a partnership with Horus Vision, makers of proven long-range ballistic software, we bring sophisticated point of impact software to your wrist. We give you the ability to input thirteen critical variables needed for long range shooting solutions quickly and easily. Our shooting solutions are provided in Mils, True Minute of Angle (TMOA) and Shooter's Minute of Angle (SMOA). And that's not all, this rugged watch can take a real beating. We've beefed up the Field Ops Watch pins to stand the strain of a wrestling match, sealed the watch for 30 meters of water resistance and given you a controlled backlight so you can see your data when you need it. This great looking timepiece is perfect for any activity. The Field Ops Watch has all the features you'll need for work and play. We've included digital day, date, and two digital time zones. Along with an audible alarm, there is an hourly chime, a countdown timer and you can check your lap times with a digital chronograph. We've included a uni-directional bezel along with a backlight. The Field Ops Watch also has a fully functional digital compass which can be adjusted for true north readings. And last but not least, we've given you a full function ballistic calculator. The SureShot calculator accepts thirteen critical shooting variables to give you point of impact shooting solutions out to 1000 meters. Input your known ballistic data (bore height, ballistic coefficient, muzzle velocity and zero range), then add your environmental data (range, temperature, altitude, inclination) and the SureShot calculator will give you a shooting solution in MILS, TMOA or SMOA. You can even get your solution in clicks for both windage and elevation. The calculator is very easy to use and most of the variables can be put into the Field Ops Watch before going out to the field. This full function time piece is unique in the world of watches. The Field Ops Watch has a high-density polycarbonate frame which is light weight and tough. The mineral crystal face is scratch resistant and reduces glare. We've beefed up the watch pins to secure the watch to your wrist in even the most arduous activities. The Field Ops Watch has a lightweight titanium case, comes with a hard rubber band. We've included an optional extended band so that you can wear your watch over outerwear. That way your SureShot is available anytime you need it."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

I have put about 400 rounds through it and not one malfunction. it also stays much cleaner and is easier to clean. I am selling a great assault rifle (the Ruger SR-556ESC) with some (in my opinion) needed upgrades. First off, I am selling it with the Bushnell TRS-25 red dot sight ($125) which I bought a 1/2"" riser block adapter for ($20) to raise it and make it easier to see through without cocking your head to the side real hard. second, the rifle originally came with a collapsible LOOKING buttstock which was actually fixed so I bought an OD green magpull buttstock ($70) which feels and looks great. also I installed an extended charging handle latch ($10) to make the charging action easier. finally, I installed front and ambidextrous rear swivel sling mounts ($65) so you can do some tactical type shooting. to be clear, I am not selling it with a sling you'll have to buy that yourself. I am however including the pop-out bipod foregrip which I installed a picatinny rail adapter for (in case you didn't know, this rifle comes totally clean with no picatinny rails). the rifle came with a 10 round mag but that's for sissies so i'm throwing In a basic 30 round. the rifle is listed on the ruger website for $1375 and that's obviously without all my upgrades so my asking price is fair but negotiable. also, I have all the original equipment so if there are any of the upgrades you don't feel you need, the price can be adjusted accordingly without them."

The advanced SureFire SFMB-556-1/2-28 muzzle brake, which fits M4 / M16 weapons and variants with 1/2-28 muzzle threads, greatly reduces both recoil impulse and muzzle rise so that the weapon tracks straight back to keep you on target for faster shot-to-shot recovery.

The SFMB-556-1/2-28 also serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56 mm Fast-Attach® suppressors, the SOCOM556-RC model having placed first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted by US Special Operations Command.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths and in either 5.56mm NATO or 6.8mm SPC. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."
