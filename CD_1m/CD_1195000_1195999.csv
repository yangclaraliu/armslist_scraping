It is a very nice scope, but I sold the rifle and the guy did not want the scope. This is the Nikon description of it:
--Brightvue™ multicoating: Bright, multicoating optics deliver up to 92% light transmission. 
--Large exit pupils: Improved low light hunting at dawn or dusk, when the game is usually moving. 
--Quick focus eyepiece: Allows the shooter to instantly bring the reticle into sharp focus. 
--Waterproof, fogproof, shockproof: Nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed. REALTREE APG HD Camo: Melts into hardwoods, pine thickets, prairies, river bottoms and other environments—delivering the kind of “season and region” versatility you demand. 
--Precise, hand-turn 1/4-MOA click adjustments: Positive-click reticle adjustments get you zeroed-in quicker and maintain your setting even with heavy recoil. 
--Sunshade adaptable: Optional accessory sunshade eliminates glare in particularly bright conditions and keeps dust and rain off of the objective lens on rainy days or in dusty environments. ..

The barrel has three holes in it and the first 1/2"" of the muzzle is cut off. A new barrel can't be inserted because of the welded closed buffer. 2 blocking bars are welded into the middle of the receiver so no bolt can be inserted.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The squared trigger guard allows easy access. The new flattend single stage trigger is set to a very fast 1.5lb pull. It has henning copetition grips for a thin profile. (I have 3 sets of grips, they were over $100 each). All the internals have been replaced and is completely balanced and has just about 2 complete sets of springs to go with it. I has a competition holster for quick draw as well as 2 competition mags. It comes with 2 different sizes of flared mag wells and all the releases are extended for speed. It is drilled and tapped for optics. It has a match grade barrel the is tapered cone for lock up. It has a full shroud. I have only put through about 150 rounds of match grade ammo. ~~~~ I am not hurting to sell just curious to see what is out there.... Like I said I have the reciepts for this and is not inflated at all like most guns today. THERE IS A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE OF MY EXCACT GUN...

Comes with a variety pack of Benjamin hunting pellets and asking 125.00 firm. Other rifle is a GAMO Hunter Extreme in .177 with advertised muzzle velocity of 1650fps with alloy pellets. Has a Vortex 3-9 drop compensation scope, which is 175.00 new and has only been used to sight the rifle in. Asking 300.00 for the rifle and scope as both are virtually new and replacement cost would be 575.00 . Looking to sell to finance the rest of my custom AR build, thanks for looking.

Also in this package is a Ramline side folder stock. My other Ruger 10 22 is set in it right now to give you an idea of what it looks like.

On the bottom is the original wood stock.

The magazines pictured in the middle (from left to right)

- Pre-ban 50 round Mitchell Arms Inc. belt fed magazine
- Pre-ban 30 round Ramline spring fed magazine.
- Pre-ban 50 round Ramline spring fed magazine.
- (2) Eagle International 10 round magazines. They attach back to back so that when one is empty you can flip it over and reload.
- On the far left is a Shooters Ridge Magazine loader - it allows you to reload any Ruger 10 22 mag with ease and quickness.
- Also comes with original 10 round magazine.

I'll throw in 100 rounds of .22lr

This is a great opportunity to not only get a Ruger 10-22, but all that you could ever want for it.


WILL TRADE FOR:

Looking for AR 10 or M1A.. I'll make up the difference in cash or .223/5.56x45 or .308/7.62 NATO ammo.

I'll also entertain offers for anything else you may have."

I  just got one of these from Midway for 60.00 this morning. It sold out quick but watching a few sites on the internet sure beats paying some guy 200.00 for buying something he didn't want so he could mark it up three times what it is worth and sell it to you.

I also bought some Federal Auto-Match bulk packs locally yesterday for $18.00. I didn't wait in line or get there early, I just walked in during the middle of the day and bought a few.

The shortage is coming to an end and it will end much quicker if people stop paying inflated prices for cheap ammo. These ammunition companies are not shutting down production any time soon, they are in it to make money and the supply will quickly catch up with the demand.

What you're basically getting is a rifle that was recently purchased for $3400 plus over $200 in goodies.  Reason I'm selling is because I couldn't get what I was looking for for my SCAR 17S and needed to get rid of one of them.  As much as I love the ACR, the .308 SCAR is a different animal IMO.

The EMAG (Export MAGazine) is a lightweight 30-round 5.56x45 NATO polymer magazine that features a number of aesthetic and functional changes from the PMAG®. While EMAG remains 100% compatible with the AR15/M16 platform, its unique geometry is optimized for foreign-made weapons such as the British SA-80 (L85A1/A2, L86A1/A2, L22A1, L98A1/A2), HK 416, M27 IAR, and others.

EMAG features the same pop-off Impact/Dust Cover as the PMAG GEN M2 to prevent dirt and debris intrusion and protect the feedlips from potential impact damage during transit and storage. When not in use, the Impact/Dust Cover can be stored on the magazine's floorplate to prevent possible loss.

For easy and accurate identification of loaded round count via the large, dual-sided MagLevel windows, the stainless steel magazine spring is coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color. Numerical indicators are added to the body to identify 5, 15, and 25 loaded rounds."

It's in flawless condition and fires great. I have put 50 rounds of assorted defense ammo through it with no problems.

This LIKE NEW pistol comes with two 6 round mags and a carry case. and a DeSantis Superfly posket holster.

It's a straight shooter; I'm selling it because my daily carry is already small enough to carry anywhere and I don't need two different calibers.

The DB380 differs from most small modern pocket autos. Most have a hammer action, but the DB380 is striker-fired. It has a positive mechanical firing pin block for safety, and the twin action bars and striker action result in a very smooth and relatively light trigger pull. The square profile slide and disassembly system give the DB380 a Glock-like appearance. (It looks like a baby Glock.) The DB380 has a locked-breech action, and a striker that is set by the retraction of the slide. The trigger is made of steel, and has a smooth face for comfortable operation. The magazine holds six rounds for a total loaded capacity of seven, and the magazine catch is made of stainless steel. Another nice feature of the DB380 are the sights: I can actually see the sights on this pistol well enough for them to be useful."" -- Jeff at Gunblast

No other rifle holds the power and mystique of the legendary Winchester® Model 70® Super Grade - the ultimate expression of the rifleman's rifle. For the first time ever. This is a matched set of four truly unique limited production Winchester Model 70 Super Grade rifles, each of which is chambered in a cartridge that's ideal for the game animals they commemorate, and is so marked on the magazine floor plate. Only 100 of these sets were manufactured for Midway USA Foundation by Winchester.

The varmint rifle is chambered in the blistering 22-250 Remington, the deer/antelope in the flat shooting 270 Winchester, the elk/moose in the potent 300 Winchester Magnum and the dangerous game rifle in the bone crushing 375 H&H Magnum. All of the classic Model 70 Super Grade features are present - the fancy grade checkered walnut stock with shadow line cheek piece and ebony fore-end tip, the engraved cross bolt head and the traditional Super Grade pistol grip cap. Each of these beautiful rifles is built with the Pre-'64  style action that offers a forged steel receiver, massive external claw extractor, controlled round feeding and reliable blade ejection. The pictures do not do these rifles justice. They are stunning.

Not only did Winchester only make 100 of these 4 rifle sets but...they do not make a Model 70 SuperGrade in 22-250 or 375 H&H Mag. This adds to the value and uniqueness of this set. These rifles are NIB...never been fired. In 2012 one of these sets auctioned for $16,000.00 up in Wyoming in a Wild Sheep Foundation Auction. See link...

$70 per box / 70¢ per round average cost.

It is better that my good neighbors have this ammo than it sitting in my basement. 
No sense paying $1 per round at other online sources either. Appleton Fleet Farm has 223 soft point available (God bless them) for $1 per round, so use that as a local price point. Yes, soft point is better for social work, but 223 FMJ scooting out at over 3000 fps isn't ticklish either.

Make yourself an AR74 by dropping this onto your existing standard AR15 lower and save at least $500 on every 1000 rounds of ammo. 1080 round sealed cans of surplus AK74 ammo are still only about $160. It is in stock right this moment at Wideners for $180 (yes that is the price for 1080 rounds!). The AK74 round in this caliber is by FAR the cheapest military spec'd ammo to acquire now, has nearly the same ballistics as 5.56 (it actually performs even better out of shorter barrel lengths), and is more destructive on impact. For those of you that are not familiar with the AK74 or 5.45x39 caliber ammunition, see below for an interesting read. For sale is one brand new Spikes Tactical complete 5.45x39 caliber 16"" Upper Receiver Group. This Corrosion Resistant Upper features a Melonite finish inside and out. Features include a top quality Lothar Walther Barrel with Nickel Boron (NiB) treated M4 Extension, Melonite coated F-marked FSB, Melonite coated Gas Tube, Stainless Roll Pin, and Melonite coated A2 Flash Hider. Built to handle the dirtiest surplus ammo with no ill effects and still be a breeze to clean. Price is $800 for this brand new in box special limited production Spikes Tactical 5.45x39 Corrosion Resistant Upper without bcg and charging handle, or $1100 with bcg and charging handle included. It takes the same bolt carrier and charging handle as any other AR15 in .223 / 5.56, only the bolt is different and must be for 5.45x34 so you may use your existing AR15 bolt carrier in it as long as you swap the bolt with one designed for 5.45x39. 

During the 1960's the Soviet military made the decision to convert their assault weapons from 7.62mm to a reduced caliber of higher velocity. This was based in part on studies of the American made M-16 during the Vietnam conflict. They felt that the United States may know something they didn't and decided to follow their example. This did not sit well with Mikhail Kalashnikov who felt that the M-43 7.62x39 cartridge was sufficient for all modern battlefield needs. Even so he began work on a new weapon to chamber the smaller cartridge.
The task of designing the cartridge fell to a group led by Viktor Sabelnikov. Other prominent designers on the team were Lidiya Bulavskaya, Boris Semin, Mikhail Fedorov, Petr Sazonov, and Petr Korolev. Their task was to develop a 5.45mm low impulse cartridge that would be more accurate than the cartridge currently used in the AKM assault rifles.
The result was a small caliber bullet of very high velocity. The bullet also has good sectional density and a fairly flat trajectory. Despite being lighter in weight than its predecessor, the 5.45mm cartridge retained the same lethality as the older round. It can penetrate a 5mm steel sheet at 350 meters, not bad for a 53 grain bullet.
Another feature that contributes to the lethality of the cartridge is that it becomes unstable when it strikes an object. This means that although it flies perfectly well through the air, it tumbles violently after striking a target - creating a larger wound channel when compared to a normal bullet. This was accomplished by leaving a hollow space at the front of the bullet which makes the round imbalanced on impact with flesh or wood.

REVIEW: This caliber is just great fun to shoot. We tested it in a Romanian rifle with eight 30 round magazines. Recoil is SO LIGHT and it functioned 100% of the time. No malfuntions at all. Overall, this is SUPER GOOD SURPLUS."
