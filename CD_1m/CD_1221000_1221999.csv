-----------------------------
From BERETTA.COM:
The Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and
interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
6. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol. (not included)
7. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
9. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
10. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
11. Barrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling."

You are bidding on a BRAND NEW, FULLY  CUSTOMIZED AR/AK Rifle.  We started with a factory Sig 556R piston driven rifle and built from there.  This rifle is absolutely new and in factory packaging, never fired, and no magazine has been inserted.  .    

This gun is the work of a gun enthusiast, a gunsmith, and a swat team professional, and the finished product is something you will be proud to own.  This gun used the Ever popular, cheap and plentiful 7.62x 39 Ammo, with lots more stopping power than a 223/556 round, and its piston driven for less cleaning, and the reliability of the AK-47.  It truly is the best of both worlds.   

TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable
 operation and function.

188,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1221188,"Want To Buy:  AR-15 LPK, Mil-Spec Stock & Buffer Assembly, Possibly an Upper as well!","Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, March 9, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Alright, so I have been wanting to build an AR for over a year now, finally got up enough saved up to comfortably buy one and go to check prices and everything is insane and OOS. So i'm coming to you guys for some help. I found my mags already (to anyone needing mags, wait to buy until you find a good deal. People are buying them for resale at gouged prices, but rarely does anyone pay those prices, they eventually drop down to a much lower price!) Also found a pretty reasonable stripped lower (get on ar15.com and start an RSS feed on the lower thread, whenever your notified be ready to buy!) and now im ready to start actually building. Unfortunately the LPK seems to be just as hard as the stripped lower! There are plenty of stock assemblies, but it's just hard finding some at a halfway decent price!

I am only willing to pay 70$ for the LPK. This doesn't have to include the grip, but i would prefer that it does. MUST INCLUDE FCG! I don't want to cross one thing of the list and add one more afterwards. Grips can be bought at normal prices still, FCG's are sold out or triple the normal price!

Looking for a Magpul Mil-Spec stock assembly with mil-spec buffer (of course) and the other required parts. Not going to put a price up on this because it will vary between models. ONLY looking for a black MOE or CTR(?) model.

I do have 4 GI mags and a 5 position adjustable foregrip (BNIB) never used that i would be willing to add in as a trade to knock the price down if your needing mags or a foregrip. I MAY also be willing to trade my Black Grip Pod foregrip as well. I believe this is the law enforcement model but can't be for certain. For anyone that doesn't know, this is a heavy duty (but very light weight) foregrip with a spring loaded bi-pod, that extends after pushing a button (button located above the grip on the rail mount so you don't accidentally push it.) This was used, but shows no signs of wear aside from the dirt. I bought it off a friend in the military who used it in Iraq on his last deployment. It's a 150$ forgrip, and IMO well worth every penny. He used it all the time to keep his AR propped up and ready for action rather then laying it on it's side. 

For the upper, i am very picky on this and don't expect to get any offers, but i figured i would post up what i wanted anyway. 

Looking for a mid-length set up, NO CARRY HANDLE, 18-22"". I am looking for either a bull-barrel or free float upper. Rails are a plus! .223 only. May consider others though, but generally that's what i am looking for. 

I won't be able to pay cash for this for about a month or so, so if your looking for a quick sale, i probably won't have the money for a little bit. I DO HAVE a basically brand new Sig Pro 2022 .40 . Bought last october from buds by the original owner, he wanted a smaller gun for conceal and carry (although this one is small enough to conceal), and had only ran 50-100 rounds through it. I bought it off him, and have only ran a single mag through it to ensure that it worked properly. It was then thoroughly cleaned and placed back in the box! Will come with original cardboard sig box, 1 12round mag and the manuals that it came with. Serial number is still on it, and matches the original box!"

Or, you can have these on your Compact 1911 for only $239.00 - over a $100 savings over the factory direct pricing!

So, here's your chance to capitalize on my impulsive purchase error! 

The set is new, and comes in the original box with all the goodies. 

Fits Colt (Officer's and Defender), Kimber (compact, ultra-carry and ultra-elite), Para-Ordnance (compact, single-stack), Springfield Armory (compact and ultra-compact) Wilson Combat and most other 1911's with grip screws measuring 2-11/16"" apart.

The 7.62x51 NATO (.308 Winchester) PMAG 20LR is a lightweight, cost effective, high reliability magazine for SR25/M110 pattern rifles featuring true 20-round capacity, constant-curve body, and snap on Impact/Dust Cover.

You do not need a new gun; just a new upper. Introducing the S&W M&P15R upper in 5.45x39 caliber specifically designed to offset the rising cost of 5.56 ammo.

Complete upper, bcg, ch and two 30-round mags for only $850 firm.

1520 rounds of ammo is only $450 extra.

The 5.45x39 ammo is still readily available. (NOT 5.56 NATO!) And yes they make non corrosive ammo.

Ammo available:
100 rounds Non Corrosive Hornady 5.45X39 60 gr V-MAX
1000 rounds Non Corrosive Wolf
420 plain paper wrapper Russian

This is not a ""panic buy"" price but an actual current market value for a collectible caliber rifle upper. Although the ammo is available, these rifle uppers are not. They are very hard to find. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. That is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of these uppers are no longer in production they will continue to rise in value even after the ""panic buy""  market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson introduced the M&P15R Rifle Upper Receiver Assembly). This rifle upper is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifle upper comes with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel.

The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

It has been enhanced with several $$$ added features. Springfield built this gun on a Springfield Series 70 frame and slide.

It has been Enhanced with a Wilson Combat (match) barrel with attached screw on compensator (also takes a suppressor or just a knurled thread protector) a Wilson bushing & link. Has S.S. Mag well, Target grips, Wilson Extended takedown and safety and an extended mag release button. Also has the Wilson two piece solid guide rod with spring and reverse rod holder.

This gun with the enhanced trigger group including combat hammer, has as nice of a trigger pull on it, as guns costing twice as much as I'm asking. I believe the series 70 frame and slide has something to do with that as well.

Slide and frame fit like a glove, and move as smooth as glass together, with no play or hesitation at all and makes the gun much more accurate than I am as a shooter. I would consider the overall finish as 98%+.

If you are looking for an easy shooting (reduced recoil because of the compensator) .45 for pleasure, tactical use, or to possibly get into a little competition, without a lot of investment, then this is the 1911 for you.

I already have (5) other .45's so I decided to sell this little treasure to someone that can do it justice.

May consider the following pistols as potential trade material with some added cash on your end, if they are in excellent LNIB condition:

$275 Please no lower offers..this is an $700-900 Camera new and works as such. Hate to let it go especially under circumstances..This is a steal!! Just need the cash asap!! Might accept nice quality revolver or pistol in trade as mine is also on the chopping block & if it sells first I will be selling my camera to fund a new purchase ... SW 442, 5900 series,Taurus Judge,etc...Just quality piece...doesn't have to be an $800 one but would like more in trade value vs cash as this is a top notch camera. I don't think a Kel Tec P32 for this camera would be a fair trade. Also Microtech OTF,Benchmade Balisong  considered as i have an immediate buyer for one.

 Hoping someone that's been wanting or needing a high end professional camera but maybe couldn't afford it will be able to jump on this. This takes those Pics that really make a difference. If you purchase it to make money ,no ill feelings. If I could afford the time it would be listed at $400+..unfortunately i don't have the time all the sudden.


As seen here at $900!! Same camera yet much much more expensive.

Priced to sell asap!!! Just lost job of 5 months today while on work Comp unpaid 2 weeks + off??? After being jumped by a group of punks while working security at a local hotel and to boot my little girl turns 5 Sunday! Fired for doing my job?? 

Perm nerve damage to face so far...expected a  paycheck this week as I thought being seriously injured in the line of duty meant id be paid for my time off healing...Drs orders of course...well no check, nor intent to give me one.. but a notice of termination?? Oh how id love to name this east side hotel! Didn't bother to call & ask how I was doing after laying knocked out for 4-5 mins in their parking lot after wading into the crowd to extract a desk clerk who found it her job to break up 
this riot vs waiting on PD. 

Listing many items to move asap, yet I hate to see go, at steal prices to make up for my mistake of doing my job vs sitting back watching a co worker get beat up, regardless of how ignorant & neglegent her actions were. (not her 1st time) Sheesh!! Is this correct? What's this world coming to? 

Oh yea icing on the cake...not only did they knock me out cheapshot style but as i layed there completely out for 5 mins!! She was kind enough to watch the crowd steal $480 in a money clip out of my pocket, my badge which wthe hotel now wants me to pay for as well as my OC spray and ASP baton both of which i had to buy...

Please excuse my rant but that's half of how I feel and why you'll see so many listings from me. 37 & yet to have ever claimed unemployed but I guess I'll learn that process as well but 100% sure it won't help me by Sunday.

The Daniel Defense Rail Interface System (RIS II) was designed at the request of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II weapons system.
SOCOM had a specific requirement for a free float M203 solution and Daniel Defense designed a revolutionary product to meet the government’s need.
The Daniel Defense RIS II allows the individual operator to free float the M203 grenade launcher with no additional parts nor any special tools. This was accomplished by integrating all of the needed parts to free float the M203 into the rail itself.

The NSR handguard was designed with the goal of being the lightest and smallest free floating forend option to the M16 family of weapons. The width of the NSR handguard before accessories have been installed is only 1.48"" The NSR handguard is available for sale as standard equipment on our rifles and upper assemblies, as well as a separate component for sale to the public. Available in 7"", 9"", 11"", 13.5"", and 16.7"" lengths. 

The KeyMod inter-locking rail system is a collaboration between Vltor Weapon Systems and Noveske Rifleworks. Separately, both companies were in development of their own systems, but later realizing that both systems were similar, a standardization of the KeyMod system came to be. 

The KeyMod system offers a mounting platform for a variety of (future) accessories and components. The days of the Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) are numbered. The future of the direct mountable accessory is here and now. The KeyMod self-contained components/mounting hardware index and V-block onto the platform, achieving a secured and accurate hold to the system, while separate lugs take the recoil force off the fasteners. The pass through attachment method eliminates the need for loose screws and backing plates that can easily be lost, or difficult to install. Another advantage of the KeyMod system over the 1913 system is the direct attach eliminates the need for the 1913 system as a ""middle Man"" thereby reducing weight and accessory off-set from the center of the handguard.

You do not need a new gun; just a new upper. Introducing the S&W M&P15R upper in 5.45x39 caliber specifically designed to offset the rising cost of 5.56 ammo.

Complete upper, bcg, ch and two 30-round mags for only $850 firm.

The 5.45x39 ammo is still readily available. (NOT 5.56 NATO!) And yes they make non corrosive ammo.

This is not a ""panic buy"" price but an actual current market value for a collectible caliber rifle upper. Although the ammo is available, these rifle uppers are not. They are very hard to find. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. That is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of these uppers are no longer in production they will continue to rise in value even after the ""panic buy""  market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson introduced the M&P15R Rifle Upper Receiver Assembly). This rifle upper is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifle upper comes with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

Don't fall victim to the the dirty tactics of these gun grabbers. If something doesn't smell right, then do not meet them. Observe and follow all state mandated waiting periods! Add an extra day to any transaction and have proof of that waiting period, such as emails, phone calls, etc.. Let the potential buyer know in advance that you need them to fill out a bill of sale which includes their name, address, phone number, FOID number, etc. If you are arrested after following all state laws, then I advise you to contact your lawyer, the ISRA, the GOA and the NRA.

This is not a ""panic buy"" price but an actual current market value for a collectible caliber rifle upper. Although the ammo is available, these rifle uppers are not. They are very hard to find. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. That is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of these uppers are no longer in production they will continue to rise in value even after the ""panic buy""  market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson introduced the M&P15R Rifle Upper Receiver Assembly). This rifle upper is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifle upper comes with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.
