FNX™-45

The FNX™-45 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

Alloy frame, with stainless cylinder and barrel
The upper part of the frame, as the photos show, shield the hammer; but still exposes its cleat-serrated hammer spur enough to produce a cocking motion for precise single action firing. The lightweight stainless variant of the Airweight Bodyguard, the 638, was introduced as a limited run in 1989, then added as a regular part of the Smith & Wesson line in 1996, when Smith & Wesson beefed up the J-frame sufficiently for it to handle High Performance +P ammunition. This third, current variant of the 638 has a .312 MIM Metal-injected-Molded .312 smooth combat trigger and MIM flat-faced hammer with floating firing pin. All S&W Revolvers have an internal transfer bar safety that prevents accidental firing if a loaded weapon is dropped, and in 2002, the 638-3 entered the market with Smith & Wesson's patented internal lock. Barrel length is 1 7/8 inches, and this 5 shot pocket revolver only weighs 14 5/8 ounces empty."

I'm the second owner and the first owner carried it in the early 80's as a duty weapon, cleaning it more than shooting it.

20 Rounds through it to ensure full function handled like a dream and OMG I knew it looked cool but I had no idea how popular this thing made me at the range. Great gun and the kit smoothed out alot of the play in the trigger that is common with old SKS's

The sight is sight-mark ultra with a laser on a polymer riser. THIS OPTIC AND PACKAGE ARE BRAND NEW for this weapon only 20 rounds through the whole package to verify functionality but It is not zeroed I just wanted to make some noise and ensure it ran flawlessly.

The other custom work involves fitting and the assembly. I took 4 1/2 inchs of the end and removed the bayonette lug. It will accept the high cap polymer mags with some mild filing I am adding a 30 round PROMAG brand new but I wasnt sure if I was keeping it so i didnt want to clearance it.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

No Trades at this time

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. 

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on G-broker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

They do not make these anymore because they were starting to compete with the higher end parent company DW drums, so now they just make low end stuff.  This is the perfect opportunity to have everything you need for one price and know that it is good quality stuff.

Everything here is in good shape, well taken care of by a serious and caring musician. Everything here new totaled approximately $4,000. I'm willing to let it go for $2,000 worth of firearms. I'm interested in AKs because I already have guns in 7.62, but I'm also interested in ARs (especially one in .300AAC) and anything that you have that is of good quality.

I have a delton  upper with a 7.5in chrome Molly barrel, Yankee hill low profile gas block, Midwest free float rail system. The only scratch is a small one on the right side of the rails. Otherwise the upper is in perfect condition and operation. I'm only wanting to trade this upper for another, longer upper, if ur lower is not compatible with the delton then we can easily switch the barrels and rails can keep our receivers. I am willing to ship but will not ship first, I have plenty of feedback on eBay and  I'm just an honest guy. I will not sell or part out this upper, only trade. Also none of the accessories are included. If anyone is interested in trading give me a text/call or email, number is REDACTED.

The PPS-43C is chambered in the potent and battle-proven 7.62 x 25mm Tokarev due to its highly penetrative characteristics. When there isn't a nationwide buying panic going on, This ammunition is readily available in both new production and surplus offerings. Even though derived from a folding stock SMG, this closed-bolt model is ATF approved - the stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the 14” barrel length weapon is classified as a pistol, not a SBR. It comes furnished with one(1) 35rd magazines, oiler, cleaning rod .. The PPS-43C offers substantial firepower in a very compact and light weight platform. It is a natural candidate for a SBR conversion (subject to NFA compliance). Hi-cap pistols of this genre are becoming increasingly difficult to find among suppliers; availability may be very limited to non-existent in the future due to pending ban and Nato Treaty talks in March for Small Arms Treaty.

This is a limited edition Glock 19 with the EXO finish by FailZero.  This unique, breakthrough technology creates a permanently lubricious surface, harder than the substrate itself, which eliminates the need for grease, oil, or any wet lubrication for the life of the weapon. Unlike films, conventional coatings and applied lubricants, it will never rub off, never flake off, never build up crud. EXO Technology eliminates wet-lubrication failures of critical components, giving you an ""active weapon advantage"" under all conditions.  (http://www.taloinc.com/glock.htm).

This pistol has a very low round count - excellent accuracy and a great shooter.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.
