The rifle operated perfect with zero issues. Also included is the Aimpoint CompM2 4 moa Red Dot. The rifle and Aimpoint were purchased brand new and I have all the boxesThe M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. 


The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

Under present circumstances perhaps an even better time to act.

Not only is this Colt a rarity in its caliber - 7.62x39, it is in near new condition, but without box, manual, or goodie bag. The firearm has been well kept and was purchased ""like new"" as a bare gun in the early 90s by the owner I bought it from. A replacement trigger group had been installed and the original was since lost.

This very meticulous 2nd owner removed the Colt carry handle upper, put it away, and replaced it with a flat top (PWS?), put in an accuwedge, changed out the flash suppressor and fired a few rounds now and then with it. He also told me up front his flat top upper would not chamber steel case or poly coated cartridges. Brass was all he ever shot through it. When I purchased it he replaced the upper with the original, still unfired. I have the original flash, and ""good guy"" 5 round factory steel mag.

SInce I bought it I have exactly 40 rounds through it - also brass FMJ. 20 PMC Bronze and 20 Fiocchi. I can say that the weapon is an absolute joy to fire. The well-balanced old school Sporter design with A2 stock and carry handle, combined with the R6830 buffer spring setup make the felt recoil about a wash compared to a 5.56. (My Colt 6720 M4 shooting 62gr XM855 kicks much harder.) On its iron sights at the back of my 25 yard range this Colt is also accurate - on its first box of ammo from the beanbag it shot sub-2"" groups with the PMC.

Included in the sale are some very rare accessories. In addition to the beautiful rifle I am including 4 high capacity magazines: two 20 rd, one 30 round, and the 75 rd drum. No markings but I believe these to be early USA ""frankenmags"". (This refers to ""obvious"" grafting the AR15 upper mag body to the AK47 lower.) I have not tested these for cycling but they are in very good to excellent condition. A magazine selection like this is VERY hard to find.

Along with the rifle and mags is a VINTAGE beauty of a scope - 3x20 Colt 1960s Japan manufacture and in near mint condition. Worth $4-500 alone, it is a nice companion piece to the rifle.

To set up the new owner I am also including 100 rds of the Fiocchi 124gr FMJ ammo."

I believe they stopped production of these guns back around 1997, so these don’t come up very often on the market and are fairly rare.  I purchased this gun new in 1988 through a local gun shop. It was purchased new as a 357 Mag, and I later bought a 45 Win Mag conversion kit for it as well.  It is currently setup with the 45 Win Magnum kit, but can be changed over to 357 Magnum in about 15 minutes.  This gun has a hard chrome frame and a blued slide, as well as a hard chrome finish compensator.  These guns had many upgraded parts right from the factory such as Millett sights, and Pachmayr/LAR grips, ambidextrous safety, as well as other upgrades.  I have the original box & manual that came with the gun, which will go along with the gun.  The items included in this sale are as follows:

LAR Mark I Grizzly Win Mag pistol (serial# A0054XX)
357 Magnum kit with 2 magazines
45 Win Mag kit with 1 magazine (currently installed)
Original box & manual
Spare recoil springs for both 357 Mag & 45 Win Mag

1 package of Wilson Combat #2B Shok-Buff (recoil buffers, 5 new left)

This gun is in very good condition, with very small pitting on the frame in one or two locations.  This is a large intimidating weapon for sure!

Barrel is a 16"" 1/9 twist Bushmaster that has been Cryo. treated.

Upper receiver and Barrel were professionally fitted together only allowing .0005 clearance between the I.D. of the upper receiver and the O.D. of the barrel extension. 
Upper was professionally duracoated by Firepower Arms LLC.  in Mason OH. 
You can't build this upper for $500.00.
Upper is Shoots under 1 MOA with Hornady match ammo.

This is a beautiful Model 94 chambered in Winchester 32 Special. The wood is near perfect and the barrel has no rust or pitting at all. The receiver is done in a copper finish which is very attractive. There is one small blem in the copper finish on the right side of the receiver in front of the loading gate. For a gun manufactured in 1965, and from the condition this rifle is in, I would say it has had very little use. It appears to have been someones safe queen.

Colt Diamondback, NEAR-MINT Condition. Stock # MSH252102SP. Serial # 573xx. One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is an exceptionally handsome Colt Diamondback revolver. In the scarce and desirable .22LR caliber, the pistol has a 6” factory vent-rib barrel,and an adjustable factory rear sight. The pistol is finished in a very deep polished commercial factory blue that is the spitting image of Colt’s Royal Blue that adorns the Diamondback’s ‘big brother,’ the Python. This particular revolver has one of the most beautiful pairs of factory wooden checkered grips we have ever encountered on any Colt “Snake Gun.” The grips are a very deep, marbled brown color that contrasts vividly with the gold-plated Rampant Colt medallions – truly, this is a SPECTACULAR Colt Diamondback! The pistollooks to be unfired, it has a very faint turn line on the cylinder, and the only imperfection whatever on the gun Is some scratching of the grip finish on the butt, and you have to turn the pistol completely over to see this. That notwithstanding, we still rate the pistol at 98% condition. The bore is MINT, and double action trigger pull is smooth as silk. Without exaggeration, this is an exceptional .22 caliber Colt Diamondback that will literally take your breath away when you see it!

I've owned all sorts of ""black rifles"" and I'll tell you what; I know what to look for when doing a build.  This build is off of a HD-16 (since people were gouging parts), but has only the highest quality parts that I had to scour the internet for.  Personally, I think this is my best build to date and I am rather proud of it.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend has a young child and she raised concerns about the AR-15 looking too much like a toy, so since it's the building part that I like, I figured I'd offer it to you guys. :)

Now, I know everyone's screaming ""The ban is dead! $500 for an AR!"", but that's simply not going to happen.  You can find cheaper rifles, yes, but their fit, finish, and over all quality are going to reflect that.  The market will take quite some time to get back to normal and I see ""custom"" rifles still selling for $1,400 and they're just stock black rifles with a new grip or buttstock.  This rifle has 18 modifications (the ones I remember) and they were installed with care and precision as this was going to be the build I kept.

I am asking $2,400 o.b.o. and I legitimately want you guys to shoot me offers, even if they're a good amount lower.  I'll also look at partial trades if you have pistols in 9mm, a full sized 1911 in .45 cal, or a Remington 700 or 870.  Seriously, it's not about the money (I HAVE to recover cost at least, though) it's about building the rifle and my girlfriend feeling safe.  Unlike the other rifles, unless you want optics, you won't have to add anything to this rifle; it's 100% finished.  Face to face and cash only.  Valid FL driver's lisence and bill of sale required.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!  Have a good one!

I am looking to sell this - not to profit - but to get as much of my money back as possible (as at a gun shop I'd likely get $500) to put toward buying a long-range rifle (Remington 783) and paying off some bills. I'd like to keep it but other things are more pressing at the moment so I am offering it for sale. Given this, I will give you my cost for the gun and accessories:

As I said, I shot this once (60 rounds) and after shooting took it completely apart and cleaned it with FrogLube. I am very meticulous about the cleaning of my firearms so I can assure you it's in great like new shape.

I have this listed at $1,500 cash for the entire listing of items but am open to REASONABLE and SERIOUS offers. As I said before-I am trying to be able to get a less expensive firearm and pay some bills without losing too much money on this gun.

I do require that we do an FFL transfer for the firearm. I am aware you can do private sale in Ohio with a Bill of Sale but I'd rather go through this extra step to ensure everything is on the up and up given this type of firearm and all the negative press about it the last few months.

Upon serious offers I will send pictures of the gun. Please note I will not be able to send photos until mid-evening due to my work schedule. I can communicate via e-mail during the day though for any questions.

DoubleStar doesn't spend as much on marketing as some of the more well known brands. Spikes, Colt, Bushmaster, Windham, S&W, Sig Sauer, Daniel Defense, PSA, olympic, DPMS and Bravo Company all make fine ARs. They also spend more to promote them, so their names may be better known.

DoubleStar Corp’s Origin
Many people ask “where did DSC come from?” After 25 years of success with J&T Distributing selling black rifle parts and accessories, Teresa and Jesse Starnes (Double-Starnes’) created a full line of complete weapons to satisfy the thousands of requests to build an AR-15. The J&T Distributing customer base demanded a rifle that incorporated the versatility and quality that J&T had been providing them for so long.

Manufactured in Winchester Kentucky, DSC has continued to supply not only the commercial market but military and law enforcement forces across the world with high quality firearms they can depend on. Every rifle built uses only US made parts, and is built with precision, care, and pride. Each rifle is built, test fired... not just some rifles... all of them.


Differences in AR-15 type rifles?
Some general info provided by an FFL that specializes in black guns...
USGI and/or mil-spec.: 
Commercial parts are made by casting and stamping, which requires weaker, softer steel to do. Parts wear out faster. USGI and mil-spec are forged and milled, much harder steel. And commercial parts don’t always work with mil-spec if you need a replacement, whereas all mil-spec works with all mil-spec. 

The DoubleStar costs more, but it is all USGI, all mil-spec. The DS-4 is a rifle with flattop. It does not come with a rear sight. They do that due to differences in personal preference. 
The DS-4 Comes with magazine and manual. 

The DS-4 bolt and carrier are far superior to most commercial ARs. Many commercial AR vendors say they have a mil-spec bolt carrier... probably not completely. The DoubleStar is USGI, M16 blueprint (no others can say that), all parts x-rayed and particle tested. Carrier is internally lined for the bolt travel and has a chrome firing pin. 

Finish and machining on the DS is far superior to most all manufacturers, and they use a higher grade 7075 aluminum. Most commercial manufacturers use 6061 aluminum, substandard and not mil-spec. 

I can go on and on. Only the billet and really high dollar manufacturers can really even compare to DoubleStar… And if I was to stake my life on it, I would want it to be the DoubleStar…"

The flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms J.A. Nine is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range.

I know all Nagants have gone up due to all the regs and stuff, but $400 for a Nagant is crazy. I bought a MINT 91/30 from a dealer with all acc's and bayo, and sling for $99.99 in August. So a realistic price would be nice!!!

Like new Encore .308 with box (box is a bit tattered from my moves), Weaver mount and rings, Burris 3X9 scope - Duplex no Mil-Dot w/ parallax Adjustment. The scope has several scratches from being moved from gun to gun. I'm guessing here but I don't think that the gun has seen more then 100 rounds through it. I used it twice in IHMSA but it was overkill for that sport. Also included is a brand new never attached Encore butt-stock in the box. You guys will know that because this was originally a pistol it can be converted to a rifle, not the other way around...but you'll need a 16"" bbl to be legal. Shipping cost must include insurance. I'd much rather hand it over to someone here in OR so that there is no paperwork involved. I have some ammo for it if it is purchased buy someone that I can hand it over to and not have to ship."

Today I have a Herbert Schmidt E8 22Lr revolver that I picked up in a trade. Overall the gun is in good condition and it fires flawlessly. The gun is accurate for a 2.5"" barrel. I shot it at 15 yards and was grouping around 1.5"" with CCI Mini Mags.

The gun has some scratches but is in pretty good shape for its age. All of the mechanics work flawlessly. Its a SA/DA gun and can be shot either way. It has an 8 shot capacity. 

Check out the pictures for condition. Also interested in trades. Let me know what you might be willing to trade for it. 

If you want to purchase please email me and I will email you back shortly and we can arrange a meeting. (I can meet around Salem or Boardman area) I require a valid Ohio I.D. (drivers license or identification card) and I will be filling out a bill of sale of the firearm to protect myself.

Will consider partial trades for guns, as long as there is at least 1,000 cash with it. Let me know what you have, no junk guns please. No low-balls, this gun is impossible to replace any time in the near future. Will only consider selling for the right price.

Price Breakdown, it's a bargain.
Rifle at this time = $1200+
Ammo = $200+
Optics and mounts = $300+
Mags = $100+
22 Conversion kit = $150+
Misc Accessories = $150+
Total = $2100+
I'm asking 1900 or best offer, won't be able to buy any of this new, possibly for the next year due to shortages and huge backlogs of orders. So prices will remain high on the used guns. My price is very fair considering, it's practically what I paid when the items were available.

Rifle price 7 months back when I bought it was $900, so, either way, it's a bargain considering current prices and shortages.

It means that not only will they get stuck with guns they didn't really want, but it also means the gun will be right there, at a reasonable price, in your dealers case.

UPPER INFO 
The manufacturing process of the VIS is unique...starting with what is essentially a traditional separate upper receiver and handguard, these parts are partially machined then permanently joined using an exclusive welding process - this composite unit is then stress relieved, final machined and heat treated. This innovative process allows the VIS to accept any standard AR barrel! The only thing that is changed is the barrel nut used with the VIS, the required barrel nut and wrench is included with each VIS kit. 

Another Vltor exclusive is the modular shell deflector and bolt assist assembly. The VIS gives the operator the opportunity to choose between a shell deflector/bolt assist combo or a shell deflector only. 

While the VIS is not the first one piece upper receiver for the AR-15/M16 family, it is the first design that retains the use of standard barrels, as well as a removable bottom rail section that allows the mounting of the M-203 grenade launcher and all SOPMOD components.

Original WWII British Sten Mk 3 parts kit.  This is a parts kit that has been saw-demilled and cannot be reassembled into a working firearm, and so it has been classified as a non-firearm by the BATFE.  These parts were hand-selected for minimal wear and abuse.  All parts are included except the missing chunks of the receiver tube.  Original gun was demilled and packed in Cosmoline after the war, and is thus well preserved and rust free.

The other parts included are a premium Indianapolis Ordnance Semi-Auto parts kit, all new parts, including an 80% completed receiver tube, 16-inch barrel (required by the BATFE), semi-auto bolt and the various pins, springs, rivets, and small parts required to complete the kit.  To be very clear, the new receiver tube CANNOT BE USED WITH THE ORIGINAL BOLT.  It is designed with a vertical magazine mount and has ventilation holes already drilled.  The bolt kit is for a vertical magazine mount and is designed to fit the receiver tube.  The receiver tube has a plan decal attached for ease of use.  Instructions are included.

I bught these parts with the intention of doing the disassembly of teh Sten and building a semi-auto Sten based on the 80% receiver, which is of course perfectly legal.  Then I realized I don't have the time to complete it so I'm taking a bit of a loss to get the parts out of my project to-do list.  If you have time to do it, this would be a great project.

I can ship in the 50 US States (shipping extra, please pay the total by US Postal MO and I'll ship when it clears) or local pickup in the Tampa area (cash payment OK) is great."

I have a new PWS MK114 MOD 1 for sale. Here is the description from the site:

PRODUCT DETAILS
A model developed after the M4 pattern rifle, the PWS MK114 Rifle has quickly become the crowd favorite for those wanting a compact package without the NFA paperwork associated with shorter barrels. The MK114 retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a permanently attached FSC556.

Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK114 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 handguard and free-floated barrel.

The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS2 sights.

Available as a complete rifle or as a complete upper receiver.

If you buy from out of Washington State or you need this firearm shipped, I will need a copy of your receiving FFL, Dealer name, clear and readable, not expired, with his phone number, and the FFL has to be valid, (Not Expired). Your name should appear on the bottom of the FFL form wiith the description of the firearm with your address and your phone number for my records.  This way I can match the firearm with the FFL. You can pay with a Certified Check or a Postal Money Order. I will accept a personal check but this usually has a wait time to process and clear the bank. I can take Credit Cards. There is a 3% up-charge and processing fee for Credit Cards added to the sale price including the shipping for this transaction. You will have to call me with your credit card information. If you live in Washington State you will have to pay 8.6% Sales Tax.  Price I am asking is $585.00. This is a very nice gun, with a clean barrel. Action works very smooth. I would keep for my own collection but seems I can't keep everything. Shipping is USPS Priority Mail, $26.00, FedEx and UPS, $36.00.

You can travel to Vashon and buy direct if you would like to.

Specifics, I will not ship to CA, MD, Hawaii, NY, DC, NJ, MA, and now Colorado after their crap, or some cities in Illibnois. Sorry not my fault. If you want this firearm it is your responsibility to know wether you are legal to own it, know the laws of your area, local, city, State, and Federal. If this firearm is not legal for you to own or not legal to own in your area you will be charged a 25% re-stocking fee if your dealer can not transfer to you and it has to be returned. Again not my fault. You will pay shipping to and from.

The blue is worn off the gun, but is very slick and nice,it has no rust at all. I was told that the grips alone are rare and hard to find, especially not busted. These are perfect. This is a true collector's peice, and the fact that it functions perfect is a real bonus. A great peice of history... The pictures are very up close, the gun looks very good in person, there is no rust or roughness at all to the gun. It is very smooth and functions just like new."

The proposed gun ban has been dropped due to lack of congressional support. Of course they still have tricks up their sleeves that might attempt but the actual ban that scared you all into maxing out and buying 20 ARs was short lived. Everyone else, please hold out buying any over priced firearm or ammo from anyone. The market will soon be flooded with what you are looking for in due time. People will want to recoup at least a little of what they lost and for those still insistent on getting x3 prices let this be their punishment and wake up call (idiot check). Like I mentioned we are not completely out of the water regarding firearms (never really are) but at least for now ARs aren't on the chopping block. Don't buy over prices ARs and don't buy ridiculously over prices SKS and seriously don't pay more than maybe $100ish for a Mosin Nagant no matter what they tell you they are surplus guns.
