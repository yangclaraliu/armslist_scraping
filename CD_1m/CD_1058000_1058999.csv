It's like brand new straight from Beretta. I got it as a replacement for a defective piece several years ago. Beretta warranty is second to none. I shot maybe 20-30 rounds through it when I received it to verify function. I cleaned it, put it back in the box and in the safe where it still sits. I have a NAA .32 for a pocket gun so I really have no need for this one. It was initially bought for the wife, but she found a .32 S&W snubnose she prefers.

Comes with the box, lock, plastic case, 2 mags, custom wood grips and factory plastic pieces, and 2 50rd boxes of S&B FMJ ammo. I will also include 2 holsters, a Keenan leather pocket holster and a Don Hume JIT belt slide. A fun little plinker that carries easy in a pocket or purse. And ammo is generally available. I also have 2 extra mags available for $25.00 each.

Looking for a stainless Ruger .22/.45, preferrably with a bull barrel. Not really interested in anything else.

Note: The black lines on the top and bottom pictures are covering the serial number. There are no marks on the gun itself.

With the prices on this sight you'll need both. Just because you see a price it doesn't mean anyone is paying that. You people should be ashamed of yourselves. You are the reasons the shelves are empty and prices have gone up. Yet you are asking prices you see other people asking and guess what you're out your money because your prices on your stuff is to high. I understand raising prices based on the current situation. But nobody is buying your pmag's for $50 or paying a dollar a round for .223 or wants your $500 pistol for $1500. Wake up you are wasting your money. Lower your prices make a little profit it's better than being stuck with inventory.

Beretta JXC9F21 PX4 Storm Compact 9mm 3.2"" 15+1 Poly Grip/Frame Black

Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Storm Compact the
ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols. Built around the same modular
concept as the full size Px4, the compact model features the locked breech
with rotating barrel system and chrome-lined barrel with a deeply recessed
combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling, but with a shorter and
proportioned slide and grip. The durable polymer frame is
fiberglass-reinforced with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail and a modular grip
system for a custom fit. It has a manual safety and an ambidextrous slide
stop lever. The Bruniton non-reflective black coating is offer superior
resistance against corrosion and wear.

Here are some specs from a retail site:
  This ultra-modern muzzleloader sports a precision barrel and is powered by an extremely hot #209 ignition system that can handle 150-grain magnum charges with ease. Radical solid composite stock design features Grip Dot panels to ensure a comfortable, non-slip grip. Comes standard with a thumb-actuated safety, Illuminator™ fiber-optic sights, CrushZone™ recoil pad, and Bullet Guiding Muzzle. Drilled and tapped for scope mounts. .50 caliber. Barrel length: 24''. Twist: 1 in 28''. Total length: 42''. Weight: 6.3 lbs.

Barrel and breech face show some signs of corrosion. I forgot to give it a good cleaning after the first time I shot it. Since then it has been well cleaned and stored oiled. Still shoots just fine. With this muzzle loader I will include 88 (that many) Winchester triple seven primers, 18 Jacketed hollow point 230 grain bullets, 27 lead .50 cal musket balls, 6 pyrodex pellets, wrenches etc. for disassembly and maintenance, and anti-seize thread paste. Comes with original fiber optic sights. Really comfortable gun to shoot. Good deal!

They were made identical for the type of hunting done over in Spain/Europe where beaters move the birds out and you have a “gun-bearer” who assists you with “loading the empty shotgun” and “handing you a freshly charged gun”. The number 2 shotgun was used more often and shows more wear than the Number 1 Gun. A small mark on the left barrel of #2 and another mark by the splinter forend. More photos are available in a 21 page PDF. The photos tell the story, these are two beautifully matched firearms. Guns are both tight, bores perfect. 26 3/4” barrels IC/M I believe. Diameters are identical on both pieces. .710” left/.720” right. Length of Pull to rear trigger is 13 5/8's inches, 14 5/8's inches forward trigger. Drop at comb is 2 1/8”, cast off is but ¾ inch. Weight maybe 6 ½ lb.s? Cased the set is 27Lb. Well figured English Cirrcasian walnut stocks and splinter forends in a classic English Red Oil finish. Rust blued barrels and parts, Case Hardened scroll engraved receivers, double triggers with front movable forward, removable sidelocks, auto ejectors/extractors, auto safe on, consecutive serial numbers, gold inlaid numbers on receivers, barrels and forends, Gold ovals in stocks, large silver bead. Did I forget anything? Ask if there is something I missed. Also more photos in a 21 page PDF are available. We have contacted AYA as to when these guns were made and they did confirm they were made and delivered in 1970 but records that far back are scarce. If you are unfamiliar with AYA shotguns they are from Spain. High quality, finely engraved, beautifully executed firearms. Enough said there! Priced less than what a new set would cost ($30,000+). No firing except with the snap caps. Shipping fees will not be refunded so please ask all questions in advance to make your decisions and email for 21 pages of photos.

Bartels. These pistols are consecutive serial numbered in 22 Long Rifle. According to The European Firearms book by Støckel: C. Bartels, Konigl Hofbuchsenmacher, Wiesbaden & Zella. Court gun maker 1840 - 1908. C.Bartels worked for the Duke von Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and the crown prince of Anhalt-Dessau. Many of their elaborate pistols were made to the Stevens Lord target pistol design. What are they worth?  These pistols have 9½” barrels with mint bores, (S/N XX7 has less than 100 rounds fired through it and S/N XX8 appears to be unfired). These are extraordinary quality in absolutely brand new condition. Frame and butt-cap are completely relief engraved in oak leaf & vine pattern. Both have target style grips-very massive & beautifully done; checkered and oak leaf style of carving. Gold gilded frames, barrels are blued and retain 100% of the finish. These were made before 1891 because there are no mandatory 1891 proof stamps. Therefore they are “antiques” and FFL transfer is not needed. The fluted part octagon, part round barrels are engraved on the top: ‘McClure Halley’. McClure Halley was associated with the East Coast elite of the early 20th century. He was a friend of Mrs. Geraldine R. Dodge of Dodge automobiles. He acted on her behalf handling many dog shows. He also was an early racecar driver and collector that brought some of the first European sports cars to America. Cars previously owned by him have won best of show at Pebble Beach. His Bugatti, Alfa Romeo and other sports cars sell at auction for millions of dollars. His 1937 Alfa Romeo Spyder in known as one of the world’s most sought after collector’s cars. The guns are fitted in a contemporary style French case made probably 20 to 25 years ago with a drawer of accouterments. Along with the McClure Halley engraving, the barrels are engraved with “C. Bartels Konigl Hofbuchsenmacher” and “Wiesbaden & Zella” and the breach blocks are engraved with “1” and “2” respectively. Payment by postal money order or cashier’s check. Antique so, FFL is not required but buyer must prove they are over 21 with a government issued photo ID and certify in writing that they may legally own this antique gun."

Info on model 50.00
http://www.falfiles.com/forums/showthread.php?t=204747
“Following the completion of the importation of the 1,848 G Series FAL’s Browning began the importation of a new Type II receivered FN model 50.00 FAL. Early examples of these FAL’s featured a standard FN serial number (typically 5 numbers -14XXX)) stamped at the rear of the upper receiver on the LH side and also a 'newly' introduced FN commercial serial numbering system for use on all commercial semi-auto FAL’s entering the U.S.A. destined for civilian sale that utilized new a 250 prefix. Later Type II examples imported utilized the 250 prefix serial number only. Many collectors will also refer to these FAL's as 'Competition Models'. The 250XXXX prefix number can typically be found on the RH side of the upper receiver to the rear of the ejection port. The bolt and bolt carrier on these dual numbered FAL’s corresponds to the 5 digit serial number on the LH side of the upper receiver and not the newly incorporated 250 prefix number. All of the examples that I have seen are model 50.00's with fiberglass non-bipod cut handguards and the fluted Browning 'Match' type flash-hider. At some point during the importation of the Type II receivered FAL’s FN elected to change their preferred U.S.A. importer from Browning to Steyr. During this transitional period of time there were some Type II receivered FAL's imported that featured both Browning Arms and Steyr import markings. I have also seen some Type II FAL's that featured dual Browning Arms and EJK-Devco markings. Given that Type II receivered importation most probably began no earlier than serial number 2500001 and the earliest documented Type III serial number available is 2500743 it is my belief that there can be no more that 742 total examples of this variant imported by Browning and/or Steyr and/or EJK-Devco. When added together with the Browning import Rogak contract Type II receivered FAL’s one can assume that there were no more than 942 semi-auto Type II receivered FAL’s imported into the U.S.A. for civilian sales. Given the information available it is clear that there were fewer FN manufactured FAL's imported with Type II receivers that either the earlier Type I's or later Type III's.”
My understand is less than 200 of the double serial # & double import stamped Browning / Styer type II receviered 50.00 marked FAL’s where imported & few than that still exist today"

I bought it thinking I was going to conceal carry it since I normally train with Sig DA/SA trigger with the decocker. Unfortunately this isn't so as I still carry my P229 or my P232 in the warmer months. Because of that, this fine piece from my collection is for sale.

Starting with our own hammer-forged -not cast- ordnance grade steel frames, slides and barrels, we machine each and every part to tolerance levels that surpass even today's industry standards. Our skilled pistol smiths hand-fit and tune each gun with the 19 standard features seen below, using quality parts that are built 100% in our state-of-the-art factory. Then they mark the slide, barrel and frame with matching serial numbers. Available in the powerful .45 ACP, this aggressive, rock-solid firearm is ready to go right out of the box.

These are typical USGI mags from the preban era. Mixed brands: Okay, Adventureline, Sanchez, Parsons, etc.

Some of them are original finish, which is worn as typical for preban mags. These are $30 each.

I also have some I have refinished with moly coating. If you are stuck in a preban state and are tired of using mags that look terrible, these are a great solution. The finish does not affect fit into your rifle, it is very thin but durable. Because it is moly, it is very slick, which makes insertion easy. This is the same type of finish that the army used. Color is dark with a greenish tint. I am asking $35 each for refinished mags. I also have one or two that was done with a light silver finish that looks like stainless steel if you prefer.

All of the magazines are 30 round and made of aluminum.

Shipping to the lower 48 states is $6 regardless of how many you buy.

I accept Paypal, and ship the next business day. Also, I accept USPS Money Order.

By buying these, you verify you are 21+ years of age and legal to own these in your state of residence. If you are a MA resident, I need you to email me a copy of you Class A LTC."

I had multiple offers at this price.



I won a Kimber Solo STS (stainless steel model) at the Friends of the NRA dinner this past weekend on 2-9-12 and I am looking to trade it, or maybe sell it.  This gun is AWESOME for what it is. I took it out Sunday and put 100 rounds though it and it is by far the best ""micro"" pistol I have ever shot.  In my opinion it blows the Kel-Tec PF9 & P3AT, Ruger LCP & LC9, S&W Bodyguard, and the Taurus TCP out of the water.  

This is a small and slim pistol in a real service caliber at the right weight for carry that has very manageable recoil.  Also you are getting Kimber's known quality and the Stainless package so you can carry it without fear of rusting.  I was easily able to shoot 3"" groups or better at 7 yards with bulk ammo which is normally hard for me with such small pistols.

This gun has has 100 rounds through it exactly and is basically new. I have owned it for less than a week. I am possibly looking to trade it for a subcompact 9mm Glock (G26), H&K Pistols, a Mossberg Silver Reserve 12 gauge, Mossberg turkey tactical 12 gauge, S&W Sheild 9mm or .40, SKS, AK, AR ect with boot my way or you way respectively.

I'm really open to any reasonable offer but I am not hurting to trade or sell this pistol. It is awesome and I have no problem owning it forever, I just don't need another carry pistol.

Due to excellent feedback about the Enhanced Ergo's, In 2011 all Sigs started to include the E2 ergo.  That makes it a semi interesting piece if you are Sig guy.  The gun has been fired and carried.  There is zero barrel rust and the only bluing that has showing is wear is the external side of the barrel (typical for non-1911 semi auto pistols).

IMPORTANT NOTE! You must go through an FFL (even if local) which means an additional $30 paid to the FFL for the background check. I do have an FFL in Black Forest that I trust who can do this transfer, or we can use yours if you have one. If you are not local and we are shipping, you must send me your FFL's license information because I can only send to them . 


The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian made 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)
