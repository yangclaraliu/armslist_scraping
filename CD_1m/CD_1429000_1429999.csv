BCG is full auto and I also believe it was made by SA&A.
Lower is marked SA&A (also made by Aero Precision).
Magpul Mbus' are authentic (not Chinese knockoffs).
Magpul MOE stock, MOE + grip, MOE VFG and Magpul rail covers.

I'm asking $800 firm, no trades and no shipping.
This will be a FTF deal in the triangle area. 
I just want to see a NCDL or ID, buyer and seller will fill out a bill of sale. Buyer must be able to legally own a firearm, all laws apply.

Thanks for looking."

Sterio speakers came unhooked. Sony aftermarket and the previous owner didn't connect them properly. I never bothered to fix it. 
Check engine lite is on. Was when I got it. An o2 sensor line is clogged. Hasn't affected it in 5 years, and mechanic said it never will. 
Belt lightly squeaks. Had it replaced, and it needs to wear in.
Trunk rusted through on contact pointers with spoiler. It's been professionally patched, and primed. Just needs a little paint.

I can trap, hunt, or relocate (for hippies)

If you need this service please let me know and we can work something out.

If you would like me to kill deer and other game animals there are some laws I must tell you about first to make sure we do not break any South Carolina gaming laws or local laws. To ensure safety I use any appropriate caliber from 22LR to 300 Win Mag. I can use a bow or a shotgun but most of the time we end up using traps due to geometry's of fire. 

When we do use rifle it is most commonly an M40A5 with 175Gn Sierra Matchking bullets in handloads. We can kill varmints up to 800 yards away confidently anything farther than that and we cant promise results.

Traps usually catch about two animals a week depending on the animal we are trapping

Receiver is marked ""Mauser Modelo Argentino 1891, Manufactura Loewe Berlin"". Caliber 7.65x53, All matching number on the receiver, barrel, bolt handle, and trigger guard. I believe this is the Calvary model with the shorter barrel and stock, total length is 37"" barrel is 18"" ish. Ammo is still available for these 120+ year old rifles and it runs less than $20 a box for PPU brand. These rifles do not require an FFL to buy or sell since they are pre-1899 production and are classed as Antiques by the ATF - see: 18 USC 921 (a)(16). Since these rifles can shoot modern ammunition and are also exempt from FFL transfers they do bring a slight premium and typically sell for $400-$800 on Gunbroker depending on if the numbers all match, if the Argentine Crest was removed or not, and the rifles overall condition. This one has all matching numbers and the Argentine Crest was not removed which makes it more desirable. The condition however is fair; most of the bluing is gone and there is some pitting, the bore however is nice and bright and the rifling clear but worn as expected for its age. Very unique collectable and like most Mausers, they continue to gain value year after year.

From the Sig Sauer website:

Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220® Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights.

 SINCE I HAVE HAD NUMEROUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE “PRE-BAN” HERE IS A LITTLE INFORMATION I HOPE HELPS EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND BETTER

 The TEC-9 and, eventually, TEC-DC9 variants were listed among the 19 firearms banned by name in the USA by the now expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB).[1] This ban caused the cessation of their manufacture, and forced Intratec to introduce a newer model called the AB-10, a TEC-9 Mini without a threaded muzzle/barrel shroud and limited to a 10 round magazine instead of a 20 or 32 round magazine. However, it accepted the high capacity magazines of the pre-ban models.
 The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB), or Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, was a subtitle of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a federal law in the United States that included a prohibition on the manufacture for civilian use of certain semi-automatic firearms, so called ""assault weapons"".[1] The 10-year ban was passed by Congress on September 13, 1994, and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton the same day. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the date of the ban's enactment.
 In the former U.S. law, the legal term assault weapon included certain specific semi-automatic firearm models by name (e.g., Colt AR-15, TEC-9, non-select-fire AK-47s produced by three manufacturers, and Uzis) and other semi-automatic firearms because they possess a minimum set of cosmetic features from the following list of features below:
• Pistol Grip (Tec 9 has)
• For end Grip (Tec9 has)
• Flash Suppressor (Tec9 has)
• Grenade Launcher (does not have)
• Magazine that attached outside of the grip (Tec9 has)
• Folding stock (does not have)
• Bayonet Mount (does not have)
 During this ban, your weapon was legal with only 2(TWO) of the accessories. As you can see this PRE-BAN weapon has 4!!!!!

 II. The Tec-9 Is A Semi-Automatic Version Of A Military Submachinegun

The TEC-9 is a semi-automatic version of a military submachinegun. Although it has been marketed under various names -- the KG-9, the KG-99, the TEC-9, and the TEC-DC9 -- and by various companies owned and operated by the Garcia family, the basic design of the weapon has remained virtually unchanged. The company decided to manufacture the KG-9 because of the growing market for military style guns in the United States. The KG-9's manual described it as: 
Combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.The term ""assault pistol"" was coined by the firearms industry to describe the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.


A. The KG-9 Was Banned as a Machine Gun, and Renamed the KG-99

In 1982, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ruled that the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.

The company redesigned the KG-9's bolt to make conversion more difficult, and renamed the weapon the KG-99. Otherwise, the design remained essentially unchanged. Intratec confirmed that like its predecessor, the KG-99 could be fairly described as ""combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.""

Intratec U.S.A. (""Intratec"") manufactured a vertical foregrip for use with the KG-99, which it marketed as an ""Assault Grip."" Intratec used the term ""Assault Grip"" in marketing the foregrip, ""[b]ecause you basically hold the gun with two hands like you would as assault weapon, a military weapon.""

In November 1982, and again in March 1985, the ATF notified Intratec that it was unlawful to possess a KG-99 and an attachable foregrip, even though the pistol and the foregrip were disassembled. Although Intratec understood that they should not be selling the assault grip, he continued to sell it as an accessory for the KG-99, stamping on the order form that ""ATF has ruled that the KG-250 assault grip may not be attached legally to the KG-99 or the old model KG-9.""

B. Intratec Rename the KG-99 the TEC-9, and Continued to Sell the ""Assault Grip.""

Intratec renamed the KG-99 the TEC in August 1985. The TEC-9 was substantially identical to the KG-99, with just a few cosmetic changes. The company resumed marketing the assault grip without any warning, advertising that it ""Attaches to All TEC-9"" Intratec advertised the TEC-9 as a ""High-spirited"" weapon that is ""as tough as your toughest customer."" The company’s brochure emphasized the weapon’s ""paramilitary"" appeal, its ""Military blowback design,"" and its ""Combat-type"" sights. The brochure depicted a smoking target of a human being shot dozens of times through the head and the heart in what appears to be a fusillade of automatic weapons fire. In April 1987, Intratec was sued by the Estate of David Bengston in Connecticut state court. The complaint alleged that the decedent, a school custodian, was fatally shot in the head with a TEC-9M [""Mini""], and that Intratec ""knew or should have known that the TEC-9M gun was and is primarily suited for an/or used in criminal activity,"" and that it ""lacks legitimate use, such as sporting, law enforcement of self-protection."" In November 1987, Carlos Garcia formed Navegar in order to take the assets of the business back from his father and avoid Intratec’s liabilities.

It's just like a Mini 14, except it shoots the AK round instead of the AR round.

It's got the regular, NEW YORK LEGAL wood stock, void of a collapsible butt stock or a pistol grip, meaning the commie lawmakers won't call it an ""assault weapon."" This guy is just about as good as it gets in New York. It's a hell of a rifle, light and handy, but powerful enough to blast your way through a cinder block wall. If you've never seen one, it looks and comes apart like an M1 Carbine, but it shoots like an AK-47. I've put high quality American Winchester ammo through it, and I've put cheap Golden Tiger and Tula surplus ammo through it, and it eats it up. Steel cased ammo is no problem.

In addition, I also have a black ATI tactical stock. This item is a black stock built for the Mini 14, except I used a dremel to widen the magazine well to accommodate the Mini 30 magazines. It could use some smoothing down, but it works just fine. This stock has a pistol grip and telescoping stock, as well as side and top rails. The item must be sold SEPARATELY seeing as, once it is placed on the rifle, it makes the rifle become an ""assault weapon."" I would like to stress this again. This item is to be sold separately. It is included in the price but needs to be paid for and shipped separately.

In addition to the extra stock, I have an Accu-Strut put on, and a 4x scope with its own rail. The scope rail is to be mounted on the rifle's sights. I have never mounted it as I am not much of a scope guy. I also have a flash suppressor, but unfortunately, the commies in New York don't think you should be able to have one, so it's not for sale. I'll have to get rid of it somehow else.

The rifle comes with a 5-round Ruger magazine that's only been used once or twice, and two 10-round aftermarket magazines that I normally use. It also comes with a bolt lock.

I'm from New York originally but I moved down to Virginia where basically everything is legal. We shoot AUG's and G3's down here. Cigs are $4.95 a pack down here in America. You can literally go to a drive-thru liquor and fireworks store. Not kidding. A drive-thru, that sells LIQUOR and FIREWORKS at the same establishment. I bought this rifle so that I'd have something to take to New York when I come back for visits if I feel like doing some shooting, but I've moved on to bigger and badder guns now.

I'll be up in New York in mid May, so in case anybody wants to do face-to-face, then is the time to do it. If you want to do a face-to-face, you have to show me evidence that you passed a background check. I need to see a pistol permit and you need to sign a bill of sale. No deals in NYC or Yonkers. I'm pretty sure they have additional laws that I don't want to mess with."

For those of you interested in FN's FS2000, like me, there is a guy from Las Vegas/Nevada, and one in Arizona who I have been in contact with who are clear scammers. At first I thought the one from Nevada who had it listed for $2k seemed legit until he insisted money or wire transfer. When I hesitated, he then offered to validate his military ID cause that would make him more trustworthy. The biggest giveaway was and getting responses from a few different guys who claim to have FS2000, they all sent the SAME photos. The dumbass from Arizona even sent me pics of two different colored rifles and when I questioned him about it, he got shitty like I was trying to play games with him.
So, be aware everyone. According to the trends on gunbroker, FS2000s seem to be selling around the low $2k mark if the seller isn't trying to rape you. Be smart and don't EVER send money unless its to a legit business where they can track it."

I have a BRAND NEW Spike’s Tactical 12” BAR Rail For Sale or Trade. This is Model SAR1112.

The Spike's Tactical 12” BAR Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). The 12” BAR rail weighs in at 479 grams (16.89 oz.) and has an ID of 1.79”.

It's loaded with extras - 45 degree forged iron sights, aluminum quad rail, a folding bipod, red dot optics, a Plano hard shell case and more. New rifle, new accessories. Comes with the manual and the Bushmaster aluminum 30-round ""high capacity"" magazine, too.

I bought it right around a month ago for quite a bit of money...

It's definitely one of the most bada*s AR-15s I've seen. 

New RI gun laws are going to make these things impossible to buy as soon as July of this year. Those of us lucky to have gotten one before that time get to keep it.

I got this for my now-ex. Fortunately she never got to use it. I have quite a bit of money into this (almost two grand). I need the money at this point.

It's a lightweight carbine, at just about 6 pounds. Leaves lots of room to add (more?) stuff on, and not end up with a 10+ pound rifle...

I posted a picture of this rifle setup to AR-15 Gun Owners Of America mentioning that I had it for sale, and the thread BLEW UP. The page admins reposted it. About a dozen other people reposted it to their own pages. All sorts of people wanted to buy it. It's a nationwide site though, and I'm not shipping it anywhere. RI only.

I would keep it, but I already have my own AR-15, and I don't need two. I need the money!

This sale is to be made in accordance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws.

The transfer can be done free of charge through an FFL that I deal with here in the Providence area.

No trades. NO TRADES!!! I will not deliver the rifle. Cash only. No checks, no money orders, no payment plans, etc. Too much risk involved. An honest person will understand this.

I'd like to make this a nice smooth transaction. As little aggravation as possible.

I am home during the day most days. Email me and I will get back to you very quickly.

First come first serve. You are responsible for knowing your own local laws and abide by them. No sales to anyone unable to legally purchase it. No kids, no criminals... you know the laws. We're sticking to them.

Comes with the gun, case, unused back straps (package opened to try them out, never shot with them), the test fire shell from the factory, and two magazines. This model will also accept the magazines from Glock 19's, Glock 17's, and Glock 18's (the 33 rounders). Great CCW firearm.

It contains all the original parts of the magazine that have been taken apart before being shipped into California to comply with state and local laws. I do not remove any parts of the rebuild kit before i ship to buyers

Rebuild kits are not to be used to assemble a new high capacity magazine which would be in violation of local or state law. These rebuild kits are intended to rebuild a legally owned pre-ban magazine or for assembling a 10 round magazine pursuant to local or state law.

You can assemble your rebuild kit into a magazine when you are outside of CA or at a location at which you are legally allowed to possess a high capacity magazine. For example: You can take your rebuild kit from California to Arizona, assemble it, use it, and take it apart before you return to California. Many of buyers are competition shooters who reside in CA but travel the country shooting and require rebuild kits for competition. Others attend weapon training facilities in other states where they are legally allowed to assemble and use rebuild kits as magazines. Just be sure you take them apart completely before returning to California. 

By purchasing a rebuild kit(s) the purchaser accepts sole responsibility to remain in accordance with local or state law and any failure to do so will be the purchasers responsibility. I accepts no liability whatsoever for misuse or negligence on the part of the purchaser. 

It is the responsibility of the buyer to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, and federal laws in regard to the possession, use, and sale of any item purchased from me.

I do not sell hi-capacity magazines period. 

Please consult the CA DOJ and/or your local ATF office if you have any legality related questions. Calegalmags is simply a retail business, we do not answer or respond to any legal or regulation related questions for liability reasons."

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount.  Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.
■Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
■Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space
■Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
■Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours
■The XPS3 is Night Vision compatible"
