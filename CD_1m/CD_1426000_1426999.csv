Description

Spike's Tactical STH1210 37mm Side-Loading Havoc 12"" Flare Launcher features the latest in design and manufacturing technology.

The 6061 and 7075 Aircraft grade aluminum components are anodized in Type III Hardcoat black for maximum durability and ease of maintenance.

Additional components are built from 1018 cold rolled steel and plated with a Mil-spec black oxide finish. The proprietary STZ push button cylindrical breech lock design is 3 times stronger than existing lever lock systems. The Havoc is designed to mount on any Mil-Spec Picatinny rail system. Installation simply requires sliding the launcher onto the bottom rail of the handguard and tightening two set screws which are included.

Im a history student at West Georgia and have to pay for summer school, so I'm letting this go. Its a good shooter, bolt and action are all pristine. Minimal scoring on the bolt face from corrosive ammo. Rifling is strong, gradually darkening from a mirror finish at the breech to a dark frost at the muzzle. It has been counterbored 2 inches. No modifications to the rifle aside from a washer/spacer under the sear spring to lighten the trigger pull. 

It throws hand-sized groups at 100 yards with surplus ammo from a rest. It has a bedding plate under the tang of the receiver that was put there by the soldier in the field. Wartime stock. Original finish, including several large R stamps, remnants of the circular CCCP soviet stamp, and ""10"" inside of a circle on the stock. Izhevsk receiver/barrel with some Tula parts. 

The supply of these rifles are not infinite, and this is a very fine example if you wish to own a functioning piece of history.

This PSL was made in Romania at the CUGIR armory and is stamped on the side of the receiver. 

This is NOT a cheap crappy parts kit, this is CUGIR factory manufactured PSL (the one everyone wants) imported by Romarm in Romania.

Chambered in 7.62x54r, the Romanian PSL resembles an SVD-Dragunov but The PSL internal components are a little different. The PSL is based off of the Kalishnikov (AK) design and features a long stroke gas piston, versus the SVD's short stroke gas piston.

Included for the asking price is the PSL rifle, original wood furniture with thumbhole stock, original Belarus LPS  scope 4x6, bird cage style flash hider,  2x10 round magazines, and hard plastic case. I will also throw in a few rounds to test it out.

I have recently taken it out to the range and put a few rounds thru without any issues, fully functioning, one of the most accurate rifles in my collection with scope or even just using iron sight (my personal preference)

These are becoming harder to find these days, especially in CA almost non existent.  This one is CA compliant with a magazine lock. Im in no rush to sell, sorry not interested in trades.Get it before its banned or gone!"

The scope that is included with the buy it now price is a Leupold Mark 4 6.5-20x50mm FFP or Front Focal Plane scope. It has 1/4-MOA adjustments. Here are some things Leupold has to say about it:

The Xtended Twilight Lens System™ optimizes the transmission of low-light wavelengths, so you see the details of low-light scenes in greater, brighter detail than with any other riflescope available.
Side focus parallax adjustment for fast, easy parallax focusing from 75 yards to infinity, from any shooting position.
Finger-adjustable ¼-MOA windage and elevation adjustments with audible, tactile clicks.
Once sighted in adjustment knobs can be zeroed.
Available with the Mil Dot or Tactical Milling Reticle® (TMR®).
These reticles are ideal in tactical situations, yet also provide greater accuracy of range estimation for hunters and target shooters.
The 30mm maintube offers incredible strength and allows for the greater range of windage and elevation adjustment.
70-MOA each of windage and elevation adjustment.
Flip-open lens covers are standard issue with each Mark 4 LR/T riflescope.
Rugged and absolutely waterproof, LR/T riflescopes can withstand incredible abuse."

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvLt8-Wf7r0
 if for any reason you're concerned about how hard it might be to install I'll do it for you when we meet. just bring your rifle with a collapsible stock.

I bought it and put it on my AR. I ran several clips through my rifle and had a blast but a) my gun is mainly home defense so full auto isn't exactly required and b) my wife wants me to unload some gun stuff to raise a little cash. So I took it right back off my rifle and put it back in the bubble wrap and in the box.

It is in brand new condition with all the bits and pieces in the box including both parts in the original bubble wrap, paper work, and the allen wrench it came with.

$300 for the stock and like I said, I'll install it for your on a collapsible stock rifle if you want me too. No shipping costs, no waiting on backorders. This stock is listed in the new ""assault weapons ban"" bill. Once that thing passes they won't be able to make these anymore."

SUB-2000
The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in .40 S&W caliber."

""The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.

A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 

This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol."""

It took lots of trial and error and trying different stuff to perfect it.  I wasted a bunch of money.  When I started my brass turned out discolored because of too much oxidizer.  Then after several trials I could get it clean but dull and the inside of the cases were dirty as well as the primer pocket.  More money. Then shit was getting stuck in bottle neck cases and the primer pockets were still dirty.  I finally got it down and it comes out CLEAN AND SHINY inside and out of either bottle neck or straight cases.  I am trying to pay for some of my efforts and equipment.

That's right, kids - our red-faced governor is proposing a bunch of laws that have nothing to do with decreasing gun-related violence.

Yep. An ""assault weapons"" ban.

http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2013/04/ri-lawmakers-unveil-gun-control-legislative-package-including-ban-on-semiau.html 

Summary:

* Bans on high-capacity magazines and semiautomatic assault weapons after July 1. Exempted are antique firearms, inoperable weapons, rifles or shotguns unable to hold high-capacity magazines, and firearms manufactured before July 1, 1963. Current owners are grandfathered in, although they may sell such weapons only to buyers outside Rhode Island or to someone authorized to possess them.
* Creation of a task force to guide the state in submitting records about mental health and substance abuse to the FBI's background check system. The task force must report back to the governor and General Assembly by Jan. 1, with legislation that will bring the state into compliance.
* Creation of a relief board for those denied firearms based on mental-health or substance-abuse backgrounds. Setting up this board makes the state eligible for federal funds to help it comply with the FBI system.
* Granting the attorney general's office the sole power to approve conceal-carry permits. Under current law, local police chiefs also have the authority, though less discretion.
* Authorizing lengthy sentences to straw purchasers and anyone who gives a gun to a juvenile, who uses it a violent crime.
* Increasing the penalty for not reporting lost or stolen firearms.
* Barring anyone from carrying a rifle or shotgun, openly or concealed, anywhere in public, except for those who are hunting or target shooting.

The CM9 is hard to find because of its popularity as a great conceal and carry gun that is very reliable and very fun to shoot.  Looking to get $450 or best offer.  Prefer to sell locally but can work something out if shipping to an FFL is needed."

The next-generation PMAG Window GEN M3 features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

I paid $104 for this at Walmart, so if you want to buy it, it is $104. That's right, no mark up. I have plenty of 45 ammo, and just don't need the personal defense ammo. That being said, I will not accept less, I'll just keep it, so don't waste our time. 

If you would rather trade for ammo, (using roughly the same Walmart retail pricing scale,) I would trade for (of course, 22LR) 9mm, 40S&W or 45 ACP target ammo. If you don't know what the exchange rates are, email me and we can work it out. 

Should go without saying, I'm not giving away my normal retail priced ammo for inflated gouge prices or what somebody thinks their ammo will sell for on Go Broker. As mentioned, if nobody needs this, I'll hold onto it.

Colt 
LE6920 M4 AR15 Carbine 5.56/223. The Gold Standard of AR15's
This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. 
- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) 
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories"
