The SARARMS K2 Semi Auto Pistol is truly amazing. It is the first comfortable grip 14+1 DA/SA 45acp pistol. You may ask yourself if this pistol really holds 14+1 rds of 45acp? The K2 has a square barrel / slide lock up (for greater surface locking area), DA / SA trigger (for fast accurate shot to shot repeatability), locked and cocked carry safety system (for a simple and safe manual safety), auto firing pin block (for the added feature of a blocked firing pin unless the trigger is pulled), Low Barrel Axis (for reduced felt recoil),  All Steel construction (for a life time of reliability), Three Dot Sight System (for fast target acquisition), Integral Accessory Rail (for the ability to add accessories as desired) and a grip that is amazing considering the capacity."

Perfect new condition, as I stated, I bought it new and never fired it.  I even changed the old pistol grip with a nice U.S. Palm grip.  Last ad was flagged, I don't know why.

Price is in line with majority of other postings for same rifle on armslist.  Only difference is this one is brand new and comes with plenty of ammo.  Price is therefore firm.  Not looking for trades, thanks!"

BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKTV) - The Buffalo-based attorney who is spear-heading a lawsuit against Governor Andrew Cuomo's recent gun laws said that Wednesday was ""monumental,"" as a State Supreme Court Justice issued an order requiring New York State to show good cause that the law is constitutional.

New York State has until April 29 to respond or else an injunction will be issued.

On Thursday, thousands are expected in Albany to rally against the Governor's gun laws. Many are looking to preserve local jobs at places such as Remington Arms, while others say they are just citizens who feel that their Second Amendments are being infringed upon.

See you all in Albany tomorrow!

This gun has under 500 rounds through it since new. It is 99%+ condition without a scratch of any mention on it anywhere. It had a Burris mount with Millett target scope (no rash on the rails from mount), but the scope decided to give me issues while in the safe over the fall. So, back it goes to Millett next week and I just decided to sell the gun since I never got into the coyote hunting I wanted to do anyway. (edit- Scope and mount do not come with gun) I also had a bipod on it, and the gun was a ""blast"" to shoot from prone! (bipod does not come with gun) Funtions great & has very minimal recoil for awesome follow-up speed. Finally, the .223 round shines when sent thru a 24"" barrel... this gun with plain 55grain fmj has more penetration through steel at 100 yards than my brother's 16"" carbine with m855 62gr penetrator rounds!"

Bought new on 2/20/2013.   I have not sent in the warranty yet.
Approximately 20 rounds have been fired to align the red dot sight.

Sale includes: 
    Picatinny rail mounted on bottom of handguard for mounting of light
    or other accessories. 
    Soft case
    One 20 round box of ammo.
    Original box
    Chamber flag
    Owner's manual

This gun has the newer style carbon fiber upper and lower receivers with dust cover and forward assist.  Older carbon Bushmasters did not have these features.
Includes the red dot sight as supplied by Bushmaster.  One end dust cap will not stay closed, it was that way out of the box.  The sight aligment is
close but probably needs further adjustment to dial it in at longer distances than what I shot it at.

I was really looking for a different model but I bought this one because I finally found an AR locally that I could buy.  Then less than a week later
I stopped in another shop to get tickets to the ""Friends of the NRA"" banquet in Danville and they had the model I had been looking for to start with.  Call or text  
REDACTED.  The gun can be seen during business hours where I work  at Lee's Suzuki / Kawasaki / Yamaha in Harrodsburg.  Sale will include transfer
through a local FFL.  I will cover the cost of transfer."

 The upper is a Colt A2 with a 1:7 twist 5.56 barrel. Bolt carrier group is LMT. Has Magpul hand guards and a DPMS charging handle. I got this upper on a trade so im not real sure of the round count but it is in great condition and shoots well.

 The upper was done in camo when I got it so I stripped the old paint and painted the whole rifle, it is just done in Krylon camo paint.

 I know gun prices are nuts right now, im not looking to gouge anyone, but also not looking to give this rifle away either, I think a good trade value would be about $800 give or take, I don't think that's too outrageous. Im only looking to trade right now, just want something I will use more than this rifle. 

 Being kind of specific on what im looking for, I would prefer a multi gun trade equal to mine in value, but may take gun +/- cash depending on what you have. 

 Im NOT looking for the following, shotguns, .22 rifles, AK's, SKS, Sig pistols, hunting rifles other than .270, 1911-.22 pistols. If you have one of the weapons I am specifically looking for and want to add something to make up value we may be able to make a deal. Im not looking to travel real far to make a deal, but within a reasonable distance is fine and face to face deals only. I have a NC CCH, all laws will apply."
