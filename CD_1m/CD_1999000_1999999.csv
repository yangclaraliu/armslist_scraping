Preferably something like a Ruger SR556. Here are the specs on the gun:

This is the loaded model from Springfield Armory, however it has been modified heavily. Upgrades include: 
-Fusion Lightweight Skeletonized trigger
-Fusion Fiber Optic Front Site
-Wilson Combat A2 Bulletproof match grade Sear
-Wilson Combat Bulletproof Firing Pin
-Wilson Combat Bulletproof Extended Slide Stop
-Ed Brown Chainlink Mainspring Housing
-STI Titanium Hammer Strut
-Wilson Combat Bulletproof Sear Spring
-Wilson Combat Recoil Springs
-Ed Brown Match Mainsprings
-High Ride Beavertail Grip Safety

This gun is an excellent shooter and feels tighter and shoots better than most of the customs that I've shot to date. The trigger breaks clean between 2.5-3 lbs. This is truly a phenomenal piece.

I'm not in a huge rush to get rid of her and not really looking to sell. Mainly looking for the right trade offer to come across, and if it doesn't, oh well."

It is in immaculate condition with only one blemish on the butt of the grip where the bluing was nicked by the magazine. It has less than 30 rounds down the pipe since new and I am the second owner. The first owner bought it new from Boondocks sporting goods in Eagle River AK and then traded it in after letting it mature in the safe for several years. I picked it up after it was traded in and the same guy that sold it to him sold it to me. It does not include the original box but I do have a brand new set of hornady .50AE dies as well as 150 or 200 (I'll have to check my storage unit) pieces of brand new in the bag starline brass to go with it as well as about 25 rnds of factory speer ammunition for it. These are going for upwards of $3k on gunbroker but I have no clue as to what the actual value is. I am just trying to break even because priorities have changed and I need the $$ for another project. I can text more pics

Approx 100 rounds through this gun. I bought it back in December and it is incredibly accurate. Did not care for the factory trigger so bought an Apex Tactical Forward Set Sear trigger. This dramatically cuts down on pretravel and eliminates the gritty feeling trigger that these guns normally have. Also drops down the trigger pull down to approx 4 pounds. If this is too light I will include the 5.5 pound spring as well as all the factory parts if you decide you would like the factory trigger instead. These triggers are normally 150 dollars or more plus gunsmith installation if you do not do it yourself (pain in the butt). Comes in the factory blue plastic box with 2 magazines and 3 different backstraps so you can customize grip for your comfort. Gun will not be sold to any felons or others who cannot legally possess a firearm. Price is firm.

You probably think that it’s worked pretty well so far, so why upgrade it?  Well, if you’re not using a INTRAFUSE® AK G2™ Trigger Group, you’re limiting the potential of your rifle.  Our trigger group offers an improved trigger pull of 3-4 pounds and eliminates the painful trigger slap common with other designs.  We’ve created a “no fumble” trigger sleeve which allows you to assemble the trigger group outside of your rifle and then drop it in as one piece.  All of our G2 components are heat treated, manufactured out of 4140 tool-grade carbon steel, and finished in dark black oxide.  Upgrading your trigger assembly to the INTRAFUSE® AK G2™ Trigger Group, simply put, is the best decision you can make to bring out all the power your AK-47 has to offer.  To top it off, the G2™ counts as 3 U.S. 922r compliant parts.

 *Note: INTRAFUSE G2 Trigger Groups are not compatible with the Saiga platform. INTRAFUSE G2 Trigger Groups are also not compatible with NoDak Spud NDS-3 and NDS-65 ""economy"" receivers. In some cases, the use of these two products together can create accidental double firing of the firearm.

MODEL:  Silver Snipe

SERIAL NO:  A11111 (Note:  All parts have this matched serial number)

YEAR OF MFG:  Made in Italy – 1958 (date code XIV).  Gun qualifies for C&R status (Curio and Relic)

CALIBER:  12 gauge

ACTION:  Over/Under     

MARKINGS:  
The left side of the barrels are marked “Chromium Molybdenum Alloy Steel / P. Beretta – Gardone V.T. 
The underside of the barrels are marked “PB / S.55 / 3 Proof Marks / XIV” /PSF and “B”. 
Both receiver flats are marked “Pietro Beretta / Founded In 1680 / Silver Snipe 12 Gauge / Made In Italy”. 
The underside of the frame is marked “P. Beretta / Monobloc”. 

BARREL LENGTH:  26”

CHOKES:  Fixed, Improved Cylinder over Modified

SIGHTS:  Ventilated Rib, matte finish with single bead front sight

STOCK CONFIGURATION & CONDITION: All wood has been refinished.  The fore stock and cheek areas of stock are nicely checkered – checkering is still in decent condition with no wear spots. The stocks have been completely stripped and refinished using a spar varnish for durability.  Finish looks close to the original Silver Snipe factory finish when manufactured, only a bit tougher.  Walnut stain was applied to enhance the beauty of the wood, again similar to Beretta's process in the 1950's, but a bit darker. Four coats of finish have been applied and each coat rubbed out.  The final coat was rubbed out with with three levels of pumice, including Rottenstone.  The stock has not been in the field since being refinished. 

 TYPE OF FINISH (BARRELS):  Blue & Plated   Finish Originality: Stock and fore grip have been refinished.

 BORE CONDITION:  The bores are bright and shiny, basically mint condition with no visible erosion or pitting in either bore.   Overall Condition: The barrels retain about 90+% of their original bluing with no visible rust or pitting -- just some very modest signs of use. The receiver engraving shows almost no wear and the markings are crisp. There is a bit of wear showing in the trigger area, but nothing that impacts the appearance.  Overall, this gun rates V. Good+ condition.   Mechanics: The action functions very smoothly and correctly.  

SUMMARY: This Silver Snipe was manufactured from 1955–1967 in a variety of configurations, barrels and gauges, attracting legions of followers who even today swear by this shotgun. Anyone who has spent much time shooting sporting clays, skeet or trap or bird hunting is aware of the prominence that Beretta carries in the sport – and for good reason. This is a well made shotgun, manufactured in Italy.  The Gun qualifies for C&R status (Curio & Relic), but only looks like it is a few years old. The Gun has been well maintained and cared for. This is a sweet over/under that still belongs in the field, providing many years of enjoyment.

This Silver Snipe model originally sold in the neighborhood of $200 based on ads and catalogs from 1957 to 1961.  FMV of this firearm based on research of recent sales and listings are:  Excellent  $800+    Very Good  $700+   Good  $650+ 

Since I no longer upland bird hunt (focus is on fly fishing), it makes sense to sell the gun to someone who will use it in the field, relishing its' heritage, quality and smoothness."
