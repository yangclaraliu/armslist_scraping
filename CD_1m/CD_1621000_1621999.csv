I bought it to do some bird hunting. But it is very difficult for me to get a hunting license up here. As a single father of 2 and working full time, there is no way that I can satisfy the classtime requirements to get my hunting license. SO, this is useless to me.

There are a number of sub-assembly inspectors letter stamps which are very clear, as is the barrel addresss which is often worn and indistinct because it is so shallow and lightly stamped. I feel that the finish on the frame may have had some help possibly because the finish there is notorious for flaking off and so maybe it was an attempt to blend with the rest of the gun.Even so the various sub-assembly inspectors letters are still clear so it hasn't been overdone.

If you are thinking about buying an AR-15 in Maryland right now, you know how terrible it is. 60-70 day waiting periods for the Maryland State Police to approve your transfer because they are hopelessly behind, and the gun stores not even taking regulated transfers from out of state. After 7 days you can legally complete a transfer even if the MSP hasnt returned paperwork. So, rather than make you wait 70 days like the stores, if you want this rifle, we go down to MSP, fill out the background check for a regulated transfer to obey all laws, and after the 7 day wait period we will complete the transfer. If I think you are shady, I will politely decline to sell it to you. But if you are not shady, here is a way to get a FANTASTIC AR-15 and bypass all the lines while being 100% within the law.

I reserve the right to refuse sale to ANYONE, for ANY reason, at my discretion.

Now on to the rifle. 

Up for sale is a Bushmaster XM15-E2S. This was my first rifle, bought in 2009 and everything that could be upgraded was upgraded. I bought it new and proceeded to carefully research all the best upgrades to do to it. I added extras thoughtfully and carefully with an eye towards increasing ergonomics and function while keeping the weight as light at humanly possible.

**ACOG NOT INCLUDED** But we can talk about an Eotech.

The entire rifle has been treated with FROGLUBE as a lubricant, and it runs very smoothly. I dont know how to describe it other than ""smoothly"", meaning that the bolt carrier rides back and forth with minimal effort. Many AR's feel gritty or bumpy when you rack the charging handle as the bolt carrier isnt riding on the rails perfectly and the spring catches and gives you odd pressure. This one is super smooth.

My goal was to build the most modern AR possible as well as the lightest one possible. This rifle has more than you need, everything you want, and nothing you dont want. It has been loved and cared for, but is not a safe queen. 

Happy to meet for a test fire at On Target. Buyer pays range time and ammo, I have some brass cased PMC so they will let us shoot it in the range. Only asking 50c a round of 5.56, which is 25c under the going rate, so you know im not ripping you off on ammo.

So what are you waiting for? Cut the line while still obeying all MD laws and get your AR-15 in only 7 days!!!"

The top choice for law enforcement snipers. A large objective lens increases resolution and exit pupil size for rapid target acquisition and optimal light performance in twilight conditions…an especially useful configuration for tactical teams that may not have dedicated night vision. This superior optical design also benefits hunters and sport shooters who want to maximize their success in low-light environments. A large field of view, 110 MOA of adjustment and a practical magnification range make this an ideal riflescope for both snipers and sportsmen. ***The 3.5-15x56NXS is being discontinued and currently has limited availability"

Basically what you get is a tuned crisp trigger pull without all the creep and grind of your standard  AR trigger group. Also I can adjust the trigger pull within a range of 4-5 pounds up to the standard military spec. All you do is mail your trigger group including the trigger, disonnecter, hammer, and both springs. I include return shipping in the price with tracking..  Please contact me via email for more details if interested.  My time is limited so after the first five orders I will suspend services until these are finished and returned. Expect about a one week turn around from time I receive the parts.

The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots. Raffle  rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot."

Sold ...Sold......Sold.......


At the prices that I see listed on the Ruger speed six, I went and dug my Ruger out of the safe to sell.
I paid $210 for this Ruger speed six last February from a local pawn shop.
He had over 5 of them for sell so I picked the best one. The double action trigger is almost unusable. I cock the hammer back every time before I fire it so you may say that it's really a single action gun. Ruger discontinued this gun because of problems and poor sales. 
This is the only gun that I know that makes a High Point firearm look good.
Starting price is $900 but I will consider any amount over $200.  I tried last year for 3 months to sale this like new gun for $250 and no one wanted it. 
Today we have 3 of them for sale. ????????"

The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot."

I think this is a very great choice for concealed permit carriers, but again I'm all about pistols. You can contact me at REDACTED."

It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

The AWC DOA PSR 338 Lapua Magnum Suppressor is the quietest Suppressor you can find on the market. We had them build to our specs. You can use this can on everything from 300 Blackout to .338 Lapua Magnum.

The T.H.O.R PSR over the muzzle brake suppressor was engineered by AWC in partnership with Surgeon Rifles.

This suppressor was designed for the US Special Operations Command's Precision Sniper Rifle solicitation.

The T.H.O.R. PSR suppressor mounts over our muzzle brake for a faster attachment method that maintains the accuracy and repeatability of AWC thread on suppressors.

Manufactured from Titanium, the T.H.O.R. PSR suppressor is one of the lightest suppressors on the market to achieve minimal point-of-impact shift.

The muzzle brake by itself is an extremely effective recoil reducer. When sound suppression is desired simply thread your T.H.O.R. PSR suppressor on to the muzzle brake.

Remington 742 WoodsMaster .30-06

Great functioning, only problem would be a little bluing needed for the barrel. No warping or anything, cycles perfectly and could hit a quarter at 100 yards.
 Comes with an Aim Master 4x32 fixed reticle, nitrogen filled scope.
  2 x 10 round mags and a 4 round mag. 
  Very nice leather sling.

   I did the paint myself. Words can't describe what went into making the red outline without mixing it into the black, came out great and compliments the gun without being over the top. The paint is purely cosmetic, and doesn't affect its accuracy at all.
