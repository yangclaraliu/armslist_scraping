These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

MINT #20 or 500 CERTIFIED 

Henry 44.40 : Honoring Uncommon Valor in Our Nation's Greatest Trial 

In the summer of 1863, two mighty armies converged on a small, quiet Pennsylvania town - Gettysburg. Here, 65,000 Confederate troops led by General Robert E. Lee massed against Union General George Meade and his army of 85,000. In a bitter, three day struggle, these two mighty waves of blue and gray would crash headlong in what would become the greatest battle ever fought on American soil, and a monumental turning point in the War Between the States. 

To honor this epic event in American history, and to honor all the brave soldiers who fought at Gettysburg, America Remembers proudly presents the Gettysburg Tribute Rifle. For the Tribute, we have selected the legendary Henry Rifle, a coveted weapon of soldiers on both sides of the battle. 

Each rifle in the edition is produced for us by the master craftsmen of A. Uberti, which is regarded as the world's premier maker of historic firearms recreations. Gettysburg Tribute Henry Rifle

Left side features four portraits of notable military commanders at Gettysburg. There is Robert E. Lee, the revered military genius whose loyalty to Virginia made him end years of faithful service to the U.S. Army to become commander of the Confederate forces. George Meade matched wits with Lee at Gettysburg just days after assuming his post as commander of the Union Army. On the first day of fighting, John Buford and a small cavalry force held back the Confederate army for hours until Union reinforcements arrived. J.E.B. Stuart led a Confederate cavalry division in a spectacular three-hour cavalry battle against Union troopers. In the center is a depiction of Lincoln delivering his immortal Gettysburg Address at the dedication of the Gettysburg National Cemetery. To the right is an image of a cannon and artillerymen with an excerpt from Lincoln's historic speech: ""We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain."" Gettysburg Tribute Henry Rifle.

Right side features four portraits of legendary leaders at Gettysburg. There is James Longstreet, Robert E. Lee's field commander and the man he affectionately called his ""old warhorse."" Winfield Scott Hancock inspired the Union troops by braving heavy artillery bombardments and when injured, went on supervising the battle from his stretcher. George Pickett commanded the Virginia regiments that led the Confederate charge up Cemetery Ridge. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and the men of the 20th Maine held Little Round Top against repeated enemy charges before pushing the Confederates back with a counter-charge of their own. To the far right, a cannon and artillerymen are shown along with the inscription: ""Armistead at Pickett's Charge, July 3, 1863."" Prominently featured in the center is a battle scene with Lewis A. Armistead leading the Confederate forces that broke through to reach a Union cannon in what is often considered the ""High water mark of the Confederacy.""

Description 

Make/Model: Henry Repeating Rifle (Uberti) Barrel Length: 24 1/4"" Stock: Polished Walnut Caliber: .44-40 Edition Limit: 500 Decoration: Each Tribute rifle is decorated in 24-karat gold and nickel artwork with blackened patinaed highlights by craftsmen specifically commissioned by America Remembers.

GOLD plated Gettysberg Tribute. MINT #920 of 1863 CERTIFIED 

.44 Cal. Revolver: During those first three days of July, 1863, the usually quiet town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania found itself at the center of the storm that was the Civil War. 

In honor of the brave Americans who fought here, America Remembers, in cooperation with the Civil War Preservation Trust is proud to present the Gettysburg 1863 Army Revolver. 

Handcrafted with exacting detail, it is a spectacular firearm used by both Union and Confederate forces during the war. 

Gettysburg Revolver - Right Side On the right side are the inscribed words from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, delivered November 19, 1863 at the site of the battle - ""We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain."" 

Gettysburg Revolver - Left Side Barrel The left side of the barrel bears the 24-karat gold inscription, ""Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, July 1863."" 

Gettysburg Revolver Cylinder On the cylinder, this highly detailed panoramic etching captures the drama of Pickett's Charge. Note the detail in uniform and armament, and the Gettysburg farmhouse in the distance. With each rotation of the cylinder, another piece of the drama unfolds. A mounted officer falls to a rifleman's shot. A Confederate infantryman swings his empty rifle at a sword-wielding Union soldier. On horseback, on foot, and down on the ground, the battle is waged with pistols, bayonets, and knives. All the excitement and fury of this moment are immortalized in this 24-karat gold panorama. 

Gettysburg Revolver Case To display and protect the Gettysburg 1863 Revolver, we have created this handsome display case. The lid, inset with leather, features the striking silhouette of a general at Gettysburg, stamped in gold above the title, ""Gettysburg 1863."" Inside the case are a replica of the Gettysburg Address on parchment paper and two solid brass buckles, as worn by each army's officers to secure their holsters and swords. The rectangular buckle bears the Union's eagle and shield image; the circular buckle bears the initials of the Confederate States. In addition, each case features a brass plaque on the inside of the lid, ""Gettysburg 1863 Revolver, United States Society of Arms & Armour."" 

Description 

Model: 1860 Army Revolver (Uberti) Barrel Length: 8"" Caliber: .44 Grips: Walnut Chamber Capacity: 6 rounds Edition Limit: 1863 Decoration: Each Tribute revolver is decorated by craftsmen specifically commissioned by America Remembers with artwork designed specially for this Tribute.

Charging clips run $3 each or more now. Original cloth bandoleers run $6-up. Shoot the ammo, keep, sell or and/or trade the rest as collectibles. 

The MkVII Ball round is intended to 'keyhole' after impact by design, making it highly effective even for hunting. During WWI, the Germans made a formal complaint about the Mk VII bullet that went nowhere. If you don't know, the ballistics of the .303 British round compares very favorably with 7.62 NATO.

Drilled and tapped for scope mounts, these XP models come with a 3-9x40 matte blued scope, already mounted and bore-sighted, so it is ready to go on the hunt when you are. They also have a black synthetic stock coupled with a 22"" matte black carbon steel barrel to allow for multi-purpose shooting in multiple locales.

M600A The M600A Scout Light® attaches by means of an integral thumbscrewclamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. Its small size increasesweapon maneuverability, increases rail space available for other accessories,and minimizes added weight. It uses a high-efficiency LED emitter, virtuallyimmune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break, and a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to create a beam with good reach and significant peripheral light for close- to medium-range applications. Maximum output is 100 lumens, and it produces tactical-level light—more than enough to temporarilyoverwhelm the night-adapted vision of an aggressor—for over two hours per setof batteries. The M600A has two switch options: (1) a pushbutton tail-capswitch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; (2) amomentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferredlocation via self-stick Velcro® backing. Constructed ofhigh-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superiortoughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glassfor maximum light transmission, the M600A is O-ring sealed to keep out dust,dirt, and moisture. Battle-tested, built to withstand the rigors of combat.
Fits: 1913 rails
