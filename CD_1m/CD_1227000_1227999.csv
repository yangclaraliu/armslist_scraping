Unfortunately as you can see it is damaged and should see a gunsmith before it's fired. The frame is cracked at the magazine well and trigger area but the frame does not feel fragile at all and stays together when disassembling. The action works, the magazines fit and the firing mechanism does strike but that's as far as I will take it.

I have never fired this gun. It will be sold to the highest bidder with the understanding that it is as-is. 

***THIS GUN IS BEING SOLD FOR REPAIR/PARTS ONLY DUE TO OBSERVED DAMAGE TO THE FRAME***

It could be a parts gun or rebuilt but it's up to the buyer to determine it's ability to be *safely* fired.

There are many rare parts that are worth a good amount on this gun & I have heard of people useing epoxy to fix small hairline cracks in the tec lower - but I would see a gunsmith.

These Hungarian pistols were imported into the USA in far lesser quantities than the more common Chinese, Polish, and the more recent Yugo varieties. So it's seen far less and is more collectible than the more common varieties.

This particular pistol is in very good overall physical condition especially when you consider that it was an issue pistol that saw either military or police service. Mechanically it is in excellent shape with a  bright shiny bore and a reliable action. It retains the majority of it's original finish but does have the normal wear from being holster carried. It was manufactured in 1951 and is serial #1231. The numbers on the slide and frame match.

I researched the Hungarian variety of the TT-33 and discovered that they call it the M48. It was built almost identically to the Russian models, but it's distinguishing feature is the black plastic grips that have the Hungarian/Communist ""hammer & wheat"" seal embossed into them.

Pistol comes with an original (not reproduction) holster, two original magazines, original cleaning rod, & leather lanyard. Also included is a 70 round box of hot Polish ammo that is clean, shiny and sure to fire.

Price is $575.00

Transaction - FTF, cash (or trade) and you pick up. Must be a Florida resident and at least 21.

Black tapcoT-6  6-position stock. Expands or contracts to fit any shooter.
Bayonet AND front foregrip installed, see pictures. You don't find that often, it's pretty great. Bayonet fits snugly into bayonet slot as it should when it's closed, and it clears the foregrip at all times.
All Numbers Match, excellent condition throughout. Cycles, fires and functions flawlessly. Selling to pay my bills and asking for a firm and very fair price.
You get the SKS rifle in the TAPCO stock.
2 TAPCO detachable 20 round magazines.
TANGO-DOWN brand, front foregrip installed.
SKS spike bayonet installed and fully functional with the foregrip in place.
Hi-Rise cheek rest that you can take off as you wish. It sets perfectly to line you up with the 4x32 scope. 
This rifle is tight as a drum and the action is like new. Whole thing looks and functions like new. Front and rear iron sites, (which are adjustable to 1100 yards/1000 meters [and the numbers are printed right on the rear site], can be seen perfectly, even with the scope installed. You can use the iron sites or the 4x32 sniper scope, it's your choice.
Two scopes come with the rifle, see pics. The 4x32 sniper scope, as seen in the pic. It sits atop a receiver cover that has 4 factory hold-down screws that keep this thing rigidly in place. It used to be that a receiver mounted scope ""walked around"" a bit and was a bad choice because the receiver cover would move slightly after multiple shots, but this 5th generation receiver cover from UTG with the set screws and retainer nuts is the real-deal and it is a rigid and excellent set up that will not move after you zero your scope. Rifle also has the shell deflector installed so the expelled shells don't hit your scope.
If you don't want to use the magnifying scope, loosen the nuts and pull the pin on the receiver cover and take off the whole 4x32 set-up...(((it's all bolted together, receiver cover, scope and mounts and shell deflector and comes off easily as one unit)))...then pop the original receiver cover on (which is included of course) and then install your projection red-dot scope, also included in this deal(as seen in the picture). This red-dot scope is of good quality and works great. If you don't know what a Red-Dot scope is, it is for QUICK shouldering and aiming of rifle. One dot, that's all.... no lining up the front and rear site. Turn the switch on, then appears on the screen- One red dot...put that dot on your target and pull the trigger. It works perfect and the technology, I don't really even understand.  But it's faster than open sites ever could be. I've got a red-dot on my shotgun too. 
The only thing that I don't have for this is a strap. But it has the strap mounts on the gun and is ready for you to install one if you want.
This is kind of my dream rifle, so-to-speak. It's just a gun, but it is pretty great. I am parting with it because God gave me enough sense to sell it when I can't pay my bills.
I'll throw in 20 rounds of non-corrosive Wolf ammo, so that you have a little ammo to start.   And I have about 700 rounds that I'll sell you:   50 cents a round- That's what I paid for it- and that's what I'll sell it for. As many as you want up till their gone. I don't need any ammo if the gun is gone obviously.  It's great:  Thanks."

This came before the Intratec TEC-9 and was designed by Interdynamic AB of Sweden (The Perfered Model). 

Unfortunately as you can see it is damaged and should see a gunsmith before it's fired. The frame is cracked at the magazine well and trigger area but the frame does not feel fragile at all and stays together when disassembling. The action works, the magazines fit and the firing mechanism does strike but that's as far as I will take it.

I have never fired this gun. It will be sold to the highest bidder with the understanding that it is as-is. 

***THIS GUN IS BEING SOLD FOR REPAIR/PARTS ONLY DUE TO OBSERVED DAMAGE TO THE FRAME***

It could be a parts gun or rebuilt but it's up to the buyer to determine it's ability to be *safely* fired.

There are many rare parts that are worth a good amount on this gun & I have heard of people useing epoxy to fix small hairline cracks in the tec lower - but I would see a gunsmith.

When ammo is finally available in large quantities (maybe 3 months if YOU are lucky) you will be out even more money. Right now, the ammo you have is ""worth"" at most 0.65 per round. You try and sell said ammo for $1.00 per round. If you got tricked into paying 0.85 per round, I understand your pain, most of us did the same. Here is the lesson. If you make your ammo prices reasonable now, you will make some of your money back. Losing money SUCKS, we get it. But, if you wait 3-5 months to sell your ammo back, and the retailers are selling ammo for 0.30 per round, you will lose even more. ARMSLIST was created to make both sides (buyer and seller) happy. If we wanted to be screwed we would all buy ammo at the range. Do EVERYONE a favor and start making DEALS, not killings. Some A-Holes at Super Dave's in Norman were trying to sell .223 for 1.25 per round and .22 for 100 per brick. The best part, a booth right across the way had it all for HALF THE PRICE.  Seriously, HALF THE PRICE. The prices made the over-priced table look like a group of spoiled kids on the playground showing off. Don't be ""that"" guy.

I bought it last month, February 2nd, at the Greenville Gun and Knife show for my wife as her conceal carry.  She's used it enough to know she doesn't like the bigger kick of a 9mm round in a sub-compact and would rather stick with her Bersa Thunder .380 instead.  I've shot this weapon myself and I found it to be smooth, accurate, easy to operate, and the recoil lower in comparison to the Ruger LC9 or Kel-Tec PF9, with no FTF's or FTE's.  You'll be hard pressed to find a poor review on this gun, good luck trying.  I have the original box, papers, and trigger lock wrenches.  Comes with 3 factory 7-round magazines, with finger extensions, and 2 flat base plates as well, to switch out if you find you don't like the extenders.  If you do a quick search online to purchase extra mags for this particular fire arm, you'll find they run anywhere from $60 to $80 easily, some times more, so I added them as a part of this deal.  See also the below bullet list for full features and benefits.  Everything goes for $425, price is firm, and for an additional $20 I will throw in a 50 round box of Russian steel cased WPA Polyformance 115 GR. FMJ ammo for the range.  Face-to-face transactions only, must be 21, have a valid SC state ID or CWP, and sign a bill of sale.  I answer email and texts pretty quickly if you have questions.  Please feel free to leave me a voice mail if I'm unavailable and I'll return your phone call ASAP.  Brent at REDACTED, thanks for looking!

Grenade launchers are pretty cool to mount under your AR... but not really all that practical and pretty expensive to shoot!!! so add a .22 under your AR and be the talk of the shooting range. It uses 10/22 mags which just about everybody has. It doesnt come from the factory with a mag, but I have a 10rnd and a 25rnd I will add with it.

Ultra-high capacity magazines keep your rifle running longer between mag changes during competition or tactical operations. These magazines meet NATO STANAG 4179 specifications and are compatible with all rifles that accept AR-15/M16/M4 magazines. Less than two standard magazines wide, so they’re easy to hold and handle with one hand. 60-round model fits most dual-mag pouches for 30-round magazines. Weight is centered under the weapon to help you maintain a normal shooting grip and stance. Seats fully loaded on a closed bolt. “Nesting” nylon followers require no lubrication and fully support the round stack to aid in reliable feeding. Cadmium coating on springs reduces friction and resists corrosion.

Fully functional.  You won't see too many that look like this.

All it has done is sit in my safe, and am going to sell to fund a new project. 

Don't waste your time with some of the lesser brands. Get the best you can afford now. Take a look at the famous ""AR-15 Chart"" and you'll see you can't do better than a BCM. And yes, that is a Troy quadrail. 

Even better is that this rifle utilizes the highly preferred mid-length gas system. The MagPul AFG shown in the picture is also included. 

$2195 The Aimpoint is NOT included, however, I will sell the sight with the rifle for an additional $500 (Total $2695) 

I'm not particularly anxious to sell this rifle, as such, I'm not interested in any trades.

Face to face in Denver metro area, no bad guys, Colo resident, etc. etc. 

Will consider shipping to an FFL but you'll pay for actual shipping and I will only ship after I've received a Postal Money Order or some other liquid funds.

489,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1227489,For Sale:  1940's-era Velo Dog with folding trigger,"Reynoldsburg, Columbus, Ohio",$ 250,"Listed On: Saturday, March 9, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I found this in a box from my late father's estate. I know nothing about guns so this is new territory for me! My dad was in WWII so I am assuming that he brought this back with him from Europe. I have finally got a definite ID on the gun. It is a Velo Dog. It was introduced in 1894 in France as a gun to keep dogs away while riding bicycles. Although designed in France, it was mainly manufactured in Belgium. They were made in 22,25,and 32 cal. configurations, if I understand it correctly. It is a 5 shot revolver with a folding trigger. The action is still good and everything seems to work. It hasn't been restored, but it has been cleaned and oiled.  Some of the markings on it are ""p8f"", ""6.35Br"", ""37"", and ""PVRC"", with  a crown over the Rand a star over the C. There is another symbol over the P, but I can't make it out. That's about all I can tell you about this gun. I feel like it has a connection to WWII somehow, but I can't be sure. My dad talked about finding a gun on the ground when he was at the Battle of the Bulge, but I couldn't say for sure if this is the same one. However, I just found a customs declaration from when my dad came back from Europe,dated July 15, 1945,  and it lists a revolver-25 cal. This might mean that this is the gun he brought back from WWII, but ther is no positive way to tell.  It measures 4.5 inches long. One guy I spoke to thought it would be worth as much as $400, and as little as $100. So, I split the difference at $250.  Let me know if you have any questions. I would like to sell this locally if possible."

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. This carbine is a National Postal Meter.  It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP a few years back. It has a low 1.4 million serial number so was made in middle of WWII. Stock is birch and is clean with only a few dings.

I am selling it with 50-rds ammo, two 30-round magazines, and a carbine pouch with two-15 round magazines (15-round mags are loaded with ammo). It also includes the sling and oiler.

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

I had no intent of selling any of my carbines but with the craziness in Colorado (proposed high-capacity mag ban, limitations on private sales, etc.), I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and with 15- and 30-round magazines legally at a fair price. This is the third one I am selling.

If you are not familar with the M1 Carbine you should do some research.  These are our first real a$$ault rifle.  My favorite gun to shoot - they always go to the shooting range.  The AKs and ARs are more intermittent.

Please send me a message if you have questions. Not interested in trades and price is firm. Thanks for considering."

Beautiful detail throughout the bird’s eye, beak, breast feathering, wing feathering, talons, wreath and mobile swastika. The grip also is most attractive. It is a yellow grip which is probably plaster filled. The reverse ricasso is etched with the double oval logo which contains the firm’s name and location, “F.W. Höller Solingen”.
The blade is very nice with a needlelike tip: however, tip is slightly dented. 
I was told it can be easily fixed but I'm not willing to try.
I've seen these listed in the past for close to $1,000.00. I'm asking less because of the small dent and I will take reasonable offers if interested.

Ruger makes storage and transport even easier than before. Readily separated into two halves, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate as every Ruger 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. Despite the ease of assembly and reassembly, the lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero – even when receiver mounted optics are used.
The Ruger 10/22 Takedown ships in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachments points for the padded, single-shoulder strap offer different carrying options.
The 4.67-pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37″ long when assembled; each half is less than 20-1/4″ when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action, and provided with one 10-round rotary magazine, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a new compact and portable package."

Took this is as part of a trade today, but since I already have one (which is my backup daily carry) I'm passing this onto one of you. 

This LCP was purchased in October 2012, so is basically brand new. I broke it down once I got it home (as I do with everything I bring in on trade) and other than some very light holster wear on the slide, its in top notch condition. I gave it a nice cleaning, but it really didn't need it, which leads me to believe it was barely fired. BTW these LCPs are probably the easiest pistols to field strip and clean that I've ever come across - kodos Ruger!

Comes with original box, lock, paperwork, and even original receipt (although i'll redact the buyers personal info for privacy purposes). 

This pistol was purchased out the door for $379 (as per the receipt). 

As always no cash offers please, trades only. I'll also throw in a pocket holster (assuming you're nice, and not an ass! (="

Please contact me if you have one of the 3 guns to sell.

EMAG features the same pop-off Impact/Dust Cover as the PMAG GEN M2 to prevent dirt and debris intrusion and protect the feedlips from potential impact damage during transit and storage. When not in use, the Impact/Dust Cover can be stored on the magazine's floorplate to prevent possible loss.

For easy and accurate identification of loaded round count via the large, dual-sided MagLevel windows, the stainless steel magazine spring is coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color. Numerical indicators are added to the body to identify 5, 15, and 25 loaded rounds.

The Rasheed is among the rarest of all military production rifles with only about 8000 ever produced. I won't go into great historical detail because I believe that most who would purchase this rifle will be well aware of it's history and rarity. The rifle is gas operated and has a 10 round magazine that can be quickly reloaded using a standard 7.62 x 39 (10) round stripper clip.

This particular rifle is just about as good a one as you are ever likely to find with regard to physical and mechanical condition. The majority of these rifles are pretty beat up from the service they saw in Egypt. This one however retains almost all of it's original finishes and the bore, action, magazine & bayonet are in excellent condition. It could also serve as a very formidable self defense weapon with similar rate of fire and power to the very popular SKS rifle.

Rifle comes with it's original attached folding bayonet, magazine and sling. The ammo and stripper clips shown in the pictures are also included.

I can add cash.

The first, and the nicest, is an essex frame with an essex slide. This is extremely well matched and the internals except slide are all Springfield. It matches up beautifully due to the original owners obsession with finishing it out. It has been lapped and the rails are polished. Its trigger is great and I recently had it cerakoted. This shoots everything but lead SWC, which is what I have decided to change to. I value this in the $625-$650 range.

The second is an essex frame with what a gold cup national match slide (only roll stamped 'Colt, Hartford Conneticut' the fifties Gold Cups where not marked) with the adjustable rear sights and high rise shark fin front sight. It shoots well but does not like the 185gr SWC bullets I like. I value this in the $550-$600 range (finished out nicely this exact set up go for nearly $1000 on GunBroker). Not perfect easily remedied. I will keep the Delta grips unless you have something great to trade.

As far as my interests, I would love something with a rail, but that is not a necessity. I would do a trade for a Dan Wesson or other higher end guns regardless of the finish and configuration. I prefer Colt and Sig.

Selling a Ruger Mini-14. This is the newer model with the heavier barrel for reduced overheating and shot stringing. It has significantly better accuracy than older versions which are selling for 700+. This particular rifle is not only more accurate because it is newer, it is also the up-rated stainless all-weather version, which makes it ideal for shooters who live by the sea. These guns were selling for 800-900$ retail before the panic.

In addition, this gun comes with an aftermarket Teach Sights rear sight assembly which is far more stable and easy to adjust than the factory rear sight. A 100$ value. It also comes with scope rings, 4 10-round magazines (2 factory, 2 aftermarket ~100$ value total). 

It also comes with a Choate Machine Tool stock in addition to the factory stock, worth ~100$.
[WARNING: ATTACHING THIS STOCK WITHOUT INSTALLING A BULLET BUTTON MAKES THE RIFLE AN ASSAULT WEAPON]

1k buys you the rifle along with the above-mentioned extras. It's a screaming deal with all the price-gouging going on since you're buying an 800$ rifle with 300$ of mods and extras for 1k. This price is firm.

BUT THERE'S MORE
I also have:
-1700 rounds of .223 ammunition. 1400 of it is steel-cased (which the rifle will cycle with no issue because it's a mini-14) and 300 of it is highly accurate, brass-cased, Fiocchi 50gr V-Max. With current market conditions being what they are, this is about ~1500$ worth of ammo which I will sell for only 1k to whoever buys my rifle.
-4 30-round rebuild kits, FACTORY, NOT AFTERMARKET. These are a must-have for anyone who owns a Mini-14. Extremely reliable and solidly built, but also very hard to get. They often trade hands for 100$ per unit due to panic buying. My price is 75$ each or 250 for the lot. Again, ONLY to whoever buys the rifle.
-Leupold 4x scope. A simple hunting scope made by Leupold, lifetime guarantee still valid. Extremely well made. 150$.

I will take no less than 2200 for the whole lot."
