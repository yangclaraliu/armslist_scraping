Don't have to sell, so don't bother low balling given the current situation. I'll keep if i can't get what i'm asking. It's in great shape and has less than 200 rounds through it. 

The M&P15A at the week-long Smith & Wesson-Gunsite Invitational. Except for the Gunsite Raven engraved on the lower receiver, the addition of a Brownells low-profile ambi sling adaptor and a Surefire M73 AR/M4 Picatinny fore-end, my rifle was just like any other M&P15A. It is a direct gas-operated AR-15-pattern carbine built with great attention to detail. Slots in the integral mil-std 1913 rail on the A3 flattop are numbered so that optics can be returned to the same place if removed, eliminating the need to rezero the gun. The single-stage trigger broke cleanly at seven pounds after very little creep.

M&P15s are chambered to 5.56mm NATO specifications, making them particularly suitable for shooting military ammunition. The 1:9-inch twist, M203-contoured, 4140-steel, 16-inch barrel is chrome lined, as are the chamber, bolt carrier and gas key. At the business end of the barrel resides an A2 birdcage-style flash suppressor, and sling swivels are installed on the bottom and left side of the gas block. The side swivel can be switched to the right side if desired. At the friendly end of the M&P15A is a six-position collapsible buttstock, making the overall length of the piece 353?4 inches when extended, 32 1/2 inches when the stock is collapsed.

The magazine release, bolt catch and safety are standard GI and worked as expected. Fieldstripping is typical AR, but the takedown pin and pivot pin on the sample gun were very tight and required light tapping with a punch to drive out. The M&P15A accepts standard AR-15 magazines and worked well with both factory and Brownells magazines, which is significant because AR magazines are a common source of rifle problems such as jams."

I acquired this original style A2 rifle but I don't use the AR platform for this type of of setup.  The barrel is stamped 5.56 and I think it has the 1/9 twist.  It is a 16 in. Hbar barrel with a carbine length gas system.  The A2 upper doesn't have any markings designating its manufacture.  I was told that this rifle was a pre-ban rifle made by PWA.  I did a little research and found out that PWA never manufactured full rifles.  Anyway, the flash hider and crush washer were removable and I put on a brand new set so It isn't a pre-ban style upper anymore.  As can be seen in the photos, the bottom forend has an aluminum rail installed with picatinny cut outs for a front grip etc.

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

The pistols are identical, however, the one I got today had a unique magazine (see pics.)  I have used the BHP extensively, and this is the very first time I have ever seen such a magazine.  It has an external spring clip on the back of the mag about one half inch above the buttplate.  I know what it is for, as the BHP has a magazine disconnect that prohibits ""regular"" mags from dropping free.  This spring does a fantastic job of shooting the mag completely free of the mag well.

This particular mag is a ""post ban"" and has the following stamped into the metal:
Right side...
RESTRICTED LAW ENFORCEMENT
GOVT USE AND/OR EXPORT ONLY 9-14-94
Left side...
PATENT 5,353,537
MADE IN ITALY CALIBER 9MM LUGER

My questions are...
--How reliable, or how strong are these springs?
--Are these mags still being manufactured?
--If they are still available, who carries them?
--Do you have any for sale, and if so, how much?
--Since I remove the mag disconnect anyway so that ""regular"" mags drop free is any of this worth my time and money?"

Ever since S&W changed their manufacturing process to build an integrated lock into the frame of each new revolver, these trustworthy classics are getting harder and harder to find. But they are awesome to behold and even better to shoot.

At $675, this pistol is worth every cent I'm asking for it.
You know it. I know it. And you know it.

This gun is a staple in any respectable firearm owner's collection and this example happens to be in stellar condition.

Less than 150 rounds fired--you can tell by the barely visible wear line on the cylinder--broken in and nothing more.

S&W revolvers are famous for their smooth double action pull and crisp clean single action pull. This one's a might better than any I've ever fired. In single action the trigger pull is nearly effortless, for perfect shots on target.

This model holds 6 shots of .357 Magnum or .38 Special and has the red front ramp sight and adjustable rear serrated sight.

It comes with the Hogue Soft Rubber grips seen in the picture as well as a complete box of 25 Hornady 140 grain FXT .357 Magnum hollowpoints (I located them to another box but they're all there).

The 686 is a fantastic gun and if there was anyway I could build out my collection and hold onto this pistol, believe me I would. 

Contact me via email through Armslist or text 4O4-954-289O if you're willing to meet at a Police Precinct or Sheriff's Office (I won't meet you anywhere else), preferably in Gwinnett County and:
1) you have a trade listed below 
2) your offer is over $625 cash

I am selling my carbine- an LWRC M6A1 upper on an LMT lower. This has been a fantastic rifle for me. Anyone who is familiar with these two brands knows the quality and craftsmanship associated with them. The upper is an Land Warfare Resources Co. (LWRC) piston operated system. The LMT lower features a BCM medium charging handle, teflon-coated 6-position mil-spec buffer tube with an H-2 buffer (VLTOR buttstock). The trigger is a mil-spec rounded hammer control group. 

I put an OD green coat of DuraCoat on it and it has served me well. Some of the DuraCoat is wearing off. This can be easily covered up with another coat of OD or even FDE DuraCoat or even Cerekote. Personally, I never liked showing up to the range looking like my rifle was straight out of the box anyway. 

The gun is spectacularly clean and runs FLAWLESSLY. It will eat any ammo you put through its ultra-reliable and clean piston system. I have taken two carbine courses with it and I have never had any issues. The only reason I am selling is that I just bought another LWRC and I want to buy a can for it... turns out shooting is an expensive hobby.

I would prefer to meet face to face to do any deals but I will ship to your FFL at buyer's expense."

Product Description:
Our CQB Sling is an ambidextrous single point sling similar to our Urban Ops Sling but with the added benefit of heavy duty elastic cord added to each side of the weapon attachment point. The elastic creates tension that keeps the weapon secured close to the body when released with little or no slack in the sling to get caught up on equipment when you need to shoulder the weapon. Designed to be used with weapons equiped with sling mounts behind the receiver and will fit most factory or aftermarket loop style attachment points. Features heavy duty nylon webbing, steel powder coated 'HK' style hook and a Fastex buckle to allow the weapon to be dropped without removing the sling. Color is Coyote Brown."

Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber GripsÂ®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber GripsÂ®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.
