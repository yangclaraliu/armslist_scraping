Ready to follow your every move, the MRAD adapts to a variety of user needs without sacrificing performance. With unrelenting precision and unfailing accuracy, this bolt action newcomer has  already defined a whole new class of long-range rifles. 

The MRAD rifle’s user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun’s modularity. The precision-grade barrel can be removed by simply unscrewing two bolts using a  

standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design paves the way for future caliber interchangeability and serviceability. 

The MRAD also boasts Barrett’s new easily accessed trigger module. This match-grade trigger is drop-fire-proof and combat-ready. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. 

Integrated into the MRAD rifle’s 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is an M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper and 21.75 inches of rail space. The configurable side and bottom rails can also hold a number of accessories. 

The MRAD rifle’s stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. When folded, the stock latches around the bolt handle for added security during transport. Because the stock folds to the bolt handle side of the action, the rifle is the same width overall, folded or extended. 

Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle’s length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. 

From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color of the rifle that blends into any environment—every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own. 

Features: 
Bolt guide acts as a dust cover to reduce contaminants 
Accepts standard M4/M16 pistol grips 
Ambidextrous magazine release 
Front-loading barrel design for caliber interchangeability

INOX version

. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may easily ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. The grip frame is flared slightly at the base to enhance pointability and control.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm. This INOX is presented with 2 - 15rd mags. Additional factory mags available as in stocd,

These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

I bought this brand new from Maryland Small Arms Range in early February.
The rifle has approx 300 rounds through it and shoots absolutely flawlessly.

All the hype you've heard about the Kriss Vector is true...it really has hardly any recoil at all. It is very easy to shoot and stay on target to keep shooting.

I also purchased the Vector Surefire E1B Flashlight Kit from Kriss, which is a flawless setup and looks really good and is very bright. Along with the Surefire, I bought the Kriss foregrip which has a slot for the Surefire activation pad built in to it.

On top of that, I have 10 Kriss 25+ Extended Mags. These are the authentic Kriss/Glock ones. They are listed as 25, but can hold 28-30.


I hate to let it go, but have run into the need for money due to job situation.
I'm looking to get $2500 obo for this setup.

I have more pictures if you are interested. You can also call me at REDACTED (Sam).

It was not a police trade in it was privately owned since 1998. It comes with 2 high cap pre bans and 1 10 round mag. Glock is mint no holster wear at all unlike most glocks you'll find in this state. I really really want a Glock 30 and I'd be willing to add cash on my end for it. Also would like a Glock 21 as well. I'm into a lot of different handguns so hit me up with other trade offers. I do love glocks though lol. Cash I am asking only 600 and that is firm considering its condition high cap mags and current market in this state. So if your from a free state and say that its only worth 350-400 maybee you will be ignored. It's a Massachusetts thing you'll have to understand. If someone has a Glock 30 I can also add hard cast bullet heads and once fired brass with it. Thanks.

One is a true 5 round, and the other is a 10 round with a block in it for 5 rounds. 
These Magazines were produced by CMI(Check-Mate Industries) for Springfield Armory
The magazine followers were produced by Borg Warner & Winchester Olin-Matheson

Springfield Armory cleaning kit package does not have a case.

Local Gun shop purchased all the rest of the magazines I had a few months back and sold them for $65-85 each.  They were new unused 20/10/5 rounders.  Found these last two cleaning out some hunting gear.   Used one deer season back in the 90s.   Back in the 90s Springfield armory did not stamp their logo on the magazines.   The way to determine Manufacturer if not initialed is by USGI Drawing D7790197 which allows for the latch plate to be attached to the magazine body by two, four, five or six welds. USGI M14 magazine latch plate weld dimple patterns were consistently the same pattern according to manufacturer.  The following latch plate dimple pattern was consistently used for genuine USGI magazines; Six (6) weld dimples with a horizontal line immediately above the bottom pair - CMI   Checkmate Industries.

Being that I purchased these so long ago, I had called Springfield Armory customer service to verify the manufacturer.  They stated all the magazines have been made by Check-Mate Industries(CMI) for the last 20 + years for springfield armory. The last few years they(springfield Armory) have stamped their logo on it. A few years back they also had some USGI surplus. 

Also, they reminded me you need to have the bolt locked back to insert the 5 round is what I believe he told me.

From Check-Mate's website
(M1A) M14 Magazines
Currently Check-Mate Industries is the largest (M1A) M14 magazines manufacturer for the United States Military. 
Check-Mate Industries is recognized as being America’s number one manufacturer of M14 magazines.
At present the only round capacity we offer for the M14 magazines are 5, 10 and 20 rounds. CMI is currently working on the development and production of a reliable 25rd M14 magazine.

The quad rail features four integrated Picatinny rails for mounting a wide range of accessories.

do some reading on these, and you will want one.  VERY pleasant to shoot, very accurate.  The hammer forged polygonal rifling makes it easy to clean.  It's had 98 rounds through it.  I bought two extra twenty round mags (eighty-five bucks apiece before the current panic made them sky rocket in price).  The scope can stay with the rifle for an extra $850.00 (Docter Optic 4.5-14X40 and great German quality) or I can mount a Burris on it for the asking price of the rifle as shown in photos.
This is FN build quality throughout.  Trigger is factory set at 3.5-5 pounds, has a number of stock adjusment features and is a fine weapon overall.  At $1475.00 you can have the B scope.  At $2325.00 I'll leave the Docter Optic on it.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.  Will consider an excellent to new Rem 700 VTR in .308 as partial trade.
