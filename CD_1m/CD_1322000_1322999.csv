             I am the second owner on this Benelli. I bought it off of a guy out of state. It was a safe queen, original owner stated maybe 10 rounds shot out of it. I picked it up, a couple weeks ago, and fired maybe 20 rounds through it, cleaned it and into storage. 

              It fired everything flawlessly. (Walmart birdshot, 00 Buck, even Fiochet low recoils 00 Buck). It comes with 3 choke tubes (ill have to check which ones), surefire forend light, rifle sights, side saddle (Velcro), extension tube (holds 7), and the original equipment that was replaced with the above Listed. 

              Also comes with Original box & paperwork for the shotgun & aftermarket parts. I'd put it at 98% just because I'm sure there is a ding somewhere from the safe. 
             Some of the m1's & M2's can be finicky with certain ammo when  you add a forend light addition or side saddle. This was why I tested it out with the 20 rounds. Very fun & not to bad on the shoulder. Since it is inertia fed it is considered more reliable but kicks more like a pump. It also has a self cleaning system (perk of Benellis). 
   Why am I trading/ selling it? Because I seriously have  a problem. I buy, build, shoot, sell or trade

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, v5 is perfectly adapted for end-users who plan on attaching the ever popular red dot, holographic or magnified optics to their firearm.

Primers, like the powder, are fed only if a case is present. No wasted primers or spilled powder. Alternate loading sequence lets you load only one case at a time. Makes learning easy for the first time user and great for fine adjustments or experimenting. You can start reloading good ammunition minutes after the press is bolted down. Change calibers in just 3 minutes. Comes with turret ready to run 45 ACP, and a second turret with 38 SPL (38 SPL dies need the flare funnel for the auto charge), shellplates for both calibers, disks for powder measure, large and small primer feeders. Also comes with a new rifle charging die if you are going to convert to small rifle. This thing is ready to rock.

All Glock 21 guts and barrel kit for 275. Will make your .45 round feel like a 9mm. I have a large assortment of ammo(including some 45 super and some.460)  which can be worked in also. I also have a few Magpul/Glock 21 30 round mags which are almost extinct for 150.00 a piece or 6 new p mags for one. I have seen these mags for 200 and sell quick.I sold 4 for 750.00 at once and these are my last 3. They cost me around that much with the aftermarket stiffer springs for quicker feeding to shoot .45 Super and .460. 4 times stronger and much more life in them than the Korean 26 round mags which don't even drop free and often separate when dropped. Springs also fit the Kriss Super VEE. Springs are better for full auto in Super Vee than original springs.

Like I said, it is not a tricked out 1911 and it is used. I don't know the round count nor could I try to even guess but it still shoots straight and has plenty of life left in it. In fact I'm not even 100% sure I'll let it go. I did want to make it into a project/hobby piece for some do it yourself gunsmith experience and if I don't make a deal I still will.

These revolutionary bullets from Barnes are made of 100% copper and contain no lead. When the bullet expands, four razor-sharp cutting petals are created, allowing the bullet to penetrate farther through tough bone and tissue. These bullets usually retain 100% of their original weight, making them a superb choice for hunting. Barnes recommends initially seating bullets 0.050"" off the lands. Best accuracy will be found from 0.030"" to 0.070"" depending on the rifle. This is not loaded ammunition.

The EOTech 557 Law Enforcement and Military Night Vision Holographic Red Dot Sight is ideal for use with magnifiers or night vision devices. This sight features the button operation on the side rather than the front making it much more convenient for the user, as well as a ballistic reticle designed for .223 ammunition. The base of the sight is designed to clear the delta ring and handguard on M4 style weapons which reduces the amount of rail space needed for mounting. Making this sight even more appealing is the fact that it runs on easy to find AA batteries."

I'm trying to build my gun collection, and it started to occur to me that I'm much more fond of revolvers.  I don't know why, but I just seem to gravitate toward them more.  Therefore, I'm looking to trade some of the semi-auto pistols I have.  This Mak is unbelievably reliable.  It's not the prettiest gun in the world (by that I mean it's nothing fancy), but I've put hundreds of rounds through it and never had a jam, FTF, FTE or any other problem I've ever heard of.  It's low maintenance, easy to field strip and fires easily with very little recoil.  If you're interested, I have no preferences or biases regarding particular brands or models, but I'm not really interested in .22's.  Probaly 38's or higher.  You can text me at cellREDACTED or respond to this email.  Buy or trade, I'll take a look at any offer.  Thanks."
