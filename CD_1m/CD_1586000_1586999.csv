It is sitting brand new on a dealers Form 3 (tax free) 
It can be sent to your class 3 dealer without paying any extra taxes to the BATFE or you can just get it from him, Kansas City area.
I will also include a blank copy of a Kansas specific NFA trust that I paid a lawyer over $500 to draft up for me.
I chose this suppressor/silencer because it is the best made for the AR15.
It is the quietest one AAC or possibly anyone else made for the 556/223.
Because of its over the barrel design it has more internal volume in which to suppress gas but only adds 4 inches to the length of the gun.
Features the M.I.T.E.R. fast attach system allows you to calibrate the can to the unsuppressed zero, so you get
repeatability without the need of making additional sight adjustments.
The SPR/M4 also does a better job of reducing gas blowback through the weapon and into your face. 
I have $1300 invested but I would take $1100 which would cover your BATFE tax stamp.
Plus I am including a fill in the blanks Kansas specific gun trust worth over $500.
It took me forever to hunt this down, and that was almost a year ago, they are next to impossible to find now.
You can search google for ""spr/m4 review"" or arfcom, weaponevolution, m4carbine, etc.
Most everybody will agree it is one of the best ever made.
I will get pictures up when my dealer gets them to me.
I am willing to entertain offers.

Mine is truly like new since I bought it new, fired 10 rounds and it has not left the safe.  I have the Savage cardboard box if you want it.  The small towns listed in the title are the only meeting places to which I am willing to travel.  I will need to see a Valid Indiana DL and handgun permit - I know the law does not require a LTCH to buy this rifle.  I will require you to sign a rec't stating that I sold this rifle to you - that is all.  I will not record your DL or permit information.    Thank you"

Functions very well and is very accurate with ridiculously tight shot groups.
This is an RG brand (also called Rohm).  Rohm makes a cheap .22 caliber handgun that is not worth that much and doesn't have a favorable track record; but the Rohm .38 special (this gun) is a good solid and heavy gun with a good and reliable track record and will give you no trouble. They are dependable, as is this one and they have been and will be, around for decades. This one is more than 20 years old and it functions great. 
I can honestly say that it is the best feeling handgun that I own. It feels right and balanced in your hand, it doesn't kick much at all and it puts the shot on the paper where you expect it to go. A great piece for the money. It feels better than my .40 Springfield XD. I have over half a box of ammo that I'll give you with it, also.
Email me and I'll meet you one day.. during the day preferably.  I Plan on selling it, but I can't help but to say that I will consider all trades, regardless of whether they are firearms or not. I'm always interested in trading."

This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA."

I suffered a shoulder injury in July of 2012 but thought I could hunt. Went out on Dec. 19th for a Duck hunt. Fired one (1) round thru the gun and knew I had a shoulder problem. Got MRI on Dec. 21st and had a 4 1/2 hour surgery on the morning of the 24th. Great x-mas right? Severed top tendon and tore both front and back tendons. Have been in physical therapy since January and the Doctor says I will never put a shotgun to this shoulder again without losing the use of the arm. So this gun is NEW......I don't think one round makes it used. As you can see gun has Camo covering. Comes complete with all chokes and manuals. Has the hard case for carry. Also comes with magnetic clip on front sight in multi-color. Also including 5 boxs Remington #2 steel and 1 box BB's for geese. Model is Benelli SA Vinci 3"" Max4 12 guage with 28"" barrel.

I have about twenty offers for $150, some from people being very rude as if they are doing me a great favor by taking this off my hands.  I do not need to sell this gun, but am doing so just to reduce the total number I have.  If I can't get something over $160, I'll just keep it.  

A few other added notes.  I'm tired of wasting my time with rude people or people who think they are doing me a favor by making an offer on this gun.  Please do not ask me to sell the gun below $160.  Please do not ask me to throw in more ammo.  If you want ammo, I have some, but 9mm is $22.50 a box firm because that's what I paid for it.  Please do not ask me to drive a half hour or hour to meet you some place that is convenient for you, unless it's someplace that I plan to be already.  

I do get up to Denver and even north of that periodically and so it might be possible to meet along the I25 corridor.  

Also, please do not offer trades for other guns as I don't need more guns.  I am not open to other trades.

Un-issued, Previously Un-Fired...","Tulsa/Catoosa, Tulsa, Oklahoma",$ 500,"Listed On: Thursday, May 16, 2013",Rifles,no type,7.62x54R                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"FOR SALE. Pick up in TULSA AREA: 

This purdy lady is a Mosin-Nagant M44 carbine. There are plenty out there that have been modernly accessorized, and seem to be popping up a lot lately.

But the neat thing about this one is that she came into my life UN-issued and UN-fired and Refurbished (has the refurbished symbol stamped on receiver from factory). Still had cosmoline all over the perfectly blued, metal and not a spot of rust anywhere, which was a big turn on. And if you are a Mosin fan, you can imagine how exciting that is to see. And the rifling is deep, sharp, and was so shiny it looked chrome-lined. Had never seen a Nagant like it. I have fired less than thirty rounds through this cannon, and they were all Winchester 'White Box' brass-cased clean stuff. I doubt anyone will want to pay what I paid for her off the bat (you don't wanna know) and the time and accessories that have been slapped on her, after all it is a Mosin. 

So I'm asking $500, which includes: 

- Brand New ATI Synthetic Monte Carlo Stock
- Stainless Finished Receiver, Magazine & Chrome Trigger
- Barrel and Front Aperture a Nice, Shiny Black.
- Custom Trigger Job Including the Addition of an Aftermarket Trigger Spring (HAIR trigger. I promise.); also eliminated most of the trigger wobble
- Burris Long Eye Relief Optic w/ Butler Creek caps;
- UTG Aftermarket Muzzle Break
- UTG Folding Bi pod
- Fluffed n' Buffed Bolt Assembly
- Browning X-Whatever sling (Can't think of the model - great sling)  

And to get ya started:

2 - Winchester White Boxes (40 rounds)
1 - Tula in a plastic ammo organizer (20 rounds)
1 - Mil-Surp Silver Tipped Armor Piercing (20 rounds)
4 - Brand-New Stripper Clips

I have lots of ammunition and 'specialty' rounds for it too (AP, AP Incendiary, etc.) some if which I would be willing to toss in if someone purchased without bottom-dollaring me lol. I plan on selling all the ammunition once rifle is gone, so please let me know if interested and I can give specs on what a I have!

Obviously will come with wrenches for scope, all the original parts (bayonet and cleaning rod, etc.) as well should you want to replace the furniture or whatnot. 

CASH ONLY for now, sorry guys. NO trades. Wish I could, but need the cash. This beauty is now a great tuned up high powered hunting or sporting rifle. I love it to death, but have to let it go. 

Note: The Burris scout scope is the most recent addition, and have not zeroed it in yet. Also have brand new ditto scout mount since I was sent two of them for some reason. The picture is crystal clear, great optic (well hell it's Burris), so that will be something fun for you to do! Hooray!"

""Dependable & Nearly Indestructible; Store Fully Loaded Without Loss Of Reliability

Due to demand far outpacing supply, we are unable to accept new orders for PMAG’s at this time. We are in daily contact with the manufacturer and will resume taking orders on PMAG’s as supply catches up. Please note that current backorders will not be cancelled.

Exceptionally rugged, combat- and competition-ready magazine functions flawlessly, even when left fully loaded for extended periods. Corrosion-proof, self-lubricating one-piece body of fiber-reinforced, molded polymer has no spot welds or joints to impair the follower, and the constant internal curve ensures smooth, unobstructed movement of the round stack. Anti-tilt follower stabilizes the stack to help prevent nose-diving and bolt-over-head failures. Heat-treated, stainless steel spring is stress-relieved for optimal performance. Withstands the heat from prolonged full-auto fire and is not harmed by most bore cleaners and solvents. Exterior ribbing provides added gripping surface; magazine catch notch, rather than a traditional hole, keeps dirt and debris out. Easy-to-grasp ledge on floorplate aids in extracting magazine from pouches; floorplate removes easily for cleaning. Curved-body 30-Round model is also available in MagLevel configuration with windows on both sides of the magazine and a bright, orange indicator to display ammo level."""

FACTORY NEW IN BOX!!!!!! 








Description: Up for auction is a factory new in box Colt LE6940 rifle. Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength. Specifications: Action: Semi-Automatic Caliber: 223 Remington/5.56 NATO Bbl Length: 16.1"" Capacity: 30+1 Trigger: Direct Safety: Lever OAL: 35.25"" Weight: 6.6 lbs Stock: 4-Position Collapsible Finish: Black."

The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

This rifle was purchased by me brand new in October of 2012. The rifle has about 200-250 rounds through it since that time (brass only).

During my time with this rifle I have not experienced a single FTF or FTE. I have always kept the rifle clean and also cleaned it right after firing. Notice that my price is not inflated, stop getting ripped off by people trying to sell you a C15 for more then $1000. This rifle MSRP's around 700-900.

Included in the 850 is of course the rifle, 4 30 round magazines and the sight. This is not the less the perfect bushnell trophy that is typically sold with the C15, it's a much better red dot. With it I can easily hold decent groupings at 100 yards. Costs around $180. Therefore with that and the magazines I think 850 is a fair price.

This is a must have for any Winchester collection. The Serial Number is G1535xxx which makes it an early 1982 model. Look them up online and you will see that out of the 3 years of the transition from Olin to Winchester Repeating Arms, this is the only year that was different from previous (1981 back) and future (1983 forward) gun features.

The firearm is in good condition. It does have some holster wear and the stainless does have a little bit of staining on the inside of the frame and slide. Its had a good bit of use over the years, at least 500-600 rounds in my possesion. 150 rounds from the first owner. I'm the second owner. I did just recently replace the recoil spring. The barrel and guide rod are both in good condition. The firearm has definitely been loved (fired)and carried, and it shows. It is in perfect working order though.

It comes with the factroy grips, and one 14 round factory Magazine, and an uncle mikes IWB holster. I do not have original paper work, or original case. As a matter of fact Im ""borrowing"" the case of one of my other weapons to store it, so keep in mind I have no case at all for this weapon plastic or otherwise. I do love the weapon and I'm not in a huge rush to sell it, and really the only reason I'm willing to part with it, is because the grip size is a little big for my hands and I have a tough time reaching the slide release, I have weapons now that are more user friendly for my reach so also keep in mind it does help to have bigger hands to grip this weapon. Please no rediculous ""100.00 offers"" or trying to trade your ""Problamatic weapon"" just because this gun has had some use. Its a great functioning gun that needs a good home other than some finish blemeshes it runs like a champ. 

Some of its features are: 

Deckocker/Saftey
Magazine Saftey
Stainless steel slide and frame
Stainless stell Magazine/14 rounds

If you'd like more pics, just let me know. Only place I'am willing to meet is Cabelas in Lacey Wa. Unless you live closer, I will meet no where else.
Thanks for looking. 

EDIT 05/10/2013: Was checking to make sure the gun fucnctioned properly when I noticed the slide release isnt working correctly. Reducing the Price and still open to firearms trades. The gun still fires and everything does work, its just when the slide locks open after emptying the mag or when the slide is opened and locked manually you HAVE to use the slide release, you just can't pull on the slide and release it. you can still rack the slide to chamber a round if the slides closed, you just HAVE to use the slide release to chamber a round if its locked open. The slide release lever is a 40.00 part on midwayusa.com"

White chalk has been added to the stamps to make them more visible for pictures, it can be easily removed. I also stripped the shellac off because it was flaking real bad, sweated out the cosmoline and applied boiled linseed oil. As you can see by the picture there is a small repair done to the fore grip by the Russians. The front band is an original non RC that I had lying around and the rear band appears to be drilled for a Kriesgmodell. This has no affect on its function. The bore is good with light pitting near the muzzle. It shoots tight groups with no ""flyers"". The floor plate and trigger guard are milled. Also included is a repro sling. It still has all the Weimer eagles intact. This rifle is too early for ""dirty bird"" eagles and swastikas if you are new to K98's and do not know. The supply of these Russian Capture K98's is hit or miss these days with prices starting at $399 for a peened common code example. Price is firm and NO out of state sales."

 Nice accurate unit.

 This rangefinder ranges to 1500 yds. on hard objects and the ARC works out to 900yds. This are the two reasons I bought this unit. The bullet drop I will not use for two reasons. One two find a bullet that matches the ones available and that is accurate is hard to do. Second, the bullet drop is for rifles sighted in at 100yds. Most long range shooters who need a long range rangefinder sight their rifles in at 300 to 400 yds. It would be better if the rangefinder gave the compensated range figuring for up or down angle than the bullet drop. Most long range scopes have the bullet drop and all you need is the compensated range to figure your shot.

 Awesome brand and product. You get what you pay for.

 I bought this range finder because I have several Bushnell products and all are of top quality. This model had the range and options perfect for my needs and at a great price. I looked at several different brands and models before deciding on this one and I am very pleased with my decision.

 5 STAR!!!! Bushnell Elite 1500 Range Finder

 This is perhaps the finest rangefinder Bushnell has on the market right now. I believe I got a fantastic product for a great cost. I can't say enough good things about this product. For anyone who is familiar with the function of a rangefinder, this particular model has a distance of 1500 yards w/ arc. For someone, such as my husband, who has a vast area of land to survey, this was a great find. Bushnell is a name we have come to trust, we have not been disappointed yet. Thank you.

 Good for the money

 This unit has a great price tag, and really it meets the expectations of its price tag. For the serious shooter or hunter or anyone who needs to know distances using a rangefinder for longer range purposes, look elsewhere. Tree lines and very large objects like white houses this unit worked pretty well, though I never ranged more than about 1100 yds on a house, using a tripod and new batteries. I tried ranging cows that were about 500 yards away to no avail; though I was able to range objects near them. All my tests were using a tripod and even trying several tries to get it to range, but it was fairly unsuccessful for long range distance measuring. I only got this unit because the price was right and the unit I sort of want is unavailable. On the right day this unit may be a bit better, just lately the only days I could get out to test this unit it has been sunny. I am a long range hunter/shooter, so I have to expect to spend much more money, but I was hoping I could get by with this unit. This is a good rangefinder in its price range I've tried a couple others out and I like this one for long range more than others, though others are better for different purposes. I think the specifications are fairly correct, though the reflective target is a bit of a gray area, so just compare which specs you need and pick a rangefinder.

 It is a very good product for the price Yes, I would recommend this product to a friend.

 I have been looking for a 1000 yd + range finder. I bought mine on e-bay for 1/2 new price. It works great & has helped me with my ballistics calculations. this is a great affordable option. The only thing it does not have is the elevation compensation option the more expensive models have. 

 I bought this unit in 2012, but NEVER used it (too old for hunting now!) Price new is $399.00;check out the following link:

The Revolutionary War Veteran's Association (RWVA) will be conducting a Project Appleseed rifle marksmanship event on Sat. & Sun. June 22-23, 2013 at the Nampa Rod & Gun Club Outdoor Range, 7990 Bennet Road, Nampa, Idaho. The event will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturday and 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.

Project Appleseed events are a lot of fun for the entire family! They offer safe, enjoyable, low-cost, hands-on activities that require no special rifles or equipment. Youth learn safe firearm handling and the fundamentals of rifle marksmanship, while adults improve and refine their marksmanship skills. The event ends in what seems to be only minutes, but the memories made last for a lifetime.

Participants will learn how to shoot rifles from practical field positions such as the prone, sitting, and standing positions. You will learn the techniques that will improve your accuracy so you can place 10 rounds in a postage stamp sized target posted at 25 yards without using extra support such as a bench or sandbags. Our volunteer instructors will also tell the stories of how civilian marksmanship played a pivotal role in the founding of our nation... the stories that just aren't told in school anymore, if they ever were.

Men attend both days for $80, women for $40, and youth under 18 are $20 (first youth free w/paying adult). Active military, law enforcement officers, and elected officials with ID can register FREE. There is an additional range fee of $5 per person per day for all attendees.

This is a better alternative to the 22 conversion bolt you can put into your 556 upper.  For only a little more this will jam much less often, be much more accurate and won't get your 556 upper filthy and reduce the barrel life.

This sells for around $500 new and I am including a $60 detachable carry handle.  Without the handle you would need to purchase a rear sight.

This is the older style 82 with a 4'' barrel.  The gun was issued to Brazilian police forces.  

The gun shows moderate wear including scratches, scuffs, blueing wear, and minor pitting.  

The original wood grips were pretty rough so I replaced them with a nice set of Hogue grips.  

This would be an excellent candidate for a Duracoat or re-blue job, or leave it alone if you're like my wife and looks aren't that important to you...  

$250 FIRM.
