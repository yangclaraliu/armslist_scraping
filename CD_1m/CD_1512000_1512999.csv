One of the finest AR-15 / M16 mags on the market today. Extremely reliable and durable and at a great price. By collecting input from military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters, TAPCO has designed a magazine that can be depended on from a trip to the firing range to deployment overseas. Molded of reinforced composite with aggressive horizontal ridges that provide increased gripping surface for insertion and extraction of the magazine in wet or muddy conditions. This also helps to eliminate feed lip separation. The anti tilt follower has been designed to allow more dirt and grime to pass than any other magazine on the market. This allows the magazine to keep feeding ammo, despite loose dirt or sand that may have entered the magazine. The spring is made using a 1770 Stainless steel wire, featuring a unique shape for smoother, quieter loading through all 30 rounds. It also reduces overall stress on the magazine body, preventing spine cracks. 30 Round capacity. Fits All AR15, M4, and M16 Variants. Made in the U.S.A. with a lifetime warranty from TAPCO."

This rifle is less than a year old. I originally custom built this rifle to carry as my patrol rifle for work. The rifle has had 150 rounds shot through it. I added a mid length gas system to the rifle along with a 1.5 BattleComp compensator so when you fire this rifle the recoil is like shooting a .22.
I have spent $3000 in building this rifle. I am asking $2600 for it. The price is negotiable to those who are truely interested in buying the gun. If you do research on this rifle and the manufacurer you will see that these rifles are top notch and start around $1400 for a base model if you can even get one.
Please Do Not low ball me on the price or an offered price. If you are interested in buying the rifle, I will ship it to your FFL. You pay the transfer fee. again the price is negotiable. CASH ONLY, NO TRADES. You can contact me via email at REDACTED or through my cell phone at REDACTED. Thank You for looking."

The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol delivers concealed carry handling
with large frame firepower. The Px4 series is built around a modular
concept so these pistols can be adapted to different needs. The Px4 Storm
Sub-Compact uses a locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more
compact and lighter weight system. The stainless steel barrel requires less
maintenance and is corrosion resistant. An ambidextrous manual safety
lever, reversible magazine release button and interchangeable back straps
make shooting the Px4 Sub-Compact easy for all shooters. The light frame
employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced polymer with a milstd-1913
picatinny rail for an array of aftermarket accessories.  The Bruniton
non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion
and wear.

Check out our website (www.scorchedbrass.com) for video reviews on this rifle.  This rifle is as good as it comes.  Don’t settle for a Bushmaster, CMMG, or any other sub par manufacturer.  These rifles are all piston driven and are as reliable and accurate as you could ever want one to be.  Here is a unbiased review from Guns&Ammo regarding the LWRC M6 platform.
http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/lwrci-m6a2-review/
If you have any questions please email me at REDACTED – below are the specs and other information on the rifle.
This M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in 16.1 inch barrel length and in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. The16.1 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire (MOA or better!) out to 600 meters. 

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.
The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

Hard to find!!,"Parker, Denver, Colorado","$ 2,195","Listed On: Wednesday, April 24, 2013",Rifles,Colt                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a brand new, in box Colt LE 6940 AR-15 with the new integrated monolithic rail platform.   

The Colt LE6940 Monolithic Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine was introduced in 2009, and is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. The top rail is continuous from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. Free floating barrel, and this is known to have sub-MOA accuracy.   I also have an LM8MRP for sale, I couldn't decide which one to keep so we'll see which one sells first and I'll keep the other.  

$2195

This rifle includes a 20rd magazine and a sling (which came in the box).  

Face to face in the Denver area or I'll ship to your FFL.   Must be legally able to purchase, have an ID, etc. etc.   

This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached.

The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices.


Although the LE6940 will most likely be equipped with a red-dot or optical sight, the gun is fitted with front and rear Back-Up Iron Sights (BUIS). In front is a protected post sight integral with the gas block and bayonet lug. It is designed to work with the supplied MaTech rear sight, which has a flip-up aperture adjustable for windage and elevation. Elevation adjustments are made by way of a drum calibrated for 5.56 ammunition at ranges of 200 to 600 meters. The rear sight is low enough not to interfere with most scopes, but may also be removed."

The rifle is completely new in the box. It is incredibly light weight at under 5 pounds stock and empty. It has a lightweight aluminum full float hand guard which improves accuracy by allowing the barrel to flex unimpeded. It has a match grade trigger system, and railed upper receiver with a rail block atop the hand guard. It is optics ready and includes a 30 round Magpul PMag along with the original box, paperwork, and Colt gun lock.

I have added the Mako FAB Defense GL-shock adjustable stock (if you're not familiar with the stock, you've really got to take a look at videos of folks shooting with it) which all but eliminates muzzle rise with an additional built in buffer spring. I have one of these on my .308 and it shoots like a .223. It has an adjustable cheek riser for the perfect fit of any shooter. The stock also contains a water-tight storage compartment for batteries, etc. I have also added the Mako magazine well grip to give additional control in close quarters maneuvering.

The package is completed with the NCStar Mark III 3-9x Red/Green illuminated reticle quick detach scope. The sight picture is easily obtained on this scope, and you can rapidly transition to the red dot reflex sight which is mounted atop the eyepiece for shots under 100 meters.

This is a package deal, altogether for $1800. Feel free to call/text me at REDACTED."

Description: Up for auction is a factory new in box FNH FNX-9 pistol. The FNX™-9 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-9 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-9’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

I just bought this, I cleaned and lubed it, but haven't fired it. I've decided to go back to a Commander length 1911. I've recently tried a number of other pistols and have realized that I should just carry what I've carried for years and be done with it.

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 20"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports rifle contour and length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of HBar contour (.750 under the front sight base) The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights"

Limited Edition (original run) Dan Wesson RZ-10 Razorback 10mm pistol, serial number RZ-0063 (see pics). 1911 style, full size (5"" barrel), single action. This is a pre-CZ gun. Includes FIVE numbered 8 round magazines, Blade-Tech IWB holster, and two Blade-Tech magazine holsters.

I'm the original owner and it's easily the best 10mm I've ever shot (I've owned a Delta Elite and Glock 10mm as well). It features double squared cocking serrations, match grade barrel and trigger, night sights, and matching laser engraving on both the gun and ALL magazines. I've taken very good care of the gun and it is in Fine condition (per NRA grading scale).
