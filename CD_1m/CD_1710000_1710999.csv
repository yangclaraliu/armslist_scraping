It could be a Model 69a I'll have to check the barrel out again and see if it says 69a or just 69. I don't know much about this gun, I just know that my grandpa had it for many years. from what I've looked up on the gun I found out it was made from 1935 - 1963, and that they only made 350,000 of them.  I did have the original clip for it, but a family member stole it, I'm in the process of trying to get it back, but I'm not sure I'll be able to retain it. The gun still has the original bluing. The barrel looks great on the outside, I'm not sure about the inside of the barrel. I'm planning on taking it out this week to try and shoot it. This gun is pretty cool, it's a bolt action, but does take a clip. The stock is in pretty good condition, no dents, or any noticable scratches. It has normal wear and tear for a gun this old. I don't have any pictures posted just yet, I will get some photos on here in the next day or 2. It has the sites that come on the barrel, but no scope. It has a metal piece on the side of the gun that must be used to hold something, not sure what it is for, I don't know a whole lot about guns, I will try and figure out what it is for, and you can see what it is when I get the photo's posted.   

If your interested or have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I can't send photos through texts my phone doesn't send pics. my number is REDACTED. I'm asking $220 obo."

I have four available currently. All are built right here in Fort Collins exclusively from American materials.  IWB clips are made from spring steel, OWB loops are shaped from .125 Kydex for extra durability. All screws are steel for far superior durability over aluminum screws. Each model provides tight retention through the definition of the gun in the holster, and makes a distinctively audible snap when drawn and re-holstered at normal speeds. These models are compatible with Glock models 17, 19, 22, 23, 26, and 27. 

Type A: compact IWB/OWB convertible design for everyday concealed/open carry use. Low profile emphasizes comfort and concealment, elevated outside edge greatly assists re-holstering, especially when carrying IWB. Ejection port and extractor areas are relieved out to reduce wear on the firearms finish. Includes IWB clips, OWB loops and 4 each - Male Phillips screws, Female slotted screws, and spacers. One black, no shirt guard, $45 SOLD. Two gray with medium shirt guard, $50

Type B: pictured bottom left. IWB only, designed specifically for deep concealment. Extremely compact design is the size of an average hand, yet is designed to carry a full-sized gun. Fully ambidextrous, all hardware can be mounted on either side, and the shirt guard protects both sides of the weapon. Ejection port and extractor areas relieved out to reduce wear on the firearm. Includes IWB clips and 2 each - Male Phillips screws, Female slotted screws, and spacers. $45  

Light mounted holster pictured center is my EDC and not for sale. Light Mounted Type-C holsters will be available for sale soon in a more compact design than pictured.  

All are backed with a lifetime ""No-Bullshit"" warranty. I will not sell anything I would not carry with myself, carry with confidence and comfort with a Lyon Defensive Concealment holster. Unique compact designs specifically for every day carry use for half the price of online manufacturers without several month waits and far better than anything locally available.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® (Aka Poor man’s P226 ) is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

This pistol looks good as new.  It comes with the red dot (pictured but not currently installed on the gun) .   I ordered custom 911 style rubber grips that I just put on top of the original grips and then put the Hogue slip on grip over the top and it holds it perfectly.  So the original grips are still on the gun and no holes have been drilled.  If you have medium to large hands you will want these grips trust me.   I paid $40 for the grips and also bought the Houge slip on grip ($12) recently.   I also bought 2 extra magazines ($45)  Only reason I am selling is because I need the money.  

It has a compensator on that can be easily taken off with a hex tool.
Also in the picture you can see it comes with a Weaver scope mount.

Ruger case in picture also comes with the gun.    

Price is firm.  No trades as the only reason I am selling is I need the cash.  Meet in Issaquah.  I will need to see your Washington ID"

Upcoming bills are forcing me to sell a few of my Mosins, these are rifles I was planning to keep and not something you will see too often! 

The first is a 1932 Izhevsk Hex Reciever Mosin.  This one has extensive ""Blood Pitting"" in the receiver area and is counter-bored with a dark bore.  Although I doubt the authenticity of so-called ""blood pitting"" the presence of damage prior to refurbishment indicates the rifle likely saw action making it an interesting piece!  Other than the pitting the stock is in great condition and this would make a great shooter! (see first two pictures) $140 (probably the cheapest hex Mosin you will see and a great rifle with actual history!)

Second is a VERY rare 91/30, 1943 Izhevsk MO double date marked AND an ex sniper!  This one would fill several holes in your collection and will make a solid investment.  Check the infamous Mosin rarity chart, MO double date is ranked 6/10 and ex-sniper is ranked 5/10, the combination of these features is VERY unusual (ex-snipers have filled holes from sniper scope mounts).  As any Izhevsk sniper should, this one has the proper lined-out scope serial number on the side of the action.  The stock has some gouges and isn't the best I have ever seen but to be honest for a rifle this rare the stock is almost an afterthought!  (see the last picture for receiver shot, photo was taken when I pulled the action) $210 (a steal for this rifle, only selling because I shouldn't have spent the money, going to school doesn't pay very well...)

I have four available currently. All are built right here in Fort Collins exclusively from American materials.  IWB clips are made from spring steel, OWB loops are shaped from .125 Kydex for extra durability. All screws are steel for far superior durability over aluminum screws. Each model provides tight retention through the definition of the gun in the holster, and makes a distinctively audible snap when drawn and re-holstered. These models are compatible with Glock models 17, 19, 22, 23, 26, and 27. 

Type A: compact IWB/OWB convertible design for everyday concealed/open carry use. Low profile emphasizes comfort and concealment, elevated outside edge greatly assists re-holstering, especially when carrying IWB. Ejection port and extractor areas are relieved out to reduce wear on the firearms finish. Includes IWB clips, OWB loops and 4 each - Male Phillips screws, Female slotted screws, and spacers. One black, no shirt guard, $45 SOLD. Two gray with medium shirt guard, $50

Type B: pictured bottom left. IWB only, designed specifically for deep concealment. Extremely compact design is the size of an average hand, yet is designed to carry a full-sized gun. Fully ambidextrous, all hardware can be mounted on either side, and the shirt guard protects both sides of the weapon. Ejection port and extractor areas relieved out to reduce wear on the firearm. Includes IWB clips and 2 each - Male Phillips screws, Female slotted screws, and spacers. $45  

Light mounted holster pictured center is my EDC and not for sale. Light Mounted Type-C holsters will be available for sale soon in a more compact design than pictured.  

All are backed with a lifetime ""No-Bullshit"" warranty. I will not sell anything I would not carry with myself, carry with confidence and comfort with a Lyon Defensive Concealment holster. Unique compact designs specifically for every day carry use for half the price of online manufacturers without several month waits and far better than anything locally available.

The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm, which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the lightweight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v7-300, new for 2013, is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.


Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space 
Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved

Well this seems like a good place to share an opinion based on the sensible writings. I find it amusing and misguided to blame anyone for selling any ammo or write derogatoy comments about the prices when this is a perfectly fair thing to do. Let me share my story to explain. I starting with a 22 rifle when i was 14 and just shot targets for fun. Over the next 50 years i purchased another 22 pistol, a 38 spl and a 12 ga shotgun. Figured this was all i needed. About two years ago i decided to look into additional firearm purchases. I have worked hard and invested wisely so i had the cash to start a new hobby. I do everything legally and educated myself on gun safety, gun laws, and firearm and ammo spec's. Then i started to purchase firearms. I now shoot regularly at a shooting range. Last october i purchased a S&W M&P 15/22 and a Bersa 9mm from Gander Moutain. When i was purchasing the guns i asked for some 22lr and 9mm ammo. They offered me a bulk pack of 9mm for $243.00 and one brick of 22lr. They did not have anymore to sell. I went through the 22lr fairly quickly and decided to get some more. trips to Walmart, kmart, Gander Mountain and five local sporting goods stores turned up nothing. When i inquired about stock i was told that no one had an ideal when they would get any. On rare occasion i found one box per trip. So i started to look for other options, the internet. Today i have 20 firearms and know every available way to find ammo. I can tell you where to find it, what is the current best price, what shipping and handling will be, and even how and when seller will list product. I can predict how fast listed ammo will sell out and tricks sellers use to get the most out of each sale. I have not listed or sold any of the ammo i purchased on the intermet but i have sold to dealers at the local gun shows. I have purchased 22lr for $.05 to $.12 per round since October. I sold 11,000 22lr at the gun show for $1000.00, hardly gouging on my part. 15 minutes later the gun dealer was selling it all for $.20 per round. Avid shooter have to understand that there are a lot of new gun owners that need ammo that is in short supply. I purchased some of my ammo on gunbroker or armslist and was happy to pay the price to have the ammo. I find it amusing when i see the post that ""got all the ammo at my local walmart today"" and "" i hope no one buys this overprice ammo"". I tried Walmart at 6:30am without success. I also run a business that does not allow me to stand in line at Dicks or Gander Mountain. I work 11 hours per day unlike some of the individual who post such lame comments. If they wanted to help they could offer advise on how to find ammo instead of the usual response like ""that's my secret"" or ""that's for me to know"". Real helpful. Well the truth is that the ammo is only overpriced to the veteran gun owners. All the new gun owners figure that they will pay the going rate to have the product. Ammo is like gas or food. Sould i make hateful comments if you pay more for gas or food than i do? The sellers offer a service and a product that is needed. If not it would never sell. So i have no problem with anyone buying and reselling to make a profit. That is a fundamental right in our country. Not something we pick or chose based on what my affect us individually. I will gladly offer every secret, trick or source to anyone that needs to buy ammo. Let's see what kind of response i get to this post. I now have every firearm i want and enough ammo to shoot comfortably for 12 months. Please, let's have a fair and logical discussion on this topic. Thanks for reading the rant of an old guy. OLD GUYS RULE."

Too many Deer guns in the safe, looking to thin the heard.  Some wear marks on the slide and a couple subtle marks on the receiver.  NO RUST OR PITTING, bore is in great shape with sharp lands n grooves.  If this is up, the rifle is still for sale!

Gun is very accurate, has put <1/2"" groups at 50 yards consistently.  Rifle sites have been removed, but are included.  Currently fitted with a Bushnell banner dusk til dawn 3-9X40mm scope with Weaver rings and mount.  Willing to separate if needed. 

All original except the slip on butt pad.  Someone had removed the original Remy steel butt plate and replaced it with a Pachy grind to fit.  It looked like heck, so I took it off and used a Pachy decelerator slip on.  For a 3006 she is soft shooter.  This is a 150th anniversary edition manufactured in 1966, back when Remy was still making solid life long guns.  Deep dark original bluing in excellent condition.  Hunting rounds available with the right deal.

Not desperate to sell, but if I can send her to a good home I'd be happy.   Sits in the safe most years as I prefer my lever action to stalk where we hunt.

Please respond via email, willing to travel within reason.  FTF sale only.  Valid MI ID etc etc.
