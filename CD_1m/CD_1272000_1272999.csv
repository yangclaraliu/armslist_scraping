I have a complete upper for sale. It is made by Bravo Company. It is new in the box. BCM Standard 16"" Mid Length Upper Receiver Group. This can come with a new BCM Bolt Carrier group and VLTOR BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle if you wish. I also have a complete Palmetto state Armory lower parts kit. The trigger group is made by Windham Weaponry so this would include everything you need to build a rifle from a stripped lower reciever. If you don't want the plastic handguards I would gladly sell it without them for $20 off the price. The prices are as follows
Stripped Upper without handguards $575
Stripped Upper With handguards $595
Complete upper with BCG and VLTOR Charging Handle $895
Complete upper with BCG and VLTOR Charging Handle and Complete Palmetto State Lower Parts kit $1060
I can also take $20 off the price if you would like a standard charging handle instead of the gunfighter one.
I am only interested in trades for a 10/22 takedown model.
You can contact me at (920)for five six -9033 or email me. I usually travel down to Fond du Lac on Sundays, so I could meet you there."

Less than 100 rounds fired.  Safe queen. Bought it for my wife and she loves it!  But she loves paid bills more!  Works great and has had no issues.  

Comes with case, all documentation and warranty card that has not even been filled out yet.  Also comes with two magazines.

The stainless model is one of the more expensive ones.  Stainless is better for carry concealed because it does not show wear like a basic black one would.  

This same gun went new for $450 at Paradise Arms on the south side of town.  We also spent the extra $40 on an additional magazine.  Here's your chance to get a great deal!  They're very hard to find and I believe this is the only PK380 listing in Colorado.  We had every intention of keeping it since it's such a nice-looking and nice-shooting gun, but bills are piling and Dave Ramsey is laying the guilt trip on me.

Price for the PK380 with mags, case and documentation is $350.

I am also selling 500 rounds of reloaded ammo (pictured) for $150.  I bought the rounds from Ammo Kan (based in Loveland) at a gun show a few months ago for $190.  Save yourself $40 off what I paid!

I am not negotiable on the prices.  I am losing my shirt on this deal already so please don't ask for a lower price because I am not currently wiling to go any lower.

Local sales only, cash only, Valid CO I.D. required and the bill of sale needs to be signed.

This is the best and most accurate barrel Spikes offers. The barrel is individually High Pressure Tested as well as Magnetic Particle Inspected, both before and after being finished. No other AR company goes to this extreme. Most are ""batch"" tested and if one passes, they all pass. The bolt is also individually HPT and MPI. The barrel and bolt are marked as such. The rifle features a free floated 12"" SAR rail system that is covered with Ergo rail covers. The front and rear sights are MagPul flip up BUIS Gen2 sights. The grip is a ""rubberized"" MagPul grip and the stock is also MagPul. Battle trigger was also installed. This a a top notch set up and is sure to give exceptional accuracy as well as a long service life. Spikes does offer an unconditional lifetime warranty and their customer service is the best out there, bar none. The barrel and bolt/bcg are full auto rated. This is not a run of the mill $1000 rifle that everyone and their brother is selling for $2000 plus. This is high quality and will meet the expectations of the most discerning shooter.I am asking $2250 for this beauty, but will consider trades as well. I am mostly interested in a high quality 12ga semi auto such as Browning Maxus or Benelli Vinci/SBE/SBE2 or a 12ga over/under. I also enjoy semi auto quality pistols in 9mm and 45's, such as 1911's and Glocks/XDM's/Sigs. I would also consider a S&W 357 revolver. Trades will be of even value or combined value or cash will have to be added on your part. No JUNK firearms will be considered. Please let me know if you have any questions or trade offers. I also have 200 rounds of brass ammo and one MagPul PMag that will go with this. Rifle will come in the Spikes hard  rifle case it was delivered in.

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite® coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

Barrel is pinned and cylinders recessed (old style craftsmanship before Smith started curring corners).  

It is a safe queen that I shoot maybe 2 or 3 times a year. Never been holstered, absolute minimum signs of wear. I consider it as accurate as my Model 27 in 6""  or my Dan Wesson 357.  I owned both before liquidating my revolver collection.  I honestly enjoyed shooting the Model 19 more. 

I only fire 38 special or 38 special +P in this weapon, although it will handle commercial magnum rounds without problem.  Timing and lock-up are excellent.

This is my favorite weapon to shoot! It's a blast to unload several 25 round clips (and it'll cost you very little to do so :D) Highly customizeable. I own several of these guns in different configurations!!
The gun fires very well. It comes with an almost new synthetic stock that I swapped from one of my other Rugers. Part of the front site is damaged but it works fine (this shouldn't matter if you're going to put a scope on there anyways WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING!!). The barrel also has some scratches (see pics).
It comes with a smoke-colored Eagle 30-round magazine. I also have an extra 25-round Butler Creek magazine I would sell for $40. I've nevery had a problem with Butler Creek magazines. I highly recommend getting high-capacity mags for this gun. These are near impossible to find in stores and you'll be glad that you got some. Also I don't think you'll find them for cheaper than this.

I hate to do it but due to my crazy overspending, I'm willing to let go of my fully built, UNFIRED AR10, What it comes with;

The gun including all the old parts I took off of it.
Magpul furniture in FDE
Magpul RSA Rail Sling Attachment
Magpul AFG
Magpul Ambidextrous Sling Attachment Point
EOTech 512
EOTech 3xmagnifier
XLarge charging handle pad
One X-25 (disassembled repair kit)
Two 20rd Pmags (disassembled repair kits)
And the original case it came in.
I've never taken it to the range to zero in the optics yet. Almost did but got side tracked with a deal on a 93R17, so I turned around and skipped it. All mods were done by me. This rifle is in mint condition."

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, a Mil-Spec backup iron sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

The battery compartment was not completely sealed during a recent competition, and unfortunately we experienced about 5 periods of HEAVY rain. When the day was over I dried everything but never thought to open the battery compartment until the sight started flickering the next time I tried to use it. Upon opening, I found very small beads of water in the compartment, but no rust or signs of corrosion. I DID NOT disassemble the unit to look for other non-obvious signs of damage.

The reticle now flickers/flashes and eventually goes out completely. Sometimes I can get it to come back on after a few minutes and sometimes it takes longer. Called EOTech and made the mistake of vaguely mentioning that I wasn't sure if the battery compartment was screwed on tight enough during the rain. Therefore, they will not cover the repair under warranty for this serial number. I was quoted $200-$300. I'd rather use that money towards an ACOG or HHS-1 EOTech combo.

It was purchased for $500 brand new on 12/8/12 from Midway. I know nothing about electronics so I'm not sure what/if anything could be done to repair the unit. Exterior is in like new condition. This is an authentic EOTech sight, not one of the EBay/Chinese imitations.
