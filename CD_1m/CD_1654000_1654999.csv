Just acquired a HK45c and realized that as badly as I've been wanting it for months now, it is not right for me, at least not right now. Second owner, original owner claimed under 150 rounds fired. Has some slight wear on the front of the slide and on the slide locks. Nothing major at all, you can see for yourself in the pictures. Light LEM installed by HK. Includes Heine Straight Eight night sights (installed, original sights included as well), two 8 round mags (both with pinky extension), original DA/SA parts and HK case.

Looking for a DD V5 or V1 + cash on my end, SR-15 Mod 1 + cash on my end, Glock 19 Gen 4 + cash, Mossberg JM Pro 22"" + cash or a Mossberg 930 (SPX or breacher barrel models) + cash. I also have an interest in 9mm ammo, M&P 9 17-round mags and knives (Benchmade Rukus, 707 Sequel, Mini Ritter Grip M4).

$1100 is what I paid for the gun. Though used, I feel it is a fair price considering the sights, LEM conversion, low round count and availability of the model. I'm a reasonable individual, I feel I paid a reasonable price. I ask that if you make an offer, make it a fair one. Thanks."

The FNS pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism together with an optional manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety. 
Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate.
â¢ Fast and Accurate Shooting 
The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.
The FNS has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.
The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy.
â¢ Maximized Safety Systems
In addition to the manual safety, the FNS features Four Major Safeties:
1.Trigger Safety
2.Firing Pin Safety
3.Drop Safety
4.Out-of-Battery Safety
1. Trigger Safety 
The two-piece trigger prevents the weapon from firing without a presure on the trigger.
The rear of lower trigger piece catches on the frame if the mechanism is moved without pulling the trigger.
2. Firing Pin Safety 
The firing pin safety prevents the stricker from passing.
The firing pin safety is lifted out the way when the trigger is pulled.
3. Drop Safety
Part of the fire control housing prevents the sear from rotating down to release the striker unless the trigger is pulled. 
4. Out-of-Battery Safety
When the slide is not fully forwards the sear cannot release the striker even if the trigger is pulled.
â¢Enhanced Ergonomics
The FNS pistol comes standard with a large number of ergonomic features such as:
- Ultra nonslip checkered grips for better prehension
- Front serrations for easy press check
- Three interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt to the pistol to the shooter's hand size."

SAIGA-12 Self-loading smooth bored shotgun. 
The ""Saiga-12"" self-loading smooth bored shotgun is intended for professional and sport hunting of small-and medium-size game under any climatic conditions. 
The shotgun comes with 12-ga. smooth bored barrel and the chamber which accepts the ammo equipped with shot or slugs including ""Magnum"" cartridges with 70 and 76 mm cartridge case. 
The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well. For the purpose of diversifying operational capabilities the shotgun may be equipped with muzzle adapters of different chokes, including the muzzle adapter ""Paradox"". 
The shotgun may be produced with a quick-detachable butt and quick-detachable pistol grip to make storage and transportation more convenient and to enhance its maneuverability. The ""Saiga-12"" shotgun is manufactured in four versions: ""Saiga-12"", ""Saiga-12S"", ""Saiga-12K"", ""Saiga-12S ÐÐ¥Ð -01"". 
The ""Saiga-12S"" differs from the ""Saiga-12"" in the availability of a special folded butt and an operating handle. The folded butt makes carrying and storing the shotgun more comfortable. The ""Saiga-12K"" has a short barrel and a trigger/firing mechanism locking device to prevent the shotgun from firing when the butt is folded. Being an export version of the ""Saiga-12K"", the ""Saiga-12S ÐÐ¥Ð -01"" is not equipped with a trigger/firing mechanism locking device. Atop the receiver is a rail for the optical-sight mount accommodation. 
Complete set 
The complete set of the shotgun includes a set of tools and accessories for shotgun maintenance. 
On Customer's order the shotgun may be complete with an optical sight, a mount, a carrying case and a sling."

Description 
 DESIGNED & ENDORSED BY JOHN PLASTER
* Design Patent Pending
* Utility Patent Pending (A) The grip cap covers a storage area in the stock. For some snipers, the weight of the rifle is not a factor. And in some cases extra weight is wanted. If you need more weight to your stock you may pour the cored out area full of lead shot and screw the cap back on. It is also possible to put basic (pull through) cleaning kit in this area. We also noticed that eight 30-06 rounds will fit in the grip for emergency ammo. (B) This T rail allows many accessories to be placed on your rifle. We furnish a solid steel T bar with a detachable sling swivel stud installed. This is for the mounting of a Harris bipod. Many other accessories may be mounted on this bar. The T bar has a quick detach thumb screw. Some snipers will want two bipods mounted, short for prone and tall for sitting position. Additional T bars are available at a nominal cost. (C) This area is flat to stabilize the rifle when shooting from a rest. It is 1 1/2 wide and heavily serrated. The elevation fine adjusting knob (Q) can be removed, leaving a 3/8 threaded hole and the stock totally flat on bottom. (D) The forend is 2 3/8 wide to also assist in holding the rifle in a stable shooting position. (E) The length of pull can be adjusted from 13 1/4 out. The stock comes with one 1/2 adjusting spacer. Additional spacers are available at a nominal cost. They come in 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 inch in thickness. You will also get a set of longer screws when you order additional spacers. (note: we designed the stock, starting short, to fit the law enforcement snipers that must wear thick body armor.) (F) The stock is furnished with two cheek pieces. The standard height is for low scope rings. The tall cheek piece is for the big lens scopes that require the tall rings. (G) The position of the cheek piece is adjustable. There are three positions to accommodate all shooters. Also the cheek piece can be turned around for the left hand shooters. (H) The bedding block is the most important part of the stock. The receiver of the rifle only touches the stock/bedding block in four places, both sides of the V in front and in back. The pillar blocks allow a 55/65 inch lbs. torque on the receiver screws which is not possible with wood or most synthetic stocks. The CNC machined bedding block in molded inside the stock, not fiberglassed in after the stock is made. (I) The barrel channel is large enough to free float a 1 1/4 diameter bull barrel. (J) See feature (A) (K) The four slots are for the attaching of camo material. Most sniper experts agree that it adversely effects accuracy to attach camo to a barrel and there are no accommodations on most stocks for camo material. We havent done any testing but common sense would tell you that the slots would also help dissipate barrel heat. (L) These side mounted sling swivel studs go through a cored hole in the stock. In from rest shooting, the conventional bottom mounted sling studs get in the way and are usually removed. Major Plaster explained to us, during the design phase of this stock, that a sniper crawling on his belly carries his rifle on top of his upper arm and/or across his back while holding the sling in his hand. A side mounted sling is perfect for this application. (M) The stippling in the grip areas is unusually aggressive and rough to the touch. Major Plaster wanted it that way. Some shooters wear gloves and the rough texture is needed. If you want a smoother grip surface, sand the areas until the desired feel is found. The stock is about 1/4 thick in this area so dont worry about sanding the texture down. Also please notice that the front grip area is narrowed. It is this narrowed size to accommodate a one hand carry of the rifle. Major Plaster complained that most sniper/tactical stocks are very fat in this area and very difficult to carry one handed (suit case style) at the balance point. We fixed the problem. (N) This section of the forearm had a pronounced angle for two reasons. When the bipod is folded up it doesnt leave a 2 gap between it and the barrel. The bipod feet are very near the barrel and will catch fewer limbs and twigs when crawling prone. The second reason for the angle is for quick elevation adjustment of the barrel when the forend is resting on a support. When you push the stock forward the barrel goes up. When you pull the stock back the barrel elevation is lowered. This is so simple that no one seems to have thought of it before or didnt think it was important enough to include on a stock. (0) This flat surface, parallel to the barrel, is for the shooters that have/use sandbags. We are told that real snipers wait and watch much more than shoot. It is helpful if the rifle doesnt fall over every time you take your hands off the rifle. This area has heavy, 1/8, serrations as on the bottom of the butt area. (P) This off hand holding notch has been on machine guns since before World War II. The advantage of this feature in a sniper stock is that you can now hold your butt stock on your shoulder with your off hand. This allows the trigger hand to relax and concentrate only on the trigger pull. This off hand hold has been proven to be beneficial over the years. It is a feature that the expensive, labor intensive, hand laid fiberglass stock makers find very difficult to incorporate into their design. (Q) This is a fine adjusting screw for elevation. The bench rest shooters and prairie dog hunters will really like this feature. consider this, a one degree turn on this elevation screw will raise or lower the stock only .00017 of an inch. This is truly fine adjusting. This screw has about 2 of engagement and can be removed with ease when not needed. It is very easy to adjust with the thumb and index finger on either side of the stock. We have found, in the prototype stage of design, that the coarse adjustments can be made with the bipod legs and the spot-on adjustment done with the screw. (R) The rubber recoil pad has five height settings possible. The center setting lines up with the stock and there is two 1/4 positions up and two down. One of these five positions will surely meet your needs. (S) The bipod T bar, mentioned in (B) is made from solid steel and is about 5 long and it will fit the swivel type or solid bipod. There are many different uses and applications for this accessory other than a bipod. If you have a need for a special accessory, your local gunsmith wont have any trouble duplicating the dimensions. (T) We, Major John Plaster and Choate Machine & Tool, Inc., have a design patent pending as of 11/22/96 and a Utility patent pending as of 10/29/96. There are some points of interest not mentioned above that we will mention here. The ULTIMATE SNIPER stock has our usual LIFE TIME WARRANTY. The stock is made of DuPont Rynite SST-35. It is one of the most expensive polymers and the most suitable for gun stocks if weight is not a consideration. We mold the stock in dark O.D. green color. Rynite takes paint very well so you can paint your stock with almost any automotive spray can paint. The available duck boat camo paint works very well. The rubber recoil pad is a little on the stiff side because it is much more durable at this durometer than a cushy pad, with a 3/4 compression, can allow a shooter to get a scope eye piece hit in the eyebrow. Hell, you could loose your scopes ZERO on a deal like that. We predict that this stock will be a benchmark for sniper rifle stocks in the future. We have features that the hand laid fiberglass/kevlar stock makers cannot incorporate into their stocks. What we have done is eliminate most of the expensive hand labor and passed the savings on to you. We are keeping the price down so that most rifle owners can afford a stock"

Heckler & Koch USC

Derived from the HK UMP, the USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge. Matched with the simple and ultra-reliable blowback operating system, the HK USC is a radical departure from traditional firearms designs. Extensive use of the same durable, reinforced polymers used on HKs line of military and police arms ensures lightweight and durability. And the highest grade of weapons steel is used where it matters in the cold hammer forged target barrel and the solidly constructed bolt mechanism. User ergonomics are not sacrificed. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. The web of the pistol grip is open for a comfortable shooting handhold. Hard points located on the top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails easy, allowing almost any kind of sighting system or accessory to be mounted."

This firearm is factory sealed. It has never been opened, and is in pristine condition for a collector! The pictures (obviously) are not of this serial number, since the box has not been opened.

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) and TALO Distributors, Inc. have teamed up to create a limited edition USA Shooting Team RugerÂ® 10/22 Takedownâ¢ rifle. This special run is limited to just 5,000 rifles, with serial numbers GOLD-0001 through GOLD-5000. This is a historic opportunity to own a collectible RugerÂ® firearm.

The USA Shooting Team RugerÂ® 10/22 Takedownâ¢ is a stainless steel rifle with a distinct blue stock. Like all 10/22 Takedownâ¢ rifles, the barrel and forend are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction-fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but rarely needs re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

The USA Shooting Team RugerÂ® 10/22 Takedownâ¢ is also shipped in a special red ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features the USA Shooting Team logo. The bag features internal sleeves, which hold the two subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options."

This holster uses belt loops at the front and rear to pull your handgun tight against your body for better concealment. The angle this holster positions your handgun allows faster drawing with full combat grip, more comfortable wearing, and much safer use.
A regular Small of the Back (SOB) holster places your gun over the base of the spine. A fall or hard blow with your gun in that position could cause serious spinal cord injury. This holster is engineered for kidney carry to avoid that danger.
Made of waterproof foam for a comfortable carry and to protect gun from moisture. Lined on both sides with rugged CorduraÂ® nylon for durability and a smooth, fast draw. Webbing inside the holster protects your gunâs sights and keeps holster partially open for easier re-holstering. 
Great for use while driving. Comes with an adjustable thumb break to keep gun secure. Fits belts up to 1Â½â wide. Made in the USA."

For serious extended-range shotgunners, thereâs only one choice. The Model SP-10.â¢ Its 10-gauge bore produces significantly superior patterns and less felt recoil than any 12-gauge, 3 1/2"" gun out there. And like all Remington shotguns, it excels in the most extreme hunting conditions. It features a corrosion-resistant system, in which the cylinder â not the piston â moves, helping dampen recoil. Itâs the only shotgun worthy of the ultimate 3 1/2"" bird-leveling payload â the 10 gauge.

It's the RPM Intrac and was imported into Knox Tennessee in the mid 90s. Has the large thumbhole stock and is roughly finished. Missing the cleaning rod but has the cleaning kit in the stock of the gun. Upper foregrip is a darker color than the lower one and this is something I've seen on other Maadi Ak47s on-line.
Comes with a gun sock, shoulder strap and 2 heavy duty steel clips. (Not the cheap aftermarket clips) 
From what I've read it's one of the higher quality Ak47s because it was built with actual Russian tooling brought to Egypt. Gun shoots straight and hasn't  had any jamming issues whatsoever. This also a rare gun because few, I believe only 2500, were imported with the plywood thumbhole stock .
  Not as shiny and pretty as an AR, but that's not usually what you get an AK for.

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1654998,For Sale:  Light weight 300 AAC Blackout Upper (Stainless barrel),"Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 680,"Listed On: Sunday, June 2, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This upper has a Stainless Steel (Light Weight) 16 in. 300 Blackout barrel mounted on a new T marked Stag arms upper receiver! I only fired approximately 40 rounds down this barrel and it was astoundingly accurate and EXTREMELY fun to shoot. Only selling because I am going with a different caliber. If you have researched this caliber at all you will know that it is nearly the ballistic equivalent to the infamous 30-30 Winchester (which has been noted for taking more deer than any other caliber in the world).
***This caliber is the quintessential caliber if you are interested in suppressing a 30 caliber round as well***
The forend is also BRAND NEW and is a Hogue free float forend which yields exceptional accuracy!
****This caliber uses your STANDARD 5.56 (223) BOLT CARRIER group and STANDARD AR MAGAZINES!*****
JUST ATTACH THE UPPER AND CHANGE AMMO AND GO!
This upper does not come with the bolt carrier group or charging handle."
