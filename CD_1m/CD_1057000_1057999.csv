Its only been shot 6 times, It has a pistol grip and a heat shield...It has an 18 inch barrel and the tube is the same length...It has been carried and transported, so its not perfect, but it's been shot very little...Let me know if your interested, I probably have $50 dollars worth of .00 buck ammo I could include. 

I live 80 miles out (south east), but will travel to meet.
I gave $450= before everything went crazy....

Of all the rifles I've owned this is the toughest one to part with.  Fired this rifle about 60 times, accurate and flawless.  Come with one 10-round magazine and one 20-round magazine, and 40 rounds of Factory brass cased, boxer primed ammo (not match).  

AR-10 rifles are not for everyone, they are expensive to own, and expensive to shoot.  I used Gold Metal Match ammo and fired back to back groups that measured under an inch with one group that was a ragged hole at 100 yards bagged in from a bench.  

Barrel carefully and correctly broken in.  Ready to shoot.  

I used this rifle with Nightforce NXS scope (not included), so you are not stuck buying a decent optic right away, I put on a set of iron back-up sights.  They are OK, but nothing to brag to your buddy about.  

There is no paperwork, no box and no accessories with this sale - lost these items in my recent move. (Sorry)

About EXO Technology
EXO Technology is a patented, nickel-boron coating from UCT Coatings, Inc. EXO Technology provides a hard, durable surface (40% harder than Chrome) and permanent lubricity to metal substrates, allowing firearms to operate without oil or grease. EXO coated components last longer, clean up easier, and require minimal maintenance, while increasing reliability in harsh environments (sand/dust, hot/cold, suppressed fire, frangible ammunition).

Certain models also feature Ameriglo night sights. Program began shipping December 2010 and will continue in 2011. The number & models of Glocks has not been finalized.

This exact gun is a 12/10 model. It has been fired exactly 50 times and is in brand new condition. There are no signs of wear at all on this gun. It comes with all the factory paperwork including the EXO card, 2 hi-cap magazines, lock, cleaning rod & brush. 

Im asking $775 or best offer. I may be willing to do a partial trade towards a like new gen 3 Glock 19 only.

The barrel, receiver, and magazines quickly disassemble and store in the butt stock. It it designed to be water tight and float. 

I kept this in a backpack with a pistol for a go bag. 

It can accept a picatinny style scope, however, it cannot then collapse into the stock. 

-> Chambered in .22 Long Rifle
-> Includes 2 8 round magazines
-> Includes original box & manual
-> Kept Clean, I estimate I have fired 800 rounds through it. 
-> A very simple, dependable gun. Few fancy features, but, overall great. 

This rifle seems to favor round-nose ammo, I used CCI Mini-Mags with great luck. Some of the cheaper wal-mart special hollow points have failed to fire or jam, FTE. 

Overall a fun gun. I am selling it to free up some funds for other projects."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian made 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

This gun was made in 1941, which usually means pre-U.S. entry into WWII.  The stock does not have the proper cartouches for that period and has probably been refinished.  The action was rebarreled post 1949, and has none of the early sight features.  The bore is medium dark with good rifling up to about 1/4"" of the muzzle.  A recessed  crown will fix this.  This means that the grooves are showing micro pitting, which will have little effect on accuracy, but will require more thorough cleaning to avoid fouling build up that will effect accuracy.

The Rhino's barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian made 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian made 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

Hello, as the title states, I have a really nice Glock 35 for sale...This is the Glock competition model.. it is a full size gun which is close to the size of a 1911.

You can tell that it has been babied, very low round count and like new finish because it has never been carried or even holstered...It has new Trijicon night sights and comes with 2-15 round mags and the Glock case and paperwork.

Also available is $100 rounds of FMJ Federal ammo.

Glock calls this gun the ""practical tactical"" and is the most accurate Glock I've ever shot. Here is some more info from Glock

Overview
The Glock 35 is made by Glock. It is a Full Size Pistol used mainly for Competition and Tactical purposes. 

Size
Glock 35 weighs 2.25 lbs when loaded, which is the average for all Pistol Firearms. The total length is 8.82 inches with a barrel length of 5.31 inches. It is a .40 caliber gun.

Glock 35 and everything -ammo....$800

with 100 rounds.... $850

Pistol Grip Mossberg 500 12 gauge pump shotgun.
Its only been shot 6 times, It has a pistol grip and a heat shield...It has an 18 inch barrel and the tube is the same length...It has been carried and transported, so its not perfect, but it's been shot very little...Let me know if your interested, I probably have $50 dollars worth of .00 buck ammo I could include. 
I gave $450 before everything went crazy....
MAKE ME AN OFFER

This is that little Mossberg 22LR that resembles an AR-15...it is new, and comes with the box and everything it came with new including a lock and magazine...
I know this isn't the AR that most are looking for, but it's cheap to shoot, and you can laugh at the 22LR, but I don't want to get shot with it.
$500

Great for CC.  Dont underestimate .22lr especially when running .22lr CCI  stingers!  This gun holds ten+one, is extremely light, and very accurate with piratically no recoil.  Every group is controlled and on target.   Accuracy is much more deadly then power.

I also have 400norinco 7.62x39 ammo. I ordered a ak74 muzzle from carolina shooters that hasnt yet arrived. This isnt a century import. The C-39 sporter was milled and mfg right here in the good old USA. They even put an American flag on the side of it. Im not interested in selling it im just seeing whats out there. The ak47 is arguably yhe best urban combat rifke on the planet due to the large cartrige with light loads thst allows u to fire from the hip verses the shoulder like u would with the .308/7.62NATO. Im not saying it is the greatest im saying its arguably the greatest. Gun by itself is $1300 with ammo its $1500"

These are very hard to find now but I got lucky and have 2 of them and only need 1 for myself. 

Includes 
Complete lower built in mag block with bolt hold open.
RRA pistol buffer tube 
9mm buffer and spring

This is a used lower so its not perfect but it isn't in bad shape."

TWO-STAGE PISTON WITH ADJUSTABLE REGULATOR provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with
superior operating endurance.
The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.


** This is a highly sought after rifle because of it's superior quality.
