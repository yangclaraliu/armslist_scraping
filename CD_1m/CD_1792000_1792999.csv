It is all matching other than the bolt which has no serial and is in a very nice laminated stock. It has some more use than some that have come in, but doesn't have an importer mark, meaning it's probably a very early import or a bringback.  Any non-sporterized Carcano, well used would be acceptable, bore condition doesn't matter. Email me for pictures. For a nicer Carcano I would include some cash."

I have two Bersa's for sale.  One is the thin grip lighter weight concealed carry Thunder 380 model and the other is the Bersa Thunder 22 which has the same control, but is slightly larger with thicker grips like the regular Thunder 380 models.  The 22 makes for cheap practice so I'm hoping someone will buy both so I only need to do one transaction.  Both guns are very accurate since they are straight blow back.  Even with the smooth sites on the 380 I, and my friends who have shot it, shoot it as accurately as our full size 9mm s.  The 380 comes with 3 of the correct, flush, Bersa 8 round magazines (the regular Thunder 389 seven round mags will not function correctly with the concealed model).  These mags are $35 each when you can find them in stock which is sometimes months.  The 22 comes with 4 mags.  I also have a generic open carry holster and sticky holster for iwb carry that I will through in along with a loader for the 380 and one for the 22.  $400 for each gun with its accessories."

“Bigger and badder” is the best way to describe the AR-536. Its 5x magnification makes it easier to find and engage targets out to 600 yards, while the larger 36mm objective delivers brighter, crisper images. The Ballistic/CQTM lighted reticle is ideal for tactical operations or friendly competition. Shooters can choose the high contrast black reticle, or select red or green depending upon the situation. Five different illumination set- tings make it easy to match any light condition.
Ruggedly built to withstand up recoil, abuse and weather, key features include multi-coated lenses, adjustable diopter, integrated lens covers and three Picatinny rail mounting points. Remove the bottom rail mount and it can be readily mounted to an AR carry handle. It is ready for the range right out of the box!!!

Not even a hiccup, a great shooting and loud AR. The best solution if your looking for an SBR. register this while you get to keep and enjoy shooting it as a pistol! That was my plan anyways!

I will include the original flash hider that came with it, and other AR accessories that I have just collected over time. These include rail covers, and whatever I find in boxes in my back room.

I have several thousand pieces of each. I will meet you anywhere local, or ship it USPS Priority Mail anywhere in the State, or US. If you have something pistol related you want to swap I'm up for any offer. If you have some ammo you don't have a gun to shoot in, or some unwanted reloading supplies, or shoot even a pistol I can play around with. Here are the details:
 Price is:
 Price is:
 9mm Luger 100 rds 5.00
 .38 Special 100 rds 6.00
 .40 S&W 100 rds 6.00
 .45 ACP 100 rds 7.90
 If you want it cleaned and polished it I will do it for .02 a round.

 I'll ship it to your front door by USPS priority mail. I use the ""if fits it ships"" priority mail boxes: You can ship twice as much 9mm as .45 acp in the same box, but generally as a rule:
 100-200 pcs will cost 5.80 to ship.
 200-2000 pcs will cost 12.65 to ship.
 1500-4000 pcs will cost 16.50 to ship.

 Your welcome to mix and match any quantity of any size. Example:
 500 pcs each of, 9mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP = 1500 pcs and would ship for 12.65.

 If you reload several sizes, than you will do well here, You can mix your numbers any way you want.

 Pick up in Wichita - I will drop it off anywhere you want in town for free, or you can swing by and get it.

 Payment: I have a store front business and take credit card orders over the phone every day but Sunday. I also except Pay Pal, and if need be will take a money order. If you prefer a personal check that is fine also, but it will delay your shipment till it clears the bank. 

 Swap: I love to swap. I am a gun enthusiast, re-loader, hunter, and all around outdoorsman. I will swap you for any gun you are not using, or ammo you have no gun to shoot it out of anymore, or about anything else. I like it all. I am a fair trader and will give you fair market value on whatever you might have to trade. All you can do is ask, and I’ll I can say is yes, or no, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.

The ""C"" stood for compact. Initially, these handguns were even roll-marked ""Service Model-C.""

Introduced August 31, 1983, the first in the Service Model-C series was the A211, which featured a round-top slide and fixed sights. Barrel length was 4.25-inches, making the over-all length .75-inch less than the standard A111. Magazine capacity (7) and height remained the same. Weight of the A211 was 36 ounces, compared to 38 ounces for the full-sized Model A111. After 992 of the Model A211 pistols were made, production of that model ceased on September 6, 1984.

Took me a few months to locate a shop that could finally get it. They had to special order this since it's in Titanium Gold. This will be a very valuable gun for collectors since it's so hard to find and this was one of the last DEP made in Israel because they moved their production to the US. It will only appreciate in value.

I have taken great care of this gun. Always cleaned it thoroughly after range sessions. Never dropped or scratched it in any way. Never holstered it so there's no chance of holster wear at all (titanium gold finish is very wear-resistant anyways). This DEP is pretty much still in mint condition. It can pass as a brand new gun.


I DO NOT need to sell this gun. If there are no offers that I'm willing to take, I will gladly keep this gun. This is my pride and joy. I will consider all offers, but 1st to offer my asking price gets it. No trades please. Thank you."

Model: Model 10-3 Military & Police Revolver 

Serial Number: C571933 

Year of Manufacture: 1961 - 1962 

Caliber: .38 Special 

Action Type: Single and Double Action Swing-Out Cylinder Revolver 

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “SMITH & WESSON” and the barrel’s right side is marked “38 S. & W. SPECIAL CTG.” The yoke cut is marked “MOD. / 10-3” and the yoke is marked “27900”, upside-down “Q”, “L” and “4”. The rear face of the cylinder is marked with an “L” and the back of the extractor star is marked “571933”. The left side of the grip frame is marked ‘6”, “X”, “27900” and “E”. The underside of the grip frame is marked “C571933” and the right side of the grip frame is marked “M” and “4”, both upside-down. The right sideplate has an S&W logo and the frame’s right side has the four line “Marcas Registradas” address. 

Barrel Length: 4” 

Sights / Optics: The front sight is a fixed serrated ramp. The rear sight is a square notch milled into the top strap. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are plastic imitation stag similar to old Ajax grips. They’re marked “20” and “K FRAME COMBAT MASTERPIECE / 38 M & P / K-22/K-38 / MED. FRAME SQUARE BUTT”. The right grip panel has a silver colored crest for engraving. Both grip panels show handling marks but no chips or cracks. The grips rate in about Very Good overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Nickel 

Finish Originality: Probably Not 

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is shallow. There is no erosion in the bore. 

Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 85% of its metal finish. The balance shows a discoloration of the nickel and some pinprick surface erosion. Please see the photos. There is some rust on the unpolished sides of the grip frame, visible only when the grip panels are removed. The screw heads are reasonably sharp. The screw head that retains the cylinder latch is blue. The markings are clear. The hammer is checkered and the trigger is serrated. Overall, this handgun rates in about Good to Very Good condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. This is a four screw, Square Butt “K” Frame revolver with a pinned barrel, service hammer and trigger. We did not fire this handgun. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: A blue two piece S&W box with metal reinforced corners is provided. It is marked “SMITH & WESSON / .38 MILITARY & POLICE / BLUE FINISH MODEL 10 / 4-INCH HEAVY BARREL” on the end, which correctly describes this revolver. The bottom of the box is marked by hand, in white “571933”. The top is marked with the S&W logo, address and a silver rectangle. The box is missing 20% of its finish and has a tear in one corner. The box is in Poor overall condition. 

Assessment: We believe this revolver left the factory “blue” and was later nickeled. At the time this revolver was produced, guns that left the factory nickeled were shipped in Gray boxes, not blue and guns sent to the factory to be nickeled were marked to note that fact. The nickel plating has frosted in a somewhat irregular pattern. The revolver is in Fine mechanical condition and would make a great handgun for home defense."

A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 US uses the trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) model. 
This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The P2000 trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3-8.5 pounds of pressure, compared to 12-15 pounds found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment (by HK armorers) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound range.

Features:
•	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•	Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
•	Modular grip with exchangeable back straps to easily adjust the grip size to the shooter´s hand
•	Ideal size and weight to comply with the requirements of the full range of police missions, including concealed carry
•	Low profile slide and slimline, compact dimensions
•	Ambidextrous slide release (located on both sides of the frame)
•	Very short trigger reset distance to enhance the speed of multiple or follow-up shots
•	Polymer recoil absorber bushing (similar to the HK USP COMPACT) aids in recoil reduction
•	Corrosion resistant Hostile Environment blued finish
•	Oversized recurved trigger guard for use with gloves
•	One piece machined steel slide
•	Industry standard mounting grooves for installing accessories
•	Ambidextrous magazine release lever
•	Optional magazine disconnect
•	Patented Lock-Out Safety device

The matte black polymer frame comes with four interchangeable backstraps to customize grip fit and is designed with a low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced control.

The FNS offers a hammer-forged stainless steel barrel. The slide features front and rear cocking serrations and is topped with three-dot fixed sights. The FN FNS also is equipped with steel frame rails that can be easily replaced.

The STI brand is just now starting to slowly make its way to the civilian world but has carried a heavy name through the competition circuit since the 1980's as the leading competetion pistol. There is no questioning the accuracy, fubctionality, or reliabiltty of this pistol, STI has proven them selves in the pro competion circuit for many years and that is why it is the most widely used brand among comp shooters today. This pistol fresh out of the box is ready to compete, STI's patened full length multiple spring guide rod recoil system allows a shooter to stay on target with little to no recoil or muzzle flip which is very important in competition or in a defensive situation. This pistol features a stell frame, stainless slide, polished sides, and blued frame. It has tactical adjustable Novak sights, 3.9' fully supported ramped bull barrel, STI patened trigger system, commander hammer,high rise beaver tail safety, single side thumb safety, and the ground breaking Recoil Master (guide rod). With this patened recoil system it tames this 45 acp to the feel of a 9mm for anyone to handle. This pistol is perfect for conceal carry and if price is right I will throw in a Loopers leather conceal carry holster. This pistol comes with the STI box and one mag (all STI like Kimber comes with one mag unfortunately) but I do have a 8rd colt stainless mag I can throw in. I would like to trade down for a lesser value pistol (prefer 1911) and cash on your end or sell out right, may possibly be willing to do multiple pistol (2 Glocks or springs) trade. I am really trying to find a nice 10mm!! Please quality only as this is as quality as it gets. I challenge you to find one bad review literally. I know many Kimber lovers that bought an STI and retired their Kimbers and made them safe queens after getting their hands on STI. These pistols are very hard to find and very saught out.

Stag is owned by Mark Malkowski who is the son of Ted Malkowski-- the owner of Continental Machine & Tool (CMT) which has been making M16/AR15 parts for the military and civilian market since the Vietnam War. Stag was even contracted to make the initial run of M&P15's before Smith & Wesson started producing everything in house.

The fit and finish are excellent and each Stag looks as good on the inside as it does on the outside. Overall the rifle shows excellent workmanship. Stag offers a lifetime warranty and uses 4140 chromoly steel barrels. In fact, many law enforcement agencies even use Stag rifles as their patrol rifle of choice.

This is a really neat package- and easy! With two barrels, you can cover all your bases-- hunting, sport and home defense. One shotgun, two barrels. With a simple twist of the front cap, you can change out barrels. Pull the shotgun out of the closet for a Saturday dove hunt- just drop in the long barrel. When you get home, change the barrel and load it up with some home protection rounds and you''re prepared for any situation that may endanger your family

Since 1919, O.F. Mossberg & Sons has produced weapons that all levels of gun users – including novices – continue to operate today. In fact, Mossberg was the first long-gun manufacturer in the U.S. to achieve ISO 9001 certification, which sets the standard on manufacturing and quality control procedures. The Mossberg 500, which was first produced in 1961, continues to be one of its most popular shotguns for sale on the market, and it’s currently used by the United States and allied armed forces, as well as by police and civilian gun owners. The Mossberg 500 also makes for an excellent field weapon, and is often used as a trap and skeet gun.

It is a very nice M1 Garand. It is a correct Springfield with nice wood andoriginal finish. It is a Korean War era and all parts are original and are correct for when issued. The wood has nicks and dings from long-term 60 years of storage. It was bought originally from CMP. Will send more pictures upon request. When CMP was selling these they sold for $1100 plus shipping - now if they have the they are auctioned and go for much more.

Here is the CMP description: CORRECT GRADE: (Very Good to Excellent) 
Correct Grade Rifles are similar to the Service Grade, but will show less wear and use. Correct Grade rifles will have all correct parts for the date of manufacture with 80% or better overall original metal finish. The stock and handguards will be of walnut and correct for the rifle but will have some dings, dents, scratches and marring of the wood finish. Stocks will have the appropriate original inspector's cartouche. The rifle bore will be very good with no significant defects. Very good to excellent condition. This grade is rare and is only available occasionally in limited quantities. Because of the scarcity of these rifles, they will only be sold on the CMP auction site.

It is a very nice M1 Garand. It is a correct Springfield with nice wood and original finish. It is a Korean War era and all parts are original and are correct for when issued. The wood has nicks and dings from long-term 60 years of storage. It was bought originally from CMP. Will send more pictures upon request. When CMP was selling these they sold for $1100 plus shipping - now if they have the they are auctioned and go for much more.

Here is the CMP description: CORRECT GRADE: (Very Good to Excellent) 
Correct Grade Rifles are similar to the Service Grade, but will show less wear and use. Correct Grade rifles will have all correct parts for the date of manufacture with 80% or better overall original metal finish. The stock and handguards will be of walnut and correct for the rifle but will have some dings, dents, scratches and marring of the wood finish. Stocks will have the appropriate original inspector's cartouche. The rifle bore will be very good with no significant defects. Very good to excellent condition. This grade is rare and is only available occasionally in limited quantities. Because of the scarcity of these rifles, they will only be sold on the CMP auction site.

It is a very nice M1 Garand. It is a correct Springfield with nice wood and original finish. It is a Korean War era and all parts are original and are correct for when issued. The wood has nicks and dings from long-term 60 years of storage. It was bought originally from CMP. Will send more pictures upon request. When CMP was selling these they sold for $1100 plus shipping - now if they have the they are auctioned and go for much more.

Here is the CMP description: CORRECT GRADE: (Very Good to Excellent) 
Correct Grade Rifles are similar to the Service Grade, but will show less wear and use. Correct Grade rifles will have all correct parts for the date of manufacture with 80% or better overall original metal finish. The stock and handguards will be of walnut and correct for the rifle but will have some dings, dents, scratches and marring of the wood finish. Stocks will have the appropriate original inspector's cartouche. The rifle bore will be very good with no significant defects. Very good to excellent condition. This grade is rare and is only available occasionally in limited quantities. Because of the scarcity of these rifles, they will only be sold on the CMP auction site.

I love it but I don't shoot it. It just sits. And since I've gotten seriously into Long Range shooting, I would rather have something like an awesome Long Range Rifle....

Very lightly used. In great shape, looks brand new. Has a BattleComp Muzzle Brake on it and Magpul Selector. 

I will break up or separately IF someone only wants the rifle and that sells first... I won't sell the magazines unless the rifle sells first OR you are going to give me the ridiculous amount of 100 bucks each and won't sell the ammo again, unless its at the ridiculous price of a buck a round...

Here are my pricepoints...

1) As you see in the picture; 5000.00 USD obo. Not first offer, best offer. 
Burris PEPR mount
Vortex Viper PST 1-4x24
Battlecomp Muzzle Brake
Stock Muzzle Brake
Grip Pod Grip
3 additional magazines, 1 lightly used and 2 NIB all in FDE
200 rounds of Factory Remanufactured Brass cased FMJ ammo which I've shot through this SCAR and my other 308s which have run flawlessly.

2) Rifle only with Magpul Selector and BattleComp Muzzle Brake and PWS (came stock), and 1 magazine- 3500.00 USD firm.
3) Rifle with Magpul Selector and stock PWS Muzzle Brake, and 1 magazine - 3500.00 USD obo
4) 3 Additional magazines, 1 lightly used, 2 NIB, with purchase of rifle add 150.00 (e.g. Option 1 plus mags, 3650.00)

Thats the basic break-down, if you want some other combination of what you see, just pm and maybe we can work something out.

What I'm looking for in trade; Really interested in Long Range capable rifles, bolt action preferred unless its a Barrett 82 (just dreaming). Looking for something in more common chambered rounds, meaning like .308, 300 Win Mag, 338 Lapua, 50 cal. as opposed to 408 CheyTac, 416 Remington, etc)

Buyer must be at least 18 years of age, legal to purchase and own a firearm in the State of Colorado, Must sign a BOS/Receipt for my personal records. Buyer must present VALID Colorado Driver's License or CCW. I reserve the right to refuse sale to anyone for any reason, especially if I suspect some fishy activity...

The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with a NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle."
