It has served me well and has been replaced by another Kimber. The Ultra CDP is the Kimber Custom Shop 3' 1911. If you're not familiar it is an upgraded Kimber Ultra. It gets extra attention from the Kimber Custom Shop. Here is the info for the series II pistol. http://www.kimberamerica.com/1911/cdp-ii/ultra-cdp-ii As listed above mine is a series 1, which are becoming harder to find. 

The pistol has some holster wear from being carried daily (see pictures). The gun works flawlessly and has been a true nail driver for everyone that fires it from myself to my 12 year old son. 

Included with the gun is the original box, papers, lock and Kimber magazine. In addition I'm including one black and two stainless Chip McCormick Magazines (the Kimber and black CM magazines just had the springs replaced with new Wolff springs last month and the two stainless CM magazine are less than a month old). I'm also including a brand new unopened Wolff recoil spring pack. 

New these go for over $1200 plus tax or shipping and transfer. Like I mentioned the series 1 are harder to find so my listed price of $950 for everything I'm including is more than fair. I've probably fired around 1000 flawless rounds through this gun and every round has been quality, all brass cased rounds from major manufactures. The round count is probably high but I want to be as accurate as possible.  If you're considering a 1911 or a Kimber this is your chance to get a high quality one for a lot less than new. 

Not really looking for trades but I also believe in never saying never so if you ask about a trade please let me know what you have and what kind of deal you're thinking. CCW preferred for sale but at a minimum you must be 21 with a valid AZ drivers license. Thanks for looking."

before you read below where I'll tell you all about the keyboard here's what I'll trade for

7.62x39mm ammo, or AK47 Accessories, I also need 38spl and 380 ammo but It would have to be some sort of combo with 7.62 ammo.. Or a gun if its worth as much as the keyboard..

Now here's some info about the keyboard .. 

Yamaha DGX 205 Portable Grand keyboard 76 keys

It can be used in multiple ways..

1. Standalone by itself, it has really good speakers, thousands of really good sounds loaded on it, 76keys
2. It's portable with batteries, if you don't have anywhere to plug it in
3. Hooked up to a computer as a USB midi controller, which then gives you access to make any key play any sound you want

It also has Drums so it can be used as a drum machine or a all in one beat machine it can record sequences etc etc..
It also can teach you how to play with a on-screen guide
Its just all around better than an mpc, I had the MPC1000 and quickly seen how unneeded it was when I had this keyboard, way more keys and just all around way more impressive than hitting some drumpads.

Selling because I'm no longer producing or engineering. It retailed for $300-$500 depending on the store

As a bonus I have some extra software I don't need.. Pro tools 10, FL Studio 10, Just let me know."

The rifle has not been fired it has been in the safe for over a year and have completely lost interest in it. 

300 blackout is a mix of two types of ammo, it is a 556 casing with a 308 projectile meaning its a bad mamajama. 


ammo is high quality professionally made, not done by a hobby reloader.

there are 3 small indents in the lower just above the safety selector on the corner edge between the upper and lower. this does not interfere with the operation of the rifle at all. just minor cosmetic issue. 

this is a mil-spec rifle built in the U.S.A. in black creek georgia by one of the most reputable AR manufactures in the industry, comes with magpul buttstock, finger guard ect ect.

the optics are vortex strikefire red/green dot optics with a 2x magnification. quality glass optics great for target shooting or even random zombie attacks you will be at ease.

This gun sells new in stores like Bass Pro for $469.99 and up depending on finish and sight choice so I think $400.00 is a fair price for a used gun (and yes, I know you can find them online for around $400.00 new but there is $40.00 in shipping and $25.00 in a transfer fee still making the gun sell for around $465.00).

Most of the past 20 years I lived in the city and didn’t shoot it all.  Now I live in a small town and belong to a shooting club and shoot about 30 rounds every 2 weeks.  Always cleaned from chamber not muzzle.  Mounted a Mueller red dot sight last fall – auto intensity adjust and 4 reticles.  Doesn’t do much for looks but really helps accuracy - Optics Planet sells it currently for $95 – with original box, tool and instructions.  Pics on request.

The gun shoots either 22 Long or 22 Long Rifle and is in great working order, VERY ACCURATE! I love this gun and hate to get rid of it but I bought a few new guns in the past few months and did agree to sell one to get the new one. ...well I got by now about 2 months and got rid of 1 now I have to get rid of this one. I bought this gun when we first moved here a few years ago and have probably only shot 300 rounds through it since I've had it. I saw it online for $170 and was able to pick it up by itself for $160 which is probably a little more than I should have for a little 22 to go plinking but I do not regret it one bit. I used to shoot one of these when I was younger and like the fact that it is has the wood stock, heavier feel and just reminds you of when you used to shoot as a kid, not like all the new cheap feeling poly stocks. It has a few scratches where it looks like somebody had rested the rifle to shoot and few random scratches here and here but overall is in good shape for an older gun, they were manufactured between 1974-1980. Anyways, I will include the soft case I paid $25 for and 200 Rounds of Ammo- 100 Rounds Winchester T22 and 100 Rounds Remington Target Rounds.

I'm not really going to use it because I'm more of a fan of .45's. I got this P95 for my wife, but she is too scared to even touch it (she was raised different than I, haha).

SO lets make a deal. I prefer cash, but will take great trades if it is a trade up or around the same value. I can add a little (a little, not 1k) cash to the deal if its a great deal you are offering.

This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight."

This is a very hard to find gun. It shoots .410 2 1/2 inch shells or slugs. I have never shot this gun. I is in perfect condition. I bought this gun for the rarity of it. You wont find anything wrong at all with the gun. Unexpected expense is forcing me to sell a couple of my rare guns. You can research this gun and these guns sell for $1000-$1500. I went in the middle with my price because I cannot find the original box. If I find it I will include it. I would trade for the right gun. I traded a $1500 Kimber for this gun so definitely Kimber 1911's, I would even look at Sigs in a 1911. I would take other 1911's and cash so dont be afraid to ask.

I bought them as part of a larger lot of reloading supplies from an estate.  I don't reload or shoot in 9mm so I'm letting them go for under 30 cents a piece.  They are loaded on once-fired mixed, boxer primed brass.  2.7 grains of Unique sits on a Winchester primer topped with a .358 diameter, soft lubed, 115 grain cast bullet.  I've fired 30 rounds through my Glock 19 and they all fed, fired, ejected, and grouped well.  My last count put the quantity at 712 rounds.  I live in Mukwonago but travel to Madison and the Fox Valley area on a weekly basis.  I would like $200 for the lot or I am willing to trade for other ammunition (not 9mm or shotgun shells).  If you want to meet locally, I could meet you at the park-and-ride located on Highway 164 and I-43.

But there is—Bill Ruger’s 10/22. Introduced in 1964, this little autoloader has been produced in the millions and can properly lay claim to being America’s No. 1 .22. It’s a simple semiautomatic action, its legendary reliability aided by the rifle’s signature rotary magazine.

The Complete Package
The 10/22 Takedown comes in a Ruger-logo black nylon backpack-style carrying case. Unzipped, it has an inside main pouch for the receiver and two smaller pouches for the barrel and a scope. There’s also a generous outside pouch for ammo, earplugs and whatever. I like the setup. A takedown model needs a carrying case, and this one fits everything you need.

The rifle has Ruger’s standard flip-up rear sight and barrelband front sight. Also supplied is a rail mount for Weaver-style rings. Now, here’s a dilemma. I like full-size scopes on good .22s, so an obvious answer is detachable rings. There are some good ones today, and I trust them, but I’m not really crazy about constantly attaching and detaching a scope, and it kind of defeats the purpose if you have to check zero every time you put the rifle together.

It also has a short reset trigger compared to the standard model, and that's the best part to me. Also added to this model are tritium night sights, which are awesome.

I replaced the stock grips with some rubber Hogue ones that feel great, so I'm including these along with the stock grips. Also included are two magazines and a hard case.

Please email if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer if I can. Not interested in any trades.
