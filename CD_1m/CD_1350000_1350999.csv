Original owner. This was for my wife and it just never got shot. Factory assembled DPMS Oracle upper on a factory assembled complete NFA LW-15 lower. This AR is a lightweight set up. It has a true 4140 16 inch pencil barrel, forward assist, dust cover, optic/sight rail for whatever you want to put on there, A2 birdcage flash hider, and is chambered in 5.56 x 45 so it can run the 5.56 and 223. Triggers on this lower are typically 4.5 lbs, have a small amount of creep, and have a fairly crisp break. Reset is a bit long.
$799 obo for gun only.  Email is the most reliable way to reach me during business hours.

Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.



These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.
 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters."

It's a 336 Carbine manufactured in 1981. It has the golden trigger and is JM marked and made in CT. This is an excellent rifle and shoots great. It's in very good shape for a 30 year old rifle with only a few minor scratches in the blueing and a a couple nicks in the wood. Everything is minor and purely cosmetic and it has absolutely no rust or pitting. This is probably one of the best east coast deer and bear rifles you can get. The 200gr round nose bullet will level a deer out to 200 yards but has the recoil of a 243.

I will sell it with or without the scope you see pictured. The scope is a Leupold Vari-X II 3-9x40 and is marked made in USA and is from back when enough components in Leupolds were made here to be called made in USA, not the new china sourced trash.

I also have up to 9 boxes of brand new Remington core-lokt 200gr ammo available to the buyer for $25 a box. I don't have to sell it though because I have two other Marlins in 35 rem.

The price for the rifle is $650 with the scope or $450 without. You won't find a JM marked golden trigger 35 remington this clean for anywhere near that price. Seeing the price is low for what it is and I'm in no hurry to sell my price will not be negotiable. NO TRADES, I already put a deposit on a new rifle being built so I don't want anything but cash.

Buyer MUST be a VA resident with a valid VA ID and some form of ID to show me you're not a felon (CHP, voter ID, LE or MIL credentials, or even a receipt with same name and address and a serial number from a recent gun purchase)."

The rifle is used but in good condition and comes with a nearly new Volquartsen extractor (about 30 rounds through it after it was installed). The rear sight on the barrel was removed for it to fit in the stock kit as well as the front sight post resulting in a minor amount of denting shown in the picture so that the fake suppressor or flash hider shroud would fit over it. Everything is as is since it does have about 1500 rounds through it, but Rugers have a reputation for reliability and my only issues were with the old extractor.

The rifle comes with 5 mags, the original Ruger 10 rd mag, 1 Archangel 25rd Marauder mag, 1 Ruger BX-25 mag, 1 Shooter's Ridge 30 round mag, and 1 Butler Creek 25 round mag.

Also included is the original sight rail, old extractor, original wood stock as well as the original sights that were removed to fit in the kit.

Great cycling action, feels very nice, beautiful wood as you can see. It also comes with a scope mount. I can add a scope if you wish. These make GREAT deer guns; never too early to think about deer season. Come October you can't find these used, so if you're thinking about it, it's a great time to buy one. 

They cost $420-450 new plus tax and what not, so I think I'm asking a fair price. I accept cash or credit card (+$10 because they charge me 3%). Face to face only. 

I am not only in Milwaukee! I am often in the Oshkosh/Fond du Lac/Ripon area and can meet you if it's not too far. 
Will consider trades for only the following: 1994-2000 honda civic (+$ from me obviously) in fair-lousy condition, must be less than 200k miles. Remington 887 with a camo pattern.

This gun was acquired by me a few years back with the intention of having it refinished due to the bluing was worn and there was some rust spots and handling marks in the wood. I finally decided to do it all myself. So here is what you get. I stripped the gloss finish from the wood and re-stained it with Cabot Gunstock stain. It has been rubbed to a fine natural wood shine and shows the grain of the beautiful walnut. I sand blasted the bluing off and then painted with OD Green Dura-coat finish. Each part was meticulously cleaned and refinish and then re-assembled. You get with this package a factory 28"" Rem-choke 3"" chamber vent rib barrel with only one Modified choke and you also get a factory but cut down to 18.5"" 3"" chamber vent rib Home Defense barrel with a Limbsaver fiber optic front sight installed. I've polished the bolt and carrier group to a smooth shiny finish. Go hunting on the weekends, come home and take the barrel off then install the Home Defense barrel to protect your family. One shotgun dual use, a hunter and defender of your family that functions flawlessly. My price was $750, NOW $700 OBO. Thanks for looking."

This gun has only been shot about 4 or 5 times to sight it in.  The traditions scope is amazing.  Looking through the scope makes the view brighter than the view in the natural light.  The gun breaks down in half with the push of a lever so you can load the primer and also clean the gun easier.  I used it for deer hunting but did not get a shot at a deer.  I am giving up deer hunting because it took too much of my time and I did not see any deer.  I also discovered that I do not like the taste of deer meat.   My loss is your gain.  The gun comes with about $60 worth of ammo.  This is everything you need to get started in the muzzle loader hunting business.  I hope your have better luck than I did.  This is a small price to pay to get started.  If this is sold to someone out of state it will have too be sent to an FFL dealer and the buyer will be responsible for the shipping cost and the cost of the FFL dealer.

The pistol has a 10 ” barrel with an adjustable rear sight, and the front sight is adjustable as well. As attractive as it is rare, the pistol is finished in Colt’s finest polished Commercial blue, and it has factory wooden checkered grips with silver-colored Colt Medallions. The pistol has a few very light service marks on the receiver and there is a very minute area of freckling on the right side of the receiver. There is also a tiny, but noticeable ding on the butt of the grips, this notwithstanding, these are very minor and overall condition of this beautiful pistol is 95%. The pistol has a shiny bore with strong rifling, and trigger pull is very smooth."

The barrel on this rifle has approx 2,000 rounds. Only 3 final prototypes have been manufactured of the FD308 prior to entering production. This auction presents you the opportunity for an extraordinary purchase not only because it is arguably the highest quality 308 auto-loading rifle in the world, but also that it comes with F&D's exclusive Unlimited Lifetime Warranty, offered by no other rifle-maker. SN#PT2 represents the absolute pinnacle of auto-loading firearms design and manufacturing exactness.
SN2 performs at sub 1/2 MOA accuracy, with a statistical average of .3 MOA using match factory ammo.
The FD308 boasts a much higher level quality design and manufacturing processes than all competitors including LWRC, Larue, POF, LMT, GAP, etc...
Unlimited Warranty

F&D's prototype model unlimited warranty is an ultimate end-user guarantee that offers the rifle owner a number of advantages over any traditional warranty, such as: free lifetime upgrades to revised & updated components, no term-limit, free replacement of all components from wear & tear (excluding barrel bore/chamber). Free lifetime replacement of all components due to unintentional & non-negligent damage. Essentially it's a rifle for life.
FD308 Features:

308 Win, 17"" match chambered, 416 stainless barrel, lapped & polished bore, utilizing a high quality barrel by Krieger
Unconstrained infinitely variable tuned piston system: NP3-Plus coated, all high-temp stainless components. Quickly breaks down for cleaning and inspection.
Non-reciprocating side charging handle
Meticulously machined matching lower receiver, upper receiver, and rail (all serialized): exclusive hand-forged 7075-T6 aluminum, hard anodized
9.4 lbs with H4 heavy buffer, match contoured stainless barrel, and UBR stock; can be reduced to 8.4lbs with lightweight accessories
Matched-pair bolt and extension: 9310 vacuum melted spacecraft grade alloy steel, case hardened, shot-peened, hand-polished, precision ground, lapped, and NP3-Plus coated
Magpul 20-round P-mag; fits and feeds flawlessly
Lifetime Transferable Warranty
20 minute top rail cant, for added scope range
Bolt-on barrel/rail configuration for quick and repeatable barrel swaps and inspection; maintains higher rigidity than barrel-nut designs, and consolidates the absolute lowest and most compact rail-height available to any piston system. The F&D barrel interface maintains 8200lbs of rigid axial force against the upper receiver, compared to 6700lbs with barrel nuts utilized across the industry. Other ""quick-change"" barrel systems maintain little to no axial force against the upper receiver (LMT). Axial barrel retaining force is one of the most significant structural contributors to accuracy and consistency of AR style rifles.
Magpul MIAD modular grip
Custom designed, hardened, hand-polished, and NP3-Plus coated bolt catch
Rail modules for accessory attachment
3rd-Party Component Features:

Geissele Automatics High-Speed DMR trigger (not the cheaper SSA version)
Ambidextrous safety selector
Magpul UBR stock
Troy Industries folding battlesights
Harris bi-pod and mount shown in pictures
F&D rifles go through a complete break-in procedure to meet our sub-MOA and flawless feeding/extraction standards. The FD308 line of rifles are arguably the highest quality semi-auto rifles in the world."
