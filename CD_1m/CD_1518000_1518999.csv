It is in perfect condition. I have found the compact model to be more accurate than the full size, but that's just my experience. It can nail the bullseye at 10 yards easily. I bought it January 4th from a dealer in Waukesha right when the ""ban"" craze started, so it took me a very long time to hunt one down. In fact, it was built/test fired only two weeks before I bought it. The barrel, take down lever, extractor, and slide catch have all been polished. It actually looks very good. I only have about 150 rounds through it. Since it's so new, it has the desired ""shield trigger"" that pre-12/2012 M&P compacts did not come with. It has the standard 3-dot Novak sights, picatinny rail, etc. Perfect concealed carry firearm. Here's what you get:

The firearm Two 12 round magazines- one flush base plate, one with the pinky extension Three palm swells (back straps) S&W Case Manual, test shell, NRA coupon, etc.

I paid somewhere in the $575 range, plus a $15 BG check, plus $35 in tax. Basically, I'm breaking even.

Since this is under my name, I require a photo/copy of your DL or CCW and a bill of sale. No exceptions unless its going through your FFL.

It also will come with the Henry Model Cantilever scope mount that I ordered from the Henry website. Henry doesn't drill and tap nor cut scope grooves, in the brass receiver of the Golden Boy, so they make and sell their own scope mount just for this rifle. The scope mount attaches to the top of the barrel by removing the rear site and bolting scope mount to top of barrel. It's all new, it's all Henry. I intended on putting a scope on here, that's why I ordered their scope mount off of the Henry website. I went through some pictures of Henry Golden Boys with scopes and found the scope that looks great on this cowboy rifle...it looks right- so I ordered it. It will likely be here after the rifle is sold. I'll put it on something else I guess. Bought this for my wife's birthday, but it is too heavy for her, she couldn't handle it, so I had to go right back out and buy a regular Henry (the blued model with the round, not octagon barrel) that one is a little lighter and she can manage it. The wood is very dark and is beautiful on this rifle. As I mentiioned, I now have the regular Henry, the ""blued"" .22 lever rifle; the wood on this Golden model is so much nicer. I have never had anything like this rifle; the lever action is smooth like butter, the brass gleams all over like it's made of gold...it will be hard for someone to shoot it because it is so incredible looking. It came with a velvet ""sock"" wrapped around the brass receiver, Henry shipped it that way. It's a piece of art. It's not cheap, but there's nothing else like it.
I've got $695.00 in it, ..they are a little hard to find, Henry Manufacturing experienced a Hurricane and then a fire at the plant and production halted. I drove for a 5 hour round trip to get this one. Then ordered the scope mount from Henry. All total I've spent 695.00, I need 600.00 cash for it or 650.00-695.00 in pistol trade. I won't give it away. The pictures are with the Henry scope mount installed. I put it on so that you could see it installed. You can see how it sits over top the receiver without touching the receiver. It's ready for a scope. The Henry box for that mount is in the picture too. I will take the mount off if you want...and put the rear site back on if you like. Or leave it the way it is and give you the rear site in a ziplock. However you like. Email if you want 10 or so more pictures.
The pics don't do the brass justice...not at all. It's perfect. I have ammo for the right trade."

 Henry Golden Boy (.22 lever action rifle) NEW IN BOX, comes with Brass Buttplate, Brass Receiver and the optional and coveted Brass Barrel-Band; also has the preferred Octagon Barrel with the gold engraving on both sides. It also will come with the Henry Model Cantilever scope mount that I ordered from the Henry website. Henry doesn't drill and tap nor cut scope grooves, in the brass receiver of the Golden Boy, so they make and sell their own scope mount just for this rifle. The scope mount attaches to the top of the barrel by removing the rear site and bolting scope mount to top of barrel. It's all new, it's all Henry. I intended on putting a scope on here, that's why I ordered their scope mount off of the Henry website. I went through some pictures of Henry Golden Boys with scopes and found the scope that looks great on this cowboy rifle...it looks right- so I ordered it. It will likely be here after the rifle is sold. I'll put it on something else I guess. Bought this for my wife's birthday, but it is too heavy for her, she couldn't handle it, so I had to go right back out and buy a regular Henry (the blued model with the round, not octagon barrel) that one is a little lighter and she can manage it. The wood is very dark and is beautiful on this rifle. As I mentiioned, I now have the regular Henry, the ""blued"" .22 lever rifle; the wood on this Golden model is so much nicer. I have never had anything like this rifle; the lever action is smooth like butter, the brass gleams all over like it's made of gold...it will be hard for someone to shoot it because it is so incredible looking. It came with a velvet ""sock"" wrapped around the brass receiver, Henry shipped it that way. It's a piece of art. It's not cheap, but there's nothing else like it.
I've got $695.00 in it, ..they are a little hard to find, Henry Manufacturing experienced a Hurricane and then a fire at the plant and production halted. I drove for a 5 hour round trip to get this one. Then ordered the scope mount from Henry. All total I've spent 695.00, I need 600.00 cash for it or 650.00-695.00 in pistol trade.  I won't give it away. The pictures are with the Henry scope mount installed. I put it on so that you could see it installed. You can see how it sits over top the receiver without touching the receiver. It's ready for a scope. The Henry box for that mount is in the picture too. I will take the mount off if you want...and put the rear site back on if you like. Or leave it the way it is and give you the rear site in a ziplock. However you like. Email if you want 10 or so more pictures.
The pics don't do the brass justice...not at all. It's perfect. I also have ammo for right trade."

Used for a hunt one season and never used again....maybe shot a total of five times...maybe 50 shella total. Never had a singke issues cycles just fine with over 1 oz loads. I paid 1399 for it brand new and its still in new condition so im asking 900 which i think is more than fair. Or i would trade for an ar15 doesnt have to be upgraded as i like new projects. once you see or shoot this thing you'll want it instantly. Its very nice and well kept. Most people convert these to tactival or homw defense shotguns. Which i shouldve done myself hut never did. Id trade for an ar15 or an extremwly nice compact or sub compact or a nice 1911 45 acp. If it's a sub compact it would have to be one damn nice gun or two subs. But mainly looking for ar15 brand doesnt matter but be mindful mine is a binelli top of the line i just dont use it.

The Ruger BX-25 Magazine was designed from the ground up, in-house at the Ruger factory, for flawless function and reliability in any Ruger 10/22 rifle or carbine. A rugged polymer body and follower make the magazine capable of handling prolonged use and almost any environmental condition. The steel magazine feed lips are engineered to withstand thousands of rounds without significant wear, drastically reducing ammunition feeding-related malfunctions and solving a problem that has plagued increased-capacity 10/22 magazines since their inception. The BX-25 magazine's 25-round capacity and excellent functional reliability are certain to make any trip to the range more enjoyable, with greater time spent shooting and less dedicated to clearing malfunctions and reloading."

Purchased new in ~1996. This gun has been sitting in my parents basement for about a decade. I just brought it out and it has, not surprisingly, some rust problems/pitting. 

I have not shot the gun but I'm sure it is 100% functional and the rust is merely cosmetic. 

I'm moving across the country and not bringing it with me.... so make me a fair offer and we'll do the deal."

The gun comes with interchangeable back straps, gun lock, two magazines, hard case and all of the original paperwork that came from Beretta. I also have a Viridian X5L that can be sold with it or be bought separately. The Viridian has multiple settings for the flashlight as well as the laser and these settings can be changed at the shooters discretion. The laser is incredible bright and so is the light. The Viridian is used but in excellent condition and comes with the original box and all of the tools for adjusting the lateral and horizontal positioning of the laser. 

I know exactly what my pistol is worth and I know exactly what the viridian's value is even though it's used. I'm not looking to trade for anything and that includes other guns, ammo, home appliances, remote control cars and the list goes on and on. I'm also not going to sell to anyone that does not have a concealed carry permit or purchase permit. It's nothing personal, I just don't want the ATF knocking at my door.

The gun comes with interchangeable back straps, gun lock, two magazines, hard case and all of the original paperwork that came from Beretta. I also have a Viridian X5L that can be sold with it or be bought separately. The Viridian has multiple settings for the flashlight as well as the laser and these settings can be changed at the shooters discretion. The laser is incredible bright and so is the light. The Viridian is used but in excellent condition and comes with the original box and all of the tools for adjusting the lateral and horizontal positioning of the laser. 

I know exactly what my pistol is worth and I know exactly what the viridian's value is even though it's used. I'm not looking to trade for anything and that includes other guns, ammo, home appliances, remote control cars and the list goes on and on. I'm also not going to sell to anyone that does not have a concealed carry permit or purchase permit. It's nothing personal, I just don't want the ATF knocking at my door.

These pistols were originally chambered in 9mm Largo (9x23mm), but in 1938 after the German unification with Austria, the Nazis reworked 60,000 of these pistols for issue to their police.  They rechambered them in 9mm Luger (9x19mm).  All the serial numbered parts match (receiver, slide, and barrel).  The receiver bears the ""Eagle/L"" marking, which was the German police proof, as well as the ""Eagle/N"" proof.  It is stamped ""08"" on the slide, signifying that it was re-chambered in the P-08 round (9x19mm).  There are also unit markings on the lanyard loop.  I'm not sure if the unit markings are from it's WWI service, or from it's use in WWII.  It is marked ""13 DR"" on one side, and ""249"" on the other.  The slide is dated 1917.

It is in excellent operating condition with a worn finish.  Wood grips are in great condition with no cracks.  There is no rust, inside or out.  The bore is in like new condition with absolutely no rust or frosting.  It is bright with sharp rifling.  It shoots great and is fairly accurate for a nearly 100 year old pistol.  

Included with this pistol is a padded felt lined wood case, four original 8 round stripper clips, and 75 rounds of 9mm TulAmmo.

Here is a little Titan pistol small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.  Most very small pistols without a hammer require that you carry with a round in the chamber, cocked with the safety on or draw and rack the slide to shoot.  I never liked to trust the safeties on these little guns and find the little lever is hard to push quickly.  This pistol has a hammer so it is possible to simply cock the hammer on a chambered round to fire.  And, with caution, one can lower the hammer without firing.  It is not a beauty queen but it is a reliable shooter.  Its very easy to carry and to conceal.   Fifty of the rounds are commercial full-metal jacket rounds.  The other 90 are reloads with lead bullets, which are cheaper for practice and less likely to penetrate walls in self defense activity.  They will expand while jacketed bullets usually do not.  It functions fine as I fired off the missing ten reload rounds recently with no malfunctions."

The only difference was one rifle had a red dot sight.  I replaced the stock hand guards with the weaver/picatinny system hand guards and added a awesome and super comfortable forward grip.  Also I installed a 1-point bunjee sling.  I can add anything else you want as long as your willing to pay.  This will not and I can put my word on it last long.  Text or call REDACTED.

Pistol is all original and has some slight finish issues on the right hand side of the pistol.  Mechanically the pistol is awesome, shoots great. Was just torn down, cleaned fully, and inspected.

I have approximatly 270rds that can go with the pistol, along with two magazines and a holster.

The pistol does have an external hammer and a safety that will also decock the pistol and does not allow the slide to be racked it also has a double action/single action trigger.  Very safe gun and many people actually conceal carry these pistols because of their ruggedness and ease of use.
