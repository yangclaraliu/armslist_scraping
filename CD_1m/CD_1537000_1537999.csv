No more searching around, everything is in stock, and with No limits on how many rounds you can buy like at the stores so take advantage!

In this crazy ammo shortage my loss is your gain, so stock up during these hard times. CA is currently trying to push for Bullet Control: Online Ammo Ban, Annual Purchase Limits, Background Checks to Purchase/Purchasing Permits and a 10% Tax Raise on Ammo. No limits on how many rounds you can buy like at the stores so take advantage!

SB-53: Bans online sales of ammo to CA, requires an annual ammo purchase permit (fee), and requires registration (background check) and thumbprint for all ammo sales. 
AB-48: Bans sale or transfer of ammo from private sales except by an FFL, FFL must report all ammo transactions to the state
AB-760: Imposes a sales tax of 5 cents per ammunition component (complete cartridge, bullet or case). Makes reloading cost prohibitive

The Long Range Lite model is improved from the standard with a nice houge grip, and a very rigid carbon fiber handguard. This gun is long, but the reduced weight makes it almost as agile as an M4 style gun. It also has the forward assist button, and the ejection port cover.
200 rounds through it. The first 50 rounds were the Tubb Final Finish ammo, meticulously following the shoot/clean procedures. these have been proven many times to make a good barrel great. And this one shoots some very nice groups. I bought this gun, and have cared for it, with no intention of ever selling. My wife will tell you that it has been cleaned and oiled plenty.
Accessories include EVERYTHING that came with the gun. Two magpul pmags, an extra (nicer) sling, and an adapter that puts a short rail under the carbon fiber handguard. I used the adapter to mount a bipod.
I reload, and can set you up with coal, and headspace measurements if interested.
Serious buyers are welcome to bring some ammo to the range to see just how good the groups get.

I am a certified instructor for Concealed Carry Classes in the state of Kentucky. I offer private and public classes. Public classes are open to anyone and I try to have 8-10 people per class. Private classes are usually a group of friends and/or family or possibly coworkers that take the class together and request that I do not open the class up to anyone outside of their group. To hold a private class I must have at least three people signed up. I also offer Ladies Only Classes (I am a female instructor) I charge $70 per person ($75 for private classes) and I have a classroom and range available so there are no additional fees. The class itself lasts about 6 hours-this time limit is state mandated, class work is followed up with the range test. I am very flexible with scheduling and will try to accommodate everyone if possible. I am also willing to hold classes in other locations if a room and range area are available.

Picked up as a project but I'm looking to fund a different firearm. This rifle does have a few issues: Stock is in fair shape, few dings and is dirty but to be expected on a rifle from the 30's. Trigger guard is functional but is bent away from the contour of the stock where the finger grooves should meet. This was done by the previous owner for unknown reasons, can be bent back into shape or replaced easily. Rear peep sight is missing as is the hood for the front sight (front sight is still in place). I believe this is because the previous owner had installed a NO. M4D scope mount. Overall the metal is good, no pitting. I'm away from home for the next week+, pictures will be up as soon as I can get back."

He posted it as ”BORE, ACTION, INTERNALS IN EXELLENT CONDITION. HAVE PUT 200 ROUNDS THROUGH THIS RIFLE WITH ZERO PROBLEMS.’’
”  I briefly looked the gun over, I did not scrutinize it , I got distracted by patriotic statements from a young guy in the military. I came home and realized I can’t remove the gas piston shroud. Next day, I bought a punch and pushed out the pin w/ the punch and hammer. The pin supposed to be pushed out w/out  effort, with the thumb. 
    Here are the picks of what I saw when I removed the cover. The rod was  stuck, the bottom  of the piston rod is bent, the middle has a wave. Obviously totally unsafe and in inoperative condition. 
   Took it  to gunsmith (I could not remove the rod). Then I contacted Paul Austin and gave him a chance to make it right and the benefit of the doubt that he did not know what  he was selling. He promised to send the spring and piston rod, a whole $30 worth of parts..,  a month and a half ago. I'm still waiting.
    Is it deliberate deception w/no concern for safety of others or just greed and irresponsible stupidity? You be the judge. God help us all with “patriots” like this.

On the forearm's right side are four Eagle Scout badges laser scrimshaw style into the American Walnut wood and hand painted in a nickel coloring. These badges represent the design changes of the badge over its 100 year history.

One is Stainless with a 7 1/2 inch barrel-walnut grips for 550.00 and the other Virginian Dragoon, six shooter, 6 inch blued barrel. Both are perhaps in my view one of the finest single action revolvers ever made. These were manufactured in Alexandria, Virginia. The Hitchner Corporation cast a heavy revolver frame using 4140 Steel, app. 10% more substantial than its contemporaries- Ruger Blackhawk and S&W. These Dragoon revolvers  were built to very close tolerances and hand fitted and individually tuned and lock up tighter than almost any other single action ever made, similar to the individual quality of the colt line of Pythons. The large bolt and cylinder stops contribute greatly to these quality features. A Swiss Safety was incorporated into the design along with cylinder dots drilled to the left and right of one bore to indicate the empty chamber, also quite unique to the Dragoon. The revolver has adjustable rear sights with walnut grips that show no sign of wear. 
Other features include one piece back strap, brazed front sight, recessed cylinders, coil mainspring, internal firing pin, split grip panels, and unlike Ruger, Interarms used a locked firing pin busing on the Dragoon. The list price in the early 80's when this was made was 280.00 whereas the Blackhawk, 10% less substantial in structure, was only 200.00. The cost of hand fitting and tuning each one of these Dragoons individually along with other excellent unique features left the Dragoon at a price point of $80.00 above the MSRP of the Blackhawk. These extras put an impact on the overall sales of the Dragoon and production was haulted in 1985. 
These Dragoon revolvers are considered by many to be 'sleepers' in that year by year the demand for these and appreciation for their quality engineering and craftsmanship continues to drive the price upward. It's a fantastic .44 caliber and great investment in a large bore revolver. You will not be a bit disappointed. 
If shipped, the buyer pays the app. 25.00 shipping costs and FFL fees on the receiving end if applicable. The revolver must be shipped FFL to FFL paid by USPS Postal Check or purchased in person. Both are priced to sell at a time when excellent quality .44 revolver handguns -reasonably priced -are almost impossible to find.

Gun has been hunted with and has some compression dents and scratches in the stock. Bluing has one minor light rub mark, but otherwise sound. Gun will come with the following:
40 rounds of loaded ammo: 20 Winchester 165gr, 17 Winchester 150gr, and 3 Milsurp with HXP headstamp
CH Wilson 30-06 die set
100 pieces of 30-06 brass

Additional info on the rifle
""ust and FYI, but those guns were never made in Manchester, England, just like they were never made in Alexandria, Virginia. Both of those addresses on the side of the action are for Interarm's respective offices (they had 2, one in each of those cities). The gun was still manufactured in Yugoslavia. If you take the gun out of the stock, it'll say so on the rear of the action tang, opposite of the saftey lever.

While it might not say MarkX, it is. Looks to be a Viscount model. It might actually say MarkX underneath the front scope base.

Some really good news is that it has the earlier 'Oberndorf' style bottom metal with the 'in the bow' floor plate release. These are much more desirable compared to the laters, with the cross button.""

Price is $475 with everything. $425 with gun and ammo only

Willing to trade. Offers welcome. I have a wide range of interests so don't be afraid to ask.

Willing to meet from Lacey to Tacoma/Puyallup and tenino area. Roy/McKenna/Yelm preferred. Ammo and reloading equipment is available to the buyer only

The Ruger BX-25 Magazine was designed from the ground up, in-house at the Ruger factory, for flawless function and reliability in any Ruger 10/22 rifle or carbine. A rugged polymer body and follower make the magazine capable of handling prolonged use and almost any environmental condition. The steel magazine feed lips are engineered to withstand thousands of rounds without significant wear, drastically reducing ammunition feeding-related malfunctions and solving a problem that has plagued increased-capacity 10/22 magazines since their inception. The BX-25 magazine's 25-round capacity and excellent functional reliability are certain to make any trip to the range more enjoyable, with greater time spent shooting and less dedicated to clearing malfunctions and reloading.

I bought this brand new a few months back.  I don't know about anyone else but when I leave the house with the intentions of buying a gun I either come home with either a gun or a bad attitude.  That's how I got this, I couldn't find one in 9mm after searching all the gun shops so I picked it up in 40.  Well I found my 9mm today and I now have 2 of these.

There is a slight scratch on the slide that was there when I bought it.  Besides that the gun is brand new.  I finally shot it a couple weeks ago and it went bang every time I pulled the trigger.   It comes with all the Springfield goodies and 2 extra mags (5 total).

The price is $750 which is slightly less than what I paid for it and that's including the extra mags and the discount.  I also have some ammo if anyone interested. 60 rounds of JHP and 1100 factory ball.  Buyer gets first dibs but ya gotta buy it all since this is my last weapon in 40.  $380 for all the ammo.  That's $15 per box of ball and $50 for the JHP.

Firm on the price of gun and ammo unless you buy both.
