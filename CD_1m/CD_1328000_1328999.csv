I'm selling because I need to fix my car bumper. Minor collision with snow bank and curb during recent blizzard like conditions over the weekend. If your in the auto body repair business perhaps we can work out a fair trade. I don't have an estimate yet, but will soon. Then we could price match to make sure the trade is balanced for both parties.

I paid more than I'm asking for this set at Christmas time. The ranch edition is currently hard to find, and the high capacity magazines will be illegal to purchase after July 1st. Thank you Hickenpooper.

I'm not interested in trading for a beater, not at all interested in a parkerized Express or a Cruiser. Definitely NOT interested in Win 1300's. 12 or 20 gauge considered. 1100's or 930's also considered.
This 8 round pistol has a 6.5 inch ported barrel and a sweet trigger in both double and single action. As you can see, it's got a full lug barrel and a rib so you can mount a scope if desired.
There's a lot of people talking smack about Taurus, but this gun's quality is beyond reproach. It's also the most accurate .357 I've ever had the pleasure to shoot. The ported barrel really helps keep on target, and the gun is heavy enough to seriously reduce recoil.
If you want to buy it outright, it'll be $500.
I'll want a bill of sale for my own personal records only and will give you one in return."

Fired break in rounds only. Springfield XDM 5.25 Competition model pistol. This is not your standard 4.5 model. This one has many advancements such as a slide cut, 5.25"" match barrel, and adjustable fiber optic sights. I bought this brand new and decided I wanted something different. The gun shoots wonderfully and has very little recoil. It is really surprising when you pick it up and realize how light it is. It is only 1oz more than the concealed 3.8 model. Comes with 3 19rd magazines and I am adding an extra for a total of 4. Also has speed loader, holster, double magazine holster, gun lock, adjustable backstraps, extra red and green fiber optic inserts, and hogue grip. Everything in original case. VERY NICE gun. I'm not trying to make a profit, just unloading so I can get something different. SC CWP preferred or through FFL if out of state.

Do not contact me telling me you can get one for $620 new. No you can't, and if you think you can you are looking at the 4.5 model. The CHEAPEST I have seen these for is $750 new (with three magazines), and that is online which means you will have to also pay your FFL dealer a transfer fee.

It's a fully loaded 2011 Rytera Alien Nemesis by Martin archery. I've owned many bows in my live but this one shoots the best and is the best tuned bow I've ever owned. 0 recoil. almost no sound. I'll let you shoot it in the back yard before you buy it.

It's made by Martin and here is what they said:
Alien Nemesis

From the designers of the first One Cam Bow, Riser Vibration Technology, Fall-Away Rest, and Roller Cable Guard, now present the Rytera Alien Nemesis. A truly new bow design.

Our goal was to create a bow that is balanced, light weight, smooth, and fast. By asking ourselves ""what would we create if there were no limitations?"", ""what if cost and machine time were not an issue?"" So many companies extrude or forge their risers to keep machine time and cost to a minimum. By the 6th version, we have a bow that should sell for much more, but by efficiently organizing machine time and trimming profits, we can offer the Nemesis for under $800.

I do believe the Alien Nemesis has it all. A truly balanced design riser, new grip design, more arm clearance than any style riser, and vibration free when shot. The Nemesis will be available with Hybrix Hybrid Cam System or Tranz One Cam System.

We would like to thank you all for the great supports. We feel that 2010 will bring a new and truly different look and performance to the archery world.

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, a mil-spec backup sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.  $1699.  or best cash offer.

Molecular Realignment Technology 
RCA uses a proprietary thermal process
that aligns the steel's crystalline structure
to increase strength, hardness and wear properties which extends the life of the tactical component. 

Polymeric Adsorption:
We bind a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene to each part to reduce friction and improve wear.

BLACKNITRIDE℠ Processing:
Much more than typical Parkerizing, phosphating or black oxide, Blacknitriding℠ is a thermal chemical diffusion of nitrogen and carbon into the surface of the steel. Only Rubber City Armory high performance parts have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal.

This was a limited run and outfitted at the factory with the stock and fore-end.

This tactical shotgun is UNFIRED...I bought it new at Gilbert's Guns in Frankfort 2 years ago, threw it in the safe, and never shot it.

The shotgun is chambered for 2 3/4"" & 3"" 12 gauge, cylinder bore, holds 6+1 in the factory extended tube, and has sling swivels fore and aft.

The only modification is the addition of a Mesa Tactical 6-round side saddle. These are not chintzy plastic - CNC machined aircraft aluminum and very light weight / durable. Back of side saddle is rubber, so shotgun finish isn't marred. Included are the original trigger / receiver pins as the Mesa Tactical side saddle is attached through the shotgun.

I'm also including a never used shotgun scabbard. Like the shotgun, bought it new and threw it in the closet. As you can see, the 870 fits perfectly - even with a loaded side saddle. Scabbard is covered in MOLLE - attach it to anything.

All in all this is the complete 870 tactical package - 6+1 12 gauge, 6-round side saddle, and scabbard. Take on zombies, defend the fortress, shoot 3Gun Heavy Metal, whatever.

I have the black version that comes with two 8 round magazines. This is an awesome semi-automatic rifle that can literally be taken with you anywhere in a bag the size of a purse or any backpack.

Yes, i know what the retail value is...but good luck finding this firearm at that price even in good times.  Back in November I even had a hard time finding it.  I think they showed back up on shelves because people's priorities ""shifted"" quite a bit.  But this is a hell of a package at a hell of a price @ $300 plain and simple.

You may think the Feinstein Ban is dead...and it is (now), but do not underestimate their will to start banning certain types of firearms soon.  Takedown firearms like this, which can be fit into a tiny package, then quickly assembled into a rifle WILL be a target for obvious reasons.  Even though it's a .22, you saw the idiots holding up that crappy .22 caliber MP5 look-a-like with a fake suppressor during the whole FSU scare just this past month because it ""looks"" like the (already illegal) MP5 so-called ""assault"" rifle.

What? I should keep describing what I have?

Remington M887 Nitro Mag Tactical with: ($610)
80 rounds of 00 buckshot.
50 game loads #6 shot. (All ammo for $85)
5 round buttstock sleeve. ($15)
Tactical spiked choke. (Came with the gun)
TLR-1 tac light (not pictured). ($160, at lowest)
But I'm not asking the $870 that all of that would cost brand new, even though the shotgun is unfired.
I'm asking for $780 cash or trade value. Giving you the gun and accessories for exactly what you'd pay for them new, but throwing in the ammo free.

All to give you a great setup for home defense. 7+1 capability, can fire shells from 2-3/4 to 3-1/2.
___
Bersa Thunder .380 ($295 on Impactguns, with $40 ship to FFL)
Total of 2x7 round magazines, one in addition to what came with the gun. ($31 online, plus $12 shipping)
$378 seems like a fairly high price for this gun being a few years old, and without ammo, so I think $310 cash or trade value would be better.

For both, I'm hoping for a cash or trade value of $1,075, which can be negotiable, to some extent.

I'm always on the lookout for good deals on ammo and accessories, so I may be adding more to what I have.

I have no need to sell, so trade is preffered.
I got both guns to expiriment, and I personally prefer my compact 9mm, and my 1911 to these great guns for the roles they fill."

I recently had this gun completely gunsmithed, and every area of the pistol has received attention. 

- Frame, receiver and barrel have been refinished with baked-on DuPont Teflon black coating. 
- All of the internals (trigger, hammer, sear, disconnector) have been replaced with brand-new stainless steel internals from a MK II. 
- All pins and springs have been replaced. 
- The bolt has been jeweled 360 degrees. 
- New firing pin, firing pin spring, extractor, extractor plunger, and extractor spring installed.
- I had a custom bolt assist handle made and installed on the back of the bolt - makes cocking this pistol much easier. 
- Lyman precision bead from sight - perfectly sighted. 

The sear, hammer, and disconnector have been honed to give a very crisp 3.5-pound trigger pull. This gun is cherry, the nicest MK I you will find short of an unfired factory original. I recently ran 300 rounds through it without a single problem, and the gun happily shoots many types of ammo (Wal-mart bulk through CCI Stinger). It would cost you $800 to build this gun yourself. 
   I'm selling it because, although I love my Ruger MK-series pistols, I have several and would like to move on to something different. My favorite calibers are .22 LR, .22 WMR,  .357 Mag, and .45 ACP, and I would be interested in many handguns or carbines in those calibers. Specific guns I am looking for are (can add cash for some trades):
- EAA/Tanfoglio/IWI Witness/Baby Eagle in .45 ACP
- Glock 30s
- .357 snubby revolver for CCW 
- HK USP 45
- S&W M&P .45 or .22 LR
- ISSC M22 .22 LR
- Stainless/Nickel 12-gauge pump shotgun

I'm also interested in many types of .22 LR handguns - a nice revolver or auto (High Standard, S&W, etc). I have a rather eclectic taste in handguns, so please send me your trades and I will respond in a timely manner."

The bass has been professionally set up and sounds great. I purchased it a long time ago with the intention of learning to play, but learned very quickly that I have practically no musical talent. It mostly sat in my closet, though I did loan it to friends on occasion. Has been played very little, but has a little bit of wear on it from being moved around. I recently had a friend in a local band set it up and try to sell it for me, but didn't get many offers. Pictures may be added later, or can be provided upon request.
