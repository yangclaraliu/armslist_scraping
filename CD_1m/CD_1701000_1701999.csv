Also comes with aftermarket gun case.

The Smith & Wesson Model 457 is a compact semi-automatic pistol from Smith & Wesson's metal frame series of handguns. The 457 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. The 457 is a traditional double-action pistol, meaning that the first shot is fired in double-action mode and the following shots are fired in single-action mode. The 457 has a 3.75-inch barrel and 7-round magazine capacity.

The compact design of the pistol makes it ideal for concealed carry. There is no spur on the hammer, thereby reducing the risk of being caught on clothing during unholstering."

This rifle was not a wall peice, it did not sit in a closet collecting dust/rust. this
rifle has been used. Don't know round count, but rifle functions nearly flawlessly. I've had few stoppages when I was breaking the rifle in and with some cheap ammo, as is expected, but for the most part it will handle anything you throw at it.. There are some scratches/blemishes on the rifle as it was a fighting rifle, but again functions great! Can personally vouch for POF-USA stress test, rifle will work in ALL conditions. This rifle has been and should continue to be used as a fighting tool. Not for someone who just wants to shoot cans every once in a while, it will obviously do it, but has so much more potential. Please only serious offers. Trade is only secondary to selling. I know what the rifle is worth, no low ballers! Please contact me if you want detailed pictures. REDACTED"

Comes with one - 35rd mag.  The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army.  

The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG).  The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42.  The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43.  This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946).  The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied.  This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position.  The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard.  The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel.  The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type.  The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake.  

This firearm is an ATF approved pistol.  The stock is permanently fixed in its folded position, and until Washington state laws change about SBR's it must stay that way

I have four available currently. All are built right here in Fort Collins exclusively from American materials. IWB clips are made from spring steel, OWB loops are shaped from .125 Kydex for extra durability. All screws are steel for far superior durability over aluminum screws. Each model provides tight retention through the definition of the gun in the holster, and makes a distinctively audible snap when drawn and re-holstered at normal speeds. These models are compatible with Glock models 17, 19, 22, 23, 26, and 27. 

Type A: compact IWB/OWB convertible design for everyday concealed/open carry use. Low profile emphasizes comfort and concealment, elevated outside edge greatly assists re-holstering, especially when carrying IWB. Ejection port and extractor areas are relieved out to reduce wear on the firearms finish. Includes IWB clips, OWB loops and 4 each - Male Phillips screws, Female slotted screws, and spacers. One black, no shirt guard, $45. Two gray with medium shirt guard, $50

Type B: pictured bottom left. IWB only, designed specifically for deep concealment. Extremely compact design is the size of an average hand, yet is designed to carry a full-sized gun. Fully ambidextrous, all hardware can be mounted on either side, and the shirt guard protects both sides of the weapon. Ejection port and extractor areas relieved out to reduce wear on the firearm. Includes IWB clips and 2 each - Male Phillips screws, Female slotted screws, and spacers. $45 

Light mounted holster pictured center is my EDC and not for sale. Light Mounted Type-C holsters will be available for sale soon in a more compact design than pictured. 

All are backed with a lifetime ""No-Bullshit"" warranty. I will not sell anything I would not carry with myself, carry with confidence and comfort with a Lyon Defensive Concealment holster. Unique compact designs specifically for every day carry use for half the price of online manufacturers without several month waits and far better than anything locally available.

This rifle uses the original Polish military chrome lined barrel and overall finish is the correct photphate gray used by the Polish military. Opportunities like this are few and far between these days.

This rifle is very accurate and the iron sights are well regulated.  Targets were easy to hit out to 200 yards.

I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only (shipping charge and FFL Fees, when applicable, are additional). All firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP. Overkill yes, but that's how I roll.

In addition, the V-RS can be accessorized with short and/or full length Picatinny rail tracks or fitted with full length smooth “bumpers” that provide an ergonomically contoured handguard. The V-RS is designed for fast configuration changes and easy modification to the platform, as the user’s accessory needs evolve or change.

The Webley Mark VI has been rechambered to fire 45 ACP using moon clips.  The Webley Mark IV uses the less common but still available and easily reloadable 38 S&W.  This pair is not easy to find anymore.  Finish and grip wear are a given with the pistols being shy of 80 and 100 years old, respectively.  No rust, strong cylinder lockup, good action, great shooters.  Each revolver has all matching numbers.  One of them has wear on the grip where it used to say ""Webley,"" and the other has a small chip on the butt area of the grip. 

Asking $999 for this pair of relatively rare World War I and II revolvers.

Face to face transaction in Waco area preferred.  I do travel some to other cities and could consider meeting outside of central Texas if it fits my schedule.  The usual rules of bill of sale and Texas residents of legal age and status to own firearms apply.

From Wikipedia:

The Webley Revolver (also known as the Webley Break-Top Revolver or Webley Self-Extracting Revolver) was, in various marks , the standard issue service pistol for the armed forces of the United Kingdom, the British Empire , and the Commonwealth from 1887 until 1963.

The Webley is a top-break revolver with automatic extraction. That is, breaking the revolver open for reloading also operates the extractor . This removes the spent cartridges from the cylinder .

Mk VI: Similar to the Mk V, but with a squared-off ""target"" style grip (as opposed to the ""bird's-beak"" style found on earlier marks and models) and a 6-inch (150 mm) barrel. Officially adopted 24 May 1915, [23] and also manufactured by RSAF Enfield under the designation Pistol, Revolver, Webley, No. 1 Mk VI from 1921–1926.

Mk IV: At the end of the First World War, the British military decided that the .455 calibre gun and cartridge was too large for modern military use and—after numerous tests and extensive trials—that a pistol in .38 calibre firing a 200-grain (13 g) bullet would be just as effective as the .455 for stopping an enemy. [25]

Webley & Scott immediately tendered the .38/200 calibre Webley Mk IV revolver, which as well as being nearly identical in appearance to the .455 calibre Mk VI revolver (albeit scaled down for the smaller cartridge), was based on their .38 calibre Webley Mk III pistol, designed for the police and civilian markets. Much to their surprise, the British Government took the design to the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock , which came up with a revolver that was externally very similar looking to the .38/200 calibre Webley Mk IV, but was internally different enough that no parts from the Webley could be used in the Enfield and vice-versa. The Enfield-designed pistol was quickly accepted under the designation Revolver, No. 2 Mk I , and was adopted in 1932, followed in 1938 by the Mk I* (spurless hammer, double action only) and finally the Mk I** (simplified for wartime production) in 1942.

Webley & Scott sued the British Government over the incident, claiming £2250 as ""costs involved in the research and design"" of the revolver. This was contested by RSAF Enfield, which quite firmly stated that the Enfield No. 2 Mk I was designed by Captain Boys (the Assistant Superintendent of Design, later of Boys Anti-Tank Rifle fame) with assistance from Webley & Scott, and not the other way around. Accordingly, their claim was denied. By way of compensation, the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors eventually awarded Webley & Scott £1250 for their work.

RSAF Enfield proved unable to manufacture enough No. 2 revolvers to meet the military's wartime demands, and as a result Webley's Mk IV was also widely used within the British Army in World War Two."

These people are the largest reason that ammo is so difficult to find right now. They go down to the store at 6am, buy every single box they can (even if they have a 1 box limit. These people are scammers, they know how to get around it.) then immediately come onto Armslist, and sell it foe $50 a box. This is truly disgusting that people do this. I understand that everyone wants to try and turn a quick buck now and again, but the way this is going has got to stop. This hobby is a truly wonderful one, but we need to support each other during this shortage. We cannot support these people and their practices.

Go on Gunbroker and you'll see this is pretty average pricing. I just don't plan on using them much.  

Possible trades:  Let me know what you have. Ammo is good - .380, .45, 7.62x39, 7.62x25, .45 LC, mag holster or shoulder holster for a 1911, holster for Ruger LCP, accessories for SKS, etc. Just let me know what you have.

The cylinder spins freely when closed. I admit part of the blame lies with myself. I should've learned how to check for these things before I went to buy a revolver. But the fact of the matter is he sold me a non-functioning weapon. I've attempted to contact him several times to tell him it is broken, and he insists it is not. Then he blocked me from his email. I took it to a gunsmith today and he told me it IS broken. I don't even want my money back. I just want the $50 to send it to Rossi for repairs, but he never gave me the chance to tell him that. I've never had to blast someone on Armslist like this, and I don't like doing it now. But people need to be warned. DO NOT LET THIS MAN SELL YOU A NON-FUNCTIONING FIREARM!!"

We specialize in custom-built AR platform carbines, and keep only a small collection of used firearms on hand. Being a secondary part of the business, we don't rely on volume. Simply put, we take in only what we want to, and I personally put rounds through every weapon before it goes on the shelf. Aside from insuring proper function... that's half the fun in doing this crap!  :)

We specialize in custom-built AR platform carbines, and keep only a small collection of pistols, etc on hand. Being a secondary part of the business, we don't rely on volume. Simply put, we take in only what we want to, and I personally put rounds through every weapon before it goes on the shelf. Aside from insuring proper function... that's half the fun in doing this crap!  :)

Pre war models were of better build quality than the early war rifles, as the Russians were getting pressed hard by German forces outside the gaits of Moscow.
This also is a much more sought after “Hex Receiver”. All serial numbers (except bayonet) on the rifle “match” and are NOT force matched... Serial # 53057.
