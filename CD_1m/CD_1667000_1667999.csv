No rust, pits, or scratches.

When I purchased it I installed a picatinny rail to accept a new red dot optic and upgraded the pistol grip with an ergonomic finger grooved grip that is much more comfortable in the hand. It has been well maintained and made a nice addition to my collection. It comes with everything you see in the pictures which includes the rifle, optic, 3 metal factory magazines, and 270 rounds of 7.62x39 ammunition.

I am forced to sell this little gem to pay for moving expenses for me and my family. Otherwise I would have loved to keep it.

Selling a 1972 Model 36 Chief's Special J-Frame. If you have ever owned or shot one of these then you can appreciate just why they have the excellent reputation that they do (slender, easy to conceal, etc.). 
What has basically been done was remove and bob the hammer using a lathe and followed it up to achieve a nice ultra-smooth surface with a rubber wheel. 
It has been completely disassembled and taken down to bare metal via a media blaster (Aluminum Oxide). Then re-blued all the components and reassembled. 
It shoots great and the action is pure Smith and Wesson. Everything locks up tight and is true. It may not be the prettiest around but on the inside it is all clean clear and true!"

THE WHITE HOUSE EMAIL  




Thank you for taking the time to write.  I have heard from many Americans regarding firearms policy and gun violence in our Nation, and I appreciate your perspective.  From Aurora to Newtown to the streets of Chicago, we have seen the devastating effects gun violence has on our American family.  I join countless others in grieving for all those whose lives have been taken too soon by gun violence.

Like the majority of Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms.  In this country, we have a strong tradition of gun ownership that has been handed down from generation to generation.  Hunting and sport shooting are part of our national heritage.  Yet, even as we acknowledge that almost all gun owners in America are responsible, when we look at the devastation caused by gun violence—whether in high-profile tragedies or the daily heartbreak that plagues our cities—we must ask ourselves whether we are doing enough.

While reducing gun violence is a complicated challenge, protecting our children from harm should not be a divisive one.  Most gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.  Most also agree that if we took commonsense steps to curtail gun violence, there would be fewer atrocities like the one that occurred in Newtown.  We will not be able to stop every violent act, but if there is even one thing we can do to reduce gun violence—if even one life can be saved—then we have an obligation to try.

That is why I asked Vice President Joe Biden to identify concrete steps we can take to keep our children safe, help prevent mass shootings, and reduce the broader epidemic of gun violence in this country.  He met with over 200 groups representing a broad cross-section of Americans and heard their best ideas.  I have put forward a specific set of proposals based off of his efforts, and in the days ahead, I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality.

My plan gives law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals, and the public health community some of the tools they need to help reduce gun violence.  These tools include strengthening the background check system, helping schools hire more resource officers and counselors and develop emergency preparedness plans, and ensuring mental health professionals know their options for reporting threats of violence.  And I directed the Centers for Disease Control to study the best ways to reduce gun violence—because it is critical that we understand the science behind this public health crisis.  From improving mental health services to looking more closely at a culture that too often glorifies violence, we must leave no stone unturned when working to keep Americans safe.

As important as these steps are, they are not a substitute for action from Congress.  To make a real and lasting difference, members of Congress must also act.  As part of my comprehensive plan, I have called on them to pass some specific proposals right away.  First, it is time to require a universal background check for anyone trying to buy a gun.  Second, Congress should renew the 10-round limit on magazines and reinstate and strengthen the assault weapons ban.  We should get tougher on those who buy guns with the purpose of selling them to criminals, and we should impose serious punishments on anyone who helps them do this.

These are reasonable, commonsense measures that have the support of the majority of the American people.  But change will not come unless the American people demand it from their lawmakers.  Now is the time to do the right thing for our children, our communities, and the country we love.  We owe the victims of heartbreaking national tragedies and the countless unheralded tragedies each year nothing less than our best effort—to seek consensus in order to save lives and ensure a brighter future for our children.

Thank you, again, for writing.  I encourage you to visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/NowIsTheTime to learn more about my Administration’s approach.

Sincerely,

Barack Obama"

 I am at $707 on her right now. Only getting rid of it because I hurt myself and wont be able to shoot something this big for a while, so i figured another carry pistol is in order.
 Here is video of clone sight in action on an AR, they are very solid. This is another one. The one on shotgun is brand new. Just like them alot. Basically got kroger corn instead of delmonte if you understand what I mean by that. Not to mention price is 3 to 1.  If not, Eotech hood and battery compartment both fit on here exactly.
Good video, she handles AR like a pro!!!

first is a AR15, its a RRA lower with magpul badlever and pistol grip.
upper was a unfired S&W sport upper, however had the upper receiver switched to one with dust cover and forward assist capabilities.
have not gotten the dust cover or forward assist for it yet. the resy of the upper arts are S&W, bolt,barrel, ect ect
The upper reciever is unfired. lower has a few hundred rounds through it from a different upper.
Gun is complete and functional except for the dust cover and forward assist that still need installed [very simple to do]
comes with 4 magazines, 1 pmag and 3 BCM mags.
Surefire 6P in a vtac mount, forward grip [not pictures. standard plastic mil style forward grip]


next is a Springfield stainless Mil spec, has about 200 rounds through it. took the first two notches off the spur hammer to prevent slide bite and it has not bitten me since.
everything else on the pistol is stock,
It comes with extra 18.5 wolff recoil spring.
7 magazines
crossbreed holster and double mag carrier
also have a galco leather holster for it if wanted.
3 sets of grips, black [pictured], stock wood grips and double diamond wood grips.
Box ect ect
This pistol was 100% for those 200 rounds fired.
does have slight handling marks and an idiot scratch most of which will polish out but have not cared enough to do it.


Looking for a pair of cz readheads or similar O/U shotguns.
Ideally I would like a readhead deluxe reduced length in 20 ga with 24 in barrels
And a redhead deluxe 12ga with 26 or 28 inch barrels.
Would also be interested in other O/U shotguns in the same price/quality range in similar set ups.

Would like to keep this within florida but may ship for right deal.

I don't care for tip off style scope rings so I installed the Weaver style adapter, which is much more durable and stable than ordinary tip off 3/8"" rings, and it looks cool too. Comes with a factory 10 round stainless steel magazine. The Simmons scope is the current production model that I bought new the same time I bought the rifle and it has great optics with an adjustable objective lens and can focused from 10 yds to infinity for precision shooting; all the controls are smooth and correct in operation and it has the European style fast focus eyepeice, a great and very useful feature. Simmons makes a great product and is probably the best scope on the market for the money. The scope is zeroed in nice and tight; you may need to make minor adjustments to account for the difference in our eyes. I bought this rifle new a year ago, mounted and zeroed the scope, then cleaned it and put it in my safe where it has sat untouched until today; it is in As New Condition and is flawless, there is not a mark on it anywhere, I have fired less than one box of ammo thru it. It is a safe queen that I will never use, maybe you will. I will also include at no additional cost a 100 rd box of CCI Mini Mag High Velocity 36 grain Jacketed Hollow Point ammo. This rifle is ready to go have some fun with and needs nothing but a new owner. This rifle is very accurate, I zeroed it at 25 yards and it produced a group that was one ragged hole; it easily bested my Ruger 10/22 that I was zeroing at the same time. Buyer must be legal Maryland resident or active duty military stationed in Maryland. I will meet buyer at a public place half way between us during daylight hours for a cash and carry FTF exchange. I am not interested in counter offers or trades and I will not ship out of state. thanks for looking, pls email with any questions."

I'm looking at lightening the load in the gun safe and getting some cash for a couple NFA toys. This gun has been nothing but reliable every time every time I've taken it to the range. Arsenal is a top build and this is no exception. This rifle has been diligently cleaned after each use with all salts rinsed and metal promptly oiled. 

The only issue I've had with the rifle since getting it is with the muzzle brake. I got it turned 180 degrees to take it off, but couldn't move it beyond that. Arsenal has some notoriously difficult to remove muzzle brakes according to what I found online and I can't get it off in my apartment without a vice or heat gun or something. Maybe someone with a bit more muscle and a garage can get it off if they want, just an FYI. Doesn't affect function of the firearm in any way.

USP
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

Features:
2-12rd 45acp magazine
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release

PTR-91 .308/7.62mm Battle Rifle (In hard case) These rifles aren't copied off old blueprints brought over from Germany. They are built using the original machinery itself, shipped across the Atlantic, and set up here in the states. The result is a German-engineered, US-manufactured, true continuation of the much feared and equally respected G3/HK91 .308 battle rifle.

THE BARREL

On some rifles a barrel is a barrel. The 18"" original HK-profile barrel that makes up the heart of this weapon system is the real standout here.

Years ago, internal decision-making originally led PTR to craft barrels with a low flute count. They worked beautifully, but led to reliability and feeding issues with anything other than high-quality, high-powered hunting ammunition. This did not sit well with a loyal community of shooters.

But, PTR listened, and responded. Starting off at six, they eventually went to eight flutes, ten flutes, up to eleven, and finally, as with this particular rifle right here, the original Heckler and Koch German design that made the weapon one of the most popular, reliable and deadly battle rifles across the globe-- twelve flutes. Eleven is good. Twelve is perfect. Want to hunt? Load up some primo hunting ammo and have at it. Want to plink? Sight in? Just test out some groups? Grab whatever is in reach.

This twelve-flute barrel will let you run everything from commie steel case to classy brass, .308 or 7.62, from DAG to Spanish to South African milsurp and whatever you find in between. That is the real selling point of this rifle: The world's ammo is your ammo. And with 18"" of delivery service slinging it, you will hard-hit and destroy your target, every target, every time.

**For disclosure purposes, this weapon has precisely 120 rounds through it, used for sighting in and more importantly, measuring bolt gap. Rifle is healthily broken in, bolt gap is good to go. Weapon has the most minimal of ding or abrasion marks. Excellent condition. Mags in excellent condition as well. Rifle ships scrubbed clean and oiled. Of the 120 rounds fired, ZERO malfunctions were recorded across Wolf, Brown Bear lacquered, Winchester, and Remington.


THE RIG

Custom-built, this is a vehicle-operator's chest rig, .308 8-mag center combat load. PALS webbing covers this thing, so your further attachment point customization options are almost unlimited. Pouches, holsters, misc. gear... tailor this rig to meet your mission requirements.

I have an M249 drum/mag dump pouch installed on the right side and a padded general purpose pouch on the left. There is also a massive, flat, deep pocket that lines the entire base of the rig. I've managed to fit entire tool kits, full size rifle cleaning cleaning pad and kits, solvent sprays, and cleaning rod sets in this thing--all at once. The best part is it would take a chainsaw to cut through the construction. It is custom-built for combat and these rigs are used by troops in Afghanistan for a reason. It features a very comfortable padded cross-back design across the back, giving your skin some breathing room, and some more maneuverability. The shoulder straps and backstrap are fully adjustable. Small or tall, this rig will fit you like a body glove when you are done with config.

One thing I personally figured out that wasn't originally advertised with this build when I ordered it: you can convert the mag loadout to four (4) mags (comparison between single and double-stack shown in pics). Let no one ever tell you that 160 rounds of .308 isn't heavy. If you're running a light mission, re-design the velcro/snap retention system on the fly and lighten your load. Eyes, ears, shotgun ammo, pistol mags, tool kits can all be carried in this rig at once, giving the wearer the ability to meet and complete any mission requirements before him"
