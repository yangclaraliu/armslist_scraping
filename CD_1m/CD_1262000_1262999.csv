Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. 

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

If you are looking at Sigs, you already know this weapon is known for ""hell and back reliability.""  It's the weapon of choice for the Secret Service, many police agencies, and if you are a television fan also NCIS.

American Tactical's state of the art polymer AR 15 lower receiver with a CORE 15 lower parts kit and a DPMS 6 position CAR stock. I've built several of these and have been impressed with the fit of the LPK's and overall finish. The trigger is also fairly nice and smooth for a stock trigger set. Feels much better than the PSA LPK kit I just installed in another lower. Has about a 5 1/2 lb. trgigger pull.

If you have your own stock I'll remove this one and take $70.00 off
for a total of $200.00. (Stock consist of stock,buffer, tube, spring, end plate and castle nut). Also willing to sell the lower stripped for $115.00.

This lower has been test fired and has about 10 rounds through it. Had a guy tell me they wouldn't work with a CMMG dedicated 22 upper.  Worked and functioned very well.

This revolver comes with the 2.5"" barrel only and is in nice condition showing some holster ware on the cylinder and corners of the frame.   The barrel bore is in as new condition.  The DW model 12 was produced in 1970 and 71 and had the ""pork chop"" style barrel shroud and external barrel nut and this makes barrel changes very easy and can be done in less than 5 minutes.  The frame on this revolver looks like it could be for a .44 magnum (it's beefy)!  Barrels are still available if you want to look for them.  This frame converts to a 4"", 6"" or even an 8"" barrel.  The original wood grips are long gone as is the original box and paperwork.  The rubber Pachmayr grips along with its weight make this a very easy to shoot pistol.  The rear sights are adjustable for elevation and windage.  These revolvers are long out of production but you can get one here!!  

I would be interested in a compact revolver that my wife can shoot.  2"" to 2.5"" revolvers only with a light frame that will shoot .38 caliber.  This pistol is too large for my wife to carry. I'll look at small pistol trades and will add cash if needed.  The out-right cash price for this pistol is $350.00.  This is the ultimate ""Truck Gun"" becuase of how beefy it is!  Send me an email with your contact information and I'll get back with you.  Must be 21 and have a valid NM Driver's License.  Face-to-Face in Albuquerque is how I prefer to proceed.  If you want this pistol shipped you are responsible for all FFL fees on both ends and the shipping and insurance.  Thanks for looking"

pretty standard for accurized weapons, weapons that shoot less than a
minute of angle (MOA).  It has a trigger job to die for (no pun

surprised when the ""hammer drops"" so you don't flinch or ""pull"" when
firing.  It has a custom made walnut stock that is both beautiful and
designed for perfect ergonomics for the right shot.  Mauser actions
are the desired system for long sniper shots due to its simplicity and
accuracy (it holds three plus one rounds in the well)."
