These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

What separates this from the others I am seeing is the fact that it comes with all the original equipment. I live near the Chesterfield Airport and can meet you anywhere around there. All the typical stuff applies. I will want to see and record your license and Concealed Carry permit. The permit is the surefire way to know I'm not selling to someone that shouldn't have a firearm."

We all love you buddy. You're a great guy, and we thank you for your service. But whatever post you are replying to is just some guy saying he has a new gun. YES, all guns get tests fired, so in theory, there is no such thing as a new gun unless you steal one off the assembly line, or make your own. No need to be a BB buster. Yes, people buy And sell guns in the hope of turning a buck, or many, in this poor economy. To each their own. Either a gun has been used, or it's just the same as they bought it. What is the big difference, other than just stirring the pot? Is a seldom fired cheap weapon better than an often fired top notch weapon? That's for the seller and buyer to decide. Stop grinding your ax for no gain. We know you know guns, and nobody faults you for your knowledge, or your self driven purpose, but let the chips fall where they may without trying to play referee.

The sights are tritium but glow very faintly, so I painted over them with white paint.Since it was an issued weapon there is some finish wear, but this doesn't affect anything. In fact I think it gives the gun some character. This gun was made in 1996 so it avoids the problems that some newer post-2004 Sigs have with QC. It was made at a time when Sig made nothing but the best. I carry this gun every day and trust my life to it.

I have looked up the 788s and it looks like they bring between $400-$550, so I am looking for a trade or sale around the $450 mark, which is a great deal for this rifle.

I have $695.00 in it.  Henry Golden Boy (.22 lever action rifle) NEW IN BOX, comes with Brass Buttplate, Brass Receiver and the optional and coveted Brass Barrel-Band; also has the preferred Octagon Barrel with the gold engraving on both sides. It also will come with the Henry Model Cantilever scope mount. Henry doesn't drill and tap nor cut scope grooves, in the brass receiver of the Golden Boy, so they make and sell their own scope mount just for this rifle. The scope mount attaches to the top of the barrel by removing the rear site and bolting scope mount to top of barrel. It's all new, it's all Henry. I intended on putting a scope on here, that's why I ordered their scope mount. I went through some pictures of Henry Golden Boys with scopes and found the scope that looks great on this cowboy rifle...it looks right- so I ordered it. It will likely be here after the rifle is sold. I'll put it on something else I guess. The wood is very dark and is beautiful. I have the regular Henry, the ""blued"" .22 lever rifle; the wood on this Golden model is so much nicer. I have never had anything like this rifle; the lever action is smooth like butter, the brass gleams all over like it's made of gold...it will be hard for someone to shoot it because it is so incredible looking. It came with a velvet ""sock"" wrapped around the brass receiver, Henry shipped it that way. It's a piece of art. It's not cheap, but there's nothing else like it.
I've got $695.00 in it, total... which is a lot, but it is very hard to find one of these. Henry Manufacturing experienced a Hurricane and then a fire at the plant and production halted. Henry .22's are hard to get. But either way, I drove for a 5 hour round trip to get this one. Then studied the ""scoped Golden Boy"" pictures...picke dout a scope and ordered the scope mount from Henry. All total I've spent 695.00, I need 600.00 of it back or I won't sell it. I Can't believe I'm selling it, but I have to have the money. But I won't give it away. The pictures are with the Henry scope mount installed. You can see how it sits over top the receiver without touching the receiver. It's ready for a scope. The Henry box for the mount is in the picture too. I will take it off if you want...and put the site back on if you like. Or leave it the way it is and give you the rear site in a ziplock. However. Email if you want 10 or so more pictures.
The pics don't do the brass justice...not at all. It's perfect. I'll also give you 200 rounds of ammo just in case you have none."

sporty toyota celica. good mileage: 158K. priced to sell, cash only. this is a solid car you can buy and drive today. available to test drive and buy after 5 pm daily. 

no outer damage. tires have good life left in them. has the SLIDING SUNROOF! automatic transmission. 

i finally saved enough to buy a car i wanted more so that 's why i'm selling. this is a solid, reliable vehicle and i have kept up all the maintenance. in the last year i have had all of the following done in addition to regular oil/fluids:
replaced both front CV joint/axl assemblies
replaced both front break rotors and fresh pads in the last 2K miles


full disclosure:
vehicle has a stamped title. 
drivers seat is broken and the back rest only goes so far forward. i drove it 3 years like this and it wasn't a big enough deal for me to have it fixed. 
antenna motor is broken and antenna is currently in the UP position. took it though a car wash so it has a slight bend to it. still works great.
this was a smoking vehicle. it's been cleaned and fa-breezed and is decent. if you're touchy about such things, i want to be upfront so we don't have the issue of getting together and you have an asthma attach during the test drive.

In case you're not familiar, this rifle is based on the Pre-64 Winchester model 70 action, which is generally held by real shooters to be one of the finest rifle bolt actions ever made. It's rock-solid and designed to outlast me, you, and your kids. :)

Hogue fully overmolded stock with a solid aluminum bedding block/pillar system, free floating the barrel.

The scope is a cheap NCStar, but it's VERY high powered (10-40x!) and worked well the day I tried it out.

It includes a Harris-type bipod (not sure of brand, may be a Harris, not sure) and a really nice padded tactical (shock) sling.

The metal has been Duracoated in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) inside and out to protect from the elements, should you decide you need to shoot in foul weather.

This is an extremely rare rifle. There is exactly 1 like it for sale on gunbroker, and none that I can find on Armslist, if that tells you anything.

I've only had it to the range once (got it in trade a while back), but it shot just over 1 MOA with cheap steel case FMJ ammo at 200 yards in a nasty gusting crosswind. All the reviews and range reports I've found say that it's easily sub-MOA with decent ammo. I have no reason to doubt it.

The previous owner told me he had some bolt work done to it, so it's supposed to be slicker than stock. I don't have anything to compare it to, but the action is very smooth.

The trigger is adjustable. I'm not sure how it's set at the moment, but my ""finger scale"" says it feels like around 3.5 lbs with very little travel, so I'm happy.

I'm not really looking to trade, since that would defeat the purpose of ""getting rid of a few guns"", but you're welcome to offer if you have something you think I might like."

I have 1200 rounds of PMC X-Tax 55 Gr. FMJ XP193 Ammo in 20 round boxes (actually 1199, one box is missing a round, but will replace with a federal XM193 round or 2 steel case 223 rounds, buyers choice). This is 5.56 ammo. Ammo is brand new, bought within last 6 months, but some of the boxes have some creases or bends from when they were shipped to me. Trying to raise funds new handgun or rifle.

Ammo is supposed to be just like Federal M193 55 grain ammo. Don't know if that is true, but I do know the rounds sure look pretty good. Shiny and clean. 

If you want, the specs are here. http://www.luckygunner.com/5-56x45-55-gr-fmj-xp193-pmc-1000-rounds

Would like to sell in 300 round blocks/minimum. Seeing the only places online that have it in stock are selling it at 0.85-1.00 round plus ship, I think $220/300 rounds ( $0.73/round) would be fair pricing.  Would also consider straight trade for the whole lot for an quality AK74 rifle or partial lot trade for pistols (leaning toward M&P 45, M&P 22, ruger 22 pistol). Will be also linking this ad with some of my other ammo I plan to put on sale so maybe a deal can be struck with those as well. 

Pick up or can ship but buyer would need to pay for shipping. Cannot ship where not legal to own this ammo. Cash for pick up, but if shipping I can take paypal (plus the fees)."

I am relisting this due to an individual that wanted to trade but did not actually have the firearms in his possession. If you are going to trade, have what you said you have in your possession!!!

Anyone can own a suppressor that can legally buy or own a firearm. I am selling this upper as an individual and it does not need to go through a Class III SOT or dealer. Anyone can sell their Class III to another individual. We will need to fill out a Form 4 together and then you will need to send in your check for $200 to the BATF to transfer it into your name.

For sale is my used 9mm Gemtech Talon Upper Receiver with Gemtech Trinity Suppressor ready to mount on your registered SBR or pistol lower. Included is everything you need minus the lower and ammunition. It has the bolt, charging handle, mag block and 5 32 round magazines. I will also throw in a LID for use on a ½ x 28 threaded barrel. This set-up is lightly used and the BUIS sights are included also.

I am asking $1600 obo for everything and will not separate the upper and suppressor. The pictures made it look foggy on the parts but everything is clean with very little wear. I can send better pictures from my camera rather than my phone. 

I am located in Johnson County, Kansas and will not ship. Kansas residents ONLY!!!

I am open to trades of equal value but cash is king. These were hard to get even before the mass shooting so get one while you still can."

Many state police and agencies have switched or are switching to this model for the stopping power of a .45 but the light weight, accuracy, and manageable recoil of a 9mm.  This gun was built for thousands of rounds with an indestructable frame and internal mechanism.  It is the same size as the Glock 17 and 22 but packs a lot more punch.

I have 4 boxes of Federal 22 LR ammo, 525 rounds/box. 

Trying to find what they are selling for online, I realized it is impossible to find any in stock to compare prices to come up with with fair market price, so I'll start at $60/box or all 4 at $240 and I can throw in a ammo can.

I know that is higher than when they were plentiful, but today it is impossible to find and if you need some today I have it to sell. 

Would consider packaging a trade toward a quality AK74 rifle or for pistols (leaning toward M&P 45 and or M&P 22), obviously with cash added from me. Will be also linking this ad with some of my other ammo and/ firearms I plan to put on sale so maybe a deal can be struck with those as well.

I AM NOT THE ONE THAT THIS HAPPENED TO, I AM REPOSTING THIS SO THAT EVERYONE SEES IT! IT WAS ORIGINALLY POSTED EARLIER BY SOMEONE IN THE RIFLE SECTION. KEEP THIS GOING AROUND, EMAIL YOUR FRIENDS. BE AWARE THAT THE LOCAL MEDIA IS AGAINST US!!!! WATCH YOURSELVES AN MAKE SURE YOU ARE TRADING, BUYING, AND SELLING LEGALLY.
THEY SHOULD BE REPORTED TO AUTHORITIES FOR ATTEMPTING TO ILLEGALLY PURCHASE FIREARMS AND MAGAZINES


Be aware that Julie Hayden and Josh Bernstein are using this site to set up meetings with honest gun owners. I was almost scammed by them. Luckily I recognized Julie and told her she was attempting a straw purchase of my rifle (using her producer's money along with a fake name and address).

They went by the names Chris and Cheryl when they met with me. They tried to buy 30 round magazines just outside Denver claiming they were legal residents of Clear Creek County. They broke SEVERAL laws while trying to make ME out to be the bad guy.

Just be aware that they are out there. If anything smells funny walk away...or point out the illegality of their activities.

Exactly the same as a Mossberg 500 but with a anti rattle mechanism in the magazine too prevent jams. Gun is a bit beat up, could use wood refinished and metal reblued. Large scuffs on metal and forend on ejection side (shown in pictures). Action is tight and smooth. Bore is PERFECT. Only problem is trigger assembly is cracked. Just buy a new one and drop it in. Would be a great first duck gun or home defense shotgun with minimal work and money. Just not a Mossberg guy. $175 OBO."
