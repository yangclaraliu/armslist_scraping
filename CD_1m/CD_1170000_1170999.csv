Israeli Military Industries is world class, military grade NATO/IDF ammo. Brass cased, boxer primed, non-corrosive, in sealed boxes from the factory. This is new ammo. The 62 versus 55 gr normally found in 223 rounds are faster and more accurate than any commercial grade you can buy. Non-lead, steel core penetrator. I've never had a failure with this, and you can tell instantly that it is more powerful from the first shot. Very cool if you shoot this side-by-side against a 55gr round.

Has two watertight storage tubes for batteries, with additional storage compartments for anything from spare parts to bore snakes. Comes with all original box, papers, magpul poster, and magpul dummy rounds

The Samozaryadnaya Vintovka Tokareva (SVT-40) was designed by Soviet Arms Designer Fedor Tokarev. It was manufactured between 1941 and 1945. The SVT-40 is an improved and simplified rifle design over the SVT-38. 
During WWII SVT-40 rifles were highly prized captures by both German and Finnish troops. Many pictures in books of German troops on the eastern front carrying the SVT-40. 
The biggest issue with the SVT 40 is the ejection of the spent casing due to improper gas cartridge adjustment and improper powder loads. DO NOT use any loads over 150 grain as this will destroy the gas chamber. Overall condition is rated as fair to good for an old surplus military rifle that will never be imported again into the USA. 10 magazine is an aftermarket so not all original.

Burris 200229 Handgun 2x 20mm Obj 21 ft @ 100 yds FOV 1"" Tube Dia Nickel Plex

Handgunning is challenging enough without having to depend on scopes that are little more than an afterthought. Burris handgun scopes are high quality, fully multi-coated optics, and the commitment of a Burris Forever Warranty make up a solid nucleus, and, as you'd expect, the line brims with innovations and firsts. Like handgun scopes with a parallax adjustment to accommodate both long-range and close quarters shooting, and the first variable handgun scope on the market. Two legendary Burris technologies are perfectly suited for the nuances of handgun shooting. Posi-Lock secures the point-of-impact in the face of abusive recoil. The high arching trajectories of many handgun calibers complicates shooting long range, unless the scope is equipped with Ballistic Plex.

It probably has @ 40 rounds through it and would grade around 97%. All Glocks will come with the cases and all but the 30 has night sights. Next I have a Colt MKIV 80 series 1911. It is beautiful and is blued with nice wood grips. It will come with 1 Wilson Combat mag but has no box. The Colt is near perfect and would grade @98%. I have a Smith and Wesson model 686 .357 cal stainless steel with 1 set of rubber molded grips and 1 set of brand new wood,grips. It is a gorgeous gun. It has been shot  and would grade at about @97%. It also will come with the factory hard case. Lastly I have a Ruger Security 6 .357 revolver stainless steel with nice wood grips and the nice Tyler grips that make it super comfortable. I think the gun has been shot but I am not certain. It is still in the factory plastic bag and has the old card board box it was bought in. Ido have a Beretta 40 cal 90two that is flawless but I am semi attached to it because it was a gift to me, but everything can be traded. I think Beretta quit making this pistol but it looks different than the 9mm 92 and the 40 cal 96. It looks better than both if you like the tactical looking firearms.

Description:

 SFMB-762-5/8-24
The advanced SureFire SFMB-762-5/8-24 muzzle brake, which fits the Armalite AR-10, DPMS LR308, and 7.62 mm rifles with 5/8-24 muzzle threads, greatly reduces both recoil impulse and muzzle rise and features neutral porting that loads bi-pod legs evenly. Its patented Impulse Diffusion design minimizes side blast and rear-directed concussion effects. The SFMB-762-5/8-24 also serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series 7.62 mm Fast-Attach® suppressors, the SOCOM762-RC model having recently won the Mk13 .300 Win-Mag sniper rifle contract award with the US Special Operations Command in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted.

Precision machined from US mill-certified heat-treated stainless steel bar stock—including high-precision single-point cut threads for optimum thread interface—the SFMB-762-5/8-24 muzzle brake is given a black Ionbond DLC coating to provide maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions and to facilitate cleaning even after extreme use.

When used in conjunction with a SOCOM Series suppressor, the patent-pending design of the SFMB-762-5/8-24 provides multiple bearing surfaces to ensure superior suppressor alignment. A rear labyrinth seal minimizes potential carbon buildup in the indexing system and facilitates suppressor removal after extended firing.

All SureFire SOCOM Series muzzle brakes have blind pilot holes at the 3 and 9 o’clock position to enable fine-tuning of recoil characteristics for individual shooting styles or ammunition characteristics. They also have blind pilot holes at the 6 o’clock position to enable indexing the adapter at bottom dead center, and to pin-and-weld on short-barreled rifles. All that is required is a basic hand drill and appropriate drill bits.

SureFire muzzle brakes are individually inspected for concentricity and alignment, and each is covered by SureFire’s No-Hassle Guarantee.

FITS: Armalite AR-10, DPMS LR308, and 7.62 rifles with 5/8-24 muzzle threads

MOUNTS: All SureFire SOCOM Series 7.62 mm /.308 caliber sound suppressors

NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors and current-model muzzle brake/suppressor adapters and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders.

Chest rig has M4 mag pouches on it and a hyrdo pouch on the back. Fully adjustable, one size fits most.

Hydration pouch. Has molle straps on the back and a Velcro tab on the top for IR patches or ID tags. 

1 Shotgun shell reload pouch. Holds up to 24 shells of 12 gauge nicely. 

1 DOD issued Kevlar helmet. Has the nice soft pads for your grape and new straps. NVG mount w/ the swing arm. Not in new condition but still well within its service life. $80

Garmen GPS. I'm told I could get 150ish on eBay but I do not have the desire to screw around with PayPal or shipping any thing. Make me an offer, I'm very reasonable so just check with me and we can talk

TLR pistol light. Mounts to weaver/picitiney rails. I ran it on my M4 before I was issued a PEQ16 and had no problems. I will toss in new battery's and let you have it for 115 obo.

Other stuff to be posted as well. I do not have SAPI plates so stop asking. I will not drive outside of Shelby or desoto county. I'm not real desperate to sell but will work a deal for you.

60 rounds fired before the magazine well decided to break on me. Magazines still lock, but the release lever needs to be rigged to keep the magazine locked solidly (to eliminate vertical play).

I have a Gen 2 Glock 23 for sale.  In the past few weeks I installed new Green F & R Tru Glo Tritium Night Sights and a plug for that hollow space behind the mag well.    It has been carried and used often and the finish shows it.   I'm not sure of the round count as I'm the second owner but I have only put about 100 rounds through it in the last 4 years.   It will come with a Galco padle holster and 3 factory ten round mags.

Comes with 31 HK 20 round magazines and 2 Cetme 20 round magazines. 9 of these magazines are still new in the wrapper. Has a low profile scope mount and uses Aimpoint 30mm quick release optic rings. The rifle operates great and the scope is zeroed in at 25-300 meters. The only issue with this rifle is the rear sight mount. It was welded on crooked and the rear sight has to be moved all the way to the right to adjust the windage. That is the reason for the installation of the Barska 4-16 power (green) lit retical optic. The rear sight and all of the parts were removed to mount the optic low. I will only meet in the local area and will not seperatly sell the magazines from the rifle.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.  This is also listed on ebay, and this listing will be deleted if/when I receive a bid on there.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

This upper is very hard to get and very popular.  Please email me with any questions.  Details are posted below.

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM™) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups or charging handles.


Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH™ series of barrels are made right here in the USA!  (Just like all the BCM products.)

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

But when the stock is SEPARATE from the gun itself, it is perfectly LEGAL to privately buy and sell. So police that dont have the balls to defend the Constitution please leave me alone, Im committing no crimes and/or future crimes by selling this item. Anyway, this is a NICE stock for any Mini-14 or Ruger collector to have, or something to hold on to and sell in the future. (The price will go up as the years go on.) Ive seen these listed on eBay with bids up to $1,500 with a few days left of bidding left on them. This is a hot item and its well worth the price, especially for all you collectors out there. I do not reccommend you put this on your weapon only because the police cannot be trusted. And I most certainly do not reccommend you shoot this at the range.

Do NOT offer me SKS's or anything bolt action unless it is a Stealth Recon Scout (SRS) rifle. I don't need anymore handguns. I am also into class IIIa vests or Israeli Military Gas masks with filters. Surprise me folks. I'm in no hurry.
