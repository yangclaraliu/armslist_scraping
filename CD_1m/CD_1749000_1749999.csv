Quality or price. These mags are known to be the best if you have not done your homework. Here is some text from magpul.

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

 Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine."

* 4 inch barrel 

* 6 round capacity 

* Wood grips 

* Fixed ramp sights 

* False hammer 

* Black frame finish 

* The Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

This has been mounted on my 308 for some time but I got a deal on a new scope so this one needs to go. Fantastic scope for Benchrest Shooting, Hunting, and long range precision.

The second rifle I am looking to trade or sell is a Marlin Model 60 with a Tasco scope. The connected tubular magazine can hold 14 rounds of .22lr.  With the additional speed loader you can reload another 14 rounds in 10 seconds. The speed loader has 8 sections each holding 14 rounds plus the original 15 (14+1) the gun holds would give you 127 rounds of plinking without making your fingers sore reloading an external magazine.

This is the all black model.  I bought this gun about a month ago and put about 40-50 rounds thru it.  Gun is like brand new never carried just one range trip and in the box.  Awesome gun to me but this was meant for my wife and she wants less recoil.  So im selling this to fund a new purchase for her. I have some ammo as well that I would be willing to sell in the package.  I have like 75 rounds of Federal 45 230 HST hollow points and about 80 rounds of walmart white box.  Im asking 
$530 for the gun and I'd let the ammo and gun go together as a package for $580.  I paid $569 for the gun plus tax $28 and $13 background = $610.00 and white box was $44.99 and HST were $35 a box X 2.  My total investment was $725.  So your basically saving $150 for a like new gun with about 40-50 rounds thru it.  $530 for the gun and $580 with the ammo included.  I will sell the ammo seperatly for $75 if interested.  No less on that.

It has had exactly 15 rounds fired. The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

UPGRADES INCLUDE

ATI tactical adujustable stock with pistol grip. (for a Home ""d"" shot gun a pistol grip WITH buttstock is better for control, its much harder for someone to wrestle this away in a struggle)

It is a ""RRA Mid-length A4 LAR-15"" to be exact. It is in awesome condition, only about 100 rounds through it, and cleaned after every range trip. These are very, very hard to find right now due to the gun craze, and most places that sell these are back-ordered for 3-12 months or more!
It has a 16"" barrel with a mid-length gas system, which gives better accuracy and lower recoil than the short-length gas systems. The barrel is chrome-moly and has a 1:9 twist. As you can see I am including a Red (or Green) Dot Sight that has 8 different reticle options. I am also including a flip-up MBUS (back up site) which is co-witnessed with the red-dot (meaning either or both could be used, they both point to my zero at 50 yards), its a really great setup for some closer-range tactical shooting. If you wanted to put a scope on it its pretty easy to do as well (Note: There is no scope included in this package). It has a 6 position adjustable stock. The accuracy is up to 1 MOA (meaning with a shooting rest, high quality ammo, and a good shooter, you can put 5 rounds within a 1"" circle at 100 yards).
I am also including the tactical sling (partially seen to the left of the stock) as well as 5 - 30 round polymer magazines, 4 of which have a handy window to see how much ammo is remaining. I will include these LOADED at 29 each (can fit 30 but its not very good for the mags and can cause problems) for 145 rounds! [NOTE: NOT SELLING ACCESSORIES/AMMO SEPARATE for this package] The ammo is 55 grain brass cased, not aluminum or steel cased garbage you see nowadays in the current craze. I am able to sell some additional ammunition for additional $.

This has everything you need to start tactical target shooting or even survive the zombie apocalypse!

List of everything included: Firearm, tactical sling, 5 LOADED magazines (29 x 5 = 145 rounds in magazines), red/green dot sight (Truglo, will include a back up battery too), back up sight, original RRA case.

I am NOT looking to trade, looking to sell only. Must be able to meet in Eau Claire, face to face, and have CASH. Will not ship. I can have additional pics and/or information on request. CCW a plus, Wisconsin ID a must."

As of right now the motor has 58,087 miles on it and the chassis has 115,323 miles on it overall the whole car is in excellent condition. The car runs and drives perfectly with no issues at all. The car has been stored every winter from both the original owner and myself. The car has never seen snow. I have only driven the car ~15,000 miles over the last 4 years. With regular oil changes (Mobil 1 full synthetic) every spring and fall.

A little history on the car: (Clear title)
I bought the car in June of '09 with a blown motor (the rod bearings had spun). I had found a 92 Mitsubishi Diamante that was rear ended and totaled out with only 42,162 miles on the clock. They both shared the same engine a Mitsubishi 3.0L DOHC. So I took the opportunity to rebuild this fabulous car. I bought the car from a local dealership who had purchased the car off of the original owner back in March of '09. They had all intentions of rebuilding the car themselves and reselling but a friend of mine worked at the dealership and I picked it up. I replaced the engine and began working on the car slowly but surely until everything was right and perfect. I have driven it since and still drive it today occasionally on the weekends. NO RUST its nice and clean!!

We will cover weapons in part 1 of the class, then will go qualify. Qualifying is simple: At 3 yards, shoot one-handed (5 rounds); At 7 yards, two-handed (10 rounds); At 10 yards, two-handed (10 rounds)

We break for lunch for approximately an hour, after which we cover the Law section of the class. After that is completed, we will review for the test and take the test. Any missed question will be reviewed and corrected. 

We give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour block of instruction course. 

The one thing that separates us from others is, we go above and beyond with lots of hands-on especially with your stance and grip of handling your firearm.

936,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1749936,For Sale:  Limited Edition 'Skull and Crossbones' / Free Colorado PMAG,"Colonial Park, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania",$ 35,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 11, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have one Limited Edition 'Skull and Crossbones' / Free Colorado PMAG for $35 locally or for a few extra bucks shipped.  All brand new in wrapper from Magpul. 

With the upcoming ban on standard-capacity magazines in their home state of Colorado and the seemingly never ending assault on Citizens' freedoms nationwide, Magpul released a short-run quantity of these limited edition PMAGs. Proceeds from the sales of these PMAGs go towards the legal battle against recent unconstitutional firearms legislation in CO and other firearms rights efforts nationwide in which Magpul is involved.

Identical in function to the GEN M2 MOE PMAG, these mags have a modified ribbing spacing on the body to allow additional branding. These magazines feature the 10th Anniversary  'skull and crossbones'  on the obverse side and ""Free Colorado"" on the reverse side.

Originally created to celebrate ten years in business, 1999-2009, the 'skull and crossbones' anniversary logo has been altered on this magazine to reflect the dates 1999-2013 to denote the time that Magpul existed in a free Colorado.

The ""Free Colorado"" logo was created during the legislative fight against these laws, and will be prominently featured during the legal fight to come.

The PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability."
