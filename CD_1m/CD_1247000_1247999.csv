All-In-One Combat Combo Ready!  


COLT LE-6940 16"" 223REM LE Carbine QDRL NOT RESTR with two magazines Throughout the world today, Colt’s reliability, performance, and accuracy provide our Armed Forces the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt LE6940 is the newest in the colt line. It uses a one-piece rock solid upper receiver that has a monolithic rail, a free floating barrel & folding front and rear sights. The folding front sight is made by Colt, while the rear sight, which can be adjusted to engage targets out to 600 yards, is made by MaTech. This is the same rear sight that is used on all Colt Mil-Spec M4s that are provided to the U.S. Army. The selector switch is reversabel for left handed shooters as well.Colt’s new LE6940 shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1” chrome lined barrel. With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. This rifle has been equipped with an STR Magpulcolapsable stock, a Magpul MOE grip and a magpul MS3 Single QD Sling. These custom items further enhance the feel and performance of this rifle. This is one of the best of the best. The LE6940 is well balanced and more customizable than previous models. For starters, a forward vertical grip can easily be installed as well as a SureFire tactical light on the LE6940's monolithic rail system. It also has enough room on the rail for a high-quality red dot with or without a 3X Magnifier. The Colt LE6940 can be turned into a precision rifle by installing a magnified optic like a Trijicon ACOG or a Leupold scope on the rail, which is built into the one-piece upper receiver. It is important to note that the one-piece upper receiver, which includes the rail, provides an incredibly stable platform that enables the operator of a Colt LE6940 to deliver super accurate shot placement. According to a contact at Colt, who put this in slightly more technical terms, the benefit of a monolithic rail is that ""the one-piece upper receiver offers 100-percent zero retention of optics."" Mil-Spec Quality The Colt law enforcement carbines are both built to Mil-Spec, and that means something. For an M16 or M4 to be considered 100 percent Mil-Spec, the rifle or carbine must be manufactured to certain government standards with certain high-quality parts and must routinely pass every government inspection and testing procedure dictated by the contract. In fact, only select fire M16s and M4 Carbines that are built to strict government standards can be considered Mil-Spec. It takes 357 ""gages"" (testing procedures and inspections) to produce one Mil-Spec select fire Colt M4 Carbine. For example, when Colt builds Mil-Spec barrels and bolt assemblies, it proof tests the rifle barrels with 70,000 psi cartridges followed by magnetic particle inspection (MPI) testing. MPI testing checks for any breakdown in metallurgy, any flaws, deformities, or cracks in steel barrels or their Parkerized coating. Bear in mind that the average 5.56 M855 FMJ round of ammunition has a psi factor of 52,000. One of the things I really like about Colt law enforcement carbines is that they are manufactured to meet high standards. Quality touches on the Colt law enforcement carbines include having the chamber bored out to reliably feed 5.56 ammunition, a barrel with a 1-and-7 twist, having a properly staked gas key, and an extractor that is designed to have the proper tolerances to ensure reliable operation under extended firing conditions. A barrel with a 1-in-7-inch twist like the type used in the LE6920 and LE6940 carbines is specifically designed to accommodate and stabilize 5.56 caliber ammunition up to 80 grains in weight. This means that you can engage targets at further distances with greater effectiveness than if you used 62-grain NATO ammunition from a 1-in-9-inch twist barrel."

VENTILATION FOR THE ENTIRE COOKTOP OR RANGE.

Most over-the-range microwaves only capture smoke from the back burners of a cooktop or range. The Extenda™ Vent from LG covers the entire cooking surface, including the front burners, for better, more complete ventilation in your kitchen.
SENSES OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE FOR FAST RESULTS.

Eliminate the guesswork in cooking. Humidity-sensing technology determines when food is cooked and automatically turns off the microwave to prevent the over- or under-cooking of meals.
NO FUSS DE-FROSTING.

Automatically defrosts for a specified amount of time

I bought it a couple of months ago and decided to go with something different.   It only has about 125 rounds through it.  Very accurate gun.  It comes with the original box, paperwork, lock, and one 13 round mag.  This is one of the new style P250's with the flat accessory rail.  Also comes with night sights.  This is a double action hammer fired gun.  

  For those who are unaware of the P250 product line, these have a serialized modular trigger system that can be taken out and put into other P250's in different calibers or frame sizes.  No need to buy another gun, just buy the exchange kit and you can easily swap your trigger pack into the new one.  The trigger pack is what is registered so there is no ffl paperwork when buying exchange kits.  I have seen some decent deals on the exchange kits on ebay.

This model has the cherokte cover slide in Olive Drab Green (OD Green) with a black colored polymer frame.  I have all the original items it came with i.e the case, lock, manual and std. mag plate.  I am also including (84 if I remember correctly) 80+ rounds of winchester 9mm FMJ 115gr ammo with this gun so you can make use of it right away!  This gun has seen about 150 to 200 rounds through it and is less then a year old.  This is my daily carry gun so please note the last pic below as the left front of the slide has some small wearing in the OD finish.  This is just about the best size/caliber carry gun you can get for the money!  Plus it's much easier to field strip then alot of pocket 9's out there.  So 350.00 is my price for everything listed and as stated I already have a replacement gun coming so I am not interested in trades.  A local face to face sale will require you to have to have a MI CPL and MI drivers License and we can fill out a MI RI-60 form for the transfer.  I would prefer to meet a MSP depot to complete the transaction so I can physically see you submit the RI-60 form.  If your out of state and interested I can ship the gun to a local FFL around you (as long as they will accept transfers from common folk) at your expense and then I can ship the ammo directly to you.  But again ammo can only ship UPS ground with adult signature required and that gets a bit pricey, so that too would be at your expense.

Designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in a emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Barrel was professionally cut down by Colonial Arms Corp. and has been threaded for their True-Tube chokes (.795 X 44). This shotgun holds NINE 2 3/4"" shells 8+1! This is my most recent shotgun project and I'm looking to start another one. Everything that was done to this gun is as follows...

- Remington black synthetic stock and forend with textured grey rubber inserts

- Remington SuperCell Recoil Pad

- Remington 1100 Tac 4 +4 Magazine Tube Extension

- Remington magazine tube spring, orange follower & magazine tube/barrel clamp

- Colonial Arms Corp. extra-full turkey choke & flush modified choke

- TruGlo fiber-optic front sight & fiber-optic Ghost Ring rear sight with interchangeable rifle sight

- New firing pin retractor spring

This gun was carried as a hunting shotgun for many years before I got a hold of it so there is blue wear on the receiver as well as some scuff marks here and there. Barrel is much better shape but also has a few marks on it. This entire gun was completely torn down and scrubbed clean, even the bolt and trigger assemblies. I have only fired 10 rounds to sight in the ghost ring since it has been cleaned. The action on this gun is incredibly smooth and has cycled over 50 rounds flawlessly from low brass 2 3/4"" shot to 3"" 1 1/4oz slugs.

- $675 for everything

Will consider trades for other GUNS, would particularly like a 12 gauge 11-87 but will consider others. Please let me know if you have any questions, interest or possible trade offers. Thanks for looking!"

Description: Up for Auction is a factory new Hornady Lock-N-Load Classic Kit.
Four ways Lock-N-Load® Classic can improve your reloading:
1) SPEED
Lock-N-Load Technology lets you switch dies to a new caliber and begin reloading again in seconds. Automatic priming is hands-off and trouble free. The angled frame gives you easier access to your cartridges.
2) CONSISTENCY
Lock-N-Load Bushings let you adjust your dies once, then lock the setting into place, for consistent reloads every time.
3) PRECISION
The CNC machined die and ram openings create near perfect alignment of the ram and die, so cases are lined up properly with the dies at all times. This precision translates into greater accuracy. The strong, rigid frame also provides the stability necessary for precision reloading.
4) VERSATILITY
With Lock-N-Load, one press can handle multiple calibers with ease. There’s no need to purchase multiple presses so you can leave your dies in place. Your dies will remain exactly as you set them, within their Lock-N-Load Die Bushings.

The Hornady Lock-N-Load Classic Reloading Kit comes with everything you need to turn out high-quality, accurate handloads. You get everything listed here, plus complete instructions. The Hornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading is especially valuable, with hundreds of rifle and pistol loads for every shooting application.

Lower: Complete New Frontier Armory LW-15 Lower

Accessories:

Quad Rail - Replaces stock carbine handguard, stronger than stock handguard, and allows for any picattiny/weaver attachments.
Ladder Covers - Protects the rail from damage and make it much more comfortable, these are Magpul FDE (tan)
Magpul RVG - Excellent vertical grip, and the magpul grip is much nicer than most of the competition, allows for either normal full grip, ""C"" grip, or Magpul Dynamics style handstop

These rifles also come with a rear sight, charging handle, and 2-point padded sling. 
These rifles are 100% ready to go, just add ammo. They have been laser bore sighted and test fired for functionality. The barrels are extremely nice and made by FN USA, the chrome lining will keep the barrel in top shape longer than you can afford to shoot it. The upper is built completely to mil-spec and features M4 feed ramps for more reliable feeding. And the bolt carrier groups are of the M16 variety, the gun is only semi-automatic but the bolts are built to be used in automatic weapons and will hold up much better than most which are only built to meet the .223 ar-15 semi-auto specs, they are also coated in nickel boron which reduces friction, requires less lubrication, lasts longer, and is incredibly easier to clean. These are not home brewn parts guns, they are barreled upper assemblies that have been factory assembled and headspaced, with a bolt carrier group installed, and pinned to a complete factory built lower, buy with confidence.

The Model 1897 and 1893 were both designed by John Browning. The Model 1897 is an external hammer shotgun lacking a trigger disconnector giving it the ability to slam fire. This means that the user can hold the trigger down while pumping the shotgun and once the pump is returned to the forward position the gun fires. The gun itself is classified as a slide action pump shotgun. It was the first truly successful pump-action shotgun produced.

This Winchester is a 1923 model and is a standard configuration with a 30"" barrel. It is in good condition minus a cracked butt stock that can easily be replaced. I had a gunsmith look at it today and said it was a good shooter."

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Cleaning kit, sling, and 1 magazine are standard.
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 6.95 lb - ideal for tactical use.

This is one of my two best rifles from a large collection. I thought about stripping all the extras off but they really make the weapon. The heavy buffer set make this rifle shoot soft and comfy, more like an ar10 than a shotgun. Included is the original buffer, so that with a 5.56 upper you can switch and shoot bth with one lower. I noticed that the 50 uppers and rifles came without ammo, with 169 rounds you can kill pigs or boss zombies all day long. The magazines included are all 30 round m4, or 9 round Beowulf. If you have a 556 upper you can use these for either caliber. The a5 stock is great as it extends to full rifle length. It also houses tons of batteries, fits a 50 cal boresnake or other accessories. The rubber grip increases comfort and the sight combo is perfect.

I am asking a lot for this rifle and package. If I get my asking price or higher I will throw in a 300 dollar pelican case with wheels. I personally guarantee that when you pick it up to get a feel on it you will find that it was worth every penny.

I will consider other brands but would like them to be mil-spec. I know I can get a new or like new rifle if the seller isn't price gouging, there is a lot of that going around but I've seen quite a few honest guys on here too. If I wanted to wait a year I could get a brand new Stag Arms Model 3 for $895, but I doubt I could be that patient. I'm really looking for a basic M4 style rifle, collapsible butt stock, 16"" barrel, etc. I prefer that the rifle have some sort of sights, but if not it's ok, and request that it include two 30 round mags which is fairly standard. 

I want to see what I am going to purchase in person, please don't ask me to mail a money order or paypal $1000 to you and tell me you will mail my item when you get the money, it's not happening. Yes, someone actually tried to do that to me on this site. 

I have a maximum of $1000 to spend and the finance department has barred the door which means I will have an almost impossible time getting more. I prefer not to sleep on the couch curled up with my AR for six weeks. All joking aside, if you have something reasonable and are asking slightly more, we can probably work something out. I prefer not to involve an FFL holder simply because it is just added expense on my part, but if you can come up with an offer that keeps me at or under my budget including the $30 fee for the transfer and NICS check, I will be happy to do that. If you have something that fits my description please email me at REDACTED or call or text me at 2-one-0-four-0-nine-2-three-8-nine, thanks for your time."
