I didn't feel like adding up the rounds but you can do the math. I have nine 30 round mags (one unloaded brand new in rapper) and five 47 round Thermold mags (two loaded). If you can't tell from the picture, of the nine 30 rounders, six are various types of steel mags, 2 are Thermold, and the new in wrapper one is a Tapco. I have all the original wood furniture. I also have a Midwest Industries Railed Scope mount. This AK doesn't have a side rail mount but I intended on putting one on. If you have the same intentions, or have another AK with a side-rail mount, the mount could be thrown into the mix as well. FTF in Louisville only. I will entertain cash offers and I will base my consideration of offers off what you want with the AK (i.e. number of mags, ammo, etc.). If you do your research on Maadi's and what the are going for without all the extras then we can negotiate within a reasonable range, just know I have no need to sell.

Comes with pistol, 3 15round magazines, the storage/carry case, test fire case, manual, ect.  Everything that came with it new.

I am asking $650 cash, FTF, must have valid ID.

I also have a little bit of ammo if you have none.

""The Beretta Laramie is a single-action revolver produced by Beretta. It is modeled after the Smith & Wesson Model 3.
The Laramie has an automatic safety on the hammer consisting of a sliding bar. After each shot, the bar automatically positions itself between the hammer and the frame, preventing accidental discharge. The bar also blocks the barrel releasing device and the rotation of the cylinder. The revolver can be transported safely when the hammer is in the half-cock notch, in this position the cylinder is able to rotate and the barrel can be opened for loading or unloading.""

These things will pop-up every once in awhile on auction websites-but they are difficult to find.

Its new although I do not have the box but I do have instructions and its been half way disassembled. It was actually never put together and this is as far as they made it before they hit a bump in thr road. I was planning on reloading but to be honest I bought a single stage so I can start off a bit more slow and simple.  This thing is a beast and I was told the accessories are up wards of 400 dollars. That being said and how hard these thibgs are to get then some one out there is about to get a smoking deal! I want 1100 for it. I was told it was 1375 delivered and then the accessories brought it close to 2k and that isnt the new inflated prices . This was bought before all that. Probably about 6 months ago and sat ever since. I will take 1100 as it sits for every single thing you see in the pictures and 1500 trade value. I think I am being extremely fair. I have not done any research at all about whats happening as far as prices go during this particular moment but Im sure someone is going to get  hell of  deal. Thanks

557,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1585557,For Sale:  NIB SMITH & WESSON 22A 22LR RIMFIRE,"Winder, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 265,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 18, 2013",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,no type,no type,Pistol,"NIB SMITH & WESSON 22A, COMES WITH 2 X 10 ROUND MAGS AND LIFETIME REPLACEMENT WARRANTY FROM THE DEALER.

The Smith & Wesson Model 22A is a semi-automatic pistol manufactured in Houlton, Maine. The 22A is a full-size pistol with an aluminum alloy frame. The steel barrel has an integrated Weaver style rail (similar to a Picatinny).

This pistol is distinguished by two features: An integral rail along the top edge of the gun permits easy mounting of optical sights and other accessories. The gun's alloy frame and alloy-shrouded barrel help keep weight down for a full-sized pistol.

The 22A is a single-action semi-automatic .22 caliber pistol. This means that after chambering the first round by pulling back and releasing the slide, each firing ejects the spent cartridge, cocks the firing pin, and then strips a new round from the magazine and loads it into the chamber. With a single action the firing pin or hammer is automatically cocked and pulling the trigger simply releases the firing pin. This results in a lower trigger pull force than a double-action pistol where the trigger must first cock the firing pin and then release it.

A frame mounted safety switch is present along the left side of the frame in the conventional location to be operated by the user's right thumb. Patridge-type target sights are standard on this gun, with the rear sight adjustable for both windage and elevation. The front sight is integral with the barrel shroud and is not removable or adjustable. An integral feed ramp at the barrel breech helps assure reliable loading of rounds into the chamber from the magazine.

The newer model incorporates a magazine safety that does not permit the gun to fire unless the magazine is fully seated. This feature helps prevent accidental discharge during careless handling especially during cleaning; though many gun aficionados dislike this feature as gun safety[citation needed] is primarily a function of the care of the operator, and the magazine safety can render the gun unfireable should the magazine be lost or damaged.

The magazine release is located on the front of the grip making it easy to locate and also makes it ambidextrous as well since it is equally well placed for both right and left handed shooters. This location however makes it possible to accidentally release the magazine if the pistol is gripped firmly such as during rapid fire[citation needed].

This is more of a problem for people with smaller hands where the finger tips may lay on the front of the handle when gripping the gun. Typically ejecting a magazine requires retracting your middle finger and pushing in on the release with the finger tip. The eject button is difficult to depress with the middle part of the finger.

The gun takes down easily for cleaning via a pushbutton at the front that disengages the barrel from the frame. It is therefore possible to rapidly exchange barrels, for example to switch on and off one with a mounted scope, etc.

I have built and sold several of these high-end H&k mr556 rifles. I have 100% positive feedback as a seller so you can buy with confidence, I will respond to your emails and I will deliver a superior product in a timely fashion. First things first, Why would anyone want to make any changes to this weapon system? I like most that have been fascinated by this rifle since I first saw it on the show Future Weapons as the H&k 416. The torture test they put it throw was in one word, Amazing. As soon as they became available on the civilian market as the H&k mr556 I bought it. The first thing I had to do was put a Red dot sight on it. The H&k sights were in the way and had to be replaced with back-up sights that fold down when not in use (cost $500+). It came with one proprietary 30rd magazine, I have plenty of AR-15 / M4 magazines already so I didn't like the Idea of being forced to buy even more H&k mr556 / 416 mags at over $100 each (cost $1,000-2,000). I understand that without a functioning magazine any rifle is just about useless, having an ample supply is important. I changed out the H&k lower with a Spikes tactical lower for two reasons. 1. So I could use the Pmags and other AR mags that I already had. 2. I don't live in Germany, German made lower parts and magazines are expensive and very hard to come by. American made lower parts, upgrade parts and magazines are readily available so in an emergency I WILL be able to find the parts and magazines that I need. Everything in the operational system that makes the rifle the powerhouse it is remains the same, all modifications were done to compliment and improve over the existing design.

As an HK product, this gun exudes excellence to the highest degree by outperforming all other AR-platforms in the market. The HK416 used by US Special forces to kill Osama bin laden (which the MR556 derives its lineage) has a proven barrel life of over 20,000 consecutive rounds with little to no drawbacks thanks to its German cold hammer forged barrel technology. Heckler & Koch is a ""No Compromise"" company that puts the quality of their products above all else. When buying this weapon, you can be sure that you are buying one of the most reliable and scarcest firearms on the market. This is the most sought after civilian assault rifle made. A direct descendent of the HK416, developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating ""pusher"" rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR/15M/16M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions caused from hot carbon fouling gases entering the receiver area, the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles.

One of the most tested and proven weapons systems in the world achieves ultimate refinement with the introduction of the SIG516 rifle. With its chrome-lined, phosphated, military grade barrel and adjustable, four-position gas regulator, the SIG516 incorporates all of the most desirable mechanical improvements. Add to these a free-floating quad rail forend and barrel, and you have the most advanced, versatile AR-based rifle available. The SIG516 Patrol comes with a Magpul MOE stock and MOE pistol grip. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, it uses the SIG SAUER innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. This system, along with the SIG SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO s Over the Beach test. A 16 chrome-lined barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating M1913 quad rail. The top rail is optic-ready and includes SIG SAUER flip-up iron sights.

Decided to do the Old West thing for now, instead of synthetic guns.
I have two TLR-1 rail mounted lights. $80 each, or $150 for both.
A few ""Grip-Pod"" tactical grip/bipod. $65 ea.
A few Knights Armerment grip. $25 ea.
3 Knights Armerment rail covers. $20.
Level 3 Stand Alone plates, front and back. Got them from my brother for a good price a few years ago, but I've had a recent back injury. Besides, cowboys don't wear plates. $150 ea or $275 for both.

I wont ship, and I'd prefer to not even leave the Springs for anything less than all I have. 
If I recall how many grips I have, that would come out to $690 for everything. Though if you want it all, I could do $640, to make it a good, even, number."

Pistol has been fired 92 times. 50 Herter's FMJ and 42 Fiochhi 124 gr. JHP. No problems at all with those few rounds. Nice carry pistol, slim and light weight. Trigger pull is like a light double action revolver. It'll sting a little on the tip of your trigger finger due to trigger geometry, but you can overcome that ( practice, mindset, practice, etc. ) Price? OK, this IS Armslist, so, judging from other ads I've seen, I'd be justified in asking $700.00. But since pistol IS used, having been fired above mentioned 92 times, I've GOT to get $800.00..........

OK, how about $300.00, a little high, that's what I paid after tax, but you get the other goodies too, and if you show me you're legally able to posess this pistol ( CCH would be real nice ) I might throw in a box of Federal 9BP JHP ammo....

While I find that interesting, it is not really a caliber that I am in to, so maybe somebody else can enjoy it at its current caliber or use the action for a new project. I HAVE NOT fired this rifle, and while I did borrow a round of 35 Whelen to satisfy my sneaking suspicion that it was chambered in that, I CANNOT guarantee all is well with this firearm.

This Revolver is all complete and original and the serial number lists in the S&W Factory records as being shipped to Robbins Air Force
Base, GA, March 22nd, 1957. All numbers match with the exception of the Yoke. As with 
most the Property of United States Air Force has been removed from the backstap but can still be seen from the right angle with the naked eye. Last one of these I saw sell sold for 
over $5000. The reason this one is being offered at this low of a price is because the frame is cracked at the barrel entrance as most of these revolvers were. Other than that the 
revolver is complete, original, and extremely tight. This Revolver is to never be shot under 
any circumstances. If you choose to do so you take your life in your own hands. This is 
being sold as a very rare and collectable display piece only. Will ship to FFL or C&R. Price

LaserLyte® Returns to Basics with a very affordable rear sight laser for the Springfield XD/XD pistols.

LaserLyte® returns to basics with the patented RTB-XD rear sight laser that fits the Springfield XD/XDM/XDS firearms. The high performance laser built into a rear sight specifically designed for Springfield XD/XDM/XDS pistols features a simple, ambidextrous “press and go” activation.  The laser is easily programmable to either constant on or pulse mode.  Another great feature is the “auto-off” feature that displays a unique flash after 5-minutes of operation and automatically turns the unit off after 6-minutes.
Made from heavy-duty, high carbon steel for added durability, the LaserLyte RTB-XD rear sight laser has a black chrome finish for corrosion prevention. A great benefit of the LaserLyte RTB-XD rear sight laser is that the customer will not have to replace grips, internal stock parts or holsters. The LaserLyte RTB-XD rear sight laser is compatible with all Level 1 and Level 2 holsters including the BLACKHAWK!® SERPA® holster system.

3- 22lr starter revolver. Shoots good, fires blank 22 rounds like they use at the start of a horse race. Makes a great learner gun to teach you kid how to shoot without anyone getting hurt. I paid $75, and ammo is available online for next to nothing for these guns.

4- Jennings 22lr. Decent shooting little pistol, cheap but fun to shoot. Not in pristine condition but doesn't look bad. Shoots great. I paid $180 for that one several years back

I have plenty of ammo available for several of them at extra cost or will throw ammo in on a good trade."

937,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1585937,For Sale:  Syderco Delica with Emerson (MSRP: $114.95),"Newark/ Heath, Ohio, United States",$ 80,"Listed On: Monday, July 22, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"If knives could be created in the same way we choose players for fantasy football league teams, every hardcore knife knut would recruit features and characteristics they like best from different knife companies and combine them into their favorite knife.  Spyderco will undoubtedly fulfill many knife knuts knife fantasy picks with the introduction of the Delica and Endura with Emerson's opening feature.  These models combine all that's functional and performance-based in a Spyderco folder with the blade-opening feature made popular and patented by Ernest Emerson of Emerson Knives.
The Emerson opening feature is a hook curving out the top of the knife's blade. When removing the knife from a front pocket it catches the pocket's edge quickly opening the knife blade ready to use. The knife can also be taken out of the pocket without engaging the opening feature by pulling it straight up and out with your fingers on top of the closed blade.

Delicas and Enduras with Emerson's opening feature have screw construction making cleaning and adjusting easier. Their gray fiberglass reinforced nylon handles are molded with Bi-Directional Texturing® for traction and improved ergonomics. Inside the handle dual skeletonized stainless steel liners strengthen the knife without additional weight and create an anchor for external and internal components to attach through for more sturdiness and rigidity. Their VG-10 blades are flat saber-ground with a stronger tip and larger 13mm opening hole. Added to the blade's spine is slip resistant jimping. Phosphor bronze washers smooth out the open/close action and the clip is upgraded to a four-way tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed clip.

Spyderco will undoubtedly fulfill many knife knuts knife fantasy picks with the introduction of the Delica and Endura with Emerson's opening feature.  These models combine all that's functional and performance-based in a Spyderco folder with the blade-opening feature made popular and patented by Ernest Emerson of Emerson Knives.

The Emerson opening feature is a hook curving out the top of the knife's blade. When removing the knife from a front pocket it catches the pocket's edge quickly opening the knife blade ready to use. The knife can also be taken out of the pocket without engaging the opening feature by pulling it straight up and out with your fingers on top of the closed blade.

Delicas and Enduras with Emerson's opening feature have screw construction making cleaning and adjusting easier. Their blue-gray fiberglass reinforced nylon handles are molded with Bi-Directional Texturing® for traction and improved ergonomics. Inside the handle dual skeletonized stainless steel liners strengthen the knife without additional weight and create an anchor for external and internal components to attach through for more sturdiness and rigidity. Their VG-10 blades are flat saber-ground with a stronger tip and larger 13mm opening hole. Added to the blade's spine is slip resistant jimping. Phosphor bronze washers smooth out the open/close action and the clip is upgraded to a four-way tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed clip.

994,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1585994,For Sale:  Spyderco Endura4 with Emerson (MSRP: $124.95),"Newark/ Heath, Ohio, United States",$ 95,"Listed On: Monday, June 10, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"If knives could be created in the same way we choose players for fantasy football league teams, every hardcore knife knut would recruit features and characteristics they like best from different knife companies and combine them into their favorite knife.  Spyderco will undoubtedly fulfill many knife knuts knife fantasy picks with the introduction of the Delica and Endura with Emerson's opening feature.  These models combine all that's functional and performance-based in a Spyderco folder with the blade-opening feature made popular and patented by Ernest Emerson of Emerson Knives.

The Emerson opening feature is a hook curving out the top of the knife's blade. When removing the knife from a front pocket it catches the pocket's edge quickly opening the knife blade ready to use. The knife can also be taken out of the pocket without engaging the opening feature by pulling it straight up and out with your fingers on top of the closed blade.

Delicas and Enduras with Emerson's opening feature have screw construction making cleaning and adjusting easier. Their blue-gray fiberglass reinforced nylon handles are molded with Bi-Directional Texturing® for traction and improved ergonomics. Inside the handle dual skeletonized stainless steel liners strengthen the knife without additional weight and create an anchor for external and internal components to attach through for more sturdiness and rigidity. Their VG-10 blades are flat saber-ground with a stronger tip and larger 13mm opening hole. Added to the blade's spine is slip resistant jimping. Phosphor bronze washers smooth out the open/close action and the clip is upgraded to a four-way tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed clip.
