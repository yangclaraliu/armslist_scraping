The XBOX has pretty much controlled the kids here so the PS3 never gets played. The 43 games are all top tier games I can list if anyone is interested and has something I may be interested in. The accessories are Chargers, remotes, rockband guitar and drums, guitar hero guitars, move, move rifle gun, etc. When I say easily well over $2500 to $3000 spent on my part here it is no exaggeration. I understand there is plenty of depreciation. My kids said I can part with it because they play the xbox more. As for the Wii there are 16 games and pretty much highly rated games also. Again so much money invested. There are at least two sets of nun chucks and two sets of wii motes. There may be 3 sets if I dig. Have accessories thrown in a box. Think there is some guns, wheels for mario kart, and other various little accessories So the Wii, 16 or so games and nunchucks, wii motes, and accessories, a charger base, a fan, and various other accessories are what is included with the Wii."

Bushmaster has reworked their magazines to offer significant improvements in function, durability and value. The aluminum box is stamped with a full ""progressive"" die to produce tightest tolerances. The welding process along the box seams has been automated to insure optimum weld ingot, strength and compliance with MIL-STD. The surface finish has been improved to meet or exceed MIL-PRF-46010 (required for U.S.G.I. magazines). Magazine boxes are treated with Molybdenum Disulphide (""Moly"") for its exceptional adherence properties which ensure long lasting protection and lubricity - far superior to the PTFE (Teflon) used on other magazines. Finally, these magazines now have a new ""anti-tilt"" follower that ensures the round is fed into the chamber properly - preventing failure to feed problems. Drop tests have proven the advantages of the anti-tilt follower over the traditional green follower. As an additional aid, the followers are caliber marked - 5.56 in this case. Highest quality tempered steel springs, and Bushmaster logo stamped baseplates (removable for cleaning) round out the improvements on these superior magazines - which have been endorsed by the National Tactical Officers Association."

60 rounds fired before the magazine well decided to break on me. Magazines still lock, but the release lever needs to be rigged to keep the magazine locked solidly (to eliminate vertical play).

Someone handy or with machining skills should be able to fix the piece pretty easily to their liking. All pictures taken with broken magwell.

The basic design of the FEG PA-63 pistol was heavily based on the German Walther PP pistol.  FEG also produced a number of derivatives of the PA-63, such as 'export commercial' model AP-63, chambered for widely available 9x17 Browning / .380 ACP and 7.65 Browning / .32ACP ammunition. Both PA-63 and AP-63 pistols were similar in design, and differed only in ammunition used and in frame finish - military-issue PA-63 pistols had their aluminum frames left 'in the white', while commercial AP-63 pistols have their aluminum frames finished in same black color as the rest of the gun.
The FEG PA-63 pistol is a simple blowback operated weapon. The return spring is located around the barrel, the trigger is of traditional double-action type with exposed hammer. Manual safety lever, which doubles as a decocker, is located at the left side of the slide. Gun is fed from single stack box magazines, magazine release button is located on the left side of the frame, above and behind the trigger.

Thermold Magazines started in the 1960’s as a molded plastics injection manufacturer that served the automotive industry. It's founder, William Howard, was well known in his hometown of Wilson, N.C. as an innovative thinker who held many patents. Mr. Howard was also a big game hunter for whom making firearms more reliable was both a passion and a necessity.

Using a nylon resin called Zytel, developed by DuPont after World War II to replace metal in large-scale manufacturing, Thermold began producing weapons magazines that resisted heat and corrosion, and functioned with extreme reliability. Thermold magazines rapidly became the product of choice among military personnel, law enforcement officers and sport shooters around the world.

All of our products are proudly made in the United States in North carolina. Today, many of the firearm industry’s largest and most prestigious distributors are once again able to sell the trusted line of Thermold magazines and weapons products.

There is no special deal here at $650.  This is damn near exactly what I paid at Bill's, which includes tax.  I am not trying to make money.  I am offering a fair deal at Bill's retail price.  I have not fired it at all.  I might consider an even trade if a Shield is in excellent condition.  Otherwise price is firm.  I'll throw in some ammo if your on the fence.

I put 2 mags through the pistol (did not use dark earth factory mags) cleaned it and it has been in my safe ever since.  So if I was not honest I could EASILY pass this gun off as new it is that clean.  It has day and night Trijicon sights all in one as you can see in the pics (the sights alone are $240).  It comes with 5 mags, 3 different sizes of back straps, 2 boxes of ammo, and the box and paper work when I bought new. 

The main attribute that sets this gun apart from the standard M&P 40 (or 9) is also what gives it its name; it features front and rear Viking Tactics Warrior sights.  The sights are actually comprised of two sets of sights; a set of fiber optic high visibility day sights on top, and beneath those are a set of Trijicon tritium high visibility night sights.  The other attribute that sets it apart from the standard M&P is the fact that the polymer frame and the steel slide are both in the Flat Dark Earth finish. 

This pistol features an ambidextrous magazine release and slide stop lever along with a loaded chamber indicator and a front accessory rail.  The M&P 40 is easy to field strip and clean, and reassembly is even easier.

It still has the factory wire tie on it. The one in the photo that is open has been sold. The highest bidder will cut this tie to inspect.  I understand that it is important to know that the rounds are unopened. 

Here's the way this will work. I already have two standing offers of $315 (this $ amount will change as higher offers come in, if they come in:) for this can. This can will stay on arms list until Sunday afternoon or until someone wants to BUY IT NOW FOR $400, whichever comes first. You can make cash offers or handgun offers or a combo. If you have a handgun valued at more than what the ammo is worth to you I will throw cash in to buy/trade for your gun. I hope this is fun for all and no one gets mad for a unique approach to selling this extremely rare and highly sought for ammo :)

I will provide proof at any time that the offer that I post is legit if you request. No moogy foogy here!

I can probably take a cc on my new square if that's important to you (add 3% to cash discounted price)

Finally... If there are enough people that want less than 420 rounds at $1 a piece I will consider splitting the box.

I have 200-round 7.62 cans measuring 3.5x10x7 and 100-round .50 cans measuring 5.75x11x7. I'm asking $12 for the 7.62 and $15 for the .50 ones. 

These have new rubber seals and are waterproof and air tight. They are great for ammo, tools, first aid kits, geocaching, preppers, and for storing anything else you need protected from the elements. They can also be turned into a miniature faraday cage. 

My job takes me all over the Springs, so we can probably arrange for a meetup close to you. Please email with your phone number and we'll work something out!"

For those who know, this is the luxury sport competition handgun of a lifetime. It is an honest-to-goodness tack driver - I have had several cases of two shots going through one hole out to about 45 feet. I'm the second owner, and the gun is about 5 years old, but in excellent condition with nothing wrong. Very little use since I bought it for IPSC/USPSA originally, but eventually decided to shoot Sigs in competition and save the CZ. It's heavy enough to reduce recoil to nothing without a compensator, and all the metal components are utter craftsmanship. Rear sight is adjustable for windage/elevation, with a front red fiber optic, so getting precise sight alignment is a breeze. And did I say there were 5 Tactical Sport OEM 20-round magazines that come with it (worth about $50 each)? Who knows - a week from now you may not even be able to buy those anymore! It has some extra parts too (slide stop release levers worth $35 each). Also a Blade-Tech Kydex holster, and an OEM high-quality case with original paperwork and lock.

Here's info from the CZ website:
Introduced in 2005, the new CZ 75 Tactical Sport in 9mm Luger and .40 S&W. The CZ 75 TS is a competition-ready pistol designed for IPSC standard division (USPSA limited division). The weight and balance of the CZ 75 TS are optimized for the rapid, accurate style of shooting necessary for success in practical shooting disciplines. The Tactical Sports model is the next generation of the proven CZ 75 Standard IPSC. The TS retains all of the best features of Standard IPSC model and improves upon the platform with increased durability, new sights, a new trigger system and more.

The TS features a full-length dust cover, a 5.4"" barrel (0.7"" longer than the CZ 75 B) as well as a slightly larger grip to accommodate the higher capacity heavy duty magazine. Other features include a fixed rear sight, ambidextrous safety, extended magazine release, SA trigger, checkered front and rear strap and a gaping magazine well for the fastest magazine changes.

1. Gun Bill Hearings Start Time Changed to 10:30 AM

2. Sequestration

Dear Steve,

1. Gun Bill Hearings

Yesterday I sent out an email announcing the time and places for the hearings on the gun control bills before the Senate. They changed the starting time, moving it up to 10:30 AM on Monday morning, March 4. If you plan on attending (which I recommend for everyone) please adjust your schedule accordingly. These hearings are still expected to last all day and possibly late into the evening.

As a citizen your greatest opportunity to weigh in on this string of bad bills is at these public hearings on Monday. Hearings for both the Judiciary and the State Affairs committees begin at 10:30 AM in the Capitol. To testify you have to sign in at the hearing room. The sign in sheet should be available at 10:00 AM, but I expect there will be a line forming well before that and there will not be enough time for everyone who signs up. Judiciary committee is hearing SB-195, 196, and 197 and HB-1224 in the Old Supreme Court Chambers. State Affairs committee is hearing HB-1229, 1228, and 1226 (in that order) in Senate Committee Room 356.
I recommend coming early, to find a place to sit, find a place to park your car, and get in line to sign up to testify (if you want to testify). It will be a long day, and one that will have great impact on our future freedoms and security.

    Here is a brief description of all the bills:

HB 1224: Bans magazines with a capacity of more than 15 bullets. Magazines owned prior to the ban can be kept but cannot be transferred or sold. (Judiciary)

HB 1226: Prohibits concealed carry on public college campuses. (State Affairs)

HB 1228: Charges fees for background checks. (State Affairs) 

HB 1229: Requires a background check to be conducted by a licensed firearms dealer before any sale or transfer of a firearm. “Transfer” includes lending a firearm to a friend. (State Affairs)

SB 195: requires concealed carry permit applicants to complete training in-person. This bill bans online instruction. (Judiciary)

SB 196: makes users, owners, sellers, distributors, and manufacturers of semi-automatic firearms liable for harm caused by any firearm that was under their control at one point in time and is later misused by someone else. (Judiciary) 

SB 197: prohibits people who have committed domestic violence offense from possessing firearms, including both misdemeanor and felony offenses. People charged with these crimes must relinquish all firearms they possess."

Someone spent a long time working on this rifle back in the 1950s, 60s, or 70s.  The receiver is an all numbers-matching Amberg 1916 GEW 98 Mauser.  It's been professionally Sporterized with a turned-down bolt handle, scope-readied with Weaver bases (not shown,) lapped lugs, and sweet trigger job.  The 8x57mm barrel is a from a K98, has a mirror chamber & bore, the stepped contour has been nicely turned to a smooth taper.  A high quality front sight base was added, as well as a rear flip-up sight.  Currently the metal is unfinished, but I can (zinc phosphate) Parkerize it for you for $75.  The stock is hand carved walnut, and inletted extremely well...she's solid as a rock.  I'm only asking $250 for this fine piece, as it sits about 90% done at this time.   

I also have a brand new Boyd's Varmint/Target laminated stock for a Large Ring 98 Mauser.  I ordered this last month when I was going to convert this gun into a target rifle.  $100 firm. 

I am in the York area, but can possibly meet in the Harrisburg, or Lancaster areas."

I prefer cash to recoup my loss on this, but would possibly be open to a firearms +/- cash trade.  I prefer a CCW holder so I know you have a clear background, and reserve the right to call for a background check if you don't have a permit.  Face to face only, no shipping.  First come, first served, I won't hold this for you until your next paycheck.  If this ad is still up, I still have it for sale.  Otherwise, please feel free to e-mail me with any other questions or to set up a time and place to meet.

From Ruger:
Ideally suited for informal target shooting, plinking, small game hunting, and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate. The 10/22's heat-stabilized, glass-filled polymer trigger housing assembly is precision-made of high-tech material for improved manufacturing tolerances, impact, and abrasion-resistance, and has an unmatched ability to withstand the elements. The hammer-forged barrel is locked into the receiver by a unique two-screw V-block system and the A380 aluminum alloy receiver is precision-machined to provide long-term reliability to the 10/22 action. Ruger's patented, detachable 10-shot rotary magazine features a unique rotor to separate cartridges and provide reliable feeding. The easy-to-use extended magazine release provides smooth, no-fuss removal of the unique flush-mounted magazine without leaving it exposed to dent or creating uncomfortable protrusions at the rifle's balance points. The Ruger 10/22 also features a fiber-optic front sight and an adjustable rear sight and a combination scope base adapter for both Weaver-style and .22 tip-off scope mounts is provided with every rifle. The 10/22 Carbine features an 18-1/2"" barrel with a 1 in 16 right-handed twist. Matte black barrel and receiver on a hardwood stock.

I'm willing to sell for $400.00 obo or trade for a firearm, old gold or silver coins, or something else interesting and collectable.  Feel free to make an offer.  Thanks."

Here is some info on them: 
Voodoo Tactical Level III Backpack, Small MOLLE Assault Pack

This is a sturdy, well-made MOLLE pack that will surprise you with its versatility and performance. It is great for a day trip or quick recon.
This enhanced Level III MOLLE compatible assault pack (18""h x 10""w x 10""d) is perfect when you don't want to lug around a full three-day assault pack. With less than half the cubic inches of our larger assault pack, you will find it is the perfect size for when you want to travel light, such as a one-day or overnight excursion. Thanks to the many MOLLE compatible attachment points (PALs) you can add additional MOLLE, ALICE or similar pouches if more carrying capacity is needed.
Don't be fooled by other small MOLLE packs on the market. Most of them are smaller, have fewer MOLLE attachment points, and lack many other advantages this enhanced pack offers. For example, this pack has a molded back panel that promotes air circulation to enhance your comfort, and sports thick, adjustable shoulder straps that well cushioned for a pack this size.
The pack has two main compartments and two large exterior pockets for stowing gear you may need to access in a hurry. It is hydration pouch compatible (bladder sold separately), 
and has vertical and horizontal compression straps to help hold your gear in place. It also offers an adjustable waist belt and a web carry handle on the top.

Large Black two-in-one Range Bag with Removeable Center Pistol Compartment

Carry your pistol, ammo and accessories in this full-size two-in-one range bag. Removable center compartment has zippered, padded side panels to store two or more handguns and plenty of ammo.
Adjustabe hook and loop dividers allow you to set this bag up exactly how you want it.
Large external pocket and double zippers up to give you ample access to your stored gear.
Overall size is 14"" x 9"" x 10"". Available in black, coyote tan, or olive drab."

 2 Century Arms L1A1 FALs. 308. 20rd Mags. Gas Piston operation. Feild strip twice as fast as an AR. Folding rear sight built in, folding charing handle. adjustable gas block. 21"" barrel on one 16"" on the other. Awesome guns both run 100%. Ban models, no flash hiders. At least 8 mags with them, I have more laying around the house and in cars and stuff, you can have all I can find these are my last FALs. Good shape for milsurp stuff. Have other misc small parts for them laying around you can have all my FAL stuff. Have a trilux scope available too.

More pics of anything available on request.
 I planned on switching my semi auto 308s over to sr-25 style mags and rifles before the world went gun ban crazy and slowly have been buying some. These are my last FALs and I would like to see them both leave at the same time. I have OCD about owning different rifles that take different mags. only one type of 308 mag in this house is the plan. Variety is the spice of life and nightmare of logisitics.

Wanted to trade for: 
Any 308 rifle, lowers, uppers, etc. that accepts LR-Pmags/SR-25 Mags/DPMS mags/etc...
 Nice scopes for a semi auto 308. FFP mil or moa. Was thinking HDMR, would like an XRS, FFP mil or moa. Or IORs.
 Anything else interesting. Just PM me and ask if you are interested. I dont want a stevens 200 in .270 though...

Can trade up or down. I have plenty cash to add to any deal and can always accept some.
