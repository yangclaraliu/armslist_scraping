Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol.

As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers, hoarders and ban pushing politicians. We need to come together and do two things: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

These price criminals only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but let's face it, do we really need 100 round drums or is that more of a want? Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back under the 1000s where they all belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The regularity will only return if we make it.

At the Ohio Deer and Turkey Expo this weekend, several booths had so called 'P-Mags' for sale.

Please be 21+ and have a valid I.D. I would also prefer it you have a valid permit to purchase/permit to carry, for peace of mind more than anything. That's not a definite deal breaker, but if you come up to me with a sniffly nose and the shakes, you can bet I'll turn you away. In other words, no shady characters... Will only sell with a valid MN ID and a signed bill of sale. That's the one rule I'm firm on.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. This 12 gauge model offers a 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

This 870 Express is in ""Like New"" condition and has had only 50 shells shot through it. Comes with a soft case. It is currently consigned to www.ontargetrange.com and is available for viewing and inspection at their Laguna Niguel, CA facility. All questions regarding the shotgun should be directed to ""OnTarget"". Private party transfer and or any related shipping fees/costs will be at buyers expense."

This is Glock's compact .45 ACP slimline model with a 6+1 capacity. This gun is very slim and very light. When carrying it, you often forget it's there. 

This gun has about 700 flawless rounds through it. Some people like to repeat the Internet rumor that the Glock 36 is a problem child. It is not. THIS GUN DOESN'T HAVE A SINGLE MALFUNCTION OF ANY KIND WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT BRANDS/TYPES OF AMMO. Rest assured, you are getting a good one, so to speak.  

The barrel is polished and both magazines have the Pearce plus-zero magazine extensions on them. These don't add capacity, but do allow you do get your pinky finger on the grip. Plus-one extensions are available if you want to add one round of capacity to 7+1. 

This gun also has XS Big Dot tritium night sights installed. And trust me, they are awesome and very bright. Only installed a year ago, so many more years of life left. These are amazing defensive night sights.  

This is one of the best carry guns on the market. 

Package includes: 
– Glock 36 w/ XS Big Dot night sights. 
– 2 magazines with Pearce plus-zero extensions installed. 
– High Noon Mr. Softy IWB holster. Very nice, soft leather holster. 
– Extra OEM recoil spring. 

Everything listed here cost me $850 brand new. 

Asking $600 or best offer. 

Wisconsin residents only. Local sale only, unless you want to drive to me. You must be have a valid WI state ID and not have a criminal history or psychiatric history which would preclude you from owning a firearm. Cash only. You must be willing to sign a bill of sale, also. 

Low-ball offers or trades will be ignored.

Facory info:

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

It has the 7 inch blade, 5 inch leather stack handle, peened not pinned like later ones. Has the rare straight line marking on guard. Not the later two line marking. Not as common as the two line marked ones. Has KA-Bar on one side of guard and USN on the other. USN etched into leather on handle, WS soldiers initials etched into side of blade. And his last name which starts with S on the back of sheath. Front of sheath has his nickname of smokey etched into it. Sheath is original sewen and stapled and leather is in good shape, keeper is ok too.  I looked up the soldiers last  name and he indeed served during WWII. 

I collect the mk2s and know their history, their markings, variations ect... and know all about this knife so don't need a false history lesson trying to get me to get rid of it for nothing. I have the reference books that are used on these knives and have sent pictures of all of mine to an authority on the Ka-Bar knife for their opinions, appraisals ect..
