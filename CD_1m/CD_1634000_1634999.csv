Like new custom 7x57:
New Ruger M77 MKII action

About 7x57 Caliber:
The 7x57 was developed by the famous German firm of Mauser in 1892, and adopted by the Spanish government in 1893. Subsequently, several Latin American countries adopted the 7x57, including Mexico. In Europe, Serbia adopted the cartridge, and it became a popular sporting cartridge all over Europe. In Great Britain the 7x57 became so popular that the John Rigby Company adopted it as the .275 Rigby. Many bolt action rifles built in the UK were so marked. Under both names the cartridge was used extensively for plains and mountain game in Africa and Asia. Ammunition is manufactured and sold in Europe, Africa, North America and most of the world. The 7x57 is a true world-wide cartridge.

W.D.M. Bell, perhaps the most famous of all African commercial ivory hunters, killed the majority of his over 1000 elephants with the 7x57. He used the 175 grain FMJ bullet for brain shots, and liked the .275 Rigby (as he called the 7x57) for its accuracy and low recoil and report.

Current ammunition catalogs from PMC, Remington and Federal show loads for the 7x57 with 140 grain spitzer bullets (SD .248) at a muzzle velocity (MV) of 2,660 fps and muzzle energy (ME) of 2,199 ft. lbs. Winchester loads a 145 grain spitzer to the same MV for a ME of 2279 ft. lbs. Federal and PMC also load 175 grain RN bullets at a MV of 2440 fps and ME of 2315 ft. lbs. These are the standard American low pressure factory loads.

Here are some 7x57 specifications that should be of interest to reloaders: bullet diameter .284"", maximum COL 3.065"", maximum case length 2.235"", MAP 46,000 cup.

There are a wide variety of 7mm bullets available to the reloader, from around 110 grains to 195 grains. Barnes offers a 175 grain RN solid (SD .310) and a 195 grain soft point spitzer bullet (SD .345). The North American shooter who wants to get maximum utility out of a 7x57 really should be a reloader. The 130-140 grain bullets are generally the best choice for CXP2 class game, while the 150-175 grain bullets get the nod for CXP3 class game. Restrict shots at the latter to 200 yards/meters or less.

The 7x57 is a well balanced and well designed cartridge for which a number of medium burning rate rifle powders are appropriate. Among these are H414, H380, H4350, IMR 4064, IMR 4320, IMR 4350, and W760.

The reloader with a strong rifle who loads to about 50,000 cup can do better than most factory loads. Do not use the maximum loads quoted below in the relatively weak Model 93 and 95 Mauser actions, or in Remington rolling block rifles. According to the Speer No. 13 Reloading Manual the Speer 130 grain spitzer bullet (BC .394, SD .230) can be driven to 2649 fps by 46.0 grains of H414 powder, and 2960 fps by a maximum load of 50.0 grains of H414.

The 145 grain Spitzer (BC .457, SD .257) can be driven to 2501 fps by 44.0 grains of H414, and 2748 fps by a maximum load of 48.0 grains of H414.

The 160 grain spitzer (BC .502, SD .284) can be driven to 2,363 fps by 42.0 grains of H414, and 2582 fps by a maximum load of 46.0 grains of the same powder. All of the above loads used Remington cases and CCI 250 primers, and were chronographed in a 22 inch rifle barrel.

The Z5 from SWAROVSKI OPTIK is a 1-inch rifle scope with 5x zoom – an innovative combination. Due to its high magnification and its large field of view, it is particularly versatile and eminently suitable for various types of hunting.

Unlike other AKs sold in this country, which are usually assembled using foreign-made parts kits the Centurion is made completely in the United States with the receiver machined from an 11-pound block of 4140 steel.

Changes with this rifle compared to original specs:
-16 1/2-inch barrel
-Three-port chevron compensator this removable unit more effectively directs propellant gas upward to reduce muzzle jump
-Sights, square-notch rear sight has been redesigned to allow windage changes by loosening a set screw and moving the rear sight blade laterally and elevation is adjusted by rotating the red-colored front sight post.

The Centurion’s most visually distinguishing features are its polymer buttstock and two-piece polymer handguard. The buttstock has a 1-inch longer length of pull (better fitting for American shooters). The handguard features four Picatinny rail segments for the mounting of accessories. As well as molded checkered panels on the lower handguard aid grip, with numerous ventilation slots in the upper handguard to help cool the enclosed gas tube assembly.

Caliber: 7.62x39 mm 
Action Type: gas-operated, semi-automatic center-fire rifle 
Receiver: 4140 steel 
Barrel Length: 16 1⁄2"" 
Rifling: four-groove, 1:10"" RH twist 
Magazine: 10-round polymer  box magazine 
Sights: front post adjustable for elevation, rear adjustable for windage and elevation

Overall Length: 37 1⁄4"" 
Weight: 8 lbs. 
Accessories: two 10-round magazines

Personal Notes: I have logged many hours of training threw the US military with different firearms. This rifle surprised me in its accuracy it shoots better then expected with low recoil and because of the compensator muzzle climb is minimal. Excellent rifle I have put approximately 500 rounds threw it and have never had a jam.

Chassis and suspension are also in good condition.

It does need some work done to it.  The bellhousing is cracked, and needs to either be welded or replaced.  Both front axles need to be replaced to restore 4WD (safe 4WD) - which is about $100 in parts.  The accelerator sticks, which is an easy fix, and the windows need to be reset in their tracks.  It needs a new battery, and new battery cables.  There may be an issue with the fuel injector - the engine acts as though it is flooding when running, and runs rough at idle.  The motor and the transmission both are very sound - good compression in the heads and no known transmission issues.  In this model of the S10, the bellhousing is seperate from the transmission, not all of one pieces like future model years which makes the cracked part replaceable or repairable for a reasonable amount of money.

The Walther PPX M1 Centerfire Pistol is made of rugged polymer and has the famous Walther ergonomic grip. The low-profile, three-dot polymer combat sights aid in rapid aiming and target acquisition. Rear sight drift is adjustable for windage. Tenifer™-coated slide and barrel have a matte finish and resist corrosion. The loaded chamber viewport gives quick status inspection. Front and rear slide serrations provide a nonslip surface to operate the slide. Hammer-fired action won't snag on clothing. Ambidextrous slide stop locks back on empty and is extended for easy gloved operation. Two drop safeties and a firing pin block make for safer carry. Reversible push-button thumb-operated magazine release is conveniently located and reversible for left-or right-hand use. A constant 6.5-lb smooth trigger pull gives greater accuracy and control. The checkered trigger guard is perfect for a tactical two-handed grip stance. Mil-std-1913 Picatinny accessory mounting rail accepts lights, lasers or other tactical devices.

The solid, flat top receiver and side ejection allow for easy optic attachment (it's drilled and tapped). 
The design allows the user to remove the lever pivot screw with a common screwdriver. This allows removal of the lever, bolt and ejector for maintenance, which means that the user can clean the barrel from the breech, like a bolt-action rifle, avoiding wear to the muzzle. 
It has the cross-bolt hammer-block safety. The wood, metal, and bore are all in very good condition. The price is firm."

This holster uses belt loops at the front and rear to pull your handgun tight against your body for better concealment. The angle this holster positions your handgun allows faster drawing with full combat grip, more comfortable wearing, and much safer use.
A regular Small of the Back (SOB) holster places your gun over the base of the spine. A fall or hard blow with your gun in that position could cause serious spinal cord injury. This holster is engineered for kidney carry to avoid that danger.
Made of waterproof foam for a comfortable carry and to protect gun from moisture. Lined on both sides with rugged Cordura® nylon for durability and a smooth, fast draw. Webbing inside the holster protects your gun’s sights and keeps holster partially open for easier re-holstering. 
Great for use while driving. Comes with an adjustable thumb break to keep gun secure. Fits belts up to 1½” wide. Made in the USA."

Probably one of the best 9mm handguns ever made, extremely accurate and reliable (Do your research). I am selling this to go to a .45, its hard to find 9mm currently, but C'est la vie as they say.  

Now, this gun has been blued, which I would say is currently at about 95%, the mag disconnect has been removed and I have taken out the factory springs and reduced the trigger pull with brownell's springs. I would say it is somewhere in the 5-7 lb range. The gun has been taken care of and is a great deal considering that it is a real hi power, not a knock off. Furthermore, the gun also sports an extended safety from cylinder and slide. I would say the round count is somewhere between 50-150 round, this is my second hi power but I think it is time for a 1911, I will only sell to people with a valid driver license, also this price is non-negotiable so please no arab traders. 

Lastly, this gun comes with three magazines and the original box and instruction manual. I will also include the original parts, including the springs and safety (if you feel like changing the springs). I will also include 150 rounds of 9mm FMJ (target ammo)."

MAY 18TH 
Holiday Inn East – Wichita, KS
549 S. Rock Road
Class Starts at 9:00AM
$65.00

We are NRA Instructors, U.S. Marine, U.S. Army Snipers, Military Instructors and Competitive shooters

By completing this class you will then be eligible to apply for your Kansas Conceal Carry License through the Attorney General's office. The class covers CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Self Defense, and Interaction with Law Enforcement. 

We will cover weapons in part 1 of the class, then will go qualify. Qualifying is simple: At 3 yards, shoot one-handed (5 rounds);  At 7 yards, two-handed (10 rounds); At 10 yards, two-handed (10 rounds)

We break for lunch for approximately an hour, after which we cover the Law section of the class. After that is completed, we will review for the test and take the test.  Any missed question will be reviewed and corrected. We give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour block of instruction course. 

The one thing that separates us from others is, we go above and beyond with lots of hands-on especially with your stance and grip of handling your firearm. 

We take pride in the fact that after our hands-on part, NO ONE has ever failed the qualification.

        FlexLock intelligent bullets react to various barriers optimally
        Flex Tip bullets eliminate clogging to enhance penetration
        InterLock inhibits separation for optimal weight retention

The culmination of eight years of research and development to meet FBI protocols for duty ammunition. Its FlexLock® “intelligent bullets” react differently depending on the barrier they encounter. Flex Tip® technology eliminates bullet clogging while enhancing penetration. Jacket-to-core InterLock® inhibits separation for optimal weight retention when penetrating everything from auto glass to plywood and sheet metal. Nickel-plated cases resist corrosion and enhance visibility for chamber checks in low light. The result is superior tactical terminal performance. Made in USA."

New in the box NEVER fired! If you know what this is you know this is under priced. I will only do a face to face sale. Depending on where you live I'd be willing to drive a little bit. I'm selling due to having to do some major repairs on home. This was a spare that sat in the safe and was never fired. I purchased this through Ranier Arms so I will post their description of this rifle. If you need more pics ask & I'll try to post what you need. This rifle is chambered in 5.56mm.

Description:

Designed and manufactured by Lewis Machine & Tool Company, the patent-pending Monolithic Rail Platform, or MRP, is the most radical variation of an integrated rail system ever conceived.

The MRP completely replaces the upper receiver and provides an unprecedented level of versatility to the operator.

It has rarely left the nylon case I purchased for it shortly after buying the rifle.  I had intended to build it out for deer hunting but just never did.  

This is an exceedingly accurate platform out to half a kilometer, and plenty reliable beyond that with the right optics and in the hands of the right marksman.  The LTR designation means light tactical rifle, and it is primarily designed for SWAT snipers in urban environments where the heavy duty 20"" fluted bull barrel would be expected to perform reliably under heavy use at relatively short distances. It has a 4 round removable magazine, though I'm fairly certain you can find 10 rounds magazine systems if you so desire.

I'm mostly interested in trading, but I might consider selling it outright for the right offer."

Look, I don't know why Prvi continues to have the ugliest box on the market. I also don't know why their ammo description sounds like something out of a eastern european take out menu. I mean, read this:

A tradition is one of the most important preconditions for the large assortment production of high quality ammunition. PPU has this tradition, especially with pistol ammunition. You will be very happy with this ammo. Give it a try in your pistol and see what we mean.

What I do know is that whatever they lack in graphic artists, or english translation, they put into their bullets. These shoot clean, and shoot consistent everytime. Fun fact - Prvi uses the same line to produce their match ammo that they use to produce their regular grade ammo, the only difference is the powder and bullet. Precision of match ammo, with the cost of bulk.

This Ruger Model 77 Mark II features a controlled feed Mauser pattern action with a flat bottom receiver and an integral recoil lug, one piece bolt, full length Mauser type extractor, fixed ejector, steel hinged magazine floorplate, generous ejection port for fast loading from the top of the action, square bridge action with integral scope mount bases, and an innovative diagonal bedding screw. The barrel is precision hammer forged. The bolt release is at the left rear of the receiver, and the three position (Model 70 type) safety is located at the right rear of the receiver.

   The 7x57 was developed by the famous German firm of Mauser in 1892, and adopted by the Spanish government in 1893. Subsequently, several Latin American countries adopted the 7x57, including Mexico. In Europe, Serbia adopted the cartridge, and it became a popular sporting cartridge all over Europe. In Great Britain the 7x57 became so popular that the John Rigby Company adopted it as the .275 Rigby. Many bolt action rifles built in the UK were so marked. Under both names the cartridge was used extensively for plains and mountain game in Africa and Asia. Ammunition is manufactured and sold in Europe, Africa, North America and most of the world. The 7x57 is a true world-wide cartridge.
Swarovski Z5 scope:
The Z5 from SWAROVSKI OPTIK is a 1-inch rifle scope with 5x zoom – an innovative combination. Due to its high magnification and its large field of view, it is particularly versatile and eminently suitable for various types of hunting. The Z5 offers exceptional optical performance in a slim rifle scope.

Look at the link above for info on the amazing shotgun. 

The Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility, and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. Utilizing the proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"", and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments. The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech system which reduces recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less on average; that's more than a pound less! The ComforTech system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest-shooting, most reliable shotgun ever.

I'm not needing to get rid of this in a hurry by any means, I'm just seeing what's out there.  I'm more interested in trades than cash, but as far as cash goes I'm at $3,000 firm.  Things I'd be looking for in trade are guns only.  Primarily more modern assault or battle rifles.  I'm a big fan of .308 but if you have a well built AR15 I'll take a look."

889,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1634889,"For Sale:  Blaser R8 Pro Savanna, 9.3 X 62 , Right Hand","chicago, Illinois, United States","$ 1,500","Listed On: Friday, May 17, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"THE WORLDS LARGEST BLASER DEALER. Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. ""Blind"" magazine exchange The magazine buttons are positioned above the trigger guard and can be operated „blindly“. When pushing both buttons at the same time, the magazine releases directly into the shooter‘s hand. If required, a second loaded magazine can be inserted within a split second. The magazine is loaded by pushing in cartridges from above, so that pushing the cartridges under the magazine lips is not necessary. Thus, the magazine can be loaded easily, even when it is inserted into the rifle which is a huge advantage for active hunters. Magazine capacity: caliber group Mini: 5?+?1 Standard: 4?+?1 Magnum: 3+1 Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy. Success Factor: The stock Different from some traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. Due to the increased muzzle stability the felt recoil is substantially reduced. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Manual Cocking System The R8 offers the capability of safely stalking with a round in the chamber without any chance of discharge due to the innovative manual cocking system. Without the need to move your hand from the pistol grip you can silently push the cocking lever forward allowing the firing pin and spring to be cocked, ensuring a shot at a moments notice. To de-cock the system simply push the cocking lever forward with slight downward pressure and the lever will return to the neutral position removing all tension to the firing pin spring. For the past half century the Blaser manual cocking system has been recognized as one of the safest systems in hunting rifles.No conventional safety system can surpass the uncocked firing pin spring. To safely open the bolt, simply move the cocking lever forward until you meet the first resistance (about 3 mm?/?1/8“) to unlock the bolt handle. This slight movement will not cock the rifle and you can load and unload the rifle safely. Protected against unauthorized access The unique design of the intergrated trigger/magazine assembly allows the trigger/magazine unit to be removed and stored separately. This important safety feature protects against misuse by unauthorized persons. Automatic Decocking By removing the trigger/magazine unit the R8 can no longer be cocked. Additionally removing the system from a cocked rifle, the cocking lever will return to the de-cocked position. Short and huntable The unique design of the R8 magazine above the trigger allows the overall lenght of the rifle to be 9 cm (3?½“) shorter than conventional bolt action rifles. This innovative feature proves to be a distinct advantage in all terrain. Perfectly balanced The combination of overall length, total weight and balance sets a new standard for bolt action rifles. The balanced weight distribution allows for fast handling and quick target acquisition. Safely stored, ready in a split second In situations when hunters have to walk long distances, it is more comfortable to carry the rifle stripped down in a backpack. If required, the rifle can be reassembled in a split second, without influencing the point of impact. When traveling, the R8 can be transported stripped down in a rifle case. In contrast to very long conventional rifle cases, passers-by do not recognize the R8’s inconspicuous rifle case. Locked Magazine The double release buttons protect the magazine against unintentional drop out. Our innovation does not stop there. We also incorporated a locking device for the hunter who prefers a non-detachable magazine. When the magazine is locked in place, and with an open bolt, the rifle can be loaded from the top. Protected All metal parts of the R8 are either made of rustproof material or otherwise protected against corrosion. The closed construction of the R8 action prevents contaminants from entering the rifle. Every magazine comes with a protective cover (1) preventing dirt from entering the rifle when the magazine is stored outside of it. When taking out the magazine, the magazine chamber can be closed with a magazine chamber cover (2) which is included in the scope of delivery. Desmodromic Trigger Mechanism The critical link between shooter and rifle is the trigger. The R8 offers the next leap in technology. Upon cycling the action, the trigger is reset mechanically. This innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing. This important design feature offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Hunting around the world There is no better advantage to a hunter than the ability to use one rifle anywhere in the world. With calibers ranging from .222 Rem to .416 Rem. Mag. there are no limitations for your Blaser. and more to come. Several rifle scopes on one barrel Every barrel is prepared for the Original Blaser Saddle Mount. This allows for several rifle scopes to be used with one barrel."

952,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1634952,For Sale:  AIMPOINT COMP M4 M68 CCO W/FLIP UP CAPS AND 3X MAGNIFIER,"warner robins, Macon, Georgia",$ 550,"Listed On: Friday, May 17, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Downsizing some of my accessories.... So here you have it.... Like new Aimpoint CompM4 M68 CCO. Includes killflash and flip up caps as well as the standard lens covers. Also included is a UTG 3X Magnifier. Unlike the EOtech, the Aimpoint CompM4 is great not only for close quarters, but long distance as well!

Some info on the CompM4:

The CompM4 sight features an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring, and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of weapon systems. Can run continuously on a AA for 8 years. 

Designed for 3rd generation night vision technology
The CompM4 sight can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility.
The performance of CompM4 sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology.

The clearest, brightest image possible
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).

Ready for use around the clock
With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 sight is ready for round the clock use.

Unique features of the CompM4
High battery compartment

Unique features of the CompM4 and CompM4s
Compatible with every generation of NVD
ACET technology allows up to 80,000 hours (over 8 years) of daytime operation on one AA battery
Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery
7 NVD settings and 9 daylight settings
QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation and lower the risk of snagging on other gear
Mount base is keyed into to the body of the sight to absorb recoil
Mount base screws directly into the sight – no separate sight ring required.
500,000 hours of use on NVD setting
2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement
Matches perfectly with Aimpoint® 3XMag
Unequalled light transmission
Front lens opening is threaded for addition of killFlash® anti-reflective device
