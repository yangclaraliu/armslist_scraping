The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.

To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.

The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

Face to face only, in my county. This means I will not travel to NY, CA or some other place outside NC. In fact, it means in person where I can look you in the eye (Skype does not count). Furthermore, it does not mean I will ship it to you, because I will not. 
If you are still uncertain about what face to face means, I suggest you ask someone who can better explain it than I.

No trades considered.

I am not giving this weapon away. If that is what you are looking for, you might try going to Mexico where I understand the US government is pretty much giving away guns, though that program may have stopped.

I had thought the line above would be self explanatory, but apparently not. If you believe this is too high a price and the S&W price offends you, I suggest you shop elsewhere as there are quite a few .22 caliber revolvers out there that can be had for less and I suggest you try one of those. 
Also, S&W list these new for $959 so go buy that. Or, look on Gunbroker where you will find them at equal or higher prices BEFORE you add in shipping."

I'm selling my AR-15 so I can get a new shotgun.  I built this myself and it is the proverbial tack driver.  It's got about 1500 rounds through it, so it's already broken in but still has plenty of life left in the barrel.  It will shoot 1/2 MOA with match ammo.  It's not picky about ammo, it will cycle anything I throw at it.  

Trigger is stock GI with modified trigger spring.  Break is very clean and a little bit lighter than a regular GI trigger.  It has a Magpul PRS stock and MIAD grip.

The only thing I never got around to changing out was the tubular aluminum handguard.  I did modify it to take a lower rail segment for a bipod as seen in the picture.  The bipod is included, but it's an NcStar cheapy that I threw on in a hurry for a competition and I'm definitely not charging anything extra for it.

The optic is a Bushnell Banner Elite 9-18 x 50mm.  Butler Creek flip-up caps are included.  Extras will be 2x20rd Pmags and 3x30rd Pmags.  

I'll be adding some pictures of the carrier/bolt face later tonight.

$1400, or make me an offer.

Good day,

I am offering a group buy on weapon optics or other accessories.  The more people I have all at one time the cheaper a price I can offer on what everyone wants.  I am a dealer so sales tax will apply.  

The minimum for this group buy will be 10 people, if we can't get 10 people I will still try to place the order but I will not be able to guarantee the discount.  I will not be able to give a solid price quote until I have at least 5 people interested and will form a list on this thread by what you are interested in so you can track the status.

Thank you,

There are no masker on the barrel witch are common for Glocks and most polymer pistols. I would like a full size pistol most likely an XDM or a S&W M&P. I would except $540 for the pistol. Not a bad deal if you consider the taxes and CBI fee from a dealer. Thank you

I've dropped the price to move it out the door.  Some kid needs to appreciate this thing.  It has one easy to fix fault... and I am rather annoyed that it happened...  (hence the price drop) other than normal sitting around wear: A potential buyer contacted me and wanted me to disassemble the rifle. I did so. In so doing the decorative screw forward of the trigger guard took a one way trip into the unknown  cracks of my deck. It is decorative and not a part of the working mechanisms of the rifle.  My mistake is your gain - but don't ask me for any favors in taking my equipment apart to review for you. No good deed goes unpunished. Otherwise this rifle is in good looking shape and a nice plinker

No other rifle holds the power and mystique of the legendary Winchester® Model 70® Super Grade - the ultimate expression of the rifleman's rifle. For the first time ever. This is a matched set of four truly unique limited production Winchester Model 70 Super Grade rifles, each of which is chambered in a cartridge that's ideal for the game animals they commemorate, and is so marked on the magazine floor plate. Only 100 of these sets were manufactured for Midway USA Foundation by Winchester.

The varmint rifle is chambered in the blistering 22-250 Remington, the deer/antelope in the flat shooting 270 Winchester, the elk/moose in the potent 300 Winchester Magnum and the dangerous game rifle in the bone crushing 375 H&H Magnum. All of the classic Model 70 Super Grade features are present - the fancy grade checkered walnut stock with shadow line cheek piece and ebony fore-end tip, the engraved cross bolt head and the traditional Super Grade pistol grip cap. Each of these beautiful rifles is built with the Pre-'64  style action that offers a forged steel receiver, massive external claw extractor, controlled round feeding and reliable blade ejection. The pictures do not do these rifles justice. They are stunning.

Not only did Winchester only make 100 of these 4 rifle sets but...they do not make a Model 70 SuperGrade in 22-250 or 375 H&H Mag. This adds to the value and uniqueness of this set. These rifles are NIB...never been fired. In 2012 one of these sets auctioned for $16,000.00 up in Wyoming in a Wild Sheep Foundation Auction. See link...
