This pistol is the ultimate custom carry pistol. It is finished in T. Birdsongs custom Black-T finish (tefflon). The front strap is hand checkered, as it the back strap. It has a custom high ride beaver tail grip safety, full length guide rod, beautiful custom rosewood grips, slightly extended thumb safety, extended magazine release, custom skeletonized trigger and custom trigger job (clean, crisp 4.5 lb trigger pull), low profile tritium night sights. The pistol includes 2 standard colt magazine and 2 Chip McCormack 7 round magazine. I have the original owners manual, hard plastic box and outer cardboard box. 

It cost me $1500 to have this gun built but it is the ultimate concealed carry 45. The pistol functions flawlessly with all types of ammunition and truly is the finest example of this type of pistol you will ever see or shoot.

I am willing to sell it for $1300 cash. I am FIRM on the price. I am also willing to consider trades + cash but please, no junk. I am interested in the newer Glock 30s, a Daniel Defense AR15 or a Colt LE6920 or better Colt AR15.

Only been to the range twice; cleaned both times afterwards. I started building it right at Christmas time and after the events, I had to get parts from a whole bunch of manufacturers: 
BCM 16"" stainless 1/8 barrel
spike's enhanced lower parts kit
BCM mod 4 charging handle
spike's stock kit
PSA lower

Incuded with the gun is one pmag with the window, one aluminum magazine, and 240 rounds of green tip 855. Can also have the spare ammo box and the Tapco armorer's tool. I bought the pelican 1720 case brand new and took my time to cut out the foam. It's a snug fit. I've got some of the original parts boxes if so desired. I've also got most if not all of the paperwork/receipts for the parts as well. I might be forgetting a few things but if I remember I'll update the ad. I would prefer to sell the gun locally face to face but if you want to have it shipped I'll split the FFL transfer costs with you for the gun but the ammo will be shipped at your expense. You can reply to the ad or call/text Greg at 315-five9three-4one4five. I check email regularly and always have my phone on me as long as I'm not at work. Get ahold of me if you have any questions.

Everything you see in this picture is what you get, these mags are steel not the junk tapco or promags. I see other SKS's out there but none that are giving you 4 mags! Some SKS type 56's take AK mags, but at a cost of removing metal from the receiver and bolt. This rifle weighs about 8.4 pounds unloaded w/ no mags. Plenty of Tacti-cool aftermarket upgrades out there and this rifle is waiting for you to add them on there. Since I bought this rifle it has been nothing but a safe queen and honestly I think someone out there can put it to good use. I'm also advertising this rifle on other web sites, word of mouth, and local gun stores. If this rifle sell via one of those mediums I reserve the right to end this listing at my convenience. I listed rifle at $750 but am willing to work on the price if I think offer is reasonable, if you catch me on a good day I may do $650, I'm also open to cash and trade but only if   hammer less snub nose revolver from S&W, Ruger LCR, Taurus, or Springfield XD45 or S&W M&P 45 or M&P 9mm. Will consider Remington 700 in .308 but that's it not looking for anything else. St.Louis area FTF sales only, has to be in public place too many bad people on the internet. If you try to low ball me I wont even reply, low balling being less than what I am asking so please don't waste your time or mine."

I also have a Rock Band/Guitar Hero Bundle for PS3.  Rock Band, Guitar Hero Bundle two guitars, one rock band and one guitar hero but both guitars work for either game, drums that work for most of both types of games, extra add on cymbals, an extra pedal that works with the original pedal as a double pedal I think it is called the metal pedal, rubber tipped drum sticks, professional microphone stand, microphone, and all receivers. The only flaw I think I know of is the drum kit and one guitar is missing the battery cover. The drum kit covers well with a good clear packing tape as well as guitar. The covers can be picked up also on ebay for a couple bucks. The games included are Rock Band 1, Rock Band 2, AC/DC Rock Band, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero Legends of Rock, Guitar Hero 5, Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and Guitar Hero Metallica. I WILL NOT SPLIT UP THIS LOT FOR A GUITAR OR DRUMS OR A GAME SO DO NOT ASK. I want somebody to get it that has never had guitar hero and can enjoy the whole lot. If I split up the lot they do not have the original Guitar for one of the games. Per say I always favored the Rock Band guitar but kids favored the Guitar Hero. Thank you very much for looking. I am pretty firm on the price may budge a little or trade and cash. Go to ebay and price the guitars alone and the two I am listing go for upwards of $50 plus with bids on auctions that are ending soon. May consider trade for things that go bang on my part, and even cash on my part depending on what it is. 150 Cash Text me at 440-231-7113

The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. These magazines are going to be banned in Colorado very soon, however you will be allowed to keep any that you have bought before the ban.

Some of the possible uses for this revolver is as a pack gun while hunting or camping.  Of course there are defensive possibilities, target shooting and general plinking. I have considered hunting Hog and Bear with this revolver, but never have.

For the hand-loaders, there are numerous ways to load the .45 Colt everything from mild recoil to near .44 Mag performance (Due to the strength of the Ruger frame), but as always consult a reliable reloading manual.

This gun has  matching serial numbers on the bolt, barrel and magazine. It was made in 1939 and has the ""STAR"" on the barrel which is pretty cool. Also included is the bayonet and 60 rounds of surplus ammo - the corrosive stuff. The stock is in fairly good condition , with a great deep, dark color to it. I have not yet cleaned it up and still had cosmoline covering the bolt. It needs a little TLC, but will turn out great. 

It has a dime size nick on the right side up near the sling hole, as well as some small scratches on the butt of the stock.

I have a Rainier Arms matched upper/lower set, lower is complete with RRA LPK and NM trigger, Ergo Deluxe pistol grip in FDE, charging handle. Has seen maybe 60-80 rounds, and that is being very generous, i've had it out to zero a couple times and some 150m or so shooting. That being said, receivers are in spectacular shape. Items for sale are less the barrel assbly, forearm, and BCG. I guess for the right offer I could include the BCG but it's unlikely. It's a Young Manufacturing NM BCG. I bought all of these parts together last year brand new, and it's pretty much an extra set of receivers at this point (and i'm not hard up for cash or trades). 

I'm looking for a Mossberg 930 SPX, that's what i'd really like to make a trade on, or for 223 ammo, or Sig 238. Anyways, let me know if you're interested and what you have. I'll work on getting actual pictures up, but when they are up remember the whole barrel assbly and TRX forearm are not included, nor the LMT Sopmod stock unless it's desired and the deal is right. The LMT Sopmod in that case, would be a never used black stock. I'm not out to rape anyone, just want a deal to make both sides happy. Consider cash offers, lemme know what you got. You can go to RA's website and price all of this stuff out and it'll come to just about $1k total. This is the ""normal"" retail prices, so keep that in mind for trades in the ""new"" market value. That would hike up the value of my items as well. Thanks"

This is not a ""panic buy"" price but an actual current market value for a collectible caliber rifle upper. Although the ammo is available, these rifle uppers are not. They are very hard to find. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. That is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of these uppers are no longer in production they will continue to rise in value even after the ""panic buy""  market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson introduced the M&P15R Rifle Upper Receiver Assembly). This rifle upper is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifle upper comes with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight.
