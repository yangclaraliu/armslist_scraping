136,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1115136,For Sale:  Remington Rand Fireproof Safe,"Lowville, NY, Syracuse, New York","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, February 20, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a beautiful safe I really wish I could keep. It served for a number of years as the village safe for the Village of Lowville. It was in the county building that for some time housed their court (traffic court I believe), municipal offices, police storage, etc. This safe is huge. I had to remove the doors and contents to move it out of the building when I bought this. The safe is in excellent condition. The walls on this are incredibly thick. It can be rolled around with two people on the casters, but moving it up or down stairs is a difficult proposition. We used a load-all fork lift to get it down the stairs when we bought it. It could probably be loaded onto a trailer with ramps and a trailer winch. It is UL listed 

The interior dimensions are 57"" tall, 20"" deep, and 34"" wide. Exterior dimensions are 40 ½"" wide, 31"" deep (not counting the dial or handle) and 68"" tall (not counting the casters and caster base). There is also a cap for the safe for a nice, finished appearance that adds some to the width and depth, but almost nothing to the height. The interior can be rearranged and configured many different ways with the slide in tray system. All the pull out files work well, and I have the keys for the interior locking sections (good for keeping ammo separate from guns if required in your location). The slide in wall sections can also be removed for more space

I have the combination for the lock, and the access panel is still present, so a competent locksmith could probably change the combination if you wanted, or possibly even swap out the whole mechanism for a more modern system (think digital. . .). 

I do not know the exact age of this safe, but I do know it is an older model. The exterior is still in remarkably good condition and with a good cleaning would look at home in most locations, or with a coat of paint could easily be a centerpiece of a room. I have the pins and bearings for the doors, and would be happily to help a buyer put the doors back on their hinges. Most of the bearings are in remarkably good condition, but a supplier could most certainly get replacement bearings and have everything looking like new. While the doors are removable, once the lock is engaged, removing the pins for the hinges has no effect, since the doors lock into the frame of the safe and each other. 

For questions, or to see this in person, Please call David at REDACTED or send an email.  Remember, the price is just a starting point for negotiations!

I'm also open to possible trades for guns.  I like black powder, long range, AR platforms, kel-tecs, pistols, carbines, antiques, unique...  You name it, I might have a soft spot for it.  Particularly interested in an AR, Sharps, tactical Rem870 or Mossberg 500, or custom flintlocks.  

I can't get pictures to post (can't get them to resize...) but pictures are available on a craigslist add if anyone is interested, or email me for the high-res versions on photobucket"

SWD Cobray Mac 11 9mm threaded barrel, 2 high cap zytel mags, 1 low cap zytel mag like new, 1989 serial number. 100 round count.

Glock 27, gen 3, like new, 50 round count.

.45 ACP	$750.00
HK USP 45 Compact, real nice, 250 round count.

7.62x39 	$850.00
Norinco MAK-90 has the larger diameter barrel, 1.5mm thick receiver without the slant cut.  This makes it easier for adding a traditional wood stock and pistol grip. Also has the double hook disconector. The fit and finish on this MAK is nice, comes with one magazine, zero round count.

All together this list totals $3000.00.  I believe I priced each firearm reasonable.  However, with that said I am looking to sell as a package.  I could easily ask and additional $25.00 on each firearm bringing the total price to $3,125.00.  

If you are interested in buying everything as a package deal, I will sweeten the deal by including (15) 20 round unused aluminum AR-15 magazines free. If priced at $20 each would total $300.00, which again is very reasonable. These 20 round magazines make it easy for bench rest shooting.

If I was to sell each item individually including magazines I could potentially sell everything for $3,425.00.  But I do not want to spend the next two weeks meeting FTF with many potential buyers trying to determine if they’re lawfully able to own such firearms.  But I will in the event no one is interested in a complete package. Asking price $3000.00

Interested buyers must at least verify proof of Ohio residency and I would prefer a CCW permit holder for peace of mine.  
I will require a bill of sale for my personal records only that will record each firearm serial number sold and who I sold it to.

I will not sell firearms to underage persons, 21 yrs old for handguns.

Soon as I have more time or no one buys this package. I will begin posting each firearm individually and interested buyers will be able to view my other postings from this post.

Thank you for looking."

 LWRC M6A2 DEA
Black 5.56 
In Stock, Ready to Ship

Brand New! NO credit card fees!!


The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

The special DEA configuration M6A2 has all of the standard features of the M6A2 plus some added features found only with this rifle. The standard features found in our rifles include our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas-piston system, NiCorr™ treated hammer-forged barrels, nickel-boron coated bolt group, our Advanced Combat Bolt (ACB), and Enhanced Fire Control Group. In addition, the DEA configuration will feature a YHM Phantom flash hider as well as an engraving of the US Flag on the magazine well.

bushmaster

One of the world's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models, the Bushmaster M4 features the distinctive M4 barrel profile and a six-position telestock for ease of deployment. The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a ""birdcage"" type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9 right-handed twist. Shipped complete with 30-round magazine, a safety and operations manual, and a carrying sling.

It also features Slide Lock so you can easily take the light on or off in an instant.

Mossberg shotguns currently designated ""law enforcement models"" are 590A1s. 590A1s differ from other 500/590 shotguns, in that they have heavy barrels, metal trigger guards, and metal safeties. 590A1s are available in 14-inch (36 cm), 18.5-inch (47 cm), and 20-inch (51 cm) barrels. The 590A1 is also used by the U.S. and allied armed forces, having been designed to meet the stricter standards outlined by the U.S. Army."

I am very impressed with the results.  You essentially create a contact wound with a 12 ga.  This is the principle of a glaser safety bullet.  The shot moves as one mass and upon contact breaks apart to create an absolutley devastating wound channel.  You need to go to you tube and see the effect.

I create these the correct way.  The crimp is removed and the shot replaced in a hard wax solution.  These will function safely in all shotguns but if you have an auto the low brass may not have enough pressure to cycle.  These rounds are safe due to the fact that there is less payload and therefore less pressure with the same powder charge.  Please do not confuse these with the unsafe process of cutting the hull about 95% and allowing the entire hull to exit the barrel.  The hull is designed to be seated in the chamber and is therefore an increased diameter.  

I made 250 rnds for my friends (after we saw the results at the range I have been busy) and one suggested that others would be interested in the shells as they may not have the equipment, time, gear, or just don't want to mess with it. So I decided to give it a try.  We have to do this face-to-face as the economics don't make sense for a few rounds.  The minimium order is 20 rounds."

The top of the barrel is marked “Colt’s Pt. F.A. Manufacturing Co. Hartford, CT. U.S.A.”. The left side of the frame is marked “Pat. Sept. 19, 1871 / July 2,72 Jan. 19,75” and with the Rampant Colt logo. The underside of the frame is marked “SA50008”. The rear face of the cylinder is marked “0008”. The front left side of the trigger guard is marked “VP” in a triangle and the rear “O”. The right side of the trigger guard is marked “Z” at the front.

Barrel Length: 12” (one foot!)

Sights / Optics: This revolver is mounted with a grooved top strap and a tall blade front sight.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are checkered black plastic with the Rampant Colt in an oval and an Eagle on each side. The grips show only a very small nick on the bottom edge of the left grip and a light scratch on the bottom of the right grip. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition.

Type of Finish: The barrel, ejector rod housing, cylinder and grip frame are blued, with a case colored receiver. The top of the hammer is blued and checkered, while the sides are in the white.

Finish Originality: All Original

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is deep. There is no erosion.

Overall Condition: This revolver retains about 99.5% of its metal finish. There is a mark on the bottom of the frame on the right side just below the bottom-most screw. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. Overall, this gun rates in about Excellent condition.

Mechanics: The cylinder has a tight lockup, and the trigger is light and crisp. The action functions correctly. We have not fired this revolver.

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: This revolver comes in a long brown cardboard box with no factory markings that is much longer than the revolver. The box has several strips of clear tape on the cover. The edges show light wear, but the corners are not torn. The inside of the box is lined with grey open cell foam. The foam shows the imprint from the revolver, but otherwise has no damage. The box is in overall Very Good condition. The paperwork consists of a “Colt Companion”, a Colt Instruction Manual and a list of Authorized Repair Stations, all in Excellent condition.

Our Assessment: This is a great looking single action Colt that has been well taken care of. It is similar to that worn by Hugh O’Brian in the TV Western “The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp” although there is no proof that Colt ever made a buntline revolver back in the day, or that Wyatt Earp ever owned one. This revolver is great for Cowboy Action competition – a little long for competitive speed, but you would sure gather style points with a pair of these in your holsters. Or, just keep it in the safe like the last owner, and take it out and admire it every once in a while."
