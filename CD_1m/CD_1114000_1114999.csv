Also have 4 brand new latest-gen Black Dog metal lip conversion mags, sold out everywhere, available either separately or with the rifle for additional cost. 

 So, a complete dedicated .22 AR and up to 6 hi-cap mags, 4 of them the kind with mag bodies that can open up for rebuilding for feed lip and spring replacement, important now that there are no more to be had! 

-NOTE- This is a complete factory rifle built for .22lr. The lower is polymer, and while the lower looks standard, internally it is set up with a blowback hammer (designed for more reliable function with 9mm and .22 uppers), a lighter hammer spring, and no buffer in the stock at all (blowback uppers usually don't use buffers).
 This is -NOT- a standard lower as it is configured, it is currently configured for .22lr only, so as be more reliable at what it is doing.
 If you need a standard lower built with standard GI parts I have them, but this isn't one of them.

Brand new, never fired except for the test rounds from the factory and never carried or holstered. The gun looks phenomenal but it's a bit impractical for something to use for an everyday carry gun. My asking price is fair and no sales tax is required so that's just more money saved by a buyer. I'm also sure that if you look hard enough you can probably find one somewhere on the internet that's cheaper, albeit not brand new. So if you can find a better deal, by all means snatch it up. The stat's for the gun can be found below. I'm honestly just hoping to sell the gun outright but I wouldn't turn down a good trade. Must have a valid Concealed Carry Permit or Purchase Permit and a valid drivers license. I can make a bill of sale when the time comes to that. If you want to buy the gun I'm pretty flexible with when you can come and look at it. I prefer for you to come to me but I can travel around Wilmington if need be. Gas prices are a bitch so keep that in mind please. Thanks for reading. The stuff below is from the SIG SAUER website

He is copying listings already on Arms List and trying to pass it off as his own. The reason I know this is I purchased a gun 2 days ago and the same exact listing showed up again today. I contacted the seller to act as though I was interested in buying it. The reply I got was from a different email address. I then called the previous person I purchased the gun from and he had no clue about this new listing. The scammer would only except pay pal payment and would ship out the gun. He would not meet FTF even though he lived in the same city as I do. So I then looked ""sellers other listings"" and found he had listings in Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico and Florida. And all of the listings were items that were selling well below market value. Examples are a Sig AR15 for $1300, a S&W MP 40c for $300, and a AK47 for $600. So please look out for the following email and pay pal accounts. Email was jamesskinner271@yahoo.com and pay pal account is jcskinn@bellsouth.net . I can only assume his name is James Skinner.

This is an immaculate MSAR (Microtech Small Arms Research) STG 5.56, serial # in the 8K range so it was after all the early problems were fixed, and it has the original Steyr AUG style 1.5x optic sight with the cross/circle reticle.  For those who don't know, this is an American made IMPROVEMENT on the original Steyr AUG rifle that was banned way back in the early 1990s and became instantly scarce and collectible; this rifle improved on feed and function, used modern polymers to make it even more resistant to damage and failures, and still has product support available in Pennsylvania!  This takes the plastic Steyr-type mags, and will actually accept surplus AUG mags which are actually pretty easy to find and no more expensive than decent AR mags.  I will include 3 mags with this gun, 1 ea 10rd, 30rd and 42 rd, and I have others available for additional cost if the buyer wants to deal.  

This rifle has been fired less than 50 rds and comes in the original factory box with all paperwork, gun lock, etc.  This is NOT a rifle you see every day, and I'll tell you what---not only is it cooler and wilder looking than even the most tricked out AR, but it's damn accurate, smooth as can be and is so short and compact with the bullpup design that accurate one-handed point fire out to 50 meters is a breeze!

I'm looking for $2200 cash, or possible trades for other ""not so usual"" quality firearms.  CDNN had one of these the other day for $3995, and most of the ones on Gunbroker are selling for $2000-$2500 with one 10 rd magazine and a flattop.  This one has the factory optic as well as the extra picatinny rail in case you want to mount another sight option."

These stock sets are not easy to find and are not cheap! Why spend $1500 on a Romanian Wasr when you can own a Polytech for around the same price. Polytech AK's are top of the line and feature the thicker 1.6mm receiver. These AK's are known for their reliability and their quality.

This gun is a late model, manufactured in 1975, making it one of the highest-quality and most reliable Commandos out there. It uses 30-round M3 Grease Gun mags, which are still cheap and plentiful on GunBroker - much cheaper than actual Thompson 20-round stick mags. The receiver, 16-inch barrel, compensator, and magazine have been recently refinished in DuPont Teflon black at a cost of $250, and look excellent. It has been thoroughly cleaned and lubed, and only 5 rounds have been fired since the refinish to ensure proper function. 

I am also including a spare lower receiver, which I had planned to refinish and convert to use a genuine Thompson wooden handgrip and trigger, as well as the mechanism required to convert the stock to a push-button release, again emulating a genuine Thompson. The wooden buttstock can be easily removed with two screws, and the gun is quite fun to shoot without the stock. I am also including a spare ejector, ejector pin, and ejector spring, good spare parts to have around. It has the rock-solid feel and fun of a Thompson to shoot, at a significantly lower cost. 

33rd-edition of the Blue Book of Gun Values places the value of this rifle in good condition at $825, which does not include the spare parts. I am willing to accept offers in the neighborhood of $725. Full and partial trade offers will be considered, but I am most in need of the cash. As much as I don't want to admit it, it may not be possible to sell this gun (or mag) without a costly FFL transfer in Colorado soon, so this is a good opportunity to pick this gun up before that nonsense goes into effect. 

I am in need of funds quickly, so I would like to sell this today or tomorrow. For this reason, please call me on my cell phone at 720-987-4060 to arrange a meeting."

Patriot Brown 5.56 
In Stock, Ready to Ship

Brand New! NO credit card fees!!


The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

This is an immaculate MSAR (Microtech Small Arms Research) STG 5.56, serial # in the 8K range so it was after all the early problems were fixed, and it has the original Steyr AUG style 1.5x optic sight with the cross/circle reticle.  For those who don't know, this is an American made IMPROVEMENT on the original Steyr AUG rifle that was banned way back in the early 1990s and became instantly scarce and collectible; this rifle improved on feed and function, used modern polymers to make it even more resistant to damage and failures, and still has product support available in Pennsylvania!  This takes the plastic Steyr-type mags, and will actually accept surplus AUG mags which are actually pretty easy to find and no more expensive than decent AR mags.  I will include 3 mags with this gun, 1 ea 10rd, 30rd and 42 rd, and I have others available for additional cost if the buyer wants to deal.  

This rifle has been fired less than 50 rds and comes in the original factory box with all paperwork, gun lock, etc.  This is NOT a rifle you see every day, and I'll tell you what---not only is it cooler and wilder looking than even the most tricked out AR, but it's damn accurate, smooth as can be and is so short and compact with the bullpup design that accurate one-handed point fire out to 50 meters is a breeze!

I'm looking for $2200 cash, or possible trades for other ""not so usual"" quality firearms.  CDNN had one of these the other day for $3995, and most of the ones on Gunbroker are selling for $2000-$2500 with one 10 rd magazine and a flattop.  This one has the factory optic as well as the extra picatinny rail in case you want to mount another sight option."

775,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1114775,For Sale:  7.62x39 Russian AKM Saiga COMPLETE CONVERSION RARE!!,"Seattle, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,800","Listed On: Thursday, February 21, 2013",Rifles,Saiga                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"A Russian semiautomatic AKM rifle. This is a Saiga which has been COMPLETELY converted into an AKM type AK, unlike other lame conversions. This Russian AK can accept any mil spec magazine, accept a muzzle attachment without use of a crush washer, attach a bayonet, hold a cleaning kit and rod, have a pistol grip, and have a rear sight that is marked all the way.

Unlike cheaply made WASRS that have cheap American made barrels (which are cranked out to make a profit alone), Saigas have superrior cold hammer forged chrome lined barrels. Since Saigas are made in an actual AK factory and not built from worn out surplus parts, their quality can be trusted.

Rifle has had 300 rounds put through it with no malfunction.

Rifle comes with box, magazine pouch, 4 steel mil spec mags, 120 rounds WPA military classic, chrome lined muzzle brake, cleaning kit and rod, bayonet, sling. The rifle is wearing an Arsenal polymer stock set right now, which reduces weight, dissipates and resists heat better, and is more resistant to the elements. It has an Arsenal single stage trigger with a bolt hold open feature which can be removed if so desired.

UNIQUE FEATURES:

Riveted AKM trigger guard- Unlike other Saiga conversions, this one has a riveted trigger guard. Others simply bolt a bent piece of metal onto the receiver. This one had the old magazine latch removed, and a new magazine latch/ trigger guard riveted into place.

AK74 style rear trigger guard rivet- Most AK rifles in the U.S. lack this correct rear rivet. Arsenal rifles and stock Saiga rifles have these special rivets due to advances in trigger designs. Rifles without this rivet can accept some triggers, but not a true copy of a Russian trigger group (as sold by Arsenal). The addition of such a rivet guarantees a larger selection of trigger groups.

Mil spec handguard retainer- Other Saigas are being sold with cheesy bolt on handguard retainers. Little puny ones that hold on the barrel with loctite and some screws. Although they work, they are nowhere near as rugged as the original military version. This rifle has a standard Russian handguard retainer, and will accept any regular AK furniture without having to screw things on and off the barrel.

Front sight/ Gas block- This rifle has a gas block with an intact bayonet lug, and has an AKM front sight as well. This combo allows for the attachment of a bayonet and cleaning rod.

Threaded muzzle- Allows for attachment of muzzle brakes or flash hiders.

Bullet guide- Allows for use of regular AK magazines.

Trigger group- Arsenal single stage with bolt hold open feature

LWRC M6A2 
FDE 5.56 
In Stock, Ready to Ship

Brand New! NO credit card fees!!


The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

This is an immaculate MSAR (Microtech Small Arms Research) STG 5.56, serial # in the 8K range so it was after all the early problems were fixed, and it has the original Steyr AUG style 1.5x optic sight with the cross/circle reticle.  For those who don't know, this is an American made IMPROVEMENT on the original Steyr AUG rifle that was banned way back in the early 1990s and became instantly scarce and collectible; this rifle improved on feed and function, used modern polymers to make it even more resistant to damage and failures, and still has product support available in Pennsylvania!  This takes the plastic Steyr-type mags, and will actually accept surplus AUG mags which are actually pretty easy to find and no more expensive than decent AR mags.  I will include 3 mags with this gun, 1 ea 10rd, 30rd and 42 rd, and I have others available for additional cost if the buyer wants to deal.  

This rifle has been fired less than 50 rds and comes in the original factory box with all paperwork, gun lock, etc.  This is NOT a rifle you see every day, and I'll tell you what---not only is it cooler and wilder looking than even the most tricked out AR, but it's damn accurate, smooth as can be and is so short and compact with the bullpup design that accurate one-handed point fire out to 50 meters is a breeze!

I'm looking for $2200 cash, or possible trades for other ""not so usual"" quality firearms.  CDNN had one of these the other day for $3995, and most of the ones on Gunbroker are selling for $2000-$2500 with one 10 rd magazine and a flattop.  This one has the factory optic as well as the extra picatinny rail in case you want to mount another sight option."

I had big plans for a build, but unfortunately ran into some unexpected bills.  The lower is mil spec standard High Grade Aerospace Billet Aluminum 7075-T6 with a solid trigger guard, flared magwell for smooth mag loads, and a lower to upper nylon tipped tensioning screw.  It also has a sweet design on the magwell. Better pics can be seen at http://northtechdefense.com/ , but this is by far the nicest lower I have ever held.

Also included in this package are 5 boxes of Herter's ammo (100 rds total) and (2) brand new 30 round mags in package.  One is a steel E-lander mag (made for Israel special forces) and the other is a forest green Magpul PMAG with dust cover.

I am asking $450 for the whole package or best offer.  The only trade I would possibly consider would be a Sig238, but would prefer a sale as I need the money more right now.

I tried to take the best pics I could, but please feel free to ask questions.  This will be listed on a couple of forums, so first come first served."

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.
