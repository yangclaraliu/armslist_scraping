Standard Saiga 12 Accessories
*5 Round factory magazine

Options & Extras
*Factory last round bolt hold open (LRBHO)!
*10 Round magazine x 2
*Threaded barrel (w/ protector)
*ATI Saiga Talon Tactical Shotgun 6 Position Polymer Stock

Other than bolting up the new stock (no gunsmithing required), this Saiga 12 has not been messed around with by untrained hands.

In addition to the general greatness and popularity of this semi-automatic shotgun, the threaded barrel option opens it up to a world of choke options for hunting use.

The LRBHO is an option only found on the Saigas recently imported to the US. It's somewhat rare, and provides a big advantage when it comes to loading mags into the receiver cleanly and quickly.

These were nowhere to be be found at the Redmond gun show two weekends ago.

On this deal I prefer cash, but will consider offers including $1,200 cash, and the balance in trade.

At Uncle Ben's we are in the information business. We feel that the more you know about firearms, maintenance, storage, ammunition, reloading, collecting, and refurbishing, the better off we all will be.

Over the course of my life I have seen many examples of poorly maintained, and badly refurbished firearms. It is my sincere hope to accurately provide everyone with the information needed to keep their firearms in great condition for generations to come.

Quality firearm restoration and maintenance has been a hobby of mine for years, I am not, however, a licensed gunsmith. I am a collector and firearm enthusiast with a class 03 FFL. It is my hope to eventually obtain my class 01 FFL and open a small custom firearm and collectors shop. I want to provide responsible and honest service to the firearm community where everyone can share and learn.


Thank you, 
Uncle Ben


Services we currently offer are;

General Firearm Appraisal
    - Let us know what information you have on a particular firearm and for a small research fee we will give you its approximate value and any pertinent information regarding the model.

Firearm Identification
    - Don't know what kind of old gun that is sitting in your grandpas closet? Send us some pictures of any stamps, writing, or marks along with a picture of the gun. For a small research fee we will identify it and give you a general appraisal of the gun (In fact we might even offer to buy it from you).

Firearm Deep Clean and Inspection 
      - For a flat rate we will do a complete field tear down, deep clean, and inspection of your firearm. If desired, we will also give you a personal walk through of the maintenance specific to your gun.

Scope and Accessory Installation 
     - We will mount your scope and bore-site it, if you don't have a scope or mounting hardware we can order just what you need, plus any accessories desired. Prices vary dependent on work required.

Firearm Restoration
     - We offer this service on a limited basis because of the risk of de-valuing the gun. Some of the things we look at are, rust damage and rust removal, original finish and bluing, wooden stock cleaning and restoration. The fee for this service is contingent on the type and amount of work desired. (Note: I am not a licensed gunsmith, any major rework beyond my ability will be referred to a local gunsmith.)

Magpul  MBUS Back-Up Sight

Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system.   The Special ultra lightweight profile barrel  has a conventional .750"" gas block diameter, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  The weight of the barrel splits the difference between our light profile and our pencil barrel.    Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.

The Rossi Matched Pair has set the standard for 2-barrel guns. This combination long gun package is unequalled, having been recognized as the best 'youth-size' gun and a top notch 'full-size' backpack take-along. We start with one of our popular single shot rifles, then hand fit a shotgun barrel to create the Matched Pair. The result is a highly reliable rifle with adjustable sights and a button rifled barrel for enhanced accuracy, which quickly swaps barrels to become your favorite shotgun. This makes the Matched Pair the perfect gun for hunting or a fun day at the range. Change Barrels Faster Than You Can Change Your Mind To change barrels, make sure the firearm is unloaded. Loosen the front swivel and remove the forend and swivel. Open the action and insert the barrel, replace forend, tighten the swivel and you are done and ready to shoot. One screw, one minute, no tool, no kidding!"

Mosin Nagant m91/30 Russian Battle Rifle

From what little research I've done I have determined this to be an Arsenal refinished Mosin with ALL Matching Serial Numbers! Proof Stamps on the receiver include, ""Black Powder Safe"" Proof, ""Point of Aim"" and Accuracy Stamps as well as Rare ""MO"" or ""Ministry of Defense"" markings which lead me to believe this rifle was to be used in defending high value Military Bases. (There are many other marking, including on the stock that I have been unable to account for yet.)

Super clean almost shiny rifling, and perfect crown. Absolutely no pitting.

I have seen and held many Mosins and this is by far the best looking and most interesting I have ever seen.

A historic piece that may just have a few more tales to tell, or even make should one decide to modernize it.

In all honesty, this gun is too nice for me.

The pistol has the slightest wear all over the slide, it's not really on the sharp edges though. The wear is barely visible and I don't think it's gonna show up in the pics. The trigger is one of the best I've felt out of all the apex kits I have installed. 

Disclaimer: The fastfire is not zeroed, I had it off for a full cleaning and haven't rezeroed it yet. 

Id like to sell as a package to cover as much of the cost of the HK but I'd be willing to keep some mags and the holster as I have other m&p's I can use them for. 


Asking $925 but I'll entertain offers within reason. I'm also willing to meet within reason to let potential buyers look it over.

TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER¬Æ is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16‚Äù barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5‚Äù. The SIG556R measures 35.875‚Äù but can fold to 26‚Äù, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable

This car has a rebuilt engine and 4speed automatic transmission. The original trans was replaced for better gas mileage. The engine is a 289 with an Edlebrock Performer 4 barrel intake and a 650 Holley 4barrel carb. These pictures actually show the surface rust a lot worse I think, but it does give a good indication that its going to need attention. Attention I can't give it since my recent back injury. If it were not for my back, I wouldn't consider tr adding or selling this car. The odometer is showing 80,500 miles, and I do believe that to be actual miles. This is a nice survivor that fires right up and drives nice. It will need exhaust work as I can hear a leak. It has headers, so its probably a gasket. Its not a leak at the head though. ALL glass, chrome, hubcaps are all there and in very good condition. headliner and dash could use some attention. The car actually drives.nice.and since recent tuneup, it has been very reliable.

I did carry this gun for a while, and it has the patented ""purple extractor"" which is very common with HK's and USP's in general. This gun is a great shooter. Still in very nice condition as shown in the pictures. These full size Usp's in .45 cal are very easy to shoot accurately. Night sights are still fairly bright, but I'm not sure how old they are.

The exact round count is 200 bullets. I keep a round count on all of my firearms. This gun has yet to even begin to start its service and looks perfect enough to be collected if that's what you wish to do with it. 200 rounds caused it no harm or unnecessary wear for that matter. Not a scratch on anything visual. (no retard scratches!!)

 With it for sale is six 15 round magazines, 2 of witch are stainless steel with the Inox base plates ( VERY RARE TO FIND!! ). 

The wooden grips may even be more rare to find. They are the absolute most nicest wooden grips for this weapon I've ever seen. I also have the stock black grips as well.

 Out of the six mags the only ones used are a pair of black ones. The stainless and the other pair of black ones are new, never used never even loaded with bullets, and there all OEM beretta mags. Gun was also never fire with the wooden grips either. 

The gun will also come with a beretta Italian leather sholder holster. Tho I have never carried it not even once. I figured if you were ever going to carry this gun it would be most comfortable like this. I put it in the holster once, It fit nice, then never again, no reason to. 

It will also come with everything this gun comes with brand new and some little extras. 

I'm not saying its a deal or a steel, but it is definitely a rare, hard to find full package, when shopping for this specific beretta.   It will be up for sale one time and one time only. If it does not sell it will be taken back down to the lab and put back into the safe never to be sold or seen on armslist again!

Other info: 

Thinning out my collection. Brand new, original owner, never fired, in original box with all original accessories (manual, cleaning kit and etc.). California model with factory installed Bullet Button and two (2) Colt 9-rd magazines. Roll mark ""M4 Carbine"" ""Ser. SPxxxx"" ""Colts Mfg Co LLC"".

These have higher MSRP and offer more features than the LE6920, 6920CA, SP6920CA, LE6920CA, 6920, LE6920MP, and LE6920CMP.

The SP6940 and LE6940 are identical rifles, except for the prefix in the serial. I believe the 'SP' serial Colts are more rare than the 'LE', because Colt dropped the 'SP' and all new M4's are roll marked with the 'LE' serial. To my knowledge the 'SP' was only produced for one year. On top of that the 6940 is the flagship model for Colt M4's. Its free floating barrel should translate to better accuracy. If you've been looking for a Colt M4 lately you know they are a beast to find, especially the 6940. You'll be hard pressed to find one at a local gun store or online auction site.

Has LC head stamp. This is 5.56x45 ammo, not .223 rem. Most AR-15 rifles will use it, but be sure before you purchase this. 

Each can has 420 rounds on stripper clips with a AR magazine adaptor. I bought a few of these a few years back and never had a single issue with the ammo, which is more than I can say for any other type of ammo I have tried. This is precisely the same ammo used by the US military. This ammo is getting to be quite hard to come by, which is why the price is what it is.

I am asking $600 for both. I would prefer to sell them both to the same person, but if you cannot afford both $300 will get you one.

It seems all the interested parties so far are out of state, so I guess I should clarify that this is for pick up in Bend Oregon. 

Right now the price I am asking is  below what most of the stores are asking for comparable ammo. I don't think what I'm asking is unreasonable but if you want to tempt me with a offer or possible trades let me know. I'm interesting in just about anything firearms related."

Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety.

The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip RX‚Ñ¢ and Ultragrip DX‚Ñ¢ represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes."

988,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1193988,For Sale:  USED VERY UNUSUAL Plainfield Machine M-1 30 Carbine Pistol,"Carmel, Indianapolis, Indiana",$ 550,"Listed On: Monday, April 8, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here is a partial history for this unusual firearm:

""In the April 1984 issue of The American Rifleman appears the article A Fresh Start for Iver Johnson by Pete Dickey. The article provides a brief history of the Iver Johnson name and the sale of the company by Louis Imperato to Arkansas investors in 1982. A time line indicates Louis Imperato purchased Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in 1973 and changed the name to Iver Johnson Arms in 1975. Within the 1975 heading, following the name change: ""Acquired Plainfield Machine Co. of Middlesex, NJ, makers of M1 Carbines"". The next entry is 1977 and indicates the Iver Johnson firm was moved to Middlesex, NJ. 

From one of the sons of William Haas who worked at Plainfield Machine at the time: ""There were some tough years in the mid 70s and in early 77 we started to negotiate with Lou Imperato who had purchased Iver Johnsons Arms & Cycle Works several years earlier. Lou did not purchase the company [Plainfield Machine Co.] but only some of the assets. He purchased the building, most of the equipment, plus the carbine tooling & inventory. He did not want the pistol lines. Lou retained most of the factory personnel, maintained my father as basically head of Engineering, and I was made V.P. of Operation with total daily control of the facility in NJ. William Storck was not retained by Iver Johnsons. I then moved Iver Johnsons from Fitchburg, Mass into the Middlesex, NJ building in the fall of 77. I left [Iver Johnson] in the fall of 78."" 

New Jersey corporate records indicate Iver Johnson Arms was incorporated in New Jersey by Louis Imperato in November 1977 with an address of Wilton Ave. in Middlesex, NJ. This was the location of Plainfield Machine Company. The operations of Iver Johnson Arms are detailed on the pages devoted to their company and carbines elsewhere on this website. 

The conflict as to the actual year of purchase is the subject of further research but it's clear the transition from Plainfield Machine M1 Carbines to Iver Johnson M1 Carbines occurred after moving what was left of Iver Johnson to New Jersey in the Fall of 1977. The records of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, & Firearms showing yearly production for rifles since 1975 indicate Plainfield Machine manufactured 4,264 rifles in 1978 and in 1979 the company manufacturing handguns using the name Plainfield Ordnance. The same records indicate Iver Johnson manufactured no firearms in 1977 and 3,080 rifles in 1978. Data as to caliber or models was not collected. 

In 1977 and 1978 Haas and Storck as Plainfield Ordnance continued to manufacture their handgun line in the same building as Iver Johnson produced the Iver Johnson carbines. 

The first indication Iver Johnson's Arms was manufacturing carbines was an advertisement that was repeated in the October, November, and December 1978 issues of The American Rifleman. 

The two Enforcer model carbines depicted below show one of the last Plainfield Machine Enforcers and one of the first Iver Johnson's Arms Enforcers. Notice the similarities. The Plainfield Enforcer has a serial number inconsistent with the serial numbers used by Plainfield Machine throughout their production 1962-1978. The serial number is preceded by the letters PP, which is consistent with Iver Johnson serial numbers which consisted of two or three letters followed by numbers. The PP appears to have been short lived and specific to the Plainfield Enforcers as the first Iver Johnson Enforcer carbines had a serial number starting with the letters EAA. ""
