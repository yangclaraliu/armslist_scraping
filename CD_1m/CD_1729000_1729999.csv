7.62x39, AR-15 16"" H-Bar 1:10 Black Barrel .750 Carbine Gas System, Nitride Lined Bore

DESCRIPTION:

These Barrels have been professionally developed for Accuracy and competition target shooting, a 16"" H-Bar which is more rigid will eliminate any vibration and improve barrel accuracy. Our H-Bar Competition barrels offer the accuracy of a bull barrel but the lighter weight approaching that of an M-4 Profile. We have them Fluted for increased Strength, Rigidity, and Cooling, while Reducing weight compared to Standard 18-20"" bull barrels. Custom Machined from solid Bar Stock of Chrome-Moly Steel Hardened to 26-32 RC Spec and then Cryogenically Stress relieved and blued for prolonged accuracy under heavy use/competition.

Nitride Treated: Read about this process bieng better than Chrome lined bores

http://www.cobratacsystems.com/blogs/news/8006929-nitride-melonite-coating-arguably-better-than-chrome-lined-nitride-vs-chrome-comparison

These barrels have been treated with a Black Nitride treatment. The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with Black Nitride have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, Black Nitride gives better corrosion protection. Additionally, Black Nitride is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as carburizing and carbonitriding."

Very interesting curio piece, slide manufactured sometime during/after World War I for the French Military by one of dozens of Spanish firms. 

The proofmarks found on this pistol are shown in the picture below. The shield with a diagonal cross and a crown on top means that the gun was inspected by the proofhouse in Eibar, Spain. Following that is the initials P.V., which mean that the gun was intended for smokeless powder. To the right of that, is a rampaging lion. This series of 3 marks was used by the Eibar proofhouse between 1923 and 1927.

No import markings. Can provide better pictures if need be. Bore is good, occasional FTF/FTE (only happened with remington brand, winchester HP ran flawless) and comes with one non-matching french military magazine (9 capacity).


The original firing pin broke my last range trip. I don't have the time or money to replace it, this is the only working issue with the firearm.

5 Left

RJ Martinâs blade design and grind gives you the piercing power of a tanto with just enough curve to the belly for slicing aptitude as well. The tanto point is even stronger than comparable tantos because Kershaw makes the tip thicker and gives it a tough flat grind. The result is an Ã¼ber-strong tip that takes on the toughest piercing tasks with no fear. But the RJ II isnât done yet.

This knife offers a full range of cutting edges. The plain edge is ever so slightly curved, giving the RJ II slicing capabilityâsomething not all tanto blades offer. In addition, the blade is partially serrated to make cutting through tough or fibrous materials a breeze. The blade is made of 8Cr13MoV stainless steel thatâs tough, wear resistant, and takes a keen edge. For a distinctive look and enhanced performance, the blade is coated with titanium carbo-nitride.

The RJ II also features 3-D machined G-10 handle scales and a secure stainless-steel locking liner. It opens with one-handed ease thanks to the SpeedSafe assisted opening system. Access it with the built-in flipper or thumbstud. The pocketclip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry. Tactical looks and a multifunctional blade combine in the RJ IIâalso available in a larger size as the RJ I.

 Technical Specifications
â¢2-Step Serration
Serrations assist in cutting through particularly tough or fibrous material, such as rope or cord. The Kershaw 2-step serration is a more aggressive style of serration.

â¢Flipper
May be used on either manual or assisted opening knives. The âflipperâ is a protrusion on the back of the blade that the user can pull back on, or flip, in order to move the blade easily out of the handle.

â¢SpeedSafeÂ®

Not just for zombies anymore

While it would be a lot of fun for our marketing department to sell the Camp 10 as the ultimate zombie-whacking tool, the truth is, it actually has a lot of other uses that you just might find to be of a more immediate nature than zombie defense. Not that weâre ignoring to the coming Zombiepocalypse, mind you. We just think that the Camp 10 makes a pretty awesome camp knife and that it does a great job of whacking campsite or other outdoor chores down to size in very short order.

From clearing brush to making kindling, the Camp 10 is the ideal outdoor and survival tool. Cut, chop, slash, hack, split, scrapeâjust about any task you ask of it, the Camp 10 can handle. The full-tang Camp 10 is made of carbon tool steel for toughness and wear resistance. A basic black powdercoat protects the steel and makes maintenance easier.

Youâll like the secure, contoured grip of the Camp 10, too. The handle has a built-in hand guard and is drilled in both front and rear so you can attach a lanyard either placeâor bothâfor carrying versatility. Of course, if a zombie does get up close and personal with you, then yeah, youâll be pretty glad to have a Camp 10 in hand, too.

The Magazine included in this build is a mil-spec Magpul PMag GEN M3. The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. Tracking number will be provided upon shipment.

It has come to my attention that you have filed suit against armslist.com over nothing more than some deranged lunatic murdering a woman in a parking lot... a lunatic who not only broke several laws, but also failed to adhere to Armslist terms of service that he agreed to when using the service.
My message is a loud and clear fuck you for targeting the low-hanging fruit, a free to use website that allows me and thousands of others to participate in the great American experiment and exercise our rights. By attacking the only free service available, you are engaging in an illegal conspiracy with the sole intent of denying my and thousands of others the opportunity to exercise our God given rights. I hereby order you to cease said behavior and publicly apologize and reimburse Armslist for the damages in monetary form that you have extorted from them by abusing the American civil court system. You will also agree to refrain from such illegal activity in the future in order to avoid paying ME and thousands of others the damages we would suffer by the loss of said services provided by Armslist LLC.
Consider this a warning shot, you pompous assholes. I have had it with your continual attacks on my rights. You are causing me undue stress of worrying all day, every day about the loss of my rights and the continual and non-stop unwarranted attacks, forcing us all to expend unnecessary time and energy to protect against your malicious and constant attacks. By NOT suing other free services such as Craigslist for the illegal actions of a small percentage of it's users, you are engaging in a targeted campaign against me, Armslist and tens of thousands of other innocent, law-abiding citizens and for that, we will make you pay.
Burn in hell Brady Campaign, I suggest you do not push us any further, we will respond and we will drain you of you ability to ever launch such an attack on the American people ever again.

I'm asking $12.00 a piece for these.  I started out with over 50 long before the craziness of the Obama crap started.  I purchased these over a period of 11 months at a price of $15.00 each, so there's no price gouging going on here.  Just looking to get out from under these.  Why pay the premium for other high cap mags like P-Mags or the crappy metal mags?
I would be willing to meet you if you're close but I'm not about driving all over God's green earth to deliver some mags.  I may however, ship these UPS if you would like, but you would pay the shipping and insurance.  If you would like these to go out of state, itâs your responsibility to know the local laws of your state!  Once they're gone, they're gone...I started out with 50 of these a little over a month ago and I have 13 left...

The 42-inch (40.5-inches inside) padded case from Voodoo Tactical safely holds just about any compact rifle or carbine. 

Inside are adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement. 

Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories. 

This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six magazines and the center pouch is even larger. 

This gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear.

The âWoodsmasterâ
Autoloading Rifle
Manufactured: 1936 to 1950
Inventor: John Browning
In 1940, .300 Savage was added to the lineup to make the 81 more competitive and give it âclose to .30-06â³ performance. 
Dave REDACTED
REDACTED âmaybe be at Port Richey gun show Sat.
In 1936 Remington introduced the revised version of the Model 8 as the Model 81 Woodsmaster. The .25 Remington chambering was dropped, but the .30, .32, and .35 Remington lived on, and in 1940 the .300 Savage joined them. Production ceased during World War II, and after the war only the .300 Savage and .35 Remington chamberings became available. Those two remained until production of the Model 81 was discontinued in 1950 with almost 56,000 built. Add close to 81,000 Model 8s produced and you have a fairly successful firearm, one as capable of bringing home the venison today as when it was introduced more than a century ago.
The barrel is easily detached by removing the forearm and rotating the takedown lever counterclockwise several revolutions. Since the system compensates for wear, a Model 8 or Model 81 with a loose barrel is seldom encountered today."

The K2 was designed after the Vietnam War.  The South Koreans observed the main assault rifles being used in the conflict; the AK-47 and M16.  They decided the 5.56x45mm used by the M16 was a good round as it was accurate and lightweight, but the AK had the best reliability and was easy to maintain.  This rifle has an AR-15-like lower-receiver (no parts interchangeable), a piston return system like an AK-47, and a gas valve adjuster like an FN FAL.  In short, you have a super-reliable rifle using the accurate 5.56x45mm; the accuracy of the M16 with the durability of an AK-47.  Due to their construction, these rifles accept some M16 accessories including bayonets, slings, and magazines made for the AR-15/M16x# platforms. This rifle uses a piston return. This means all the cycling parts are in the receiver and return tube above the barrel unlike the M16 (which has the recoil spring in the stock) which makes it into one of the best side-folding stock rifles.

The NAA .22 Long Rifle with the 1 & 5/8"" is also offered in our Holster Grip configuration which allows for convenient carrying and operation. The grip folds up to allow for easy concealment and carry and folds out into a locked grip for more convenient use and control. It is versatile for many applications and is the standard by which other Mini-Revolvers are judged.

As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge."

Glock has none of these options. This is a walther design. However, S&W offers a life time warranty, Walther does not. If you like the PPQ or PPX you will like this pistol.

This looks and fells brand new, and costs $149.00 from Wilson Combat. Here is their description:
There have been numerous variations of the famous Bruce Nelson designed summer special style holster over the years, many are excellent and some leave something to be desired. Due to consumer demand, we have crafted what we think is an optimized variation of this famous design. The NEW Wilson CombatÂ® Summer Companion features a stitched-in sight track for a smooth draw and clean sight picture. It's made with the premium cowhide ""rough side"" out to help stabilize the holster for a consistent draw. Double ""hard action"" snap loops will accommodate up to 1.5"" belt widths and of course the top of the holster remains open to allow easy/safe one handed holstering. As with most Wilson CombatÂ® holsters the Summer Companion features a backpiece that locks the thumb safety in the ""safe"" position on 1911 models and protects the back side of the pistol from body perspiration. Meets I.D.P.A. holster criteria.
