         This is a pretty much NIB pistol with some upgrades and extras. I have shot (1) mag of Black Hills self defense ammo through it to see how the APEX DCAEK kit shot. I have owned a couple M&Ps and this is a great improvement over the factory parts. The things included with this deal are the Factory Gun Case, M&P 9mm Pistol, (4) factory magazines, APEX M&P DCAEK Kit installed, (3) Palm Swells, and extra factory parts. The extra parts include the original sear, sear spring, trigger return spring, striker block, and ambi thumb safety. Currently the pistol is configured without the thumb safety but, it is very easy to take on and off. I can have it configured which ever way you want, just let me know. The Apex Tactical Duty/Carry Action Enhancement Kit was designed to provide the M&P pistol with a smooth, consistent 5 to 5-1/2 lb trigger pull with the advantages of shorter over-travel and a reduced reset. Well there you have it I'd say it's a fair deal considering a lot of things are out of stock and the APEX Kit is already installed. Just think about all the transfer fees, gunsmithing fees, taxes, and shipping cost you could save.

No more than 1000 rounds through the gun but surely more than 500 just not certain (really wasn't keeping count). I put a cheaper price on it because I scratched up the back side of the handle putting the bolt back together after cleaning it and found it really tough to get back together. Gun has a volquartsen trigger kit that works great with 1.5 pound pull. I put a Hogue rubber handle on it too that feels very comfortable. AIM Red dot stops working sporadically but I have a unconditional warranty and I already talked to the people I bought it from and they are bringing me a new one during the Sharonville Gun and Knife show at the end of June. Gun comes with 4 Ruger clips and the original box with all paperwork. Cash and proof of Ohio residency is all you need. If your not an Ohio resident I will have to use an FFL at your cost. Email me if your interested as I get email on my phone and should answer quickly.

Then, he refinished the slide with some textured paint...closely matching the black frame. Please look closely at the pictures!!! Included with the sale are two IWB holsters (one lefty, one right), three magazines (two with finger extensions, one with out, still have originals), one snap cap, grip sleeve, box, and manual. He said there is a belt clip floating around too. I'll throw that in with the sale too, if i come across it. I shot this one june 15th, and it shot great with Hornady critical defense loads. Very accurate little pistol. He said approx 300 rounds plus my 20 were fired.  I am selling this as a package deal. I do not want to sell separate. Also, I do not want to drive an hour just to meet you. Be prepared to drive close to Canton!!!!"

Every component is top of the line, best I could find, because I wanted to run a slide fire on an AR and didn't want to spend 223 ammo $$$$$, I went with a 9mm but it took a couple tries before I settled on Mega Machine lower & YHM upper.  
  it was the ONLY 9mm AR upper that handled the slide fire reliably.  You will go through more ammo than you expect, but in the end you're still smiling!  
*
if you are the type that enjoys crowds, questions and putting the ""range moron"" in his place when he tells you that you can't own a machine gun, ( I've also heard of education sessions with law enforcement, but have not personally had the pleasure)
*
I was not able to slide fire the 22lr, although I have seen people with a soft touch do it, and the 22lr upper is the best that is offered and functions flawlessly.

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic

• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery.
No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.

• Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with
Aimpoint 3X Magnifier and Concealed Engagement unit.
• Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world
conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
• Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).

both covers closed in an emergency.

Correct Grade Rifles are similar to the Service Grade, but will show less wear and use. Correct Grade rifles will have all correct parts for the date of manufacture with 80% or better overall original metal finish. The stock and handguards will be of walnut and correct for the rifle but will have some dings, dents, scratches and marring of the wood finish. Stocks will have the appropriate original inspector's cartouche. The rifle bore will be very good with no significant defects. Very good to excellent condition.

It is a correct Springfield with nice wood and very nice original finish. It is a Korean War era and all parts are original and are correct for when issued. The metal seems unused and wood has nicks and dings from long-term 60 years of storage. It was bought originally from CMP. Will send more pictures upon request. When CMP was selling these they sold for $1100 plus shipping - now if they have the they are auctioned and go for much more.

Here is the CMP description: CORRECT GRADE: (Very Good to Excellent) 
Correct Grade Rifles are similar to the Service Grade, but will show less wear and use. Correct Grade rifles will have all correct parts for the date of manufacture with 80% or better overall original metal finish. The stock and handguards will be of walnut and correct for the rifle but will have some dings, dents, scratches and marring of the wood finish. Stocks will have the appropriate original inspector's cartouche. The rifle bore will be very good with no significant defects. Very good to excellent condition. This grade is rare and is only available occasionally in limited quantities. Because of the scarcity of these rifles, they will only be sold on the CMP auction site.

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability Summary: SAM7R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit."

-Trigger job, got the pull down to a crisp 4lbs with minimal take up and overtravel, the reset is very short and sweet, albeit a little subtle (I can and DID bring it down to a light 3lbs, but the combination of slightly stiff recoil and very short reset would cause me to double unintentionally... if you want, I can bring it back down but I don't recommend it unless you know what you're doing...)

Luminox was approached by US Air Force pilots flying the F-117 Nighthawk Stealth fighter jet. They were wearing the Navy SEAL timepieces, but chafed at the word ""Navy"" on the dial. Luminox then developed a watch for these pilots and approached Lockheed Martin, the makers of the F-117 Nighthawk for a picture of the plane to use in the catalogs that marketed the watches.

This initial contact turned into an exclusive arrangement to produce Lockheed Martin timepieces, including watches dedicated to the F-117 Nighthawk, F-16 Fighting Falcon, SR-111 Blackbird and the new F-22 Raptor.

This sensational timepiece incorporates the exclusive self- illuminating tritium gas dial, with hands and hour markers that glow brightly for up to 25 years, even in absolute blackness with no need for any external light source or power. The entire watch - case, screw-down back, screw-in crown, bezel and bracelet is crafted of stainless steel that's been shaped and PVD (Physical Vapor Disposition) plated black to evoke the exotic look and feel of a Stealth aircraft. Features a multi-jewel Swiss quartz movement, highly scratch-resistant sapphire glass crystal with double anti- reflective coating and dual time zone bezel."

HK45 COMPACT TACTICAL
The HK45 Compact Tactical builds on the tough, military lineage of the Heckler & Koch HK45 series of handguns to devise the ultimate operator’s pistol. The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HK’s American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the new pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit.

The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10-round magazine with extended floorplate, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences.

The HK45 pistol series were originally developed as candidates for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition so there is little wonder that the HK45 CT is so well-suited for military, law enforcement, and security use. Each HK45 CT comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

An HK proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces effecting the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

An “O-ring” barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. And the threaded barrel on the HK45 CT is made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

The HK45 Compact Tactical uses all HK45 magazines, from 10-rounders to the smaller capacity 8-round magazine. A Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for mounting lights and accessories is molded into the polymer frame of the HK45 Compact Tactical.

The HK45 Compact Tactical is currently available with a “decock only” (V3) control lever mode found on its special operations counterpart or with a decock and manual safety (V1) control lever function.

I've had this SIG556 for about a year and have only put about 500-600 rounds through it. 

Not really trying to sell this rifle. Mainly want to trade. It will come with the box, paperwork, lifetime warranty, and even the lube that came with the rifle from the manufacturer. The rifle will also come with the SIG Diopter sight system, and a few magazines. I bought the handguards separate from SIG and they ran me about $80. I have a few PMags, I think four different SIG magazines (with couplers) and about 1100 rounds of 5.56 that I can negotiate with.

I'm looking to trade the rifle for something new. I will not accept a cheap handgun or rifle alone for the SIG556 with the EOTech. Multi-trades are welcome, so are trades plus cash. Be fair with your offers as I do know what these are worth and know what most other rifles and handguns are worth due to the fact that I do a lot of research on anything I want to buy.

Looking for:

-CETME
-Springfield SAR-8 (HK-91 Clone)
-Springfield M1A (I can get the synthetic stock model for $1600 locally and NEW, so $1500+ is bullshit)
-C93 (I can get these locally for $700, I won't pay a dollar more.)
-PTR-91
-M1 Garand (Depends on the grade, matching, etc.)
-FS2000
-Glock 17 Gen 3(no, I will not pay your bullshit price of $550. I can get these for $450 NEW)
-Colt LE6920

I'll accept combinations of the mentioned guns, with either cash or another gun to make it equal. If you're offering something worth much more, we will talk on the prices."

It was made by Orbea Hermanos of Eibar Spain between 1915 and 1916 to fill a 50,000 gun contract for the British government.  There are British military proofs on the frame and cylinder.  It fires, but has a short stroke to the hammer and sometimes does not fire the round.  It has had the firing pin repaired, and is missing the lanyard ring and a pin in the trigger guard.  The hammer screw appears to have been replaced.  It appears to be double action only, as the hammer will not pull back to use as single action.  All the metal is in great condition and shows no rust or pitting.  The bore is bright with sharp rifling.  Asking $250.  I am located in Jeffersonville, Indiana, near Louisville, Kentucky.

It has had exactly 15 rounds fired. The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

UPGRADES INCLUDE

ATI tactical adujustable stock with pistol grip. (for a Home ""d"" shot gun a pistol grip WITH buttstock is better for control, its much harder for someone to wrestle this away in a struggle)

By buying any of this ammo, you agree that you are legal to purchase and own ammunition in the state of Wisconsin. To make it worthwhile and to make sure I am not driving all over town, there will be a $50 minimum per transaction. The 357 and 38 Special you can mix and match, but the 223 ammo needs to go all at once. Since the prices are very close to what I paid with tax (sometimes even less), the prices will be firm.

The reel is amazing smooth and didnt have any problems getting it dialed in for casting, the rod is super light and with the sensitive rod tip you can feel every little thing your bait is doing. This is a great rod/reel combo that cost me far more than what I am selling it for, just like the med/heavy action rods more so I used this twice and never used it again. I still have the box the reel came in if you want it as well. Already lined with 8lb test line ready to go. A great fishing set up for much cheaper than the store.
