WITH MAGAZINE POUCH 






DESCRIPTION:

This Black ProTech Intimidator Gun Holster - also called a Hip Holster or Belt Holster - it features an adjustable Thumb Break and easily clips onto a belt or your pants (belts up to two inches wide). Or, you can slide your belt through a belt loop on the back of the holster without using the metal clip. The holster is made of durable padded Cordura and black Nylon w/black nylon stitching. The metal clip and the thumb break are reversible and adjustable so the holster can be worn on the left or right side (for right or left hand people). Also, the holster has a holder for an extra magazine.

WHAT A FIELDTESTER HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE PROTECH HOLSTERS

This is one of the best all around holster we've ever tested. This is the holster that, I think, stacks up against the biggest competitors on the market.  There are so many different types and makers of  holsters, and sometimes the only advantage is the quality that was put into making the holster and not necessarily the ease of use.  Yes, there are cheap holsters, and there are expensive holsters so you have to choose price or quality.

This holster is simple, yet very effective.  It has an additional pouch in front of the holster for your extra clip, a Velcro strap for the magazine, and a quick release clip strap for the pistol. The holsters are four wall construction, the inner wall has vinyl vapor barriers and foam padding. The holsters interior is lined with a soft nylon fabric to protect your weapon, and provide a smooth draw every time. They offer different sizes for different pistols, but they are all built with the same quality no matter which one you purchase!
All Pro-Tech products which I have reviewed exhibit quality throughout. I think they have found a niche in a market that is increasingly growing and becoming more competitive.

It was a collaboration of S&W and Walther that brought this pistol into being. It is a cross between a striker fire and a true double action with a de-cocker. Walther's version is a P99, the James Bond gun that daubed in Golden Eye. This handgun features double action/single action, de-cocker, cocking indicator, loaded chamber indicator, adjustable night sights, accessory rail, and ambidextrous magazine release. Complete field stripping without tools of any kind in seconds. Also features a poly frame for light weight and a blackened stainless steel slide assembly. I rate this in excellent condition with minor wear on the top of the breach area where the slide and barrel lock up.
Included with this weapon are 3-12rd magazines and an uncle mikes holster. I will require a copy of your driver’s license with a signed statement that it is legal for you to own this weapon or a copy of your firearms permit. I want to advise, this is not a QA model (quick action) which is a single action with de-cocker that you have to cycle the action back slightly to cock. This is a traditional double action. You can carry de-cocked, pull and fire like a double action revolver the first shot and then following shots are short single action. This is a very safe handgun. Face to face transactions. Text me at 601-896 forty seventy.
Price is firm, this handgun is worth it."

I am firm on the price I have seen them on here for a lot more. This gun came in a package of guns that I bought and I have no need for it. The guy I bought it from said it had never been fired but I checked it and it appears to have been but not much for sure. The gun is in great shape. I would be willing to trade for silver bullion or other firearms. I am also looking for a good LEFT Handed compound bow that has the accessories with it. I will only do FTF sale with valid Colorado DL or CCW preferred. Bill of sale required to protect both of us.

The Kansas Concealed Carry Handgun (CCH) course is a mandatory eight hour course that is taught within the parameters set forth by the Kansas Attorney General. The course entails instruction in basic firearms safety, marksmanship, Kansas law as it pertains to CCH, and situational scenarios that a CCH licensee must be made aware of. The course of fire is designed to accommodate all levels of shooters (beginner through expert). The student must score 100% on a written test over discussion material, and must score 18 out of 25 during the shooting qualification. You don't need to worry about either test as you will be given everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course.

I then upgraded almost all of the internals with premium parts to improve the handling, reliability, and accuracy. I have all the original parts and receipts for the new parts if interested in having them. List of extras are as follows. Brand new Beretta 9mm barrel $140. Used Beretta 40 S&W barrel.VZ grips $75.

The pistol does not come with a case, but I do have extra hard cases to purchase if wanted. This pistol shoots great, especially soft shooting in the 9mm, and the trigger is much better than the original.

From the Manufacturer:

Product Description
This sight is even smaller than the former N-cell battery sight and runs on a single 123 battery. It also has a longer battery life than the N-cell style sights. Smaller, lighter and always fast with three reticle options. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights or NV mount.- Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length - Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space compared to the 4 inch N battery sights - Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved - Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to hover over the delta ring of the rifle - Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, 3X battery life of N cell sights - Reticle: 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot.

Smaller and lighter than other holographic weapon sights, the EOTech XPS2-0 is an ideal compact option for your weapon platform. The XPS2-0 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
The XPS2-0 runs on a single 123 battery, making it small enough to leave plenty of rail space for rear iron sights, magnifiers, and other tools (the shortened base requires 2.75 inches of rail space maximum). EOTech also eliminated the battery cap and latch and replaced them with a simple O-ring tethered cap, helping the sight achieve better sealing.

It has an internal hammer and disappears when worn IWB or in a pocket holster. This gun is perfect for concealed carry. Comes with the original S&W stamped Hogue bantam grips. I love this gun, and wouldn't be selling it if I didn't have other .357 Mag. revolvers and I wasn't looking to fund a new purchase.

The gun comes with a brand new Remora IWB holster ($30 value). I'm asking $600 for the package. Like I said, I'm looking to fund a new purchase so I would prefer a cash sale, but I would consider trading for a new/newer S&W M&P 9c or M&P 45c."
