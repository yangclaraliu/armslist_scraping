Are you thinking about getting out of the reloading life? My Wish: I need to replace two Dillon 550B's I regrettably sold in 2007 and get ready to return to shooting. I would like to get a Dillon 650 with dies and ready to go for a .40 or a .45 caliber (both would be perfect). The more extras (powder measure-add'l calibers-pickup tubes, tumbler, etc) you have, the more I'm interested. Don't trade a abused system to me with missing parts. No cash on my end, so your Dillon would be a even-steven trade if it's right for both of us. I check email daily and will respond to national or local considerations."

1 Box has nickel plated brass and the other box is brass.
This is old ammo but shoots great and has been put away in ammo can.
If you could find this ammo today it sells for around $25 per box of 20.
Here is a little info about this ammo.
This subject has been covered previously. For review, there appears to be minimal differences in terminal performance for most law enforcement and military caliber handgun bullets when fired in service weapons with barrel lengths between 3.5 to 5 inches. The vast majority of our testing is performed with 4 inch barrel handguns. 
All of the following 9mm loads offer acceptable terminal performance for law enforcement and defense use: Fed 147 gr JHP (9MS & P9HS2), Rem 147 gr JHP (R9MMS & GS9MMC), Win 127 gr +P+ JHP (RA9SXTP), Win 147 gr JHP (RA9147HP, X9MMST147, RA9SXT, RA9T)

Although providing good terminal performance, due to adverse publicity in the popular press and media, the original Winchester SXT bullets, the ""Black Talon"" are no longer in production. A variety of bullets labeled ""SXT"" are available from Winchester, but their performance is quite variable. Generally, the civilian SXT loads have sub-standard penetration and/or expansion and should not be relied upon in lethal force situations. The law enforcement Ranger SXT bullets generally offer adequate terminal performance for law enforcement use. 

The Winchester 127 gr +P+ is the only 9mm bullet less than 147 gr which has demonstrated adequate penetration and expansion in our testing. This bullet gained notoriety as it can penetrate soft body armor made of Spectra, although it is stopped by Kevlar vests. The downside to this bullet is the increased muzzle flash and blast and increased wear on the weapon due to the higher pressure loading. The lighter weight may be a disadvantage when intermediate barriers are present.

JHP handgun bullets often fail to expand when passing through heavy clothing due to the hollow point getting plugged, and the bullet then acting like a FMJ. The Winchester RA9T load gives more robust expansion and is less likely to exhibit expansion failure when passing heavy clothing. While the Federal P9HS2 ""Hydra-Shok"" has the largest expanded diameter of the bullets listed above, the blunt, rolled deformed edges are not as effective at cutting tissue and enhancing the permanent crush cavity as the sharp deformed surfaces of the Winchester RA9T. When I carry a 9mm, my first choice is the Winchester 9mm 147 gr JHP SXT Ranger (RA9T).

Recently, there has been a trend in 9 mm LE ammunition sales to the 124 gr JHP's. The most recent sales distribution data I have seen indicates 50% 124 gr, 40% 147 gr, and 10% 115 gr. Is it possible that the illogical hype of bullets shown to b e less effective than the 9mm 147 gr JHP’s is a result of bullet salesmen and gun magazine writers who need to sell a product? Perhaps the well documented success of the 9mm 147 gr JHP in California is a result of differing laws of physics on the West Coast than in other areas…….. Unfortunately, that conjecture does not stand up to scrutiny, as the extensive Royal Canadian Mounted Police studies determined that the 9mm 147 gr JHP was the most effective load for the caliber. In addition, during the ammunition trials for the U.S. Military M11 pistol (Sig P228) conducted by Navy Weapons Center Crane Indiana, the 9mm 147gr JHP was selected as the issue load for the M11, beating a variety of other 9mm JHP loads, including both standard pressure and +P pressure 115 gr and 124 gr JHP’s.

The largest independently verified study of bullet penetration and expansion characteristics in living human tissue has shown the 9mm 147 gr JHP to offer acceptable performance in law enforcement lethal force confrontations. A senior criminalist with the San Diego P.D., Mr. Eugene J. Wolberg, has analyzed their 9 mm 147 gr JHP performance in 10% ordnance gelatin and compared the laboratory results with the actual terminal effects produced in human tissue in nearly 150 officer involved shootings with the San Diego Police Department. When I last spoke with Mr. Wolberg in May of 2000, the majority of their bullets have penetrated 13 to 15 inches and expanded between 0.60 to 0.62 inches in both human tissue and 10% ordnance gelatin. This appears to be ideal performance from a 9mm. San Diego PD switched to the 9mm 147 gr JHP when their lighter weight, higher velocity 9mm 115 gr JHP bullets had several failures to penetrate deeply enough to create damage to vital organs in the torso and cause rapid incapacitation. 

Other large California agencies with experience using the 9mm 147 gr JHP, such as Los Angeles PD, Los Angeles SO, San Jose PD, Santa Clara PD, Santa Clara SO, San Mateo SO, and San Francisco PD have had similar results. These and other California agencies successfully using the 9mm 147 gr JHP have thousands of officers with hundreds of officer involved shootings. 

Law enforcement personnel should look at all the data, and not take someone's word as gospel. In fact, I would never want anybody to deploy a weapon system or specific ammunition based solely on my or any other person’s comments. I want everyone to do their own scientific, reproducible testing. I certainly do not want unsupported hearsay to influence a choice with such profound implications to the safety of both officers and the public.

This started off as a factory Target model with the laminated wood stock, bull barrel, and ""nicer"" trigger. I swapped out the stock with a Hogue OverMolded soft rubber stock. I put in a Power Custom power recoil buffer, Bell and Carlson extended mag release and their extended automatic bolt release. I added the Wolff performance spring pack also (extra power hammer spring, reduced power trigger and reduced power sear spring). Also included are three 10 round factory mags and one 30 round butler creek mag.

I'd say I've put about 7500 rounds through this beast which is a shame, I know, I should have shot her more.

Currently there is a Bushnell Banner 4x12 AO scope on top. I also have the laminate stock. Feel free to pick and choose, I'm willing to negotiate.

I would much prefer to do a face-to-face transfer and forgo the hassle of mailing this to a FFL. I'm not against taking a little road trip to meet up somewhere in western Montana.

>>This is a cartridge that contains no gunpowder. the little 20g. bullet is solely propelled by the powerful Eley priming mix. For this reason, it does not generate any significant pressure. Due to the lack of noise when fired, the .22 Colibri may be shot indoors, even in the living room, provided a proper back stop is available.

I no longer have my 22 mag and basically forgot I had the ammo.

Here is the story - I had the ammunition in a plastic carry box.  Cleaning rods and stuff in the top tray and  under that you put the ammo, cleaning solvents, oils, etc.  A bottle of solvent tipped over and leaked out and soaked the boxes.  I had not realized that for a period of time and so the boxes were soaked and the metal tarnished.  I'm in the process of cleaning the ammunition.  The ammunition does not look pristine.

Cost - $8/50 rounds - total of $40 as is right now.  If you want me to finish cleaning - $10/50 rounds - $50 bucks.

I will be coming through Wichita on Thursday afternoon and on to the KC metro.  If you want it - contact me and we can make arrangement.  I don't have a firm time on when I'll be coming through Wichita - probably between 4:30 PM and 5:00 PM is my guess from the SW (Harper).

This AR-15 is a carbine upper from Palmetto State Armory with a 12 inch Midwest Industries modular, free-float handguard. It has a lightweight New Frontier lower with a 6-position standard M4 stock. I added some nice flip up iron sights as well. This is an excellent, all-around setup that is lightweight and can take a beating for home defense, hunting, and even a starter in competition. It's also a good place to continue customizing with a nicer stock, putting on the other accessory rails and going full tactical.

I've received the same questions from a couple of people about some important info I initially left off. The barrel is 16"" long and chrome-lined with 1:7 twist to stabilize the heavier, more practical bullets from 50 grain and up with a carbine length gas system. I'll also include the aluminum 30-shot mag which has a Magpul no-tilt follower in it that is even in the photo.

If there is any doubt about the New Frontier polymer lowers, I'll first remind you of some other polymer lowers: Glock, Springfield, Smith & Wesson M&P, FNH, Walther, etc. Then you can search for reviews and torture tests of this lower. I'm quite impressed with the sturdiness, and the tight fit to the uppers I've tried them on. The trigger is really impressive also, crisp with no significant creep or over travel.

I took a bunch of photos that I uploaded to my flickr website, but unfortunately I can't get a hyperlink to work on armslist. You can go to flickr.com/photos/abphotos/sets and in the craigslist set you'll find the photos of the rifle at the end.
