This pistol is compatible with ALL Ruger 10/22 magazines and drums.  I bought it several months ago. 

The previous owner reported issues with jamming.  I installed a new Volquartsen extractor and a new firing pin/firing pin spring.  It now functions pretty well with CCI Mini Mags but it's all about the position of the magazine, so the rounds feed into the chamber properly (regardless of the magazine type).  This is a pretty common problem with these guns and I've heard of some folks doing modifications to the magazine well to make sure the magazines seat/feed correctly.  I didn't feel like doing that, as long as the magazine is pushed forward (not pulled backward), it works pretty well.  Occasionally, the top cover works it way lose after several rounds - but you can just pop it back down.  The top cover and barrel have some slight flecks of surface rust.  When this thing is lubed and loaded with good ammo, it is very fun to shoot.

The gun will come with:
- Extra firing pin (x 1)
- Extra firing pin spring (x2)

I will also include one [B]super evil ""high capacity"" magazine[/B] for a full price deal or an interesting trade.  Seriously, this magazine is PURE evil*...I wouldn't turn my back on it.

Barrel was professionally cut down by Colonial Arms Corp. and has been threaded for their True-Tube chokes (.795 X 44). This shotgun holds NINE 2 3/4"" shells 8+1! This is my most recent shotgun project and I'm looking to start another one. Everything that was done to this gun is as follows...

- Remington black synthetic stock and forend with textured grey rubber inserts

- Remington SuperCell Recoil Pad

- Remington 1100 Tac 4 +4 Magazine Tube Extension

- Remington magazine tube spring, orange follower & magazine tube/barrel clamp

- Colonial Arms Corp. extra-full turkey choke & flush modified choke

- TruGlo fiber-optic front sight & fiber-optic Ghost Ring rear sight with interchangeable rifle sight

- New firing pin spring

This gun was carried as a hunting shotgun for many years before I got a hold of it so there is blue wear on the receiver as well as some scuff marks here and there. Barrel is much better shape but also has a few marks on it. This entire gun was completely torn down and scrubbed clean, even the bolt and trigger assemblies. I have only fired 10 rounds to sight in the ghost ring since it has been cleaned. The action on this gun is incredibly smooth and has cycled over 50 rounds flawlessly from low brass 2 3/4"" shot to 3"" 1 1/4oz slugs.

- $675 for everything

Will consider trades for other GUNS, would particularly like a 12 gauge 11-87 but will consider others. Please let me know if you have any questions, interest or possible trade offers. Thanks for looking!"

The 5.45x39 ammo is still readily available. (NOT 5.56 NATO!) And yes they make non corrosive ammo.

This is not a ""panic buy"" price but an actual current market value for a collectible caliber rifle upper. Although the ammo is available, these rifle uppers are not. They are very hard to find. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. That is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of these uppers are no longer in production they will continue to rise in value even after the ""panic buy""  market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson introduced the M&P15R Rifle Upper Receiver Assembly). This rifle upper is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifle upper comes with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

This is not a ""panic buy"" price but an actual current market value for a collectible caliber rifle upper. Although the ammo is available, these rifle uppers are not. They are very hard to find. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. That is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of these uppers are no longer in production they will continue to rise in value even after the ""panic buy""  market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson introduced the M&P15R Rifle Upper Receiver Assembly). This rifle upper is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifle upper comes with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

This gun would make a great cowboy action shooter, or an asset to a collection. Gun has been in one family since new. Color on reciever remaining is about 30%. Original finish. All screws on the butt and reciever look untouched. There is a clip on the end of the magazine that has slight damage to the screwheads, very minor. All in all about as nice as your going to find one that has been used. I see no signs of abuse. Gun must be picked up in Bowdon.

Unlike some less expensive rifles, this is made of 7075-T6 alloy, even the quad rail.  You may have not heard of Adcor, but they have been making Colt's receivers for years now.  This rifle is one of a handful currently being tested in the military's Individual Carbine program.  It has made it to the second round of testing and may eventually replace the current M4/M16 if it is chosen as the winner.  An independent testing laboratory (H. P. White) ran the rifle for over 6000 rounds without a single stoppage or malfunction, and subjected it to dirt, water, and mud without issue.  This weapon was designed to last, and could certainly be considered an investment grade rifle.  Barrel is 16"".  Rifle is optics ready."

Comes with one (10 round mag) and original ISSC box and spare front sight. It is like new, great condition. Always stored in it's box in a safe and wiped after use. If it were a car an old lady would have driven it to Church on Sundays only.
It enjoys the high velocity .22LR ammo, I have shot the CCI mini mags through it and it is ridiculously accurate.

I am willing to ship on Buyer's coin but local preferred. Throw me an offer. Honestly thought I'd hold onto this gun forever but with the impending ban in Maryland I am trying to pick up new guns before I can't buy them any longer.

Should the anti-legislation die off, you can still get the asking price from a ban state. It was purchased new in 1991 by a Police officer who qualified with it once, and carried it as a patrol rifle for roughly two years before he was told he had to go back to the issued shotgun. He sold to the second in 1993 and estimated a less than 500 rd count. The second owner heavily lubed it and stored it then. It appears to be a good semi-auto copy of a Colt A1-A2. It is one of the first 5000 made by Eagle Arms of Coal Valley, Il. the retail arm of LMT,  owned by Karl Lewis.  It has a  20'' chrome lined barrel and bore, and forged recievers. This company was sold in the wake of the AWB in 1994 by Mr. Lewis to Mark Westeom. who later aquired the Armalite trademark. 
It is not from the Armalite budget line. This rifle was a forerunner of both the Armalite, and LMT ARs. It came from the factory as a complete rifle but it does not have a white stamp on front of the magwell. That practice began under Mr. Westrom. It does not have a cast lower, nor was  the companies inventory sold to DPMS, or DSA.  Those statements may apply to the guns made by Esential Arms of Louisiana.( which may be fine guns, I have no experience with them.However, according to AR-15.com LMT continues to supply receivers to a number of companies. 
 LMT = LMT, Lauer, DS Arms, PWA, Eagle,Armalite, Knights Armament, Barrett, Bushmaster.
Condition would be an easy good-very good. There is some minor fading ( not wear) in spots., that appear a Colt like Greenish Gray.
It comes with 200 rds. 160 redbox, 40 mil surp and new/w tags Black Hawk nylon case. The price is firm as I am helping a friend with an estate liguidation."

Hey guys, I have roughly 5,000 Empties right now.  So here is the deal... I am only selling these in medium flat rate boxes.  Thats +/- 2500 pieces (sorry I am not counting them all out).  Also, given the situation with brass and all ammo, this stuff has gone up a bunch in price.  I honestly am not in a hurry to sell this batch... if it doesn't sell, Ill just reload it myself...

Caliber: 223

Price: $350.00 Shipped PER BOX (2500 +/- pieces)

Other Info: 223 Brass is cleaned and polished but, not processed. I have a medium flat rate box's full.  Pieces are by the pound so I am guessing there are  2500 (give or take, very close)!  

All brass is bright and shiny.. BLING BLING!!  It has been SS wet tumbled and is ready to be processed

I am asking $350.00 Shipped!  With brass getting hard to find, this is what I am asking... Again, no rush for me to sell them."

As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds. 

These price criminals only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but let's face it, do we really need 100 round drums or is that more of a want? Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back under the 1000s where they all belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The regularity will only return if we make it.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents.

Now once again i am getting to those who are gladly using greed that all started with the death of innocent people. Those of you who are using this as your agenda to rip people off have proven i have offended you and your conscious is speaking to you loud and clear! You delete my adds and each time you do then those of us who refuse to participate in your act of greed have won yet another battle. And most of all the truth hurts...doesn't it? SO before those of you who are deleting my adds then i hope you have thought about your actions. Greed can work its way into every person. That does not make you a bad person but money has clouded you judgment, At one point or another it has clouded all of ours. So before you delete it again then respond to me, State your case, Call me what ever you wish. My response will not be intended to be rude, I do not intend to judge you but it will start with be thank you for your reply and end with god bless you. I am not better then you, At one point im my life i have let greed over come me as well. If you don't agree then tell me. I will tell you what i believe and what i have seen.  I am not one who post something that i would not tell any one face to face. Please read what i say, Think about it, Look at what acts of greed has done to this great country! Then look what the same greed has done to so many other country's. For those who think this is just about guns...Greed is what this is about, weather its guns, ammo, or something completely different. 
If your tired of being ripped of by people price gouging then do i have a deal for you. STOP FEEDING INTO IGNORANT (lacking Knowledge) PEOPLE WHO WANT NOTHING MORE THEN RIP YOU OFF> If you continue to pay these prices people will continue to enjoy ripping you off for guns an ammo. Dont sell your guns for stupid prices and dont buy guns for stupid prices. ITS GREED plain and simple. Remember what goes around comes around in time. In God We Trust used to be what we lived by! Now some of those same people who claim to live by this are doing what our government want. Tearing our great country apart with GREED! Im sure this will make some person offended..Guess what so am I. Do more then your self for others is a good moto to live by. Rip every one off that you can and pretend to be a good person has become what some are about. SPEAK OUT! Those who do nothing because they think one man or woman cant make a difference...You are not alone. UNITE, FIGHT, PROSPER or lay down and empower Greed. Its your choice. Greed is a form of evil. ""All that is needed for evil to prosper is for a good person to do nothing"". United we stand, Divided we fall. Remember this. Pricing you guns so high that a good person who wants nothing more then to protect their family or own life cant afford them. How much good have you done for others. Its not about just guns. Its about Greed and those who can happily rip someone off and smile about it! Delete my add and you will have proved me right. Leave me nasty comments and the truth has got to your conscious. I hope people will do what is right but that lies on your shoulders now!! Those of you who do not see your actions as greed but only meating the demand...Would you need to sell your gun for twice its worth just because you know you can a huge profit. Maybe you need to put food on your familys table....is that your reason? I have 3 children and when i struggle i pray. God has never let me go hungry, God has never given me more then i can handle. I trust in him and try to show others. THAT DOES NOT MAKE ME BETTER THEN ANY ONE WHO MAY READ THIS. What it does you ask. It has reminded me that life is not what i can do for myself, but hopefully i am able to do what God has called each and every one of us to do and help others if i can. 

For those of you wanting to stop this act of Greed. Then lets do something about it. Let us who refuse to be victims become sheep dogs. Let us form our own group to help each other out. Contact me with ideas, Band together but most of all do not stand by and do nothing. Im not asking you to throw a bible at ever person you see..but speak out, Help each other as if they were your brother or sister and do not let money cloud our judgment. People with good intentions and the realization that there are others like us who want nothing more then to be fair, and power through the temptations to fall into negative intentions still exist..So until the next person who is afraid of the truth deletes my add then let us stand together for our cause just as those who have followed the people who want nothing more then to suck the money from each person who feel they have no choice but to pay these ridiculous prices. GOD BLESS everyone and our Great Nation!"

As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

These price criminals only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but let's face it, do we really need 100 round drums or is that more of a want? Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back under the 1000s where they all belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The regularity will only return if we make it.

I watched a Walmart employee buy 6 boxes of .223 ammo after being told they didn't have any. This employee went outside and sold it for $60 a box normally $37 and change. Now we can only buy 3 boxes he bought 6, then sold it in the parking lot on his ""break"". How can we get ahead?"
