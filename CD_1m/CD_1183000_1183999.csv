Product Description:

The DCM Competition Model combines all the features we've seen as ""modifications"" by High Power Competitors - to create a rifle that can help you win ""right out of the box""! Bushmaster has designed a rifle for the serious DCM Competition Shooter. In keeping with DCM (Department of Civilian Marksmanship) High Power Competition Rules, this rifle looks like a ""stock AR-15"" type rifle, but includes all the modifications and upgrades that will give you a competitive edge. All the features built into this superb competition rifle result from years of observation and discussions with competitors at the Camp Perry National High Power Matches. These special accurizing features include:

The M16A2 Dual Aperture Rear Sight is specifically modified to accept interchangeable apertures available in four sizes to suit the competitor's vision and preference... .036""; .040"" (Standard); .046"" or .052"" diameter. Additionally, the sight can be configured for a choice of 1/2"" or 1/4"" Minute of Adjustment for both Windage Knob and Elevation Drum.

The Competition Front Sight is specially ground on three sides for optimum clarity, and is available in the shooter's choice of two widths (.052"",or .062""). It is secured within the front sight base by a set screw to avoid the possibility of any movement once the rifle has been ""zeroed"".

The 20"" Bushmaster Extra Heavy Competition Barrel is a full 1"" diameter under the free float tube, and is precision button rifled 1 turn in 8"" - right hand twist - 6 lands and grooves. The Barrel material is ChromeMoly Vanadium Steel, and the Firing Chamber is machined to SAAMI specifications. It is lead lapped and hardened to Rockwell C26 to 32. Unlike many other Bushmaster Barrels, this barrel is not Chrome lined.

In the Upper Receiver, the Bolt is carefully matched to the Barrel Extension Lugs for precise lockup, maximum strength and optimum accuracy.

The Lower Receiver houses a finely honed Two Stage Competition Trigger that is factory set for a 3.5 lb. first stage and a 1 lb. let-off (second stage). This 4.5 lb. total trigger pull meets CMP/NRA competition regulations.

The handguard set looks like government issue parts, but is actually a Competition ""Free Floater"" Tube (handguard tube/barrel nut combination). It does not contact the Barrel forward of the Receiver. A sling swivel is attached to the forward end of the tube to avoid any possibility of deflection or pressure on the barrel that could degrade accuracy.

The Buttstock has been improved for competition with the addition of a 3.62 lb. lead ""Counterbalance Weight"" which can be trimmed by the competitor to achieve a comfortable balance and solid feel."

It is chambered for the .223 Remington and features a 18"" barrel with AR-15 style flash hider. The Galil is a modified and improved version of the famous Kalashnikov (AK47) design. It was specifically manufactured to fire the .223 cartridge and to function flawlessly in the arid (and sandy) desert environment of the Middle East. The Galil was selected as the weapon of choice by the Israeli Defense Forces, beating out the M16A1, AK47, and HK33 among others. Other features include a milled receiver, wood handguard, folding carry handle, integral bipod, AK style safety w/ additional left-side thumb safety, and heavy duty side-folding stock. This weapon is in excellent overall condition. There are a few minor handling and storage marks but no rust or pitting. Looking at the internals, I cannot tell if this rifle has even been fired!

It is chambered for the .223 Remington and features a 18"" barrel with AR-15 style flash hider. The Galil is a modified and improved version of the famous Kalashnikov (AK47) design. It was specifically manufactured to fire the .223 cartridge and to function flawlessly in the arid (and sandy) desert environment of the Middle East. The Galil was selected as the weapon of choice by the Israeli Defense Forces, beating out the M16A1, AK47, and HK33 among others. Other features include a milled receiver, wood handguard, folding carry handle, integral bipod, AK style safety w/ additional left-side thumb safety, and heavy duty side-folding stock. This weapon is in excellent overall condition. There are a few minor handling and storage marks but no rust or pitting. Looking at the internals, I cannot tell if this rifle has even been fired! Needless to say, the mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is likewise excellent. you can contact me via seccoalis@gmail.com, my loss is your gain...."

The Galil was selected as the weapon of choice by the Israeli Defense Forces, beating out the M16A1, AK47, and HK33 among others. Other features include a milled receiver, wood handguard, folding carry handle, integral bipod, AK style safety w/ additional left-side thumb safety, and heavy duty side-folding stock. This weapon is in excellent overall condition. There are a few minor handling and storage marks but no rust or pitting. Looking at the internals, I cannot tell if this rifle has even been fired! Needless to say, the mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is likewise excellent. you can contact me via seccoalis@gmail.com, my loss is your gain...."

Fellow firearm enthusiast, please help clean up this site from price gougers. Start flagging the overpriced items. We should be sticking together and fighting the folks attacking our second amendment rights here in Colorado, not taking advantage of each other.

When you see these gougers, and they are apparent flag them. They are not trying to make a fair profit but are doubling or tripling the price, simply click on the flag option, click overprice, and hit ok.

This message will likely be flagged by them within minutes and will disappear, so please help out. Copy this message and repost yourself later today and various times during the week.

If we show a uniform voice, they will eventually keep their hoarded stashes or come down in price.

Fellow firearm enthusiast, please help clean up this site from price gougers. Start flagging the overpriced items. We should be sticking together and fighting the folks attacking our second amendment rights here in Colorado, not taking advantage of each other.

When you see these gougers, and they are apparent flag them. They are not trying to make a fair profit but are doubling or tripling the price, simply click on the flag option, click overprice, and hit ok.

This message will likely be flagged by them within minutes and will disappear, so please help out. Copy this message and repost yourself later today and various times during the week.

If we show a uniform voice, they will eventually keep their hoarded stashes or come down in price. I am all about capitalism – I am not about taking advantage of others in a situation outside their control. Did we all feel the gas stations in New York charging $12 to $20 a gallon after the hurricane was fair – NO, and neither is the gouging going on right now.

No more $900 ARs for $1,800 to $2,000; no more USGI magazines that walk of military bases being sold for $30, nor more $700 AKs being sold for $1,500. Let freedom and fairness prevail!"

It is chambered for the .223 Remington and features a 18"" barrel with AR-15 style flash hider. The Galil is a modified and improved version of the famous Kalashnikov (AK47) design. It was specifically manufactured to fire the .223 cartridge and to function flawlessly in the arid (and sandy) desert environment of the Middle East. The Galil was selected as the weapon of choice by the Israeli Defense Forces, beating out the M16A1, AK47, and HK33 among others. Other features include a milled receiver, wood handguard, folding carry handle, integral bipod, AK style safety w/ additional left-side thumb safety, and heavy duty side-folding stock. This weapon is in excellent overall condition. There are a few minor handling and storage marks but no rust or pitting. Looking at the internals, I cannot tell if this rifle has even been fired!

Hey. I have my Keltec with Glock .40 mag. Never fired. Never used it for what i wanted it for. Factory photos.. The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price."

Over the last few decades there has been a misconception among many including some of the most learned scholars of Gundom that handguns are a short range proposition only and that shooting anything past 25 yards with a defensive handgun is sheer folly. I am here to tell you that this line of thinking really hinders the aspiring pistol shot and gives the shooter a false impression about the defensive handgun in general.

Now let me explain: I think it would be very hard to justify in court any defensive shooting out to 25 yards or beyond, meaning I would not recommend shooting a non-gun toting assailant from distances greater than this with your pistol. But that doesn’t mean however you should not practice with your carry gun to distances as far as you can place the shots accurately, even if it is a mouse gun that looks like it couldn’t spit a piece of lead out past the end of your arm.

I shot 50 rounds in the picture below out 25 yards, so it can be done and it was. The fact that it has next to no recoil really helps. 

I will also accept in lieu of FRNs 6 - 1 oz silver american eagles or 180rnd box of .308 ammo. I will also accept trade if its a revolver, a .380 pistol or 9130 Mosin Nagant Rifle. Also willing to trade this for a scope of equal value that will fit on a Mossberg .308 bolt action rifle.

22LR - Six Round Capacity Magazine.
This is an enjoyable gun and brand new, only a few months old and I have put only 100 rounds through it. This is also an affordable and reliable firearm in the .22 Long Rifle caliber category. Next to no recoil, with 13oz weight and small enough to fit in your hand its perfect for CCW and for women of small stature and for those starting out in the firearms world. Perhaps its because you've been watching C-SPAN. I'm also betting that the recession has put a slight dent in your discretionary income, and that you're a little confused and overwhelmed by all the opinions on the internet forums out there (as they say a river that is a mile wide, is an inch deep). Buying a used gun to save money can be a hit or miss in the quality department. To address this I will attempt to make a youtube video in the coming weeks to ensure everyone that I am not selling this gun because its a cheapie, but because I am just ready to move on to other firearms. I am willing to trade so its not about needing to get rid of it. In fact, when I move out of Philly, if I still own this, I will not be selling it, it will be my LCTF.

Despite all the negativity you read online about it, I have had absolutely no problems with this gun. Buyer pays transfer fee. I understand the history behind this manufacturer, but I have not had any problems with this firearm. I need to be clear here, if I successfully move out of Philly and into Gods country real soon, the rest of PA, I will no longer be selling this firearm as it will be my LTCF, but while I am here I refuse to go through the Philadelphia process of getting a CCW. I am not bringing down the price, trust me with the ban thats coming and the inflation thats coming, it will hold its value. So I am either going to sell it for the asking price soon, or I will keep it as my LTCF once I move out of Philly. I just wanted to be clear that this is not a damaged firearm.

Part of the Rimfire Technologies kit allows the bolt to remain to the rear and simply pulling it back and letting it go will release the bolt.  The factory set up is not user friendly, this is much better.

Ruger soft case with zippered pocket also included and of course a trigger lock (can never be too safe)!  The box/paperwork for the scope is included and I should be able to find the Ruger paperwork for the 10/22 and throw that in too.  I also have a Ruger 10/22 book that is older, but has lots of good info on these rifles.

Well, that's the package.  It is a great looking rifle and the photos do not do it justice.  The colors in the stock are amazine and the fluted barrel looks great.  Let me know if you would like to purchase this package.

This was purchased last month brand new from Sportsmans Warehouse here in Lexington. I intended for it to be my main carry weapon but I'm a 45ACP guy and can't let go of my XDs. In full disclosure this gun has had exactly 26 bullets down the chamber in one trip to the range at Bud's. It's as close to new as you'll find and this model seems to be sold out everywhere right now. Included with the gun are the original carrying case and factory 6rd mag as well as an additional factory 7rd mag (purchased from Bud's for $50) and a Crossbreed IWB Horsehide Mini Tuck holster ($80 and never used). This is the perfect setup for someone looking to carry an ultra compact 9mm pistol and comes with factory Sig Night Sites. I also have two additional 6rd factory magazines that I will sell with the gun for $45 each (otherwise they get sent back to Cabelas). Email or call/text REDACTED with any questions. Firm on the price as worst case I'll put it in my carry rotation or keep it in the safe for a rainy day.

I just realized how low on 22lr target ammo I am and thought I would offer a trade for someone who needs 9mm. Both are scarce now.

I will consider taking less 22lr ammo if you want to trade some CCI stingers, Winchester 333 packs(plus 5$), or some other, nicer ammo. Also, partial trades of cash and ammo (like 10$ and 250 rounds of bulk 22lr) would be considered. I am not really looking to sell but I guess I will take offers."

This is a .40 caliber, compact, steel-framed semi-automatic pistols. Firestar pistols are recoil operated, with Browning cam locking and short barrel recoil. The M-40 is double action pistol with frame mounted ambidextrous safety that allows for ""cocked and locked"" carry. All Firestars featured automated firing pin safey and magazine disconnect safety. Single column magazine holds 6 rounds. 

Firestar pistols are claimed to be ones of the smallest guns in their caliber, but, obviously not the lightest ones. The solid steel construction makes these guns extremely sturdy and reliable, and additional weight greatly improves recoil control and makes the shooting quite comfortable, despite the powerful ammunition and small size of the gun.

DS Arms is one of the few manufacturers that uses only U.S made components that are assembled here, yup, in the United States.  These are military specification rifles, conformed by DSA for civilian duty, which is exactly what would be expected from a company that well over 90% of the rifles they build go straight to militaries and police/swat agencies.  Which is, also, why most people haven't heard of the manufacturer.  They haven't broken on the civilian market but the people who use their rifles know and trust their quality with their lifes.  Every day!!  

Brand new, straight from DSA.

This rifle is chambered in the Nato 5.56, meaning it can shoot the higher potency 5.56mm or the .223 rem.  Choices for ammunition are a good thing with shortages ruling the scene.  
This rifle includes the foregrip, one magazine and a hard case, and, has a ""Dont tread on me"" machined onto the lower.

NO weapons have been banned yet. NO ammunition has been regulated. NOT ONE piece of legislation has been passed federally that does one thing to inhibit us from owning, selling, trading, or utilizing firearms, yet I scroll through these listings in shock at how some are choosing to take advantage of an already stressful situation. Should the price of an AR-15 have gone up? Maybe a little since supplies have been depleted. .40 SW ammo.....yeah, it should probably be a little higher since the government just bought a couple billion rounds. But what broke the bank for me was when I saw a not yet banned, always difficult to find weapon (even with zero gun control talks), from a mediocre company, that is normally priced in the $500-600 range, going for over double that. Shame on us. We have allowed fear of government intrusion and greedy FFL holding dealers drive these prices through the roof, to where even .22lr is impossible to come by for cheap. Looks like we fell right into their hands. They have dried up the market, and the greedy are making a big buck. Congrats. My advice....quit paying overbloated prices and they will come down. Don't accept these high prices as the new norm, otherwise this activity that we all enjoy is gonna be impossible to afford."

If you are interested please read the entire post. I have put a lot of time, money and work into this gun in order to get it functioning flawlessly. If you know anything about these guns then you know that they can be rather finicky out of the box and require some fine tuning. I did just about everything you can do to this gun and have spent lots of time at the range breaking it in and firing all sorts of different rounds through it until I got it just right. It will now cycle very light target/bird loads all the way up to 3in slugs without a single ftf issue. The gun has been disassembled and cleaned thoroughly after every shooting session. The magazines have also been disassembled, cleaned, lubricated and they all work perfectly now. 

I absolutely love this gun and never would have considered selling it but I would like to put the money towards a different project. I know how much time and money I have put into this gun so please don’t waste my time with any low ball offers. The only way I can justify selling the gun is if I get the price I am asking for it, If I can’t then it’s just not worth it to me to sell. These guns are becoming harder and harder to find and if a ban were to pass you may never get your hands on one. 

The following is a list of everything that has been done to the gun and what all is included. I’m selling it as a complete package deal, so if you don’t want everything then don’t waste my time. If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures let me know.
