Mag. Hard rifle to find, IF you can find one. I'm moving and she has to go. She is flawless from the blueing to the recoil pad. She is in 100% new condition. Thought I'd use it after hunting for this rifle for two years, but never did get her out much, and by ""much"" I mean ""once"" to test fire it - been in the case ever since. She's had 7 rounds fired by me to check the Battue sight. Again, flawless in every way. It hasn't even had a scope put on, I only put the rings on while I'm packing up so I wouldn't misplace them - they have not been torqued yet. It comes with original box, rings, soft case, manual + paperwork, etc. Call, email, or text anytime for pics or information. REDACTED"

Easily the most advanced rimfire rifle ever built, the Model 597™ represents the first technological breakthrough in the category in 35 years. Our new rifle has all the standard features that have made the originals an American favorite, but with some notable upgrades. Because our Model 597™ action is the ultimate in feeding reliability and out-of-the-box accuracy, it was only natural we develop the Model 597™ TVP™ (Target-Varmint Plinker) to take full advantage of the superior design.

Truly the ultimate 22 target-rifle platform, this tack-driver features a 20"" stainless heavy barrel and a rugged laminated thumbhole stock that’s contoured to accommodate right- and left-handed shooters with equal comfort. The impeccable balance of our new stock design will shine the first time you try an offhand shot. Trust us, one squeeze of the trigger and you’ll be a believer. Its receiver is equipped with a factory-mounted scope rail so you can add optics and be ready to shoot in a flash."

Product Information
The MagPul 20LR PMag is constructed from advanced polymers with superior impact resistance and light weight. This 20-Round magazine is designed to replace the standard SR25/ M110 pattern magazines. The 20LR is less than half the weight of a standard steel mag and has a true 20-round capacity. The body is designed with a constant-curve inside dimension and a self-lubricating follower for reliable feeding. The textured magazine body and flared floorplate improve handling over standard magazines. The snap-on impact cover protects the feed lips from impacts and debris while in storage. The impact cover also allows loaded magazines to be stored long-term (over 1 year) without compromising the integrity of the feed lips. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using the impact cover or simple punch for cleaning and maintenance.

These are the best type of 870 you can get in my opinion. The adjustable recoil reducing stocks have a problem with cheek slap, an uncomfortable upward motion experienced when firing the gun with a solid cheek weld. The Talon stock is more like the traditional 870 stock, but still utilizes a pistol grip, and 2 different size interchangeable grips to suit different sized hands. I personally like to be able to fire shells all day without  feeling like my shoulder is going to fall off the next. 
With this stock, there is very little recoil compared to a factory stock combined with shooting magnum loads, or slugs. Target acquisition is also better because there is less muzzle climb. Again, the items included with this package include:
-Remington 870 Tactical 12 gauge with 6+1 shell carrying capacity
-6 shell side saddle ammo holder and belt holder
-Blackhawk Talon Spec Ops Gen 2 Recoil Reducing pistol grip fixed stock with storage compartment and also the standard factory stock and screws
-Assorted 12 Gauge 00 Military Grade Buckshot shells, and over 50 high brass Interstate steel #6 waterfowl game loads

It is a Bushmaster XM15 lower reciever with an amazing Compass Lake upper receiver.  It has a heavily fluted 20"" barrel with a lathe turned muzzle brake on it that does come off, but is put on so perfectly that you can't even see the seam between the brake and the barrel.  The barrel is a heavy contour under the Nordic Components handguard, but fluted well to balance it.  After the gas block it is .750 to the muzzle.  
The lower has been reworked by Compass Lake with their 2 stage match trigger and it is light and smooth as can be with a very clean break.  It has a Magpul MOE fixed stock, which offers a shorter length of pull and better cheek weld than the A2 stock.  
I will include the Leupold single piece mount designed specifically for ARs to bring the scope up and forward allowing correct eye relief and head positioning, and the SWFA SS fixed 10X scope.  Also I will include the Bipod and 4 20 round PMAGS, which fit better than the 30 rounders in the prone.
I am asking $3200 for this setup.  I would like to do face to face in the FT Lewis area of Washington.  I will drive up to 2 hours for a full price offer though.

This is a heavy profile chrome moly vanadium 16"" steel barrel which has better accuracy and will hold tighter groups after repeated shots, than the lighter AR15 barrels. 

This model comes with a detachable handle, 6 position stock,  and a Picatinny rail for simple optics attachment. The upper and lower receivers are machined from 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum forgings for light weight and added strength.

Description

HellFighter
The HellFighter® WeaponLight for crew-served weapons and heavy guns packs power and versatility into a tough, compact package that weighs only 10 pounds and measures a mere eight inches in length. It features a blinding 3,000-lumen beam with enough reach to illuminate targets hundreds of yards away and enough surround beam to make it perfect for patrol or search-and-rescue operations. 

Built to withstand intense recoil and combat conditions, the HellFighter's water-resistant body is constructed from high-strength aerospace aluminum with a Mil-Spec Type III hard anodizing finish. A 5mm multi-coated Pyrex® window protects its lamp assembly, and the window itself is protected from dust, mud, and heavy particle impact by either a swing-open amber filter for cutting through smoke or dust, a swing-open infrared for use with night vision devices (NVDs), or a swing-open opaque cover. 

The HellFighter's rugged high-intensity discharge (HID) lamp is powered by one or two military BA-5590 batteries or from a 12-volt auto battery, and is virtually immune to failure from recoil, vibration, or impact since it has no filament to break or burn out."

This is the Centurian 24 by Liberty.  It's only a couple months old.  Although they say this will hold 24 guns, I'd say 12 is more realistic if you have decent sized assault rifles or scoped rifles.  You can reconfigure the inside however you want it, I use the shelves on the right side for storage.  The do come out and you can put rifles just like on the left side.  It has a small dent by the top hinge which doesn't affect anything and is not very noticable unless you're looking for it.  Has a combo lock that I changed from a 3 number combo to a 2 number combo for faster entry.  I can put it back to a 3 number combo if you prefer.

Additional Description: With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. Features a Nitron®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame. Hogue® Grips round out this package.

The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

You can reconfigure the inside however you want it, I use the shelves on the right side for storage. They do come out and you can put rifles just like on the left side. It has a small dent by the top hinge which doesn't affect anything and is not very noticable unless you're looking for it.

By purchasing you acknowledge and fully understand the statement below. (copied from http://www.calegalmags.com/Rebuild-Kit-Info_ep_42.html)

Rebuild Kit Info READ PRIOR TO PURCHASING

*IMPORTANT- Regarding Rebuild Kits*

A ""REBUILD KIT"" is a complete magazine that has been disassembled into parts. 

It contains all the original parts of the magazine that have been taken apart before being shipped into California to comply with state and local laws. I do not remove any parts of the rebuild kit before i ship to buyers

Rebuild kits are not to be used to assemble a new high capacity magazine which would be in violation of local or state law. These rebuild kits are intended to rebuild a legally owned pre-ban magazine or for assembling a 10 round magazine pursuant to local or state law.

You can assemble your rebuild kit into a magazine when you are outside of CA or at a location at which you are legally allowed to possess a high capacity magazine. For example: You can take your rebuild kit from California to Arizona, assemble it, use it, and take it apart before you return to California. Many of buyers are competition shooters who reside in CA but travel the country shooting and require rebuild kits for competition. Others attend weapon training facilities in other states where they are legally allowed to assemble and use rebuild kits as magazines. Just be sure you take them apart completely before returning to California. 

By purchasing a rebuild kit(s) the purchaser accepts sole responsibility to remain in accordance with local or state law and any failure to do so will be the purchasers responsibility. I accepts no liability whatsoever for misuse or negligence on the part of the purchaser. 

It is the responsibility of the buyer to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, and federal laws in regard to the possession, use, and sale of any item purchased from me.

I do not sell hi-capacity magazines period. 

Please consult the CA DOJ and/or your local ATF office if you have any legality related questions. Calegalmags is simply a retail business, we do not answer or respond to any legal or regulation related questions for liability reasons."

If it's not new - it was not used much and certainly no signs of holster wear. There is a very thin scratch on the left side, bottom, of the grip. It's a 'hair' scratch - I didn't see it when I bought it so I can only speculate that it's the result of someone here handling it.

"" I've said this and really believed it.
""Why buy the USA model when the Italian one will last longer"" oah yeah I thought so too. 

I highly favored the Italian model Beretta over the USA model for as long as I can remember and I'm sure a lot of you's have as well. In fact I still do but only for novelty reasons and that's just about it. I'm not a very Patriotic only buy American things type of guy, but I have some things to make you think about when buying your next Beretta M9 or 92fs. If you have ears attached to your head you've heard the story, but did you ever really think it through. 

When Beretta came to us to propose the Beretta M9 it was basically a prototype in our eyes. They though it was ready for the battle field and in fact is it strait out wasn't. Not only that it was far from it.  We made them change so many things before we even tested it. Like where the mag release button is, no it wasn't always where it is today, and where the safety is and also the fact that it decocks. that's just to name a few besides the magazines that the US helped Beretta with the design and production of after the magazine problems. also other little things like measurements of the gun itself, Ok ok I digress on that. If you didn't know now you do.

Fact is every time the US even suggested a change or even touched the Beretta it got better, and yes that is a fact!!  When they brought the Beretta to the US, it was basically a hunk of metal with an open slide that was very attractive to the eye and the US wanted to make it work. I didn't see or hear about the US suggesting even a 1 change on any other test weapon let alone help! all we did was complain about them during and after testing and told them what was wrong, but didn't suggest or try to help by any means.
The US told Beretta what to do with the firearm and gave them plenty of chances to get it right and straiten out the design. Even helped them with the measurements like I said before. 

The US was not stupid and saw something good and boy were they right. The us didn't Just help smooth out the edges they dam near designed the dam thing themselves. In all reality the Italian's should be trying to get there hands on the USA model not the other way around. Bottom line, if it wasn't for the US Beretta would be nowhere near or even close to what they are today!! our contract made them and we dam near made there gun.

""But Italy has a harder metal and aluminum"" Think again, we have access to the most strongest metals known to mankind. Not saying there used on the beretta, but if that's the last statement anyone who loves Italian beretta's is holding on to I guess I just cut the string. Italy couldn't get the metals we could. oah and craftsmanship, well we crafted it! anything else?? we both use the same exact machinery as a matter a fact we ship them the machines we use, not the other way around. 

Well I think I got my point across. If you don't favor the USA model over the Italian one that is absolutely fine, but don't look down on or think anything less of the USA model. Both are great models. If I had to choose what model would outlast the other id have to go with the USA model and that's if I really had to choose. I own both in both blued and inox. All work great. the Italian model Inox turned yellow where the wear marks are as they did on my cousins after about 800 rounds but they still work great. That is he only problem I've came across with either model. If the USA model did that o boy forget about, no one would buy another one. Thank you for reading.     Now armslist on you Armslisters!!"

-Benchmade 332AGR Pardue Titanium framelock. A.G. Russell exclusive in 2000 I think it was. Hard to find little knife. I have 2 of them and both are new, but no boxes. $180
-Spyderco Bi-Fold Auto like new in box w/ paperwork. Very few made and been discontinued for awhile. Made in Golden, CO. Bought new and carried maybe 3 times, but never used for anything. $160
-Springfield Armory ""GPK"" folder. Carbon fiber handles. Very well made knife and if I'm not mistaken Eickorn of Germany made them for Springfield. There were only 3 knives made by Springfield Armory and I think you got the chance to buy one if you purchased a rifle from them, but I could be wrong on that. I have 2 of these, both brand new, but only 1 is still in the package and never been taken out. $200 for the one in package, $175 for other.
-Springfield Armory ""Tactical"" folder slightly used in excellent condition. Black Kalgard coated tanto blade. Also made by Eickorn of Germany. Nice, stout knife. $100
-SOG Pentagon Elite II as new in box. Older model in black & white box and has ""Pat. Pend."" on blade. Made in Japan. This is a well made and very large folder withthe axis lock. $120
-TOPS Ranger Short Stop fixed blade with kydex sheath new but no box. 6"" overall. Micarta handles and 1/4"" thick blade w/ full tang. Very stout knife. $90
-Deviant Blades Custom friction folder brand new & only came in a small pouch. Thick carbon fiber handles with black coated A2 steel plain edge blade. Maker said he made around 50 of these and some had O2 steel blades but not a lot. I paid $250 several years ago. $250
-Cold Steel Voyager XL ""Gunsite"" model new in box. Not sure how many Gunsite models they did but I don't see many. Tanto blade. Very large folder at around 10""-11"" open. Made in Japan. $120
-Cold Steel Scimitar used in excellent condition. Carried for a few months off and on. Black plain edge blade. Been discontinued several years. $90
-Strider custom ""LM Nail"" new in wrapper but took off the wimpy 1"" of flat paracord they wrapped around the end for a grip and had a friend wrap a nice paracord grip on it which I think looks & feels  much better. Kydex sheath on same color paracord to wear around neck. $140
-Spyderco ""Toad"" D'Holder designed folder. Small little liner lock but very stout. Hard to come by too. I have 2 of these, both new in box. 1 is serrated and 1 is plain edge. $165 each.
-Mickey Yurco custom Coin Knife new in plastic padded container it came in. Made from a real 50 cent piece. Paid a little over $100 a few years ago. $95
-Ontario XM-1 Extreme Military folder new in box. One of the stoutest folders I have seen. Thick titanium  liners and N690 Cobalt steel blade. I carry one just like it a lot. $140
-Camillus ""CUDA2"" Quik-Action folder like new. Hollow ground bead blasted ATS-34 tanto blade, dual stainless steel liners, G10 handles. Has very unique 'thumb disc"" you push toward the business end of the knife to open blade. Pretty rare knife. $225
-Tactical Dzigns Titanium Ice Pick with really grippy handle with kydex neck sheath. Titanium looks flamed. If you want to be a hitman when you grow up you need this thing....I don't know what else it would be good for. Hand made and VERY sharp point. $40
-Microtech Scarab CLONE auto. This is the one that costs around $55 I think. Used, and I got in a trade a year or so ago. Fires hard and it's not terrible quality but not a Microtech either. $40
-Boker Tree Brand ""Orion"" folder. Model # 2065. VERY rare knife that was an A.G. Russell exclusive. Carbon fiber handles with titanium blade with a crystallized titanium coating that looks really cool and SUPPOSEDLY will kill most any germ on contact. I have seen the coating on kitchen knives before but don't take my word on the germ thing. New in box with paperwork. Very limited production & hard to get. $280
-Boker Tree Brand ""Personal"" fixed blade. This is the mate to the Boker Orion listed above. It has the same titanium blade with the colorful crystallized coating, and the handle is titanium too. New in box and also comes with a very nice black leather sheath. A.G. Russell exclusive also. $160

Brand new, never fired, never inserted. I put 20 rds into it and out of it by hand a couple minutes ago to confirm it is a 20 rounder. I've had it a few years, sold the rifle, found these mags later. I will ship it to you in a ziploc baggie, inside a USPO box. I don't have the original packaging. I have other after market Mini-14 mags, this one is better by far. You pay for the postage, insurance and proof of delivery, the cheapest way possible but you'll get it. I also have two nickle 30's (after market, not identical-$30each) and three polymer 30 rd. Promags ( $20 each). All are new, never fired or inserted. The promags are in their original packaging, one of the nickles is also, the other will be in a ziploc. To be fair the nickles look like crap (not beat up, just not made as good) compared to the factory Ruger but they're at least thick steel. If I kept them there would be pliers, mabe a file and certainly lube in their future. The Promags are what they are, polymer mags. All of them are better than shooting single shot :) Lastly if you live in a Commie state that doesn't give a rat about your 2nd Amendment rights I can dissassemble them and send them to you as ""repair"" kits that can majically reassemble at your kitchen table in about 30 seconds, if even that long. What you do after that is and should always be your own business."

Shipping price includes fees from my FFL dealer to yours. Size matters in a concealed carry pistol. Reduced dimensions and light weight are as important as magazine capacity and power. Kimber Ultra Carry pistols in .45 ACP and have it all, and put it together in a 1911 package that simply outperforms any other type of semi-automatic. To ensure dependability, Ultra Carry lightweight aluminum frames are machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. Each model has standard Kimber features like rounded and blended edges, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety and bumped beavertail grip safety. Magazine capacity is 7 rounds in .45 ACP. They fit almost any size hand and point naturally. Best of all, the crisp, clean single action trigger eliminates long travel, heavy pull and the guessing that goes with it. For concealed carry, nothing beats a 1911–and no 1911 beats a Kimber.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.
