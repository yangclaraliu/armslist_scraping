For trade I have :

Marlin model 60, made in 1988. It is an 18 shot with the 'last shot/bolt open' feature that was only available for a couple of years in the late 80's. It had a double feed issue common with this model) I sent it to my gunsmith and the problem is gone. I got it back last week, so it is quite literally fresh from the workbench. It is in good condition, with some bluing missing on the bolt handle & area. The wood stock has some general wear, a minor bump, scratch bruise here & there, but still looks decent. It's a rock solid gun & is dead on accurate.

I also have a Mossberg 2+1 'Sweet 16' 16.ga. Here is a video i shot for a guy that was asking about it earlier.

These are the last ones I have.  Once they are gone, there will be no more.

With the bill that passed in Colorado (House Bill 1224) that looks like it will force Magpul out of Colorado these may become very hard to find. Magpul is currently making all orders in Colorado their top priority and has even started a program for Colorado residents to try to get them as many magazines as possible before the ban goes live and they have to leave. While this is a good program in my opinion, it means the rest of the US may experience a shortage in magazines and will have a harder time finding them.

I have 9 left for sale. All orders will be shipped via USPS unless local pickup and cash payment. Orders of multiple magazines will be grouped together for shipping. Tracking number will be provided when shipped. Shipping will occur 24-72 hours after confirmed PayPal payment has been received.

Black tapcoT-6 6-position stock. Expands or contracts to fit any shooter.
Bayonet AND front foregrip installed, see pictures. You don't find that often, it's pretty great. Bayonet fits snugly into bayonet slot as it should when it's closed, and it clears the foregrip at all times.
All Numbers Match, excellent condition throughout. Cycles, fires and functions flawlessly. Selling to pay my bills and asking for a firm and very fair price.
You get the SKS rifle in the TAPCO stock.
2 TAPCO detachable 20 round magazines.
TANGO-DOWN brand, front foregrip installed.
SKS spike bayonet installed and fully functional with the foregrip in place.
Hi-Rise cheek rest that you can take off as you wish. It sets perfectly to line you up with the 4x32 scope. 
This rifle is tight as a drum and the action is like new. Whole thing looks and functions like new. Front and rear iron sites, (which are adjustable to 1100 yards/1000 meters [and the numbers are printed right on the rear site], can be seen perfectly, even with the scope installed. You can use the iron sites or the 4x32 sniper scope, it's your choice.
Two scopes come with the rifle, see pics. The 4x32 sniper scope, as seen in the pic. It sits atop a receiver cover that has 4 factory hold-down screws that keep this thing rigidly in place. It used to be that a receiver mounted scope ""walked around"" a bit and was a bad choice because the receiver cover would move slightly after multiple shots, but this 5th generation receiver cover from UTG with the set screws and retainer nuts is the real-deal and it is a rigid and excellent set up that will not move after you zero your scope. Rifle also has the shell deflector installed so the expelled shells don't hit your scope.
If you don't want to use the magnifying scope, loosen the nuts and pull the pin on the receiver cover and take off the whole 4x32 set-up...(((it's all bolted together, receiver cover, scope and mounts and shell deflector and comes off easily as one unit)))...then pop the original receiver cover on (which is included of course) and then install your projection red-dot scope, also included in this deal(as seen in the picture). This red-dot scope is of good quality and works great. If you don't know what a Red-Dot scope is, it is for QUICK shouldering and aiming of rifle. One dot, that's all.... no lining up the front and rear site. Turn the switch on, then appears on the screen- One red dot...put that dot on your target and pull the trigger. It works perfect and the technology, I don't really even understand. But it's faster than open sites ever could be. I've got a red-dot on my shotgun too. 
The only thing that I don't have for this is a strap. But it has the strap mounts on the gun and is ready for you to install one if you want.
This is kind of my dream rifle, so-to-speak. It's just a gun, but it is pretty great. I am parting with it because God gave me enough sense to sell it when I can't pay my bills.
I'll throw in 20 rounds of non-corrosive Wolf ammo, so that you have a little ammo to start. And I have about 700 rounds that I'll sell you: 50 cents a round- That's what I paid for it- and that's what I'll sell it for. As many as you want up till their gone. I don't need any ammo if the gun is gone obviously. It's great: Thanks."

Asking $1,500 and not looking to trade.  I build these guns over the course of 6 months slowly collecting parts.  If you think $1500 is to high then I apologize but that is what I have into the weapon.  Buyers will need to sign a bill of sale with a valid ID. I retain the right to run CCAP checks to ensure no felony confections.  Our country faces these firearm problems because wrong people are getting their hands on guns they are not supposed to own.  I will not contribute to the problem.  Thank you for looking."

I have only had it for a few months. I have shot it a few times so I know it works fine. Comes with everything that is on the bow in the picture. After I bought it off a guy that failed to tell me that it had a small crack on the top limb. I bought it because I was considering hunting with it but I think ill just stick to rifles. I took the Bow to Mahoney's after noticing the crack and the Archery staff informed me that it was not that bad and that it would definitely last the season but I haven't shot it since. I will enclose pictures of a the crack because I am an honest person and hate people who do what that guy did to me.

Here is a brand-new USGI Surplus 9mm individual pistol cleaning kit made by OTIS. Thuis is high quality and current issue for those carrying the 9mm M9 pistol and will work great if you have a Beretta 92 or any other 9mm.380/.38 or .357 handgun with a similar bore size.

It has all sorts of cool stuff inside a great cordura zippered roll, with Molle straps in Desert tan color that has a dustproof zipper....neat!

You will see that this includes a mini-DVD on cleaning, all the materials and special tools you will need to maintain most handguns. This is for 9mm but you can add a .40 or .45 brush and this kit will work well for that too. Some of the tools are a screwdriver bit, a carbon scraper, several sizes of punches, two flexible cleaning rods, a brush, a screw on handle for several of these tools,fiberoptic borescope, patches CLP (Cleaner/lube/preservative) and bore/chamber brushes to clean any part of any handgun...these kits are awesome, and I only have three of 'em left!
NSN 1005-01-528-7843.....I bet our Government paid a lot more than this for these!

But better than that, you can buy one of these from me at the great low price of only $25.00 cash. Check Ebay.....some are asking high prices as these are so hard to find: (this one is 33 bucks after you pay for shipping, and it is missing the DVD!)

http://www.ebay.com/itm/REDACTED35?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649

Mine is in new condition and perfect....best price you will see, too....IF you find these at a gun show they run 35 to 40 bucks each!

Most of us know that our wives dont approve of us having a safe full or guns.
But I know how you can soften her heart about having all those guns or maybe getting that new one you had your eyes on now for a while.
Get her a new top in the kitchen from granite, or a new bathroom top makeup desk top, whatever it might be we do it all, and she will be HAPPY AS EVER, while you can sneek in a new gun while getting rid of one or two you dont use or barely use.
If youre interested let me know what you have for trade and what kind of product youre looking to do.

STG 44 in 22 lr with 25 round magazine. It is all metal and wood made in Germany by GSG (Only thing Poly is the mag on this gun). The StG 44 is a full weight, almost exact replica of the original 8×33 Kurz rifle that is said to be the predecessor to the Kalashnikov AK47, as well as all of the other assault rifles spanning the decades after WWII. It comes in the Amish handmade wooden crate you see here in the pictures. As a collector’s item, the original StG 44 is out of the reach of most American collectors, in part because the original was select fire and therefore banned from import by the 1986 machine-gun law. In semi-auto .22LR rimfire, not only can you own a gun with the original look and feel of the real StG 44, you will be able to shoot it cheaply, and it will itself be a big collector’s item as we go down the road.

626,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1234626,"For Sale:  ***Tactical SKS, top of the line***two scopes, many extras","Palmyra near New Albany/Louisville, Indiana, United States",$ 700,"Listed On: Sunday, March 10, 2013",Rifles,Norinco                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Norinco Chinese SKS:  Black tapcoT-6 stock   It is 6 position and expands or contracts to fit anyone.
Bayonet AND front foregrip installed. You don't find that often.  Bayonet fits snugly into bayonet slot as it should when it's closed, and it clears the foregrip at all times.
Numbers Match throughout, it's in excellent condition. Cycles, fires and functions perfectly. Asking a very fair price.
You get the SKS rifle in the 6-position TAPCO stock.
(2) TAPCO detachable 20 round magazines.
Tango brand, front foregrip that is installed.
Spike bayonet installed and fully functional with the foregrip in place.
Hi-Rise cheek rest that you can install or remove based on the scope your using. This gun comes with two scopes. Cheek-rest sits you perfectly in line with the 4x32 scope. 
This rifle is like new in every way.  Front and rear iron sites are installed, (they are adjustable to 1100 yards/1000 meters [and the numbers are printed right on the rear site], You can see/use the iron sites perfectly, even with the 4x32 scope installed. The scope and it's ring-set clears the sites. 
Two scopes come with the rifle, see pictures. The 4x32 sniper scope, as seen in the pic. It sits atop a receiver cover that has 4 factory hold-down screws that keep this thing rigidly locked in place. It used to be that a receiver mounted scope, on a SKS, ""walked around"" a bit and was a bad choice because the receiver cover would move slightly after multiple shots, but this 5th generation receiver cover from UTG with the set screws and retainer nuts is the real-deal and it is a excellent set up that will not move after you zero your scope. Rifle also has shell deflector installed so the expelled shells don't hit scope.
If you don't want to use the magnifying scope, loosen the nuts and pull the pin on the receiver cover and take off the whole 4x32 set-up-  {it's all bolted together, receiver cover, scope and mounts and shell deflector and comes off easily as one unit}  -then pop the original receiver cover on (which is included of course) and then install your projection red-dot scope, also included in this deal(as seen in the pic). This red-dot scope is good quality and works great. If you don't know what a Red-Dot scope is, it is for QUICK shouldering and aiming of rifle. One dot, that's all you see.... no lining up of the front and rear site. Turn the switch on, then One red dot appears on the scope screen (you have multiple choices of what you want the dot to look like- it has a selector switch...put that dot on your target and pull the trigger. It works perfectly. The technology is beyond me, I don't really understand how it works. But it's faster than open sites by many fold. I've got a red-dot on my shotgun also. 
This rifle is my favorite. I am selling it because I have to. I have to have the money. You will love it I'm sure. It's the nicest tactical SKS that I have seen in the U.S., at least on this ARMSLIST website. I'll throw in 20 rounds of new WOLF ammo. It's non-corrosive of course. I have a lot of it and will sell it all, as much as you want, 2 rounds for a dollar. I paid fifty cents a round for each and every round that I have. I can't find it any cheaper, even when I can find it online and when it's in-stock. I won't mark it up, but I won't mark it down either. 20 rounds at no additional cost then 2 for a dollar after that. It's all new Wolf and Tulla (exact same thing), all boxed up, dry, clean and new. Thanks"

Folks, here is your chance to own an accurate AK system, ""Assault Rifle"", that is American made.  The Sig Sauer 556R, 7.62 x 39, is as reliable as Russian's AK-47 but is much more accurate at 100-200 yards.  Sig Sauer's 556R is based on a combined technology of a dependable AK, coupled with the ease and MilSpec, upper/lower concept, similar of a U.S. AR-15 M4 system.  It is the combination of the these two exceptional features that allowed the Sig Sauer 556R to deliver the deadly 7.62 x 39 rounds with the accurate comparable to an AR-15.  Additionally, the adjustable gas system will allow you to shoot subsonic bullets, with proper cycling & chamber, so you can shoot quietly, especially with a suppressor or silencer.

The Tactical and Home Defense Package rifle comes with 1 30-rounds factory magazine but the Sig Sauer 556R takes just about every AK magazine on the market, Russian, Chinese, Romanian, Polish... etc.  The rifle will also comes with a Sig sauer Red Dot Scope System, a Sniper Red Laser with remote trigger, and a Tactical Led Light.  All mounted on a UTG Deluxe See-Thru Riser with Picatinny Tri-Rail Mount and STANAG Dimension. This complete package is all that you will need for close quarter combat and home defense, while the laser and the red dot scope would allow you to shoot accurately at 100-200 yards."

This listing is for some stripped-down MRE-style food packs.  These were newer production when I got them, and have been properly stored for the last 2 years, so they'll last you a LONG time.  Contents are all Government-contract (actual MREs).  There are 16 entree/side-dishes, something like 30 peanut butter, chocolate-peanut butter, and cheese packets, a few packets of crackers and other snacks, 2-3 dozen water-activated food heaters, assorted condiments/accessory items, plastic beverage bags, probably 20 packs of waterproof matches, and more.  Total contents would compare to about 1-1.5 12-ct cases of MILSPEC MREs, but I kept the meals themselves as well as the high-calorie peanut-butter/cheese packets and tossed the ""filler"" items like the saw-dust flavored bread, the dry-mouth-inducing crackers, etc.  Had these for my wife and I's bug-out bags to supplement regular kitchen pantry food (ie, crackers, caned food, etc)  and there is more than enough in the way of calories and nutrients to cover 2 people or 72-hours.  We also lived off of a bunch of this stuff during that bad storm in the winter of 11/12 when we were without electricity or heat for 6-days.

This carbine has been further improved over the YHM offering with the addition of a Rock River Arms M16 bolt carrier group, Hogue OverMolded rubber grip, and a CAA stock saddle with battery compartments.  The M16 BCG perfectly balances out the carbine gas system for optimal reliability, while the Hogue grip provides a comfortable interface with a consistently solid grip that performs well in all environments.  The stock saddle gives an enhanced cheek weld while also providing a dual O-ring sealed storage place for snap-caps, spare batteries, backup bolts, or similar items.  As on all Diamond Specter carbines, the rail provides a seamless optic platform on the entire top surface and the diamond fluted barrel provides a strong, stiff, and lightweight solution that also provides superior heat dispersion compared to standard profiled barrels.  This gun does not come with optics, sights, ammo, or magazines, but I do have these and would be happy to include some for the right price or trade.

These pictures show a few different optic configurations in order to provide you with a bit of inspiration for how you'd like to make this gun yours.  These images show the gun with a 1-4x optic, a 4-16x optic, and my favorite, an EOTech 552 with a 4x magnifier in a flip-to-side mount with MBUS backups.  Whether you plan on doing range shooting, 3-gun, or want a bit of tactical-tacticool, this AR will serve you well.  Unfortunately, the EOTech and magnifier is unavailable as I am keeping these for my personal use.

Thanks for looking and if you've got any questions or want to see more specific pictures, please let me know; I have detailed knowledge and photographs.

In 1976 Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) introduced what would become the P220, manufactured by Sauer.

This P220 is a must have for the Sig or Browning collector.

I dearly live this rifle. It's only the second rifle I have actually built. First was a Mosin Nagant build then this. It's an almost brand new rifle, bought in the winter of 2011 and just sighted in. Then summer 2012 the bipod was added then fall 2012 the Knoxx stock was added. All the added parts are as follows: Knoxx recoil reducing stock, Knoxx adjustable cheek price, Harris style bipod ( I forgot the actual brand name), Bushnell 3200 Elite 5-15x40 tactical with 6"" sunshade, Remington bases and Quadlock rings. This rifle is a sub MOA rifle and will put quality rounds through the same hole at 100 yards. It also recoils considerably less with the Knoxx stock. My 11 year old cousin used this rifle to take his youth weekend deer in 2012. I do have pictures just ask for them. Best to TEXT ONLY at REDACTED. NO CALLS. I can answer texts at work but not calls.

Seen probably 500-800 rounds and cleaned and taken care of after each time it has been used. 
Comes with two 14 round magazines, box, and a uncle mikes holster. 

At 5"" tall with a barrel length of just under 4"", the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4"" off the length and about 1/2"" off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.

Thank you.  You have set a terrific example for everyone on this site.

To the rest of the viewers here on armslist:

Only when we stop rewarding the privateer opportunitsts who are snatching up any available ammo solely intent on selling it back to true gun enthusiasts at 2x - 4x normal market price for their personal profit, will ammo prices level out and supply become available.

Manufacturer's supply of AR platform weapons are slowly coming back.  Magazine supply is coming back.  Ammo prices have peaked and supply will come back also.

Be diligent in protecting our right to keep and bear arms but be disciplined.  Don't play into the self fulfilling cycle of rewarding scalpers who snatch up the ammo we want and then sell it back to us!!!!!

When these scalpers start to get stuck sitting on their inventories of overpriced guns, magazines, and ammo we will really see prices drop and product become available to those of us who enjoy the sport for the right reasons!"
