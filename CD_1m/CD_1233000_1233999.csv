It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. Brushed stainless finish. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

 I would like to trade a very nice to excellent example of the 1944 dated Mosin Nagant PU sniper rifle for an original matching New England Westinghouse M91.

 The original WWII PU sniper that I offer up in trade is one of the better examples, this maker and model year is not currently available for purchase by any of the major importers. (with small exception, which even then would be entirely luck of the draw and the odds are very long, finding a similar example and with all matching numbers they're even longer).

 It is from the more desired and lower production Tula arsenal and has no visible [I], [X] or [/] refurbishment stamps on the barreled action, stock or scope, it's all stamped matching with the letter prefix's (no line-outs), has an excellent bore and the original crown, the original matching optics are sharp and clear as well.

 This rifle is not upgradeable within it's category and I would not consider trading it if it were not a duplicate model and year for me.

 So... if you have an original and matching numbers New England Westinghouse Mosin Nagant you would be willing to trade for a pretty scarce, Tula PU sniper please send me a email and we'll talk.

 Many detailed photographs available to ""NEW"" owners considering a trade.

I've held the XD for two people that have backed out so please don't ask me to hold either for you. First person to put cash in my hands takes the pistol(s). Asking $600 for the S&W and $650 for the XD. Could cut a deal if you buy both and I will ship on your dime if need be.

The finish has been hand polished with mothers and microfiber cloth and then taken completely apart and cleaned/lubed with Militec. This pistol has been shot VERY little, I'd say less than 100 rounds. This gun is in very good functioning order and I would venture to say that it is absolutely perfect in that aspect. It has very good lock up, perfect timing, great trigger, and a perfect cylinder gap. This piece really is a gem in perfect working condition that really WILL last an infinite number of .357 Mag as Ruger totes it. This is a very beefy fully stainless steel tank of a gun that you simply can't kill.

I am NOT actively looking to trade, I just thought it would be nice since I don't have anymore S&W revolvers anymore and I would like to fix that. I am wanting to trade ONLY for a Smith & Wesson 28 Highway Patrolman .357 Mag with a 4"" or 6"" barrel. It has to be in very good condition otherwise I expect some boot or other items (ammo, holsters, or a cheap gun if it's really bad). I will be performing a full inspection of your revolver - I know what I'm doing. I MIGHT consider other S&W N Frame .357 revolvers but I'm not interested in adding cash to any trades at this time.

It ain't gonna hurt my feelings if I don't get a single response or PM from this thread as I am happy with my GP100.

Up for sale is my old setup for an SKS and all parts are used but in great shape. It has the Tapco Intrafuse stock with the upper and lower rails for accessories. The grip has a storage compartment, too. It has the ATI adjustable butt stock with the adjustable cheek rest installed. Also included is a set of Tech Sights TS200 for the SKS which includes the tool to adjust the sights properly from Tech Sights. They adjust for both windage and elevation. I have the package for the TechSights and paperwork for them. I can send more pics, if needed, too. There is a small scratch on the TechSights that could be recovered but it does not affect any function whatsoever. No firearm is included in this sale, just the hybrid stock and sights. The picture of the sights on the rifle is for display purposes only. This setup has been a great setup, but I have moved on to other things. Feel free and ask me any questions you may have.

Edit 3/11/13 I forgot to add that I already filed down the Tapco stock for the correct fitment took about 2 an hour of work. Also, included in this sale is an ATI rubber recoil pad for the butt stock. And, the ATI butt stock is adjustable for length of pull, too.  

Edit 4/02/13 I am including a foregrip in this sale for free and lowered the price. Picture of foregrip can be emailed to buyer if needed.

Hey you, Patriot... I'm throwing in the NEWEST CCI mini mag DST! Drone Seeking Tip! CCI is sold out everywhere because drones could be vulnerable to CCI DST, don't know how long this listing will be available so buy quickly. 

Unless you're shooting skeet level to the ground, why bother with ""two blasts from the balcony when there's trouble"" as a wise vice president has suggested? You will wish you had these 100 DST rounds instead of fumbling to reload high on adrenaline while a drone hovers overhead taking pictures of another half naked and pissed off Patriot with an empty shotgun before posting it on the drone's facebook page.

The lucky buyer will receive the actual CCI mini mag DST box, inscribed with the second amendment and signed by senator Dianne Feinstein and everyone's favorite jolly fact providing freedom loving Piers Morgan! I had to disguise this picture as regular CCI CP HP mini mags to avoid spam bots buying this rare ammo too quickly and reselling for much higher, but rest assured these are the real deal CCI DST everyone's frothing at the mouth for!

 I have up for trade a very nice example of the 1944 dated Mosin Nagant PU sniper rifle.

It has an excellent sharp shiny bore and the original crown.

This rifles stock is Tula arsenal marked with the matching 1944 date stamp.

Matching numbered optics are sharp and clear.

Interestingly the rifle has no visible [I], [X] or [/] refurbishment stamps on the barreled action, stock or scope, it's all stamped matching to include the letter prefix's and has no line-outs and renumbering.

 So... if you have an original and matching numbers New England Westinghouse Mosin Nagant you would be willing to trade for a pretty scarce, Tula PU sniper please send me a email and we'll talk.

 Many detailed photographs available to ""NEW"" owners considering a trade.

All of these Zero series P-38 pistols are very significant as they track the various production changes that occurred throughout the early production cycle at the Walther factory. These fourth stage pistols went through numerous design changes on the frame, slide and locking block area to improve the produce ability and lower the overall production cost of these pistols. This fourth stage became the final production model that became the standard P-38 production pistol which was used though out WWII. These Zero series pistols are characterized by the ""0"" in front of the serial numbers, the high-polish commercial blue finish, with commercial type slide markings on the left side with the German Walther factory Waffenamt proofs on the right side. The grips are made of a black plastic/bakelite material with checkered panels on both sides with a rounded lanyard ring on the lower left side. The left side of the slide is marked with the Walther Banner followed by ""P.38"" and the serial number, ""011073"",  with a single Nazi Eagle firing proof. The various parts all carry a small Eagle Walther proof with a matching serial number on the front of the barrel lug, left side of the frame and left side of the slide. It is fitted with a correct matching locking block that carries the last three digits ""073"" of the serial number, along with a single Eagle Waffenamt on the right side. It is complete with one wartime magazine with the Walther proof and ""P38 9MM"" located on the lower left side of the magazine body, with an original 1941 dated P-38 holster. Not only was this manufactured by hand, but this was one of the 9500 made in this series and was made between Jan. 1940 & April 1940. Many considered the ""Zero Series"" to be the First Military P38's. After the war, it was later imported to the United States by PW ARMS of REDMON, WA and possibly used by one of our many Police Forces. The price I am listing is the mid price auction value/OBO. The reason for this is due to the fact that I will NOT ship this to any one under any circumstances. I understand there is insurance, but that will not replace this piece of history.

I had no intent of selling any of my carbines but with the craziness in Colorado (proposed high-capacity mag ban, limitations on private sales, etc.), I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and with 15- and 30-round magazines legally at a fair price.

If you are not familiar with the M1 Carbine, you should check them out. These are America’s first real a$$ault rifle. My favorite gun to shoot - they always go to the shooting range.

Please send me a message if you have questions. Not interested in trades and price is firm. 

Thanks for looking."

Rifle is chambered for 556. I really wish i could keep it, as i took a decent amount of time to set it up the way i want (im a big od green guy) and am in no hurry to accept lowball offers or trades. Its a weird time in the firearms industry right now and im not entirely comfortable capitalizing on the current ""grab"" but like i said before, i am in need of a new car.

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. This carbine is an Inland. It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP a few years back. It has a low 900K serial number so was made in early WWII. Stock is walnut and in good shape but shows it has been around.

I am selling it with 50-rds ammo, one 30-round magazines, and a carbine pouch with two-15 round magazines (15-round mags are loaded with ammo). It also includes the sling and oiler.

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

I had no intent of selling any of my carbines but with the craziness in Colorado (proposed high-capacity mag ban, limitations on private sales, etc.), I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and with 15- and 30-round magazines legally at a fair price.

If you are not familiar with the M1 Carbine, you should check them out. These are America’s first real a$$ault rifle. My favorite gun to shoot - they always go to the shooting range.

Please send me a message if you have questions. Not interested in trades and price is firm.

I will also throw in the hard to find high capacity 12 shot magazine for an extra $50. 
The only reason I am charging extra is cuz I personally had to pay $95 to find one of these online. 


So, alright heres the deal. Anyone who is crazy enough to sell one of these right now has to have a darn good reason so here is my deal so you understand. I have dreamed of owning one of these for years, but my wife would never let me have one in the house. In regards to the recent turn of events in congress I decided to just say screw it and buy one online. I then proceeded to begin fixing this thing up the way I wanted it,......then, my wife found out. So, now I have to take this big ol' badass hunk of gold (cuz when when these get banned they will be worth 3x as much) and I have to pass it off to the next lucky guy. I hope whoever gets it enjoys it as much as I wanted to. That is why I am not trying to jack the price way up there, I am barely just charging what I paid for the gun and the extras add on parts. Im not even trying to break even, just want this to go to a good responsible home.

You can read a review of this model here: http://www.gunblast.com/DelTon-DTSport.html

""The DT Sport proved to be one hundred percent reliable, as expected. The carbine fed, fired, and ejected every cartridge perfectly. Accuracy was excellent, especially considering the mil-spec trigger. I do much better work with a match trigger, such as the Alexander or Timney, but this carbine is built for fighting, and the trigger is well-suited to that task. The AR-15 is a wonderful concept, and Del-Ton executes it very well. The Del-Ton rifles are built very well, and just because the DT Sport is one of the most affordable AR-15 carbines available, does not mean that it sacrifices on quality. The DT Sport has everything that you need, and nothing that you don’t. It performs as well as rifles costing three times the price, and buying a basic rifle such as this leaves a lot more cash to purchase a good optic, plenty of extra magazines, and ammunition. You can’t have too much ammunition. The stuff keeps well, needs no refrigeration, and several thousand rounds will fit neatly under your bed. Buy it while you still can."""

This is a gen 2, the major noticeable difference between it and other generations is the absence of a light mounting rail or thumb grip. It is a question of preference, but for those that prefer it this is a highly sought after model. It appears to be in good shape other than just a few small scratches (hard to see) on the slide. These g19 (&g17) gen2s are what built Glocks reputation in the 90s.

Mr. Rojohn
I was traveling last week and was not able to respond to your email.  I was working with Kim to try to find a way to fill your order and satisfy your requests as best we could.  Our costs of materials have been rising every month and like all other ammunition manufacturers, we must raise our prices as our costs increase.

Having said that, with the number of threats we have received from your customers and the foul language that has been spewed to our staff, I have determined that we will not fill the order and will not be taking future orders from your firm.  I will not subject our staff to such verbal abuse.  They work hard to build high quality ammunition and serve our customers and do not deserve this kind of treatment.

We appreciate your past business and wish you the best in finding a supplier that can better suit your needs.

I wrote:

Dick,

Thank you for your late response. Would have been great to hear from you sooner... I can not control what my customers do.  They are the buyers, and they have every reason to be pissed off as hell.  As for the cost of your product.  When a offer is made and a price is negotiated between two groups and the seller out of the blue changes the price by 18-20% that is called poor business.  It is funny but I can still pick up a box of .22lr from my dealer here in town... at  wholesale prices...  Funny how the price did not go up 18% after I made the purchase. I walk into bass pro shop once a week.  Price Tag does not say 25.00 dollars for a box of target ammo..  it still has the same price tag....  

 Your folks do build a quality product,  I will give you that, but what you need to work on is the second part of your email below.  Serve your customers.  You sir are doing a horrible job at that.  Your customers do not deserve to be screwed the way you are screwing them...  But hey, you run it the way you see fit.... see how long you stay up and running....  The  BBB will be called, emailed, so on so forth....You broke a verbal contract that we had 12 weeks ago for 70 cases of ammo.  We were told that it would be done in 6-8 weeks.  YOU BROKE A CONTRACT we had...  and folks will hear about it....

Dick you mention that you will not take future orders from my company.  LOL!  Do you really think that a person will really come back just to get screwed again?  After this, I would never come back....I could by buy Tula ammo and be treated better than your company has treated these 70+ buyers....

I will pass along your email to the 70 folks, down here in Kansas/ Missouri and let them do what angry folks do when they are  wronged....  I am sorry that Kim had to take a few bad phone calls, I guess those Nebraska buyers can get a bit angry as well when it comes to getting hosed on a contract....

Mr. Rojohn,

I may be a little behind the curve here as I know there has been communication going on since you sent this email to me last Friday but this is the first opportunity that I have had to respond to  you so please forgive me for the delay.  I am not sure what price you were quoted and I am sorry that you are feeling that our price increase is out of line.  Our goal is to continue to make high quality ammunition.  Unfortunately, the components that we need to produce our ammunition is the best American made that we can find and probably because of the recent ammunition shortage,  the prices of these high quality components have increased dramatically.  We have made a decision not to compromise and not to settle for something less than the best.  Consequently, our production prices have increased dramatically.  All of our customers have been very  understanding and supportive of this decision as they love our product.  We have been told by many shooters that our ammunition is the cleanest, most reliable on the market.  We are very proud of American Bullet  and we will continue to uphold our high standards in production so that we can continue producing our high quality product.  I am very sorry that we cannot fill your order at your anticipated price.  At one point earlier today, we were anxious to contact you and offer you something that we think you have found to be very agreeable.  However, because of the way  that our employees have been treated by people that know you, I think it would be difficult for us to continue any type of a respectful, trusting relationship. 

Sincerely,
Mary Abramson

I replied with:

Thanks but we will take our 70 cases to another vendor. I buy ammo from numerous locations. No price increase except you. I will agree that you make a quality ammo but your outrageous increase after a price was agreed upon twelve weeks ago is a breach of a contract. So the loss of a respectful trusting relationship is on American Bullet not me. You rattled 70 cages by your poor decision. This is on you. You broke a contract.... I will be posting all of this information in the add I wrote up to sell your product. All I can do as a dealer is provide the best information to my customers and at this point I can not do that. I apologized to Kim for my customers.... Maybe you should apologize to my customers who had faith in American Bullet just to be let down. The price quote I was given were the 2012 price sheet. 18-20% less than what they are now. I will stick beside my customers and fight for them just like you fight for your sales reps. In the end the customers are the ones buying your products not your employee's. I have started a complaint with the BBB and the folks who made these purchases will join in to make sure others to not fall in your price gouging.
MR.

So let the refunds begin...  I want to apologize to everyone once again... I provided you all with the hopes of getting ammo through a company that made a quality product... however, they do not stand behind an contract between the sales department and myself.  I will be cutting all affiliation with American Bullet.  I have 70 some customers who have been wronged...  I will start the refund process today once I contact my banks....  I will be working in the same order that purchases were made.  Please be patient......I will get your money back to you....

Specific Pics as requested
The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

These Rifles were produced by Yugoslavia at the Kragujevac arsenal, and were named the ""Model 1948 98k Short Rifle"" or the Yugoslavian M48. They were based in on the German 98k Mauser.
The M48 is a little shorter in overall length in the barrel and the overall length of the rifle than the German 98k

Manufactured by Yugoslavia into the 60's they became obsolete with the proliferation of the Automatic rifle. So they were lovingly stored for civil militia/reserve use, and test fired every 5 years. 50 years later they have been released on the collectors market.
Yugoslavia produced many of these rifles, and many are still available on the market in mint condition These 8mm rifles are extraordinary shooters that are well made and offer a unique opportunity to the shooter and collector to purchase a Like New version of the very dependable and well made Mauser 98k."
