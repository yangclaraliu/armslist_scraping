The rifle is in very good shape and the bore is clean. Feel free to email me with an offer, I would prefer cash or gold/silver but would consider trades.

If you are looking for a cheap large caliber rifle the mosin nagant is the way to go. You can still buy 900 rounds of ammo for roughly $130 online. The 7.62x54R is comparable in ballistics to .308 or 30-06 but at a fraction of the cost.

I have always been a big fan of mosins, they are relatively cheap, reliable and accurate rifles. I think this rifle is worth every penny at the price listed with the PU scope on it, the Tula manufacturing and the late 30's prewar quality. It is a hell of a nice rifle and then with the scope thrown it makes it even more interesting.

Great for everyone including women and kids
Known as one of the lightest semi-auto shotguns around, the Franchi 48 AL is ideal for any hunting or shooting that involves walking and carrying. The reliable action does not use gas to cycle the action but is based on John M. Browning's famous long recoil design, the Browning Auto-5.

The main advantage beside being very light is the long recoil. The barrel and bolt remain locked together during recoil, compressing the recoil spring causing the shooter to experience less recoil. $395.00 or best offer"

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths and in either 5.56mm NATO or 6.8mm SPC. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

Chambered in 22.250 nice caliber for long distance hunting without making a big mess.
Looking to see what else is out there as between my work schedule and family life I never have the time to hunt, and its too nice of a rifle to just sit in my safe.
for those of you lowballers, out there, Dont bother I dont have to sell this and honestly I hate getiing rid of any of my guns unless its either worth it or I reallyu like the trade. So either be fair with the offer if you know what its worth or do some reaserch before you give me a dumb number."

This is one slick powerful targeting pistol. There's a lot to say about this handgun. Those of you that have been in shooting sports no doubt have used one of these atone time. The company is best known for its line of interchangeable barrel single-shot pistols. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out."

I travel a lot with my job and stop just about anywhere I can to see what ammo Walmart, Academy, etc have in stock. So my thought was to share this info with other fellow hobbiest in return for the same thing from you. I created a Google Group for this purpose. How it works is when you find something, you email it to the email listed below and it sends that out to everyone who is a part of the group. This way we can help each other stay informed in realtime (at least those of us with smartphones anyway) of who has what and when and be able to purchase ammo at somewhat normal or reasonable prices.

Not sure what you have? Send me some pictures of the gun including any writing on the barrel or sides of the gun and I can find information for you.
There is no reason your gun should go to a smelter when there are people like me who have a clean background (Concealed Pistol License to prove I have passed 5 background checks required by law to get a firearm)
I am also an amateur gunsmith and love getting firearms that need repairs or services that you just don't want to sink your valuable time and hard earned money into.
Let your guns continue on and be well taken care of for years to come, not have them melted down and destroyed.
I am open to price negotiations on any firearm. Send me a quote on what you would like for it, if it is reasonable, I will pay it, I will not pay gouging prices that are 2 or 3 times what the gun is worth. But I will be fair in my pricing and evaluation. All sales are subject to inspection of the firearm."

There is a lot of debate and untrue facts about MagPul PTS Stuff , so I hope below will clear some stuff up...


* THEY ARE MAGPUL SIGHTS , LICENSED BY MAGPUL .. There is nothing ""fake"" about them , and they are 99-100% identical to the $100 USA licensed versions , they use the same DuPont polymer the American licensed version.
* PTS DOES NOT MEAN AIRSOFT -- MAGPUL PTS does make some items for airsoft rifles , but PTS stands for professional training and simulation -- they are popular with airsoft guys because they fit many of the popular guns in the air soft community. , and are available worldwide.
Would I take these or recommend them for war zone use ? No , because I don't believe they have been battle proven yet -- *but for the range , plinking , and having for use as backup sights to your primary optic (remember all magpul MBUS are backup sights -- and they are all polymer) you can't go wrong ... these will do the job the same way as the USA sold versions , for a much lower price.

DO NOT let the gunshow charge you $70-100 for these , because they don't cost that much ... those guys are trying to pull one over on you -- I AM NOT.
Quote:
With the increase in availability of both the MAGPUL PTS and MAGPUL USA parts, there has been some confusion regarding the differences between MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products. All MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products are made with DuPont polymer and either forged steel or aircraft grade T-6061 aluminum alloy, and are close to indestructible. Because of MAGPUL USA’s military contracts and the regulations regarding sales of US Made firearm parts (ITAR Restriction), MAGPUL USA products are generally not available for sale outside the United States, and are even restricted in several US states. MAGPUL PTS parts are contract manufactured by MAGPUL internationally and are legal for sale anywhere in the world. Additionally, some PTS parts are specifically designed for use on airsoft rifles (like the MIAD grips designed to house electric motors) but the CTR stock for sale here is designed to fit both real mil-spec buffer tubes , and the MBUS sights will go on any 20mm rail — . Regardless, all MAGPUL parts are made to the same exacting professional quality you’ve come to expect from MAGPUL."

• Diameter: .451""
• Grain: 185gr
• Bullet Type: XTP® Hollow Point
• 100 Bullets per Box (FIVES BOXES)

Originally designed for hunting, self-defense and law enforcement application, the XTP® bullet demonstrated the kind of accuracy that led many competitive shooters to adopt it. Doug Koenig, one of the top competition shooters in the world, uses the XTP® bullet in competition, where dead-on accuracy is essential. But, it’s the stopping power of the XTP® bullet that has truly built its world-class reputation. From the on set, XTP® bullets were specifically designed to expand reliably at a wide range of handgun velocities to deliver a deep, terminal penetration with every shot.

• CONTROLLED EXPANSION
Precise folds divide the XTP® in six symmetrical sections, strategically weakening the jacket and initiating controlled expansion even at low velocities. The design also ensures no fragmentation at high velocities. Deep penetration at higher velocities than the original XTP.

• NO EXPOSED LEAD
The copper jacket protects the nose of the bullet, so the hollow cavity functions properly on impact and ensures proper feeding in semiautomatics.

• SWAGED CORE
Totally uniform in the core density, this ensures balanced expansion, as well as in-fl ight stability.

• CANNELURE
On revolver bullets, the cannelure helps achieve accurate, consistent crimping, and keeps the core and jacket locked together. All cannelures are applied before the fi nal forming process to eliminate any distortion to the finished bullet.

• DRAWN COPPER JACKET
Expansion is controlled by varying jacket thickness down the length of the XTP.® It provides a definite advantage over plated bullets which have a uniform jacket thickness over the entire bullet.
• Recommended muzzle velocity range: 1200 to 2300 fps

Features:
Controlled expansion to 1.5x its original diameter over a wide range of velocities.
Heavier jacket stands up to the high pressures and velocities of the highest performance handgun cartridges.

There is a lot of debate and untrue facts about MagPul PTS Stuff , so I hope below will clear some stuff up...


* THEY ARE MAGPUL SIGHTS , LICENSED BY MAGPUL .. There is nothing ""fake"" about them , and they are 99-100% identical to the $100 USA licensed versions , they use the same DuPont polymer the American licensed version.
* PTS DOES NOT MEAN AIRSOFT -- MAGPUL PTS does make some items for airsoft rifles , but PTS stands for professional training and simulation -- they are popular with airsoft guys because they fit many of the popular guns in the air soft community. , and are available worldwide.
Would I take these or recommend them for war zone use ? No , because I don't believe they have been battle proven yet -- *but for the range , plinking , and having for use as backup sights to your primary optic (remember all magpul MBUS are backup sights -- and they are all polymer) you can't go wrong ... these will do the job the same way as the USA sold versions , for a much lower price.

DO NOT let the gunshow charge you $70-100 for these , because they don't cost that much ... those guys are trying to pull one over on you -- I AM NOT.
Quote:
With the increase in availability of both the MAGPUL PTS and MAGPUL USA parts, there has been some confusion regarding the differences between MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products. All MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products are made with DuPont polymer and either forged steel or aircraft grade T-6061 aluminum alloy, and are close to indestructible. Because of MAGPUL USA’s military contracts and the regulations regarding sales of US Made firearm parts (ITAR Restriction), MAGPUL USA products are generally not available for sale outside the United States, and are even restricted in several US states. MAGPUL PTS parts are contract manufactured by MAGPUL internationally and are legal for sale anywhere in the world. Additionally, some PTS parts are specifically designed for use on airsoft rifles (like the MIAD grips designed to house electric motors) but the CTR stock for sale here is designed to fit both real mil-spec buffer tubes , and the MBUS sights will go on any 20mm rail — . Regardless, all MAGPUL parts are made to the same exacting professional quality you’ve come to expect from MAGPUL."

One 5 round factory magazine shown in the pic is included. There is also a sling attached to the weapon and approximately 30 rounds of 410 ammo I will throw in. Do some reading about these guns, they are a lot of fun. Light recoil, easy to find ammo, and good times. I any find time to go to outdoor ranges so, it's time to sell.

Up for auction is a very nice Browning Model 71 lever action in .50 Alaskan, These rifles were originally chambered in .348 Winchester. Gunsmiths wanted the Browning 71 due to its durability and strength when converting rifles to 50 Alaskan. This rifle has a half octagon half round barrel measuring at 34"", an all steal Schnabel for end, the sights have not been clipped and the engraving on the barrel and action are beautiful. the stock also has a hidden compartment for holding 4 rounds. The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price is for $2900 therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the shipment,"

Up for auction is a very nice Browning Model 71 lever action in .50 Alaskan, These rifles were originally chambered in .348 Winchester. Gunsmiths wanted the Browning 71 due to its durability and strength when converting rifles to 50 Alaskan. This rifle has a half octagon half round barrel measuring at 34"", an all steal Schnabel for end, the sights have not been clipped and the engraving on the barrel and action are beautiful. the stock also has a hidden compartment for holding 4 rounds. The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping.

Up for auction is a very nice Browning Model 71 lever action in .50 Alaskan, These rifles were originally chambered in .348 Winchester. Gunsmiths wanted the Browning 71 due to its durability and strength when converting rifles to 50 Alaskan. This rifle has a half octagon half round barrel measuring at 34"", an all steal Schnabel for end, the sights have not been clipped and the engraving on the barrel and action are beautiful. the stock also has a hidden compartment for holding 4 rounds. The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping.

Aimpoint Pro: A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening.

Magpul PMAGs: Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality. PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately. Made in U.S.A.

36"" Voodoo Tactical Rifle Case. New Enhanced Model Holds Two Carbines and Two Pistols This case is designed to hold one or two of the M-4 carbines with a collapsible stock and a 16 inch barrel. It will also hold similar carbines with a collapsible stock, a folding stock rifle, or any other weapon that is under 35 inches in overall length. This 36-inch Voodoo Tactical brand padded rifle carrying case will help protect your rifle from the hard knocks of transportation, whether in your vehicle or in the field. It can also be used if you break down your gun or to carry different uppers. Inside are two sets of adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case that has foam only on two sizes or the flimsy egg-crate foam of some hard-shell cases. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement. Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories. This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six standard size magazines and the center pouch is even larger. This Voodoo Tactical gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear.
