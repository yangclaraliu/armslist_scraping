We all know the US and the internet is all completely out of AR Lower Receivers and back orders are more than 6-12 months long. Also, complete built new or used AR-15s are ridiculous in price so why not buy a lower and complete the rest when prices are normal.
The Reason why the price is at a premium: I've been looking for an AR Lower for 3 months now, I've spent countless hours trying to locate one and I actually had to camp out 10+ hours to get it. I bought 2 (1 to keep and 1 to sell). I also know FFLs around the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 for the background check. This is also a real machined lower, not a polymer one.

This gun is in “as-new” condition both functionally and cosmetically. Bluing pristine, without marks, and grips/handles are in absolutely perfect condition with no wear visible. 

This model has “threaded” barrel-removal system (see picture), which is superior to the “push-button” models because it does NOT have any springs to wear out over time and it functions as well after 1,000 take downs as it does when new. It also has a locking side button on the thumbwheel that keeps the threaded retention wheel absolutely tight while shooting. 

It has the famous High Standard “loaded chamber” indicator on the rear of the slide. The safety on the rear of the frame also functions as the slide lock. Mag release is located left forward, above the trigger guard. Handles both standard and high-velocity .22 lr ammo. Not recommended for hyper-velocity rounds, such as Stingers. People shoot 'em in HS pistols, but I've never fired any in THIS weapon.

This gun is SOLID metal. It is pure joy to hold, shoot, and handle.

Firearm has no visible nicks, scratches, rust or other signs of wear inside or out. 

Two genuine High Standard magazine are included (one blued and one stainless), and both have been “tuned” to accept either CCI or Federal ammo (does not care for Remington cartridges, however).

I will include the carbon-steel magazine adjustment tool along with instructions so that the new owner may custom “fine tune” the mags for any desired ammo.

This firearm has absolutely NO issues.   Everything about this gun, inside and out, is 100%. The trigger pull is smooth and crisp, and sights are “on the money” for 25 – 50 yards.

Auction includes firearm, 2 magazines, speed loader, mag adjustment tool and padded gun case.

I also have the Owner's manual in electronic form, which I will email the buyer.

As a High Standard in this condition with 2 factory magazines is almost impossible to find, I'd like to  entertain serious cash offers in the $550 range. I would also consider partial trade for ammo.

Pre-ban Green Label rifle uppers, so they have the old school grey military finish. Heavy barrel that keeps its weight all the way through, not turned down under the guards, for very stiff tight groupings and a 1/9 twist for ability to use all bullet weights that accurately. Colt bolt group and handle included.

 I will sell these built up on a modern forged lower into a complete rifle made to your specs, or alone if requested. Mags, ammo, and accessories available as well by request. Price of complete system obviously dependent on options.

 These are not generic budget uppers, as anyone who has used one knows. I am not a price gouger, and I am open to reasonable offers, but complete these Colt upper groups alone were going for nearly a grand -before- the panic started, so $1500 for a complete rifle seems more than fair. Couldn't come close to replacing these parts for that now.

 Examples are rifles built on these in the past, yours can look however you want"

The Reason why the price is at a premium: I've been looking for an AR Lower for 3 months now, I've spent countless hours trying to locate one and I actually had to camp out 10+ hours to get it. I bought 2 (1 to keep and 1 to sell). I also know FFLs around the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 for the background check.

We all know the US and the internet is all completely out of AR Lower Receivers and back orders are more than 6-12 months long. Also, complete built new or used AR-15s are ridiculous in price so why not buy a lower and complete the rest when prices are normal.
The Reason why the price is at a premium: I've been looking for an AR Lower for 3 months now, I've spent countless hours trying to locate one and I actually had to camp out 10+ hours to get it. I bought 2 (1 to keep and 1 to sell). I also know FFLs around the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 for the background check. This is also a real machined lower, not a polymer one.

We all know the US and the internet is all completely out of AR Lower Receivers and back orders are more than 6-12 months long. Also, complete built new or used AR-15s are ridiculous in price so why not buy a lower and complete the rest when prices are normal.
The Reason why the price is at a premium: I've been looking for an AR Lower for 3 months now, I've spent countless hours trying to locate one and I actually had to camp out 10+ hours to get it. I bought 2 (1 to keep and 1 to sell). I also know FFLs around the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 for the background check. This is also a real machined lower, not a polymer one.

The PPS-43C is chambered in the potent and battle-proven 7.62 x 25mm Tokarev due to its highly penetrative characteristics. When there isn't a nationwide buying panic going on, This ammunition is readily available in both new production and surplus offerings. Even though derived from a folding stock SMG, this closed-bolt model is ATF approved - the stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the 14” barrel length weapon is classified as a pistol, not a SBR. It comes furnished with one(1) 35rd magazines, oiler, cleaning rod .. The PPS-43C offers substantial firepower in a very compact and light weight platform. It is a natural candidate for a SBR conversion (subject to NFA compliance). Hi-cap pistols of this genre are becoming increasingly difficult to find among suppliers; availability may be very limited to non-existent in the future due to pending ban and Nato Treaty talks in March for Small Arms Treaty.

Sabre Defense is no longer in business due to some ATF troubles, something to do with some employees walking away with some of the machinegun parts they made for the military. Sabre Defense was known to have made higher end ARs, you can google sabre defense for some reviews.

The PPS-43C is chambered in the potent and battle-proven 7.62 x 25mm Tokarev due to its highly penetrative characteristics. When there isn't a nationwide buying panic going on, This ammunition is readily available in both new production and surplus offerings. Even though derived from a folding stock SMG, this closed-bolt model is ATF approved - the stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the 14” barrel length weapon is classified as a pistol, not a SBR. It comes furnished with one(1) 35rd magazines, oiler, cleaning rod .. The PPS-43C offers substantial firepower in a very compact and light weight platform. It is a natural candidate for a SBR conversion (subject to NFA compliance). Hi-cap pistols of this genre are becoming increasingly difficult to find among suppliers; availability may be very limited to non-existent in the future due to pending ban and Nato Treaty talks in March for Small Arms Treaty.
