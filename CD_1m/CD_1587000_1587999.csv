This gun has matching numbers (i.e., bolt, bolt carrier, gas tube, and dust/receiver cover). The gun has Chinese wood upper and lower hand guards. And also has the thumbhole ATI Fiberforce stock set. However, I'm throwing in a new Russian wood laminated butt stock, however it's the one that was made for a milled receiver AK-47.  But it will fit the Norinco MAK-90 (if you decide to install/mount it later-but need to comply with the 1994 AWB weapon's law, which needs at least 5-U.S. made parts in/on the gun to make it legal - if you want to install a pistol grip and regular butt stock). Sorry, I don't have the Chinese thumbhole stock that usually comes with the gun. In addition, the gun has a pinned on flash hider. Overall, the gun is in excellent plus condition. However, there are a couple of small holes in the receiver. Someone (not me) drilled a couple of holes (pictured) in the receiver to install a scope mount. Both holes are not all the way through the other side. Just on one side (left side). But it does not look bad. Whoever drilled the holes did a really good job. Thought I'd mention it so there won't be any surprises. Although, it does not hinder or affect function wise. This gun is in really excellent shape, and the bluing is in excellent condition also. The scope mount and the base (rings included) will come with the gun. It's one of the early Chinese made scope mounts. It looks really nice and has a blued finish, and all steel. I believe it's one of the early Red Star brand from China that was imported back in the late 80's or early 90's. Just email me with any questions. I can email some more or close up pics if needed. You must be at least 18 years or older to buy this gun. Local (Kentucky) sales only. Thanks for looking.

Designed with the demanding needs of Law enforcement and military. Our CBR is the workhorse of the Seekins Precision rifle lineup. The SP CBR is built with the original SP Billet Upper and Gen 2 lower, a stainless Seekins Precision 14.5"" barrel and our 12"" BAR rail. All Seekins Precision rifles come with a Melonite coated gas tube, bolt carrier and adjustable gas block to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire. The adjustable gas block is properly tuned from the factory but can easily be user adjusted for your specific ammo. 

Also has an EOtech 553 NV compatable, with troy flip up battle sights. This is a super high end rifle, and priced accordingly, not price gouging here. If you want one of the best rifles on the market here it is, with the 14.5'' Mid-length gas system, and the PWS brake it is the smoothest and best shotting AR i own.

If you're serious about shotguns you probably know what your looking at, for everybody else, the 11-87 Police, Benelli M2/M4, and FN SLP are the best semi auto shotgun money can buy and are in a class of their own. This shotgun blows the Mossberg 930's out of the water. It is extremely reliable and high quality. This shotgun will cycle any low brass target loads out there flawlessly which is a major problem with a lot of semi autos.

Mine is the highly desired model with the old style XS Ghost Ring sights that has a AR15 style front post. This fills up the rear aperture well for accurate aiming unlike the new style which is just a blade.

It's in good shape with typical wear and is 100% factory, it's never been modified. This shotgun retails for $1200 new (actual retail not MSRP) with ghost rings and you simply cannot get this style sight anymore. I'm selling mine for $650 FIRM which is what a Mossberg 930SPX would run you and is nowhere near the gun.

This is quite rare in the 2.5"" barrel length, and even more rare in the stainless finish.  

This is a 6 shot gun built on Taurus's Raging Bull extra large frame.  Barrel is NOT ported, and is topped with a fiber optic front sight.  The frame, cylinder, and barrel shroud are all in titanium, as a result, this is the lightest 6 shot .44 magnum ever, at just 25 ounces. 

 As you can imagine, recoil is brisk, but the large rubber/neoprene grips do an excellent job of soaking up the sting.

  I have a number of .44 magnum revolvers (not for sale) , and this one has only seen a few cylinders of ammo through it.  Lock up is very tight, timing is perfect, the trigger is smooth and light, either in double or single action. 

  Like new condition, includes box, manual, and lock keys. 

 If you want to make a trade offer, I'm looking for other guns or a quality mountain bike.  Trade offers need to add up to at or near my asking price."

From what I've gathered digging around 762x54r.net, this was set up with a PEM (not PU) scope during the war. 

The receiver sports the ""cn"" stamp (that's s-p in russian), which stands for 'snaiperskaya provernaya', meaning this rifle was selected as one of the most accurate rifles from its production lot for conversion to a sniper weapon.

The rifle IS counterbored, and the bore is a bit frosty, but it is still a shooter. I'm really looking to get into a regular run-of-the-mill m91/30 to maybe set up with a reproduction scope, and as this rifle has collector value I'd rather not bastardize it. My price reflects what it would cost me to get a regular m91/30 nowadays.

It comes with the cleaning kit as well as the bayonet and sling. Sorry for the blurry picture, I can try to do a bit better on request.

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle."

Due to them being actually molded together they are THINNER than two separate bx-25's taped/glued together.

For those who are unfamiliar with the product, this is the info that Ruger has on its website: 

""Ruger came up with an innovative design to couple two magazines together. Once thefirst 25rds. are used, all you have to do is flip the mag over. As reliable as the standard BX-1 10-round Ruger rotary magazine. Stainless steel feed lips are designed to present cartridges into the action at a 30 degree angle for better feed reliability. Stainless steel, constant force spring provides feed consistency round after round. Anti-tilt follower is injection molded from a high lubricity polyacetal for consistent reliability. BX-25 X2 magazines will work with any factory original Ruger 10/22 Rifle, SR-22 Rifle, 22 Charger Pistol and 77/22 Rifle. The BX-25 will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition and requires no lubrication. If it becomes necessary to clean the magazine, loosen the screws on the right and left side of the magazine with a 3/32’’ hex tool.""

These guns are rare and very collectable.  Baker was one of the high end gun makers back in the day when LC Smith bought them out in 1888.  LC Smith was then bought out by Marlin in the 1940s. This gun comes with a note from Ahlman's gunsmith varifying that it is still in fine working order and safe to shoot with light blackpowder loads (comes with the note from ahlmans themselves for proof). This is not necessarily a wall hanger since it is able to shoot. Very minimal pitting and there is no rust!

I'm looking for a hunting rifle that has iron sights.  My preference is for 22""+ barrel length, wood stock, and at least drilled and tapped for a scope (with a mount, rings, and/or scope would be even better).  

My highest preference is for .30-06, but would consider .308, .270, or perhaps some others.  My only necessary criteria is for it to have iron sights.  Any ammo to include would be great!  Could also pay extra for extra ammo.  

I'm pretty much looking for a bolt action, although something like a Savage 99 lever action in one of the above calibers would be cool, too.  

No Mosins or beat-up surplus.  A nice Swede Mauser or sporterized surplus in good condition would be considered, however.

FACTORY NEW IN BOX!!!!!!


Description: Up for auction is a factory new in box Colt LE6940 rifle. Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength. Specifications: Action: Semi-Automatic Caliber: 223 Remington/5.56 NATO Bbl Length: 16.1"" Capacity: 30+1 Trigger: Direct Safety: Lever OAL: 35.25"" Weight: 6.6 lbs Stock: 4-Position Collapsible Finish: Black"

COMES IN ORIGINAL FACTORY CASE WITH PAPERWORK, .22LR CYLINDER AND THE .22MAG CYLINDER, ALSO A LIFETIME REPLACEMENT WARRANTY FROM DEALER.

Ruger Single Six is a single action rimfire revolver produced by Sturm, Ruger. The Single Six was first released in June 1953.[5]

The Single Six is currently produced as the New Model Single Six. The term ""New Model"" simply means that this model includes Ruger's transfer bar mechanism for increased safety, allowing one to carry the revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. Prior to 1973, the Single Six was produced without the transfer bar mechanism, making it less safe to carry with all six chambers loaded, and with the hammer resting on a loaded chamber. The transfer bar safety allows the weapon to fire only when the trigger has been pulled. Ruger provides the transfer bar safety upgrade free of charge for owners of any old model Single Six, though this will lower the value for those in pristine, collectable condition.

The New Model Single Six is currently chambered in .22 LR, .22 WMR (.22 Magnum), and .17 HMR. Barrel lengths include 4⅝, 5½, 6½, 7½, and 9½ inches. Both blued and stainless steel versions are available. Ruger manufactures several ""convertible"" models that ship with both a .22 LR cylinder and .22 WMR cylinder, allowing the use of both cartridges.[3] (22 Short and 22 Long cartridges can also be fired in the Long Rifle cylinder.) For those models that ship with both cylinders, the last 3 digits of the serial number are engraved on the front of the cylinder; only cylinders that have been properly timed should be used with any given revolver. The term ""Super Single Six"" refers to those models which have fully adjustable target sights.
