I took this Brand New Bulgy AK74 in on trade and really don't have a use for it.  It was built 11/2012 by TGI (not a typical cheapo) with an unissued parts kit around a NODAK Spud Reciever and by far the nicest one I've ever seen.  The rivet job is spectacular and the furniture is perfect and obviously never issued as well. I have run 25rds down the pipe (non-corrosive) and she's a real peach. 

Comes with (2) two 30rd Tapco Magazines, Taqctical Case as well as a complete Bulgarian ""plum"" plastic furniture kit.  I picked this up just in case I kept the gun to ensure the original wood stayed in its current condition.

I will sell FTF to a KS resident legally able to purchase and own a firearm in our state or thru your out of state FFL.

(With the increase in availability of both the MAGPUL PTS and MAGPUL USA parts, there has been some confusion regarding the differences between MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products. All MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products are made with DuPont polymer and either forged steel or aircraft grade T-6061 aluminum alloy, and are close to indestructible. Because of MAGPUL USA’s military contracts and the regulations regarding sales of US Made firearm parts (ITAR Restriction), MAGPUL USA products are generally not available for sale outside the United States, and are even restricted in several US states. MAGPUL PTS parts are contract manufactured by MAGPUL internationally and are legal for sale anywhere in the world. Additionally, some PTS parts are specifically designed for use on airsoft rifles (like the MIAD grips designed to house electric motors) but the CTR stock for sale here is designed to fit both real mil-spec buffer tubes , and the MBUS sights will go on any 20mm rail — . Regardless, all MAGPUL parts are made to the same exacting professional quality you’ve come to expect from MAGPUL.)"

Description: Up for auction is a factory new in box GSG Schmeisser. Caliber/Gauge: 22LR Color/Finish: Black Barrel length: 16.5 Magazine Capacity: 25RD sku#gergstg44 The GSG StG-44 uses a blowback action, and proved to be very reliable with high-velocity 22 LR ammunition. The charging handle is on the upper left side, and serves to manually lock open the bolt. Also, the magazine has a pin which protrudes from the top when empty, locking the bolt open after the last shot. The ejection port has a stamped steel dust cover, much like the original. The pistol grip and trigger are also of authentic design, as are the sights and the overall look and feel of the entire weapon. The rear sight is easily adjustable for a great latitude of elevation, and also has ample windage adjustment. The carbine has a sixteen and one-half inch barrel, with an overall length of thirty-seven and one-quarter inches. The GSG StG-44 comes packed in a wooden shipping crate that has a hinged lid and rope handles on each end, which adds to the classic flavor of this military style weapon. The carbine is supplied with one polymer magazine (25rd). NO TRADEs at this price! 460@roadrunner.com"

We have turned from gun loving enthusiasts into hording grandmas on black friday at Toysrus.   Buy some ammo and shoot it. They will make more, eventually you can buy cases of it again. 

None of my friends will go shooting with me lately. They are sitting on stacks of ammo like the well is gonna run dry.   OK for you 5.7 FNH shooters perhaps. but for the rest of us.....stop hording and start shooting already. The government is trying to lull you into becoming a horrible shot because you don't practice anymore. pretty soon those guns are gonna feel too heavy and you will just hand them over for a 3ounce pepper spray that doesn't weigh down your pocket. 

OK seriously. I have this ammo for sale and I needs some money.  REDACTED"

Why do you need ammo. Because its sold out everywhere? No. You need ammo to go shooting and have fun with our beloved past time. Your guns only hold so much if it was self defense you only need a box or two of corbon defense or HPs.

We have turned from gun loving enthusiasts into hording grandmas on black friday at Toysrus. Buy some ammo and shoot it. They will make more, eventually you can buy cases of it again.

None of my friends will go shooting with me lately. They are sitting on stacks of ammo like the well is gonna run dry. OK for you 5.7 FNH shooters perhaps. but for the rest of us.....stop hording and start shooting already. The government is trying to lull you into becoming a horrible shot because you don't practice anymore. pretty soon those guns are gonna feel too heavy and you will just hand them over for a 3ounce pepper spray that doesn't weigh down your pocket.

PRO-3 duty holster positively locks the gun to make snatching extremely difficult from the front, rear, top or side

TRIPLE RETENTION DUTY HOLSTERS WITH PATENTED INTERNAL LOCK

The emphasis on weapon retention in duty holsters is greater today than ever before, but this vital need to protect the gun must be balanced with the ability to draw the officer's weapon efficiently.

PRO-3 duty holster positively locks the gun to make snatching extremely difficult from the front, rear, top or side. Yet, with a swift, simple motion, the officer can release the thumb break and draw the gun cleanly without the need to release any complicated system of snaps and straps.
AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE PRO-3
Three types of independent retention
 1.Patented internal locking device
2.Retention strap/thumb break
3.Adjustable tensioning device
4.Patented laminated construction - either MIRAGE® or Cordura® nylon exterior, foam core and smooth nylon lining
5.Positive triggerguard stop positions gun the same way every time
6.Holster suspended within patented thermoplastic exo-skeleton for support, strength and rigidity
7.Non-stretch retention strap and molded thumb break stay open for easy, one-handed reholstering. Contoured thumb break discourages blading
8.Patented molded sight track protects front sight and reduces holster wear
9.Injection molded belt loop accepts Spacer Pack"

Developed during the now-defunct 1994 Federal assault weapons ban, the Hi-Point carbine comes with a ten-round magazine that fits into the pistol grip. With the expiration of the federal assault weapons ban in 2004, aftermarket fifteen-round magazines are now also available in most states. The proprietary magazines are only usable with Hi-Point firearms. The pistol-style magazines for the 4095 .40 S&W carbine are fully interchangeable with the Hi-Point .40 S&W pistol. No such compatibility was advertised by Hi-Point regarding the original 995 carbine and the 9mm Hi-Point C-9 pistol; owners of both designs have reported that they are not completely interchangeable. The shorter pistol magazine is not long enough to fit the carbine; however, the longer carbine magazine will fit into the pistol.
Development

Despite its appearance, the Hi-Point carbine was developed for the civilian market and not specifically aimed at police department use. Nevertheless, it has been approved and purchased by a small number of local police departments that cannot easily afford to outfit all of their officers with more expensive long guns.[1]

In the first quarter of 2009, a new model of the 995 carbine was released, the 995TS, which features a new stock and last round hold open. The TS model is slightly more expensive than the ""995 Classic"". The 4095 model in .40 S&W[2] and the newest model, the Model 4595 in .45 ACP,[3] are available only in the new TS configuration. As of September 2010, the ""995 Classic"" or ""4095 Classic"" are no longer featured on the Hi-Point website.[4]
Popularity

The carbine has proven popular, and has established a solid reputation as a plinking rifle or knockabout camp or truck gun.[5] Some 28,000 were made and sold in 1998 alone, and it continues to sell well. After the success of the Model 995, the original 9mm version, the Model 4095 was created in the .40 S&W caliber. It shares much of the success of the Model 995. The newest model, the 4595TS, is poised to share in the success of its smaller-caliber siblings.

Hi-Point has developed a strong following despite the 'ugliness' of their products. A frequently heard epithet refers to the original Hi-Point configuration as ""that Planet of the Apes gun."" Their guns consistently score high in evaluations run by Gun Tests Magazine.[6] All Hi-Point firearms include a lifetime ""no questions asked"" warranty that transfers to anyone who purchases a used Hi-Point firearm.[7]"

(With the increase in availability of both the MAGPUL PTS and MAGPUL USA parts, there has been some confusion regarding the differences between MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products. All MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products are made with DuPont polymer and either forged steel or aircraft grade T-6061 aluminum alloy, and are close to indestructible. Because of MAGPUL USA’s military contracts and the regulations regarding sales of US Made firearm parts (ITAR Restriction), MAGPUL USA products are generally not available for sale outside the United States, and are even restricted in several US states. MAGPUL PTS parts are contract manufactured by MAGPUL internationally and are legal for sale anywhere in the world. Additionally, some PTS parts are specifically designed for use on airsoft rifles (like the MIAD grips designed to house electric motors) but the CTR stock for sale here is designed to fit both real mil-spec buffer tubes , and the MBUS sights will go on any 20mm rail — . Regardless, all MAGPUL parts are made to the same exacting professional quality you’ve come to expect from MAGPUL.)"

(With the increase in availability of both the MAGPUL PTS and MAGPUL USA parts, there has been some confusion regarding the differences between MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products. All MAGPUL USA and MAGPUL PTS products are made with DuPont polymer and either forged steel or aircraft grade T-6061 aluminum alloy, and are close to indestructible. Because of MAGPUL USA’s military contracts and the regulations regarding sales of US Made firearm parts (ITAR Restriction), MAGPUL USA products are generally not available for sale outside the United States, and are even restricted in several US states. MAGPUL PTS parts are contract manufactured by MAGPUL internationally and are legal for sale anywhere in the world. Additionally, some PTS parts are specifically designed for use on airsoft rifles (like the MIAD grips designed to house electric motors) but the CTR stock for sale here is designed to fit both real mil-spec buffer tubes , and the MBUS sights will go on any 20mm rail — . Regardless, all MAGPUL parts are made to the same exacting professional quality you’ve come to expect from MAGPUL.)"

These have the follow description from the manufacturer: ""The next generation of magazines have arrived and INTRAFUSE is at the forefront with our Gen II Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag."""

Anyone with half a brain can figure out that these guys are just fishing to see who will sell them any firearm without requiring a permit. It's pretty obvious that they have spread the word amongst their buddies on how to get a gun. I wouldn't be writing a post about this if there weren't so many different inquiries on my ads I've had at least 5 different guys try this with me since December. BE CAREFUL with who you meet and try to verify that the person had an LTC before you set a meeting spot. FFL's are a safer bet,  a short phone conversation can tell you a lot about a guy, if it sounds off... don't meet him anywhere. And no matter how much they offer you for your gun just remember that it will still be registered to you after you sell it to them and chances are it will be used to commit a crime and sold around to different people until it becomes evidence.

  The Police Force 8,000,000* Tactical Stun Flashlight might just be the most powerful stun gun we have ever offered. It is the first model to incorporate Triple Stun Technology (TST) which creates a powerful “electrical storm” on the head of this model.

 Features

Police Strength Protection: Engineered to meet the demands of Police, Military, and Security Professionals worldwide but also available to civilians
Triple Stun Technology: Streetwise Security Products continues to innovate and improve the designs of their stun guns. The SWPF8000R is the first model to incorpate Triple Stun Technology which allows the electrical charge to quickly jump between both edges and the middle of the prongs which creates a loud and bright electrical burst.
Shock Proof Exterior: Military Grade aluminum alloy protects the Police Force from damage so it can always be ready to protect you.
Blinding Light: Not only will the flashlight safely illuminate the entire area at night, but it can also help to protect you. When shined in the eyes of an attacker, the ultra-bright light can have a temporary blinding effect making it easy for you to immobilize them with the stun gun. Other brands state the brightness of this light as 160 to 200 lumens.
Auto Emergency Tool: When stored in your automobile the unique design of the top edge can be used to shatter a window if you are trapped in your vehicle after an accident.
Economically & Environmentally Friendly: The stun gun and flashlight are fully rechargeable and the light bulb has a life of up to 100,000 hours.
Safety Switch: To prevent accidental discharge, the safety must be in the “stun” position and trigger pressed before the stun will operate.
Fast Action: The safety switch and trigger buttons are strategically located on opposite sides of the unit allowing the safety to be turned off and the trigger pressed in less than one second.
Rechargeable: Recharge cord (included) plugs into a standard wall outlet to save you money on batteries. Complete charging instructions enclosed.
Lifetime Warranty: The Police Force is made of the highest quality components and comes with a lifetime warranty. See the enclosed instructions for complete details.

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly, is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle. The SPR features LWRC enhanced fire control group, a Magpul MIAD pistol grip, and the new Magpul ACS stock. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. This rifle also includes upgraded Geislee SSA trigger with 4lb break, surefire mb556k muzzle brake for reduced recoil and muzzle rise. Perm attached to 14.7in barrel from factory. The rifle has about 400 rounds though it and was cleaned every time it has been fired.

Why do you need ammo. Because its sold out everywhere? No. You need ammo to go shooting and have fun with our beloved past time. Your guns only hold so much if it was self defense you only need a box or two of corbon defense or HPs.

We have turned from gun loving enthusiasts into hording grandmas on black friday at Toysrus. Buy some ammo and shoot it. They will make more, eventually you can buy cases of it again.

None of my friends will go shooting with me lately. They are sitting on stacks of ammo like the well is gonna run dry. OK for you 5.7 FNH shooters perhaps. but for the rest of us.....stop hording and start shooting already. The government is trying to lull you into becoming a horrible shot because you don't practice anymore. pretty soon those guns are gonna feel too heavy and you will just hand them over for a 3ounce pepper spray that doesn't weigh down your pocket.

OK seriously. I have this ammo for sale and I needs some money.

Comes with everything pictured (including Sticky pocket holster and kydex IWB holster) and has had approx 250 rounds down the pipe.
$750 OBO, cash only, not looking for trades. I can meet in Norman. Call/text REDACTED if interested. 

I will request you bring a valid DL, military ID, or carry permit, and sign a bill of sale. Please don't take offense, I just try to cover my ass.

They always drop free, period. Tell that to a PMAG and my Spikes lower!

Also, they don't have those damn ridges that Magpul insists on putting on their PMAGs which snag and hang up on your mag pouch or chest rig. Anyways, get the very best, the one used by militaries around the globe, the EMAG. Also, these are recent production (2013 stamped) mags, no older generation ones and come new in their sealed packaging with dustcaps. Finally, I know you hate buying PMAGs which cost $12.50 for $45 bucks under the situation. The EMAG is a different story. MSRP is about $25, I think I bought these guys for about $32 each, so the markup is very little. Get what you pay for!

Cost- $38 each and eight are available, although I may have a couple more. I am the cheapest on Armslist nation wide! Will split up the lot, that is no big deal. I will also ship to locales where it is totally legal to own these things, so if you are from a ban state I am sorry but DO NOT try to have me send you a ""parts kit"" ok.
