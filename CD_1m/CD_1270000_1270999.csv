Very sturdy, feed reliably, and wont dent or rust-- and Tapco provides a lifetime warranty for all of their magazines. $18 each, 5 for $80.

 About Gen II Tapco Intrafuse AR15 mags (from the manufacturer):

 The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

 We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

Next item is possibly the rarest CS knife in existence. It is a Mini Kukri. When these do pop up on Ebay, people go crazy. I have seen a well-used one sell for $400, and mine is in flawless condition. Both would make great items to pass down, or sell at a later date. The price on these knives continues to go up. I feel that my price is very fair, and you will too if you research these knives like I have. I will maybe consider handgun trades, just let me know what you have."

It's wooded, and it has no improvements. The road it's on is totally unpaved, however, the good news is that you can get to it via the paved county road that runs behind it, if you don't mind hopping over the barbed wire fence. As far as I know, there are no HOA or POA fees on it, only the Wood County taxes that are $2.53 per year.

http://img802.imageshack.us/img802/8007/platbox.jpg - small, lot marked in red
http://img248.imageshack.us/img248/9817/platlarge.jpg - large, unedited
If the above links don't work, email me and I'll send you the pictures.
According to the scale, I would venture the guess that this land is around 40' x 50'. It's to the east of FM 778, south of Opportunity Dr and north of CR 3840 (Slayton Road), the second lot to the left of the one that says 40, underneath the left leg of the letter ""A"" in ""Oakcrest Avenue.""

This is about where it is: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Slayton+Rd,+Hawkins,+TX&hl=en&ll=32.639294,-95.308059&spn=0.00646,0.011362&sll=31.168934,-100.076842&sspn=13.422105,23.269043&oq=Slayton+Rd+Hawkin&t=h&hnear=Slayton+Rd,+Hawkins,+Texas+75765&z=17 and again, there's not really frontage on Slayton Road, there's a strip of land between Slayton and the lot that you have to cross to get to it.

I realize there's not a lot to be done with this land, but it could be your tiny place in the world to call your own, to go camping on, to bury some treasure on... I want to trade for a gun, preferably a handgun, BUT I WILL CONSIDER ANY GUN that you are willing to part with. In order of preference:

Glock 19
Jericho 941 / Baby Eagle
Any type 1911
Mossberg 500/590

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Here is a as new CZ 52 with very few rounds through it.  I bought it new several years ago and shot it very little, maybe 50 rounds.  The CZ 52's shoot the 7.62x25 tokarev round.  It comes with the holster, extra magazine and cleaning rod.  I'll toss in a box of ammo also as the ammo is sometimes hard to find. I can sell a little more ammo if needed.  Looks like the average price on other sites is around $335.00.  I am going to ask just $300.00 for gun and ammo.  Thanks for looking.

The gun is in excellent condition. The box is in very nice condition. The date of manufacture of this is 1966.

There is a story behind this gun. I bought this gun from a lady in Montana who told me that it belonged to her uncle. Her uncle was a bank manager and he bought the gun new and kept it in the drawer of his desk, loaded. When he retired, he took the gun out and shot the six rounds that were in it, cleaned it, and put it away. The box contains five empty casings, along with the original tools that came with the gun. The only mark on the gun is on one sport on the cylinder where it seems that it might have come from being in a wood desk drawer. I've tried to get a photo of it in the last of the gun photos.

Now, the serial number on the box is S 271180. The serial number on the gun is S 275277. The numbers are very close. I have no reason to believe the lady would lie about the gun so my guess would be that when the gun was purchased it was put into the wrong box. In any case, the gun is in excellent condition, and the box and contents are very nice."

I want to add one to my collection so I can cross it off of my ""buy before ban"" list, but not enough to pay Benelli prices for. Those of us with a firm understanding of law and processes like these know that we are not going to see a ban in 2013. If it happens, which it most likely will, it will not be until early-to-mid 2014.. Like the kel tec plr16, this is a gun being bought simply for sporting and collecting purposes rather than practical purposes and will end up a tac'd out safe queen among a fairly large collection. I do however understand basic economics, and recognize that prices will be inflated due to the drought. I know I'm not going to be paying what I would have paid six to eight months ago, but I'm willing to pay a bit more than its worth to make it part of my collection. I just don't want any rediculous offers. Like I said, I understand that the price will reflect the current political climate,  I just don't want to be ripped off.

I have a SA TRP Operator with the full rail for sale.  These guns are extremely hard to find since they are no longer produced.  You can still order one from the Springfield Armory Custom Shop but they are running 3200 and a year plus wait to get them.

This gun has the national matcch bull barrel and has the NM serial number to go with it, it is also built in America unlike most SA's that are made in south america for Springfield.

The gun is in excellent condition and comes with the Springfield case with 2 mag holster and gun holster (which doesn't fit it but that's what came with it).  Also comes with one magazine.

The TRP Operator with full rail is one of the hardest to find and one of the best 1911's you can get.


Has minor holster wear, other than that it looks and works flawlessly.  Night sites are still nice and bright.

Some safe marks hare and there from bumping around other guns but nothing to really worry about.

Due to my bank's policies related to cashing non-local certified/cashiers checks, I can only accept payment by Paypal, Western Union Money order,Money-gram order, certified check from either Bank of America or Citizens Bank. I also ship to: California, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey,Connecticut,Hawaii and Alaska shipping is 69.00 flat. I pride myself in getting things shipped out to you guys as soon as payment is received and confirm.
No need to pay your FFL because we dont accept FFL once you have your DL id. I ship on Tuesdays and Thursdays so if payment comes in late Thursday your gun won't ship until Tuesday. I also shoot every gun either before I post the add or before I ship to make sure there are no problems with ammo feeding or any other problem unless the caliber is rare in which case I may not have the ammo needed to fire it.

Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil.This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action.

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action. The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system."

These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil.This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action.

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action. The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system."

The Henry Lever Action is a classic Western-style lever action rifle, and one of the most popular .22's on the market today. The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable.

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself."

Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil.This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action. 

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action. The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system."

I also ship to: California, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey,Connecticut,Hawaii and Alaska shipping is 69.00 flat. I pride myself in getting things shipped out to you guys as soon as payment is received and confirm.
No need to pay your FFL because we dont accept FFL once you have your DL id. I ship on Tuesdays and Thursdays so if payment comes in late Thursday your gun won't ship until Tuesday. I also shoot every gun either before I post the add or before I ship to make sure there are no problems with ammo feeding or any other problem unless the caliber is rare in which case I may not have the ammo needed to fire it.

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches."

Not perfect, but very nice, just the same. Sorry for the crummy phone pic, because it really doesn't do this gun justice. This is said to be a pretty special item, according to some knowledgeable folks over at RFC. Here is a snippet of what they posted:

Info from the web about the rarety of my Ruger MKII - Note, mine is a shooter and not worth as much as a new in box.

From Chad's reference:

KMK514 special distributor model. Features a regular production KMK514 with Desert Camo laminated thumbrest grips. Known s/n range 216-42263 to 216-43553. About 1,500 produced for Outdoor Sports (OH) in 1990. 

I might also add that a Ruger Mark II KMK 514 NIB at the current going prices for MK II's on GB will most likely top $600.00 at auction. The only MK II selling for more than them right now are the Government Target versions in stainless and I saw one of those go for $750.00 which would have been unheard of a few short years ago. Gun prices for the Ruger variations have really started to climb in the last few years!
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

They also say this model with this barrel is one of the best balanced Marks ever made. Don't know about that, but it sure feels good in your hand. Anyways, I hate to let it go, but I just don't use it much and with ammo so scarce, it just isn't filling my needs.  Comes with 2 mags and holster.

To me this package is kind of hard to price ill try and put a fair value one it i have gotten a number of e mails from people asking a value some more respectful then others but hey i guess thats what you get on a public forum.  I realize prices are kind of crazy right now but with all the accesories and extra mags that are included ill try and be fair.  I feel the gun itself value wise is around 550 ive seen g19s going for way more then this but trying to be fair.  Mags ive also seen some crazy prices id say 30-35 each on the mags ive seen 50 and up.  I have around a 100 or so in spare factory parts.  Ammo thats included also worth around 125-150 id say.  Was told yesterday to ask around 975 thats a pretty good price but im trying to be fair i hve more then my asking price invested of course but hey thats what happens."

970,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1270970,For Sale:  Hornady Lock-N-Load A.P. Progressive Reloading Press with EVERYTHING!,"Taylor, Detroit, Michigan",$ 10,"Listed On: Saturday, March 16, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I received this press for christmas this year. Without having a mentor to teach me, youtube was working but not good enough. I guess reloading is just not for me. Now if I had a father, friend, uncle etc to teach me the ins and outs a lot of money can be saved here.
I have decided that I need repairs to my newly purchased house more than this press so it and all the dies, shell plates, scale, etc are for sale together only. Will not separate!

The Hornady Lock-N-Load A.P. Progressive Press was purchased in Dundee on 12/15/2012 Paid $423
I loaded exactly 1000 rounds of 9mm very slowly while watching videos and trying to teach myself. I think I did pretty good for no instruction. Then I loaded 100 rounds of 45ACP. Thats it exactally! None of the other dies or crimping dies or shell plates etc were ever used.

Whats included:
-Hornady 9th Edition Handbook of Cartridge Reloading Paid $32 
-Individual manuals for the following calibers: .38 Special, .357 Magnum, .45ACP, 9mm Luger, 10mm/.40 S&W, .44 Magnum Paid $7.50 each or $45 total 
-Hornady .45ACP #546555 3 piece Die Set (used 100 rounds) Paid $46 
-Hornady 10mm/.40S&W #546533 3 piece Die Set (Brand New) Paid $46
-Hornady 9mm Luger #546515 3 piece Die Set (used 1000 rounds) Paid $46
-Hornady .44 Mag/.44 Special #546548 3 piece Die Set (Brand New) Paid $46
-Hornady .38 Special/.357 Magnum #546527 3 piece Die Set (Brand New) Paid $46
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for .45ACP (used 100 rounds) Paid $20
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for 10mm/.40S&W (Brand New) Paid $20
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for 9mm (used approximately 600 rounds) Paid $17
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for ..38 Special/.357 Magnum (Brand New) Paid $17
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for .44 Special/.44 Magnum (Brand New) Paid $17
-Hornady Shellplates - Each of these plates fit many more different calibers, too many to list. Reference Hornady's Shellplate Sheet for a complete list.
Hornady Shellplates 
#45 (.45ACP & 45 Winchester Magnum) Paid $33
#8 (9mm Luger, 30 Luger, 38 Super) Paid $33
#30 (.44 Special, .44 Remington Magnum, .445 Supermag) Paid $24
#1 (25-06, 30.06, 270 Winchester, 7mm-08, 308 Winchester) Paid $35
#6 (.357 Magnum, 7.62x39) Paid $35
#10 (10mm, .40 S & W) Paid $35
-Frankford Arsenal Quick-N-EZ Case Tumbler (used twice to clean to batches of brass)
media in Tumbler is still good plus whats left in the cantainer of Corn Media I bought.
Can’t find receipt but I remember the tumbler was about $60 and corn media ?
-Black Media Sifting tray Paid $9
-Hornady Lock-N-Load #050108 Bench Scale Paid $91
-RCBS Green Primer Flip Tray Paid $9
-Cabela's 6"" Electronic Calipers Paid $25
-Lyman Inertia Bullet Puller Paid $25
-Extra Lock-N-Load Die Bushings 2pack Paid $11 & 10 pack Paid $45
I purchased a 2-pack and a 10 pack plus the few that came with it.
These are what make the Lock-N-Load unique. You can get your dies all set up for loading and with just a quick turn take those dies out and put in dies for a different caliber in minutes.
I also have a reaming case prep tool (never used) Paid approx $15 never used NEW!

I am sure I am forgetting some things. 

TRADES I MAY CONSIDER:
Colt Delta Elite 10mm in new condition, Preferrably Bi-tone Springfield XDS plus cash 
Thats most likely all I am looking for. Maybe a Crossbow 350FPS or better plus cash.

I don't expect this to last long since they are sold out everywhere. I am not looking to double my money or anything but I am well over $1300 into this! If you want the reloader but you dont want all the die sets I have, let me know what you do want. Then I can see what I am able to return and we might be able to work something out.

I also went and bought a used table off of Craigslist that has metal around the edges to mount the reloader too. This may be available. I would really like to keep the table, but as they say, everything has a price.

Now one way to make this work on both ends is, since alot of the dies, shellplates, crimping dies, etc are brand new, I can just return them and that would bring the cost down for a potential buyer.
I am looking to get my money back at the least.
Make me an offer!
