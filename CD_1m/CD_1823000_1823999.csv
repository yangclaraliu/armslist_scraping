I've shot this rifle with match grade ammo and it shoots 1.5 MOA at 86 yards. At 50 yards its ridiculously accurate.

I have six x 10-round magazines for this rifle; I have polished their internals to remove the dreaded and well-known friction from causing jams. This made them all perfectly reliable. The rifle functions well with everything except Thunderbolt. I also have two of those horrible, awful 30-round magazines made by Remington, which are sure to turn you into a monster when you touch them. I have to sell these today or Sunday somehow or they turn into pumpkins, according to our vaunted, Bloomberg-funded state legislature.

DESIGNED FOR SHOOTING
A400 Xplor is the result of the hard work of designers passionate about hunting, always in search of the optimal balance between innovation and tradition. But that’s not all: with the A400 the design and research also meet functionality, with simple and original solutions thought for the hunter.


Perfect mix of walnut and polymer to maximize performance From the fore-end insert to the trigger guard and over to the kick-off interface, each polymer component of the A400 Xplor has been conceived to optimize form, weight and functionality. Green receiver: a true cosmetic alternative respectful of even the most classic tastes.


The finishing of the A400 Xplor Unico’s receiver is an absolute innovation in the world of hunting shotguns and represents the union between the protective characteristics of anodizing and the exclusive green color that renders the a4 and the exclusive green color that renders the A400 Xplor truly “Unico”, a green technological beast.

Other information:
28"" barrel with three factory chokes. Plugged for two round hunting limitation (removable).

One hundred test rounds fired on ""sporting clays"" range with perfect results.

Very light to maneuver with fast action and limited recoil.

Provided in the box with all documentation/user manual materials."

I recently inherited this gun, and am actually thinning out my supply. This is the Model 92, a $600 gun, NOT the M92 or the R92 that are the cheap, heavy octagon barrel models often sold at Fleet Farm. They did a great job modeling this after the winchester 94. 11+1 capacity, and nice weight to carry, Not too heavy, not too light! 

I took it straight to the gunsmith and he cleaned/lubed it all, and ground down a couple burrs in the action. It's got a clean bill of health and is ready to be someone's brush gun/bear gun. It would compliment a .44 pistol greatly! I am including 1 box of winchester 240 gr jacketed soft points as wells as 1 box of Remington HTP 240 gr Soft Points. The price is as follows $400 for the gun $80 for the ammo. (Remington's sell for $56 @ Gander, and the Winchester are $49 if you can find them). Not looking to separate. Firm on price. Thank you.

The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle"

The M9A1 is the latest version that was helped developed to meet the needs of the Marine Corps. IL residents responsible for 7% sales tax. I am a dealer and will ship to your FFL. This gun comes case, manuals and 2 mags. The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U. S. Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces: A. 3-Dot Sight System: Like the 92FS, the M9A1 features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. B. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and backstraps of the frame are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. C. Accessory Rail: The frame of the M9A1 has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. D. Magazine Well Bevel: The magazine well has an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations. E. Sand-Resistant Magazine: Developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan, this unique magazine comes standard only on the M9A1. The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 in desert or other extreme conditions."

I am available just about any time today or tomorrow to do a deal.

This is a Superior Arms (www.superiorarms.com -- made in Wapello, Iowa) S-15 Carbine .223 Rem./5.56x45mm chambered AR-15.  If you are not familiar with Superior Arms, they make excellent quality ARs.  With the exception of the lower parts kit and a few other minor pieces, they manufacture all of the major components (barrels, uppers, lowers, etc.) and assemble them in-house.  Their quality control is top-rate!  I own another Superior Arms AR that's identical to this one, and it is a fantastic rifle!

This particular rifle was acquired as part of another deal, so I have not fired it myself.  But looking it over it appears to have been fired very little, maybe less than 200 rds.  It is clean, in like-new condition.  I would have thought it was new myself until I noticed the SLIGHT wear on the bolt carrier.

Lock-up of the upper to lower receiver is TIGHT (usually an indicator of quality of fit and accuracy).  

I am selling it for $1,200 OBO together with (2) 30-round aluminum C-Products magazines with Magpul anti-tilt followers, carry handle, and an Aimpoint CompM4 clone.  If you don't want the carry handle, I'll knock $40 off the price, also I can throw in an A2 buttstock (with buffer and spring) as an extra for an additional $40, or I can switch out the current collapsible buttstock with the A2 stock if you'd prefer it that way for no difference in price.  Basically, I can configure this however you'd like it.

The Aimpoint is a clone and not the real deal, but it LOOKS EXACTLY like the real thing.  It came on another rifle, and while I prefer a real Aimpoint (of course), I did use it for a couple of trips to the range, and it worked fine!  

I would prefer to sell this without the background check requirement, and I am sure you would prefer to buy without the BG check, so give me a call or shoot me an email today and let's talk a deal!"

The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...
