I'm located in Moorpark for local pickup or I could ship the item if you'd like. If you have any questions please ask. Thank you!

The Spyderco Para-Military2 Digital Camouflage Black Blade G-10 has several changes over the classic version. The G-10 handle is narrowed at the end improving the ergonomics. It features a Compression Lock and an ambidextrous-friendly four way clip which carries tip-up/tip-down, left/right-hand and rests deeper in a pocket.

We kept the same high-performance CPM S30V full flat-ground blade but made its profile thinner; removing angles that could catch on a pocket or clothing during deployment. We also lengthened the blade's tip and added additional surface jimping to both the spine and finger choil. Implementation of a new Bushing Pivot System generates fluid action and more consistent manufacturing tolerances.

Refinements to overall construction may not be drastic or even visible to the eye but from the G-10 textured handle to the CPM S30V steel full flat blade, everything is sharper, smoother and guaranteed to provide performance and user comfort.

Made in Golden, Colorado U.S.A.

I wanted a tough as nails rifle but still really accurate. I had him install a Fulton Armory chrome lined barrel. Very few gunsmiths will install a chrome lined barrel on an M1 because it is difficult to headspace. It will last forever and is really easy to clean. He installed a Badger Ordnance NM gas cylinder, and fit the op-rod tip to fit perfectly in the cylinder. The rest of the gun was built using excellent to new GI parts. Shot less than 300 rounds. I initally had the wood painted camo, but have since removed the paint except for inside the stock, as you can't see it without taking it apart, and it keeps the wood sealed. It is not glass bedded, but wood fit is very tight. Has a couple of dings in stock, very minor. I will also include 1 bandoleer of ammo, and a Holbrook device. I have over $2000 in the gun. It will shoot 2 MOA with HXP. I will sell without stock/handguards for $1075, or if you have your own parts and want to rebuild to your liking, I would sell the receiver/bolt/barrel for $700. If you want, you can purchase extra ammo in bandoleers, boxes, in sealed or open cans. Also I have once fired brass and about 500 or so primers. I'll sell the ammo at current CMP pricing, or match any price you can find by a retailer so you will save on shipping."

It has a capacity of 4+1, 2 3/4 inch shotgun shell and has a full choke.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. Anambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-roundmagazine will be available separately.
The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

I have a customized Daniel Defense DDM4V2 AR-15 and Glock 19 for sale. The rifle has EXACTLY 90 rounds fired through it and is in like new condition. The Glock 19 has 100 rounds through it. The rifle comes with a hard shell case that came with the gun plus a custom Condor tactical soft shell rifle case that I bought to go with it, it has three packs that are molled to the front which will hold up to 14 30 round mags and also has a seperate compartment that will hold 2 handguns and documents. Package also comes with 10 Magpul PMAGS. I wont split up the guns. They are being sold as a package only. Below you will find the specs for the rifle along with all the parts I've installed. Make me an offer for the package, I have over three thousand in the rifle alone so no low ball offers, they will be deleted and not responded to. THE ONLY TRADES I WILL CONSIDER are a SCAR-H (.308) or maybe other high end AR-10 style rifles. Thanks for looking.
