The Good - it is a post-855,000 production model. This means it should be easy to find a replacement barrel, especially for bird hunting or clay shooting. The replacement parts are relatively easy to find and not expensive. Strong ejection. Internals are in good condition.

Mossberg International's new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today's AR-style platforms with Mossberg International's reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18"" barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13"" length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4"" - 14.5"" LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine.  I also have 500 22 rounds to go with it.

Long rifle preferred if firearm,, 30-06, 270win, mosin nagant , even a sks possibly.  Some others may be considered.  Let me know what you've got! I'm open to reasonable offers like I said. If your wondering what the 3 knobs do on the guitar, the first one is tone, next two are a volume for each pick up. So each pickup actually has its own volume control.

I have decided to let go of my 1911 parts, which are a collection that was amassed over decades of collecting. These are rare parts, and if you have a WWI 1911 that has incorrect parts on it, the value is hurt significantly.

So, the investment of a couple hundred dollars to make yours correct, could increase the value by 4x or 5x that amount, or more. When knowing collectors look at a 1911, they scrutinize every part, and expect it to be right.

Here is all I have, and the prices (the number corresponds with the tag in the photo - due to Armslist size restrictions, there is a Photobucket link below to copy / paste in your browser):

18: Two-tone ""R"" stamped (Risdon Mfg Co.) magazine = $125
19: Two-tone ""R"" stamped (Risdon Mfg Co.) magazine = $100
20: Two-tone ""R"" stamped (Risdon Mfg Co.) magazine = $100

55: Wooden 'Double Diamond' grips (pair) = $300
57: Wooden 28-row Checkered grip (single / rt panel only) = $50
10: Vertical ""H P"" barrel = $300
9: Intertwined ""H P"" barrel = $300

48: Long wide-spur hammer with bordered checkering = $110
49: Long wide-spur hammer with no border on checkering = $110
50: Long wide-spur hammer checkered to edge, no border = $110
27: Short-tang grip safety = $70
1: Slide, has early U-notch rear sight, narrow front sight, and ""M1911 A1 US ARMY"" on right side - complete with firing pin, extractor, and firing-pin stop = $400

If you are serious about buying, please e-mail me what you are interested in.

I will only take a USPS or Western Union money order.

As it relates to my prices, I have put them below what eBay auctions are closing at for like parts, and what I'm seeing at shows.

I beg you, please do not send me an e-mail complaining about where I've set my prices. I am not forcing anyone to buy them, and if you are a serious collector, you know what they're worth. Look at what correct WWI barrels are selling for on eBay ($400+). Grips are astronomical in price, but again, if you have an otherwise correct WWI USGI 1911, and it has after-market grips on it, it really hurts value.

If you buy multiple parts, I may work with you on price a LITTLE, but I am not going to give them away. These are getting harder and harder to find, and are only going up in price. We're coming up on the 100th anniversary of WWI, which is going to cause a spike in prices as well.

I will consider trades, but nothing modern. Would need to be militaria (helmets, firearms, inert ordnance, etc) from WWI or WWII, any country.

I will keep it as brief as posible. I will send more information and pictures to serious inquiries. I will look at all offers and either take the highest cash offer or best trade. Thank you.

I am looking at trading a portion or posibly all of what you see in the pictures below. 
First off I have a Glock 17 tactical custom. She is new and as you can see in Flat Dark Earth, color. Night sights, beaver tail, Peirce grip. I had the pistol worked internally.  All parts hand polished and fitted. The ejection port cover acid washed for a nice two tone appearence. I have a total of 11 high cap mags, 9 of the 17 round and two of the 33 round mags. They are all new and unused.  All lettering on pistol and mags are done in white lettering. I have over 1000 rounds of 9mm ammo. Most of it is very high end tactical or law enforcement hollow point Hornady, Hydra Shock +P+, Magtech Guardian Gold +P. She is verytight and very smooth and ballanced with a tough stance.

I have what is considered to be one of the finest and most advanced AK 47 pistols made. I have the Arsenal SLR-106 Krink. AK-47 short pistol.  If you know AK's, you know Arsenal. She is new in the box. I have a total of 4, 30 round Bulgarian Circle 10 and Pro Mag, magazines. 5, 20 round circle 10 Bulgarian and one 5 round Arsenal mag. I have the original sling and a Magpul sling, custom grip and 350 rounds of PMC X-tac penitrator steel core 5.56/.223 as well as several other quality rounds. She comes with a Drago custom gun case/pack. Everthing is new in box and flawless. 

The last weapon I have is a hard to find especially in this condition 1932 Tula, Mosin Nagant 91/30. It has the hex receiver rather than the comon round and is a beautiful Tula rather than the Izzy. I looked for a few years for the perfect Mosin and found this one. I bought a second one that was also sweet for a parts kit and with the finest wood furniture out there. I have two bayonets many smaller hard to find parts and armor tool's. I will include stripper clips and over 500 rounds of Steel core ammo seald in a Russian military spam can. the ammo is not cold war stuff but rather fresh and recent.

I have a number of new vintage AK-47 steel 30 round mags. These are not the reproductions. They are the best hand picked East German and Russian mags. I took the cosmoline off and they are simply the best AK mags with proper markings on spine."

I bet those cry babies believe the government should also shut down all private sales like auctions, free marketplaces, swap meets, jockey lots, farmers markets, etc because they can't control prices in those areas.

- I'll throw in one 50 round box of ammo for full price offer
- Picatinny rail under barrel (a must have for home protection - great for mounting a light)
- DA/SA trigger with manual safety/decocker
- 3 high capactiy magazines (2-15 round and 1-17 round) 
- Minor wear where expected (slide, slide rail, metal to metal contact points, etc.) and some very minor holster wear on slide
- Comes in plastic case (original cardboard box also comes with it)

This pistol shoots great.  I bought this as a project (got a good deal because it came with no mags).  I had some leftover factory Beretta 92/M9 mags and had recently read about guys modifying these to work in the Bersa.  All they need is a repositioned mag catch slot (the wider slot that you can see in the photo).  Just to let you know how I did this:
1. Remove internals from mag - reinstall base plate only
2. Remove rubber grip from gun
3. Remove mag release from gun
4. Seat mag (with base plate) in mag well
All the above allows the mag catch slot to be lined up in exactly the correct location (no need to take measurements, use calipers, etc.)
5. Drill pilot hole
6. Expand pilot hole to allow hand files to be inserted
7. Hand file to obtain correct length and width of slot (inserting into magwell throughout the process to ensure alignment is still correct)
- We're talking about some hard steel when it comes to these magazines, so this was a fairly time consuming process (however, it's worth it because Beretta mags can be found much cheaper than Bersa). 

Shot this recently to test function of the mags.  They all seat with a satisfying click.  The base is nice and flush with the bottom of grip.  Shot slow, shot fast and absolutely no failures.  The slide hold open feature even works just like original Bersa mags.

You will not be disappointed with the functionality.  I would keep it, but I already have a Glock 19 that serves the same purpose (similar size/capacity) and wifey says one has to go.  

MUST have CPL and driver's license and be willing to complete bill of sale.

Not long after that article came out the TTN SXS's weren't available. They are now available again but it is my understanding this will be the last batch imported by Cimoarron. The TTN is the way to go if you want a true hammer gun. It is the ruler of the SASS Classic Cowboy catagory shotguns......................................... TNN has addressed several issues with this gun. Most of the other CAS SXS’s don’t have enough drop in the stock for CAS ground targets. They tend to shoot high for most people. The TTN has plenty drop for shooting at ground targets very similar to the originals. It is a heavy built 3""chambered long forcing cone gun so felt recoil in minimal with this guns.The hammers are close together making it easy to cock both with one thumb. For these color-case guns I receive these guns as all blue, I take them apart de-burred and de-horn the hammers and send the parts out for true bone meal and charcoal color-case hardening.....................The flat matte finish on the wood gets several coats of hand rubbed Tru-Oil. Then the parts are refitted and polished so the gun will work with the lighter springs. Then, the hammer springs,and the firing pin springs reduced and installed.....................The triggers are switched suides for righthamded shooters (3rd picture down on a different gun). The ""V"" type top latch spring and the sear springs are fitted with the more reilable piano wire springs. When finished the gun easily cocks both hammers at the same time with one thumb. The latch lever will open easier and the barrels will fall open wide of their own weight. For the barrels, the chambers are polish and chamfered for easy loading and unloading"

 I would like to trade a very nice to excellent example of the 1944 dated Mosin Nagant PU sniper rifle for an original matching New England Westinghouse M91.

 The original WWII PU sniper that I offer up in trade is one of the better examples, this maker and model year is not currently available for purchase by any of the major importers. (with small exception, which even then would be entirely luck of the draw and the odds are very long, finding a similar example and with all matching numbers they're even longer).

 It is from the more desired and lower production Tula arsenal and has no visible [I], [X] or [/] refurbishment stamps on the barreled action, stock or scope, it's all stamped matching with the letter prefix's (no line-outs), has an excellent bore and the original crown, the original matching optics are sharp and clear as well.

 This rifle is not upgradeable within it's category and I would not consider trading it if it were not a duplicate model and year for me.

 So... if you have an original and matching numbers New England Westinghouse Mosin Nagant you would be willing to trade for a pretty scarce, Tula PU sniper please send me a email and we'll talk.

 Many detailed photographs available to ""NEW"" owners considering a trade.

 TIA"

 I would like to trade a very nice to excellent example of the 1944 dated Mosin Nagant PU sniper rifle for an original matching New England Westinghouse M91.

 The original WWII PU sniper that I offer up in trade is one of the better examples, this maker and model year is not currently available for purchase by any of the major importers. (with small exception, which even then would be entirely luck of the draw and the odds are very long, finding a similar example and with all matching numbers they're even longer).

 It is from the more desired and lower production Tula arsenal and has no visible [I], [X] or [/] refurbishment stamps on the barreled action, stock or scope, it's all stamped matching with the letter prefix's (no line-outs), has an excellent bore and the original crown, the original matching optics are sharp and clear as well.

 This rifle is not upgradeable within it's category and I would not consider trading it if it were not a duplicate model and year for me.

 So... if you have an original and matching numbers New England Westinghouse Mosin Nagant you would be willing to trade for a pretty scarce, Tula PU sniper please send me a email and we'll talk.

 Many detailed photographs available to ""NEW"" owners considering a trade.

 TIA"

His Street Beat fixed-blade knife reflects all three influences. Handle and blade are roughly equal weight. Where they join is a deep finger choil doubling as a hand guard. This spot marks the location of a balance point, sometimes referred to as a sweet-spot, making the knife noticeably responsive in the hand.
The Street Beat is constructed from a full-length piece of steel set between Micarta handle scales. The scales are double pinned, expanding three-dimensionally on both ends offering the hand exceptional grip. The VG-10 clip point blade is double flat-ground with crosshatching called jimping on its spine that creates texture therefore tactile resistance against the skin of the hand and keeping the knife firmly in grip. There are two lanyard holes, a traditionally positioned handle lanyard and a small lanyard hole through the blade. Looping a thong or cord through the blade lanyard keeps your hand positioned forward on the handle even when swinging or chopping. The Street Beat comes in a black Boltaron sheath with a G-Clip fastening system

657,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1219657,For Sale:  CRKT Nirk Tighe 2 Folding Knife,"Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States",$ 75,"Listed On: Friday, March 8, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"It all began last year when Canadian knifemaker Brian Tighe saw Glenn Klecker's design for his NIRK folder, a strikingly minimal design stamped and folded out of two pieces of stainless steel. Brian called Glenn, and raised the possibility of using the same lockback release mechanism with CNC-machined open-build construction. Brian went to work and produced his custom NIRK Tighe from exotic materials,which immediately won the Most Innovative Custom Design Award at the 2010 Blade Show. 
All that was left for us to do was to convert his custom into a faithful production model. Our version of the NIRK Tighe features 420J2 stainless steel frames which are stamped, then machined and coated with blue titanium nitride. Finally, the frame exterior is satin polished, leaving the blue interior coating, a stunning effect. 
Like the original NIRK, the knife is a lockback folder in which the spring, release bar and lock detent are all integral with the frame structure. Two pronounced finger notches provide a secure grip. Brian's blade is a graceful but strong drop point design with subtle recurve, and weight-saving reliefs cut into the spine for balance. The blade can be opened with one hand, by using a thumb on the reliefs, or by pressing the blade flipper. The blade is precision cut from premium AUS 8 stainless steel. At the blade pivot, a special caged mini ball bearing system gives fast and smooth opening action. The tighter the grip on the handle, the tighter the lockup, making this an exceptionally safe design. A custom removable stainless steel clothing/gear clip is provided. 
Glenn's original quest was to create a folder of ""irreducible complexity."" Brian has added a few additional parts, true, but he's also added a vast amount of design interest in what is still a very functional folder.

DESCRIPTION:

Converted semiautomatic IZHMASH Saiga 308-1 with 2 magazines and 22"" barrel.  This rifle is absolutely gorgeous!

Legendary AK reliability in the popular .308 / 7.62x51mm caliber, which is the same caliber as the AR-10, M-14, etc.

Includes one (1) 10-round and one (1) 20-round magazine.

Functional bolt hold open (BHO).

Imported from Russia.  If Dianne Feinstein has her way, soon you won’t be able to buy one like this — ever. 

CALIBER:

.308 / 7.62x51mm

CONDITION:

Used.  Excellent condition.  All numbers match.  The bore is like new.  This rifle is from my wife’s personal collection.

COMPLIANCE PARTS:

Tapco G2 FCG (3 parts)
Dinzag Arms AK74 style threaded muzzle brake (1 part)
Custom Wood Furniture — Thumbhole stock (butt stock & pistol grip) and hand guard (3 parts)
For a total of seven (7) 922(r) compliance parts (one more than required) — you can legally use high cap magazines.

OTHER INFO:

Converted by an experienced builder.  Unlike many, the FCG is properly shimmed so as not to wander and jam.  THIS IS NOT A CENTURY BUILT RIFLE.

If the Dragunov style furniture is not your cup of tea, this rifle will take standard AK butt stock and pistol grip.

This is my personal Russian Mosin Nagant M44 Carbine. This shoots 7.62x54, it has no rust, no pitting and all the numbers match. This is an actual Russian Communist rifle and I have made sure it is Very accurate. It was bulit in 1948 in the Izhevsk factory. This is NOT the polish, chinese, or czech rifles, it is Russian. The slide on this glides like it is on butter. It quite literally glides. As well, the copper/metal butt is in perfect condition. Ready for war or to really destroy your shoulder. This rifle is not for the squeamish. The wood is very solid and there are zero cracks or bumps that shouldn't be here in the first place. This is a 65 year old rifle and the wood is in much better condition than its age. It will outlast any rifle that is made today. It has a Bayonet that is fixed to the rifle and clicks into the the rifle. It has no wiggle. It does not budge at all. When I first bought this I had my gunsmith personally check out the head spacing, sights and all movements to make sure it was in good condition. It was, and the price reflects it. I'm asking $$350 OBO for it. I'm not in a hurry to sell it so please NO LOW balling or games. Note looking for any trades but if you have one shoot it over. All I can say is no, email me with questions. I'm in Plano and LOVE History. Hope you do too. ASKING $$$350 OBO"

""The Model 60 has a manual ""fully open"" bolt hold position, activated by pushing the charging handle inwards towards the gun when it is in the fully retracted, open breech position. To close the bolt with the manual bolt hold-open engaged, the charging handle must be pulled out, away from the gun, before the bolt will go forward. Since 1985, the Model 60 has also included a patented automatic ""last-shot"" bolt hold-open. This latter feature is a safety feature that locks the bolt half-way open after the last cartridge is fired, thereby allowing the safe inspection of the now-open action. This also notifies the user when the gun is empty..............During the late-1980s, the capacity of the rifle was reduced to a 15 round maximum limit, to meet New Jersey's firearms law for semi-automatic assault weapons. For a few years in the mid-1980s the Model 60 rifles had both the ""last shot hold open"" feature and also held 18 rounds in the tube magazine. Those rifles with those two features are among the most sought after Model 60s. ........"""
