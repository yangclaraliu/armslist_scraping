Listed here is Colt M1911 reproduction, the World War I model. It's in beautiful carbonia / charcoal blue finish. 

This is essentially a Colt made, limited production 1911 pistol, meant to reproduce the original mil spec Colt 1911 of the early 20th century teens. It is chambered in .45 ACP, and bears all the build quality and aesthetic perfection one would expect from Colt. Only around 4,000 were made of this gun, and then another 4,000 of the 1918 version, which is finished in Black Oxide per the specs for wartime production of the pistol, before parkerized guns were adopted. 

This gun is in new condition, and is unfired. Never has been loaded either. Cosmetically and functionally, it is in perfect condition. There is very slight wear on the barrel lugs, and near the muzzle end of the barrel, but finish wear is to be expected in these areas, and is the result of a few dozen safety checks over time. I have seen other new examples of this same gun, but with more wear in those same areas. 

The charcoal finished version of this gun is generally a little more sought after than the black oxide version of the M1911, as the carbonia / charcoal is a more choice process, offering a look that compliments the 1911 like no other. Furthermore, the WW1 reproductions have met with a very large amount critical and popular acclaim during the past few years. They rate high as accurate reproductions of the original pistol, and as VERY shootable, and an incredibly well made GI 1911 configuration 1911 from Colt. If you know Colts and like 1911s, you are probably enlightened as to how wonderful these pieces are. If you are new to these, please look them up and prepare to be intrigued. 

The trigger on this gun is incredible. I previously owned a 1918 version of this same gun, and it shot incredibly well, with no jams, or failures. But the trigger is what's best, as it's less than 4 pounds, and really touches off at that perfect moment, basically helping the shooter in chewing a two inch wide hole through through the target. If you can shoot, then this gun won't hold you back in performance. There are other mil spec Colt that are really heavy in comparison. This one is not. It's on par with most custom-grade 1911s, and should prove to be a great shooter. 

The sale includes the gun, two unstamped repro - style Colt mags (standard blued, single tone), the military style issue box (see pics), and a reprint of the original Colt 1911 manual. There are a few extras that originally came with the gun that are not included: These 1911s were produced via Colt's custom shop, and came inside the Colt CS blue box, inside of a white sleeve box. Those materials are not around anymore. Had they been, I would be charging a bit more to make up what I paid for this originally, about a hundred dollars more. 

I will deal face to face, and will want to see a non-expired, valid Wisconsin drivers license. Recipient will be asked to sign the bill on sale as well. Please feel free to ask me any questions via email, or to set up an opportunity to see the gun. Thanks for looking!"

It's built on a limited-run (group buy on FALFiles) Entreprise Type I receiver with correct Belgian markings and blued finish, as well as a matching serial number to the rest of the gun. It has an early ""b"" suffix serial on the lower receiver. Also has wood carry handle, wood pistol grip, and very rare, early Type A wood buttstock. All the finish is original except for the upper receiver and barrel, and the metal is all in great shape. Looks beautiful as is, or you could have it hot blued and have a REALLY gorgeous, rare FAL. The only flaw is a small dent in one of the metal handguards, but that can be fixed pretty easily. Bore is excellent and the barrel is Belgian. This is really a great rifle, I just do not shoot it enough, and I love HK :P It will come with two Belgian 20 round magazines and an original sling.

256,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1533256,For Sale:  HK Mark 23 .45 45,"north carolina, North Carolina, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Sunday, April 28, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am the original owner of this HK Mark 23. It has had only ~250 rounds of ammunition through it. The gun is in perfect condition without blemishes except for the normal wear mark that occurs on the top of the barrel as seen in the photos of the ejection port. The gun includes two 12 round magazines, two ten round magazines, the Mark 23 Picatinny Rail Adaptor ($129.95) for mounting a laser or tactical light such as the Surefire X400, and the GG&G Mark 23 Picatinny scope mount ($325) for mounting an Aimpoint, Holosight, or other sight of your choice, flash suppressor, original owners manual, warranty card, and HK fitted camo case. The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. The Mark 23 provides match grade accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole! The Mark 23 is available in .45 ACP Features: •	Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile •	Match grade trigger •	One piece machined steel slide •	Frame mounted decocking lever and separate ambidextrous safety lever •	Can be carried “cocked and locked” in single action mode with the safety lever on •	Patented HK recoil reduction system •	Corrosion resistant blued finish •	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame •	Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves •	Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories •	Ambidextrous magazine release lever •	Extended slide release •	Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator •	Patented Lock-Out Safety device"

One VERY small scratch by the round ejection port. No dings, nicks, or other scratches. Comes with 2 mags, the manufacturer's first shell, 220 brass rounds, and 50 brass hollow points.

Weapon has a threaded barrel for suppressor attachments and a rail system for other attachments. Weapon light & ammunition are included in price.

Weapon has had 280 rounds through it total. (I bought 500 originally, have 220 left that come with the weapon)

Weapon shoots flawlessly and there is not a thing wrong with it. Light has fresh batteries and works beautifully. This weapon has been very well taken care of, cleaned & lubed about once a week.

I'm selling because a nasty care bill has come up and love my Glock way too much to sell so this was the next in line.

Cash only please and this offer stands. Please do not try to talk me down on the price because it's not going to happen. All of what comes in this package is worth more than the price as it is.

This is the Compact Tactical model. The weapon was around 1100 when I originally purchased it. The tac light was around 270, not to mention the ammunition. This really is a beautiful weapon.

REDACTED, serious inquiries only please. You can call or text at any time. I'm currently working the night shift so I have some weird hours. If you call and I don't answer, just leave me a message and I'll get back to you soon. I will be taking this post down immediately after sale, so if your reading this, the sale is still open.

2 boxes 30-06 Red Tracer ammo by Talon Mfg. - $60 for both.

2 boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser FMJ bullet & 2 boxes of 6.5 Swedish wood bullet ammo. The wood bullet ammo was considered to be ""blank"" ammunition when used with a special  adapter that shredded the wood bullet. However be extremely careful if firing without adapter because wood bullet can be very dangerous at close range. $50 for all four boxes. All of the 6.5 Swedish ammo above is non-corrosive.

5 boxes WWII era 8x56R ammo. This ammo was made in 1938 as the Germany was planning to enter Poland. This is the correct ammo for the M95 Steyr ""straight pull"" carbine & long rifle. The ammo is in amazing condition given it's age and each box and every individual round bears the date of manufacture, and the proof mark  ""War Eagle"". The vast majority of this ammo will fire reliably and I shot many boxes through a M95 carbine I used to have. Recoil is quite heavy though in the carbine. This ammo is a ""super collectible"" piece of WWII history. Price is $20 a box or $80 for all five. Each box contains 10 rounds packed on 2 blued steel M95 stripper clips which sell for $5+ each on Gunbroker & Ebay today.

Wearing a holstered pistol is sometimes not an option. Concealment can be a challenge with some revolvers but not the Off Duty. This enclosed hammer double action revolver is ideal for tucking in a waistband, under a shirt or in a pocket because the enclosed hammer will never snag on clothing at absolutely the wrong time.

This listing is for my very rare, high quality and extremely good condition Romanian SKS.

This is from my personal collection and is not the typical beat up junk you've seen on the market.  Most of the Romanians you will find have been abused and beat to hello.

* 1958 Romanian - Considered to be of equal quality to the Russians and second to none. Much like the Albanian, these are very few and far between and most are very beat up. Not this one, I guarantee this Romanian is one of the nicest you will ever see, if not the nicest. There is nothing wrong with this rifle and there is everything right about it. It is extremely rare especially in this nearly perfect condition. This could possibly be the best SKS investment you could make or a very close 2nd to the Albanian. All matching numbers with cleaning rod and bayonet. This is my personal favorite and hate to sell. ONLY $$600

* 1954 Russian Tula - OH MY, this is extremely rare as it has NO refurb markings! Nearly all Russian SKS's have been factory refurbished and marked as such prior to being imported to the U.S. for resale. It is extremely rare to find one that hasn't been refurbished. Not only has it not been refurbished it has dark solid wood. Many of the later SKS's came with the ugly laminated or plywood looking stocks.  SKS with all matching numbers except, the mag doe's not have any numbers on it. Comes complete with cleaning rod and bayonet. What a rare find, asking ONLY $600 obo !!!

I have over 30 photo's available I can email to you, but please only request them if your serious about this rifle.

See my other listings for more collector quality SKS's and other firearm related items.

I will make 7.62x39 ammo available to anyone who buy's any of these rifles. I have sealed cases of Yugo brass ammo and will sell to you at .40cents per round as much as you want.

I prefer cash but will entertain offers but I'm very very select on what I'm willing to trade for. But go ahead and tell me what you have, all I can say is no.

I am looking and interested in the following:
*CASH !!!
* Ruger Mini 30  tactical version

Extremely nice, like new, possibly un-fired or fired very minimal if at all.
Collector Grade Norinco SKS with ALL matching numbers !!!

Quite possibly the very nicest Norinco you have ever laid eye's on. 

My interest has changed and I'm selling/trading my collection of collector quality SKS's.
This listing is for my near perfect condition Norinco SKS.

This is from my personal collection and is not the typical beat up junk you've seen on the market. 

*Norinco - This particular SKS has the factory installed bakelite handguard, this is very rare. This rifle is in aboslutley as new condition as it can be, it appears to be in un-fired condition. It is just about as perfect as you will find. It is all matching numbers and comes complete with cleaning rod and bayonet. It's so beautiful I fell in love with it when I saw it and just had to have it and you will to! What a bargain, asking only $500 obo

I have over 30 photo's available I can email to you, but please only request them if your serious about this rifle.

See my other listings for more collector quality SKS's and other firearm related items.

I will make 7.62x39 ammo available to anyone who buy's any of these rifles. I have sealed cases of Yugo brass ammo and will sell to you at .40 cents per round as much as you want.

I prefer cash but will entertain offers but I'm very very select on what I'm willing to trade for. But go ahead and tell me what you have, all I can say is no.

I am looking and interested in the following:
*CASH !!!
* Ruger Mini 30  tactical version 
* Ruger PC9 Police Carbine
* Kimber or Colt handguns
* Freedom Arms 22lr mini mag revolver with belt buckle and leather pouch
* Did I say cash already ?
* What do you have ???

You will need to provide a copy of your DL and PTC/PTP and sign a Bill of Sale for my records, no exceptions.

Feel free to ask questions and submit offers/trades. I will reply as soon as I can unless I feel they are not serious inquires.

I'm located in the Clearwater area, you must be willing to meet at my location or very close."

A 9mm C-9 Hi-Point semi auto pistol w/8 rd mag (model 916). And to wrap it all up, 500 rds of 124 gr FMJ 9mm ammo. Both the carbine and the Pistol are rated for +P ammo. Have a carbine, pistol in the same caliber, with plenty of ammo to use. Makes a perfect home defense setup and only 1 caliber to try to find. Before I get the hater mail for them being Hi-Points, I'll break down the prices. $550 for the Carbine, $300 for the pistol, and $350 for the ammo. I know I didn't pay that much for them and inflation sucks, but SKS's used to go for $89 each and AK's went for $300 tops, and 5.56/.223 used to be under .25 cents per rd. So by those prices, the inflation on Hi-Points are well below the average of the other over priced guns and ammo. The reason for this rant is to curb the socialist freaks out there that just because the prices are not where they think they should be, then I am a horrible person and should automatically sell to them for what I paid 5 years ago.  Sorry I don't fit your socialist model, everything is not about you... I have not had any of the usual problems that Hi-Points are always rumored to have. These go bang when you pull the trigger. I would like to sell them together, but might be willing to separate for the right offer. Will not sell the ammo separate. Not really interested in trades at the moment, need the cash. I can take additional pics if requested. Thanks for looking."
