It is 195 series, unknown round count. Comes with 2 factory 5 round mags, and 2 unknown brand 20 round mags (I think they are 20's, I have never loaded them)

It has a Hogue Stock, Ultimak scout rail, Tech-sights rear peep sight (factory sight included if I can find it), and an Accu-strut barrel stabilizer. I also have the factory plastic stock for it.

The barrel was shortened to 16 1/2 inches, and a Choate flash hider sight combo was installed.

Here's the bad. The first hole for the Choate I drilled ended up leaving the sight canted, so I had to press the sight further on, and do a second one. The second hole left the sight straight, but the pin went in at an angle. The pin is through the bottom of the barrel, but the holes on each side are un-even. I attempted to clean up the holes with some JB weld, and it ended up a little sloppy, as I have never used JB weld before. For $44 you can order another flash hider from Midway and give it a try yourself...lol

The Stock has been badly broken and someone has put screws in it to hold it together.  I removed some electrical tape to see what was going on but I did not want to damage it.  It is a true collectible.  Bright steele barrels and the engravings are very nice.  I comes apart and goes back together easily and soundly- it is very tight.  Only shoot with light loads if at all.  I would not try until you had it inspected by a gunsmith.

The gun was made with a 24"" Barrel chambered in .308. It has a 14-3/8"" length of pull and and a raised cheek.  - $350.00

 Beautifully Sporterized, this thing is a must see tack driver. A very nice custom gun for the discerning shooter. The amount of work that went into the building of this gun is incredible. At this price, the gunsmiths work has been discounted to below minimum wage, lol. Beautiful wood, Redfield adjustable rear ghost ring peep sight, Ebony forend cap, matching numbers, great bore, etc. The bolt was completely reworked and is beautiful, it was jeweled and the bolt handle was dropped for scope clearance if a scope is so desired. The inletting to the stock was masterfully done. The wood seems to be a tiger maple of some sort and it has the ebony forend cap with ivory ring.

Alas, the gun is not perfect. Thus the price. There was some kind of mishap that left a spot on the barrel right next to the front sight ramp due to corrosion. The oxidation has been removed and the metal stabilized but there is some discoloration and metal pitting.  Like the picture shows, it is a small area and not very noticeable but it is there none the less. I have seen similar, but worse in size where a fellow grabbed his gun by the barrel with a bloody hand and didn't clean it up immediately. Left over night that can start the rust fast. Maybe it's the extra iron in blood as opposed to water.t isn't very large or noticable, but I wanted to point it out.

Please, no trades at this time.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters."

Inc. redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the triggerguard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position. This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland. All parts and components are new and Polish made. The PPS-43C pistol comes with 2 curved box magazines, each holds 35 rounds. Polish PPS-43C semi auto pistol ATF approved incl. 2 x 35rd. magazines and cleaning kit. Caliber: 7.62x25 mm TT,. Weight: 3.67 kg loaded, 3.04 kg empty,. Length: 615 Barrel length 250 mm,. Magazine Capacity 35 rounds.. Effective range:200 meters .
 Produced in Poland at the famed Radom plant, this new production PPS-43C is a semi-automatic derivative (FOLDING STOCK IS FIXED SPOT WELDED) of the Russian PPSH-41 full-auto, sub-machine gun developed during WWII for the Red Army in its fight against Hitler. The PPS-43C is chambered in the potent and battle-proven 7.62 x 25mm Tokarev due to its highly penetrative characteristics. When there isn't a nationwide buying panic going on, This ammunition is readily available in both new production and surplus offerings. Even though derived from a folding stock SMG, this closed-bolt model is ATF approved - the stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the 14” barrel length weapon is classified as a pistol, not a SBR. It comes furnished with two(2) 35rd magazines, oiler, cleaning rod .. The PPS-43C offers substantial firepower in a very compact and light weight platform. It is a natural candidate for a SBR conversion (subject to NFA compliance). Hi-cap pistols of this genre are becoming increasingly difficult to find among suppliers; availability may be very limited to non-existent in the future due to pending ban and Nato Treaty talks in March for Small Arms Treaty.

You know these are impossible to get right now.  But, if you can find them, they're $599, plus tax, plus background check...or, about $700.  That's what I have in this one and I'm not going to lose money.

LWRC M6A2 
Patriot Brown 5.56 
In Stock, Ready to Ship

Brand New! NO credit card fees!!


The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

The stock is nice (a few very small dings) and bluing is good all around- no scratches on this barrel.  This has the thicker ""micro groove"" barrel and drives tacks at 50 yards with better ammo (CCI, Winchester & Rem do best).  The scope is an older BSA Contender 4-12 x 40 and it holds true until bumped hard (good, but cheap scope).  Scope has wear on it meaning its been good enough to be used for 5 years on another rifle (25-06) which got it's new Leupold VX II with a stock refinish last fall.  So this BSA got moved down to the Marlin since it does the job as well as any other $130 scope (5 years ago).

I want to keep this gun as it's been a great rifle and was made in 2000-- with the nicer cross-hatched stalk work, thicker barrel and I had the trigger tweaked and barrel floated and this really improved accuracy-- very reliable out to 150 yrs.  The bolt action is smooth and the clip holds tight like it should.  This gun needs nothing but good ammo to shoot MOA at 100 yrds and is a rabbit ""head laser"" at that range using 30 gr Hornadys.

This rifle comes with about 100 rounds of better Win Super X & Remington 40 gr. bullets and 70 rounds of Armscor (decent plinking ammo)... about $40 worth.  So the price for a cash sale includes $280 rifle + $40 ammo = $320."

I bought a Windham as my gunsmith said they're the best fit/finish he's seen on ARs (short of Noveske). Check out online reviews, they’re overwhelmingly positive.

Huge plus with this American manufacturer is the Windham lifetime warranty! The rifle’s brand new, and hasn’t been registered yet. The lifetime warranty is transferable, per their site, but there’s no need for that since you’ll be the original owner!

Windham finished this top-end AR with the most requested parts around: Magpul adjustable stock, Magpul pistol grip w/ storage compartment, Smith 'Vortex' flash hider, Diamondhead flip up front and rear sites, Diamondhead free-float quad rail system, Magpul angled foregrip, etc! All the extras equal $600 MSRP!! This AR is ready to run, brand new in its hard case! Some sellers online aren’t including the hard case, and several haven’t been including 30 round mags; not I, you’ll get the hard case and original 30-rd mag that Windham ships as part of the rifle package.

$2000 for the rifle (cheaper than recent gunbroker listings, plus no sales tax/shipping), $2100 to include 3 new-in-wrapper windowed PMAGS! (at $2100 I'll also throw in 60 rds of AE varmint-tipped .223, as it's been laying around for a couple months)

I have 4 magazines shown but I can throw in 2 more for a total of 6 20 round magazines. this has the metal trigger housing as opposed to the new plastic trigger housing. It comes with some extra unused wood furniture and sling.

I can meet FTF in the northern Colorado area. I am easy to get along with, however, have proof of Colorado residency without excuses like ""I just moved here from New York city"". If you show up with your hat on sideways, your pants falling off, a MR. T starter kit on, an attitude or any liberal voting stickers on your car dont expect to complete the transaction. No punks and you must be legal to own firearms.

Subject: NO Gun Control - IT IS UP TO YOU To Protect our 2nd Amendment Rights

Colorado Senators,

Now it is up to you to defend our 2nd Amendment rights. I know many of you have already told me you intend to do just that – I know you have taken the same oath I did as a military veteran – To Defense the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. We know what the 2nd Amendment says about our rights not being infringed. Unfortunately your counterparts in the House do not understand how the bills proposed infringe upon those rights.

HOW WILL YOU VOTE?

HB13-1229: Requiring background checks for all gun transactions – let’s consider the fact that in each case in recent history, those whose criminal actions have led to this current frenzy to remove our rights ALL purchased their firearms legally through the background check system with the exception of the monster Adam Lanza. Adam’s mother unfortunately lost her life because her son decided to kill her for her weapons, which she purchased legally. I am trying hard to understand HOW this bill would do anything to prevent another Adam Lanza, James Holmes, or a Jared Laughner from doing what those sick people did to others. Please tell me HOW…. I’ve not heard this from anyone. What this law does is infringe upon my right to sell a firearm privately to someone I know, who likely has a Colorado Conceal Carry Permit, or who has already passed background checks in their past. This is a direct attack against our 2nd Amendment rights (I can’t give a firearm I own to my son???) – and for WHAT reason? Please someone tell me. How is this not infringing upon our 2nd Amendment right? 

HB13-1226: banning concealed weapons on campuses – college age students are old enough to vote, buy booze, buy pot (I’m sure that’ll be coming soon), and to buy guns, but they are not allowed to carry them on campus? What is the rationale? Has anyone look at the FBI data around violent gun use at college campuses? What did that say? The massacre at Virginia Tech was conducted in a GUN FREE ZONE. The evil murderer Cho, an individual adjudicated as mentally unsound, was allowed to purchase handguns without detection by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). See HB13-1229 – the irony of this is sickening. Cho legally bought the firearms that he used to murder innocent people with in a gun free zone. Is your intent to have this happen MORE OFTEN in our state? How is this not infringing upon our 2nd Amendment right?

HB13-1228: instituting a fee for gun buyers to cover the cost of the CBI to perform background checks – this is not gun safety, this is a gun tax. We pay Federal and state taxes today, and yet this bill says we need to pay tax for the mandatory background check. See HB13-1229 – the House wants to make this background check mandatory for all transactions, and they want to tax us for it as well? First off, how does this make anyone safe? Second, this is self-serving – all dealer transactions require a background check by law (to include gunshows), and yet the House wants to make all sales require a background check, and then make gun owners pay a tax for that mandatory requirement. How is this not infringing upon our 2nd Amendment right?

HB13-1224: limiting magazines to 15 rounds – the absolute worst of the lot. Someone has to explain how limiting anything from whatever to 15-rounds makes anyone safe. Where is the research to prove this to be true? The truth is that states with 10-round magazine bans DO NOT see a decrease in crime. Those states with the most draconian laws have a higher rate of violent crime nationally. Worse than this, the bill infringes upon our right to defend ourselves effectively by telling us (law abiding gun owners) that we can only have 15 rounds. Does ANYONE believe that criminals will follow this law? Do you really believe James Holmes, Adam Lanza, or Jared Laughner would follow these laws? The answer is NO – you know it, and we know it. Plus, a Colorado Business that is profitable, and produced outstanding equipment (Magpul) will be forced to move because of this legislation. Even if they are provided an amendment, they will need to move to avoid being boycotted for hypocrisy. HOW does limiting our rights to more than 15-round KEEP ANYONE SAFE? Please explain this to me – I’m just a simple American Military Veteran and a director of church security for a large church in the Denver Metro area. I must be too simple to see the obvious reasons – but I’ve talked to a great many angry Coloradans who also fail to see how this will keep anyone safer, except for the criminals. How is this bill not infringing upon our 2nd Amendment right? 

Take away jobs, remove our ability to have the same capacity magazines as criminals, tax us for mandatory background checks, ban conceal carry for mature adults on campus to make those killing zones, and require background checks for all private transactions. Sounds like the House bills do nothing but infringe on our 2nd Amendment rights.

HOW DO THESE BILLS KEEP US SAFER? What has the House proposed that would keep us safe – nothing… There is NOTHING about mental illness – nothing about enforcing our current laws, nothing about removing gun free zones for legal conceal carry holders, nothing for keeping us safer. The opposite is true – restrict, regulate, tax, and infringe… 

Remember this – Colorado Gun Owners span both parties and make up quite a few “independent voters”. If these bills pass, you can bet that Colorado Gun Owners across all parties, and backgrounds will all make the necessary changes in 2014 and 2016 to ensure that our 2nd Amendment Rights are NEVER AGAIN infringed upon.

It comes with extra grip and hand guard set for when you take the launcher off, 2 high cap mags, scope and for the right trade a 90 round AR15 DRUM!!!

This Bohica perform's and has been trouble free all these years and a blast to own!. As far as I remember the launcher was ordered as a extra with the rifle and came as a unit.

Just consider the rarity of this product and they way it was made/set up or the fact that you just cant find another one even kinda like it, or one of it's family member's being sold elsewhere. This is the collector/shooter's rifle to get! Feel free to Google it and you will see only a few ""actual"" reviews out there! It is that rare!
 Most of the stuff you will find is people bagging on what the name stand's for. BOHICA also made alot of big cal uppers but only 50 of the RIFLES so thats why there is little to none of actual comments or reviews on them made by people who own them or even held them in their hand's. 

I also have a Bohica 50cal upper that willl be for sale in a different listing.

The launcher is an original Cobray  37 (Mak10-11 etc) device with M203 TGH/handle etc and they dont make them anymore. Included with the deal is a Military issue M203 Grenade Carrying Vest to haul your ammo around in while you are out having fun!"
