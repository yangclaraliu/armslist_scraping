Prices are firm. If you can find surplus 30'06 cheaper then buy it. I would ship but you would pay the real cost of legally shipping the ammo (ORMD via USPS) so it is probably not cost effective. 

Pick up will be in Sierra Vista. If you are in Tuscon I might be willing to meet in Benson depending on the deal. If you are elsewhere we can figure it out."

Kinematic Drive™ SYSTEM
In its simplest term, kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The new Browning A5 makes better use of kinetic energy with its powerful, short recoil-operated Kinematic Drive System. Kinematic Drive harnesses recoil energy and converts it into the mechanical motion needed to operate the action. This concept is tried and true, and now perfected by the company that broke ground first with autoloading shotguns. The beauty of Kinematic Drive is the simplicity of design for consistent, reliable function with any load and under the full extremes of weather, temperature, moisture and grime. We believe the new Kinematic Drive is so reliable that the A5 is the first ever autoloading shotgun to carry a 100,000-round or five-year guarantee. This gun is designed to work, come hell or high water. Operation is clean because gases are sent out the barrel and away from the action. There’s also extreme load versatility. The extensively tested Kinematic Drive offers reliable performance with virtually all loads down to 1 ounce field loads with no adjustments."

About Our Barrels

The custom machined match barrels used in RGUNS rifles and uppers are made from 4150 chrome-moly vanadium steel manufactured in the USA. Each 5.56 NATO barrel is properly head spaced with an M4 feed ramp extension installed.

 Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and muzzle threaded � -28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion when the barrel heats up, and hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life.  

 Each barrel has an eleven degree crown, polished chamber and lapped bore, as well as a pulled-button rifling,  producing a superbly accurate bore diameter with uniform rate of twist. Fluted models feature unique fluting designs to improve rigidity and aid in barrel cooling.

From Wikapedia: It features a stainless steel frame and slide double-action, semi-automatic handgun with 4 inch barrel, slide mounted de-cock/safety and an 11-round staggered-column magazine. It was one of the new 3rd generation S&W semi-autos, designed with input from famed gunsmith Wayne Novak of Parkersburg, WV. The 4006 introduced the new .40 S&W cartridge and featured a wrap around one piece grip made of Xenoy versus the earlier standard 2 piece grip panels, as well as low profile 3 dot Novak sights. Various safety features include a safety lever, which blocked the firing pin from the hammer as well as a magazine safety, which kept the pistol from firing when no magazine was inserted. While a true double-action pistol, the firearm shares this magazine disconnect feature with Browning Hi-Power pistols: it cannot be fired without the magazine in place. This feature was developed to meet the needs of various law enforcement agencies interested in providing another level of safety for their officers. The Model 4006 has been used by many law enforcement agencies as a standard duty sidearm, including by the California Highway Patrol, California State Parks and Rec., and until recently, the Colorado State Patrol."

and say you found one for cheaper. Good luck with 
those. This is the newest model, with all the newest parts

The Ruger Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR) is a light, small-frame handgun with a smooth, easy-to-control trigger and highly manageable recoil. Its patent-pending polymer fire-control housing holds components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduces weight significantly and reduces recoil. An optimized friction-reducing cam results in a smooth, nonstacking trigger pull. The cylinder and barrel are supported by a monolithic, aerospace-grade aluminum frame treated with a black synergistic hard coat to reduce weight and enhance durability. The cylinder is strong 400 Series stainless steel, extensively fluted to reduce weight and is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s durable Target Grey® finish. Five-shot capacity.
Available:

    LCR – Chambered in .38 Special+P and outfitted with a Hogue® Tamer™ grip to reduce perceived recoil. Integral U-notch rear sight. Replaceable, pinned, ramp-style front sight.

I'm the second owner on this gun and it has only had 24 rounds put throught it since new. 16 by previous owner and 8 by me.

This gun is in near MINT condition. NO faded blueing anywhere. 

It comes with a Bianchi nylon holster, and a box of 100 36 grain hollow-points.

I'm asking $450 FIRM or trade for other firearms ONLY. Please no shotguns.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. Gen Magazines WILL NOT accept the Magpul Ranger Floorplate.

The next-generation PMAG 30 Window GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining."

The Finns adopted the Russian M91 when they split from Russia during the Revolution but quickly decided it needed changes for their use. Both the Army and the White Guard did their own versions until just before the 1939 Winter War. There are actually more Finn variants of the Mosin than there are Russian. The M39 was an effort to consolidate the best of all the modifications into one standardized rifle. The list of improvements to the M39 vs an M91 include...

 Unique stock produced from local arctic hardwood making it very durable and resistant to temp changes. Stock has loops for both normal and side sling attachment. Side sling is used by Ski and Cav troops.

 Action floated with shims.

 The Typical Finn 2 stage Trigger. 

 Windage adjustable front sight. 

 Improved rear sight.

 Dimpled magazine to improve feeding.

 This rifle is a 1968 build among those used by the Finnish Army for competition. Rifle is in Excellent condition, all numbers match, and includes sling and the Arsenal ""hang tag"" showing it was never issued. Also included is a black soft case. Please be aware that the Finns reused many parts from older rifles when producing all of their Mosin variants. Because of this most Finn Mosins show wear and pitting from before the remanufacturing process. 

 This rifle is no different. The receiver is 1901 production at the Russian Izzy arsenal. Think about that. This receiver predates The Sino-Russian war of 1903, The Russian Revolution, WW1, the Winter War of 1939, and WW2. (called the Continuation War by Finns) The Receiver could have been involved on the battle field of any or all of these. Trust me, it has signs of wear and neglect in its previous life. 

 These rifles can sell for over $600 but since this is a 1968 it doesnt command as high a price. I'm offering it for $350 with ZERO haggling. Cash only. No Trades, No Checks. First person to put cash in my hand owns it. Keith @ REDACTED anytime. If this ad is still up the rifle is still for sale."

Need to sell this great running truck. I have no illusions of getting back what I have spent on getting it ready for you!
Brand new battery installed today, along with one warrantied tire.(nail) Other tires have about 1700 miles on them.
I have owned this truck for about two years and have put less than two thousand miles on it! Which is exactly why I need to sell it. It's more truck than I need. Worst thing a person can do to a truck is let it sit and rot. I have spent a small fortune on things like: new K&N air filter; new front end components; new shocks; new tires; new window tint; changed transmission and more than I care to list or remember.
As stated - runs and drives great! Sounds good too! (after-market exhaust) Has towing package and power windows and locks. Mileage is 159,517. Has after-market deck and is already wired for your amp and speakers. Leather interior is in good shape, but has one bad spot on drivers seat. Paint is somewhat sunburnt, but have you seen what guys are doing with roll-on Rustoleum these days?!
Willing to barter for smaller truck or camper styled rv. (Obviously, I won't be interested in anything that needs to be towed.) Not interested in any cars, thank you. Will accept loudenboomers as partial payment depending on what you're offering. Price is not set in stone, I am somewhat flexible, but please be reasonable with any offers.

NO SCAMMERS & NO SPAMMERS! I'm an honest, straight shooting guy and would appreciate only dealing with same.
Please reply with phone number and good time to call."

These rounds have the tungsten carbide penetrator inside the casing.These are TRUE armor piercing rounds that are no longer made. Tungsten Carbide is MUCH harder than steel! These rounds are dated 1952, headstamped FA (Federal Arsenal). I have personally shot these into granite boulders and the penetrator was only scratched and still had a point on it This stuff is hard to come by, expensive and highly sought after. 
If you buy these online, they will cost $3 per round with a minimum order of 200 rounds and they do not include the clips. 
I am selling these for $2.50 per round with a minimum purchase of 16 rounds and I will include the clips. That comes to $40 for 16 rounds loaded in two Garand clips. I have 4 lots of two loaded clips (16 rounds per lot) available.
