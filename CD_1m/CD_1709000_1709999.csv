We all grew up hearing the phrase, ""Faster than a speeding bullet...,"" but not when it is fired from Smith & Wesson's new Model 460XVR, with the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on earth. The Model 460XVR is so revolutionary that it required an entirely new designation...XVR, X-treme Velocity Revolver.

Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot!

The BFG-50 is constructed using the most modern manufacturing methods and is made from the highest quality MIL-spec alloy steels. The BFG-50 was designed by Mark Serbu, a degreed mechanical engineer. The design has been thoroughly proven with over 1500 rifles delivered over the past five years.

While the price of this gun is incredibly reasonable, the low quality that one usually expects with a low price is not a fact of life with the BFG-50. How can this be done? Low overhead, and a design that's optimized for manufacturability as well as performance and quality. The BFG-50 is a perfect gun for the enthusiast who has always wanted to have a .50 BMG rifle, but doesn't want to spend $3,000+ to get one.

http://www.rockriverarms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_id=223

Except mine comes with a Front Sight Block. 

Rock River Arms Rifles come with Heavy Profile Barrels, that are 1"" under the hand guard, and the standard .75"" thickness after at the gas block on. This gives them better accuracy than standard AR barrels that come in a thin ""Pencil"" profile, as well as give them a longer life and help them cool faster. The 3rd picture shows an accuracy test with a scope at 100 yards, all of the shots are within 2"" (2moa) using Steel-Cased Tula ammo.  

If you choose to buy it, I switch my upgrades for the stock parts such as:

Gas block to FSB
hogue grip to A2 Grip
Griffin Armament M4SD2 Flash Comp. to A2 Flash Hider
UTG Extended Charging Handle latch to Standard latch
Magpul ASAP End plate to Standard End Plate

I put ""New"" trigger because it is in fact new, never used. It is still in packaging. It's the same trigger that came with the gun, except brand new.

I have over 1000$ of parts on this rifle. If you want it in the exact configuration, it is $2,000 . I will not sell it with the Lucid HD7 Red dot.

Off Season Special -- $60 takes it.

Estate find.  I’ve never fired it, but it seems ready to go.  I cleaned it, oiled it up and checked the barrel.  Looks ready to go.   I think this is CVA but I don’t see a mark for them, Hawken or the other black powder makers that I’m familiar with.   You can look and decide for yourself what it is.

This has a synthetic stock and is much lighter than my full sized Hawken.  The overall length is 3 foot 6 inches and the barrel length is 2 foot 2 inches … approximately.  Because it seems lighter and smaller, I think this would be great for a kid or lady to learn and play with.  For the price, it can be good cheap fun for anyone.

Comes with the ram rod, but no other accessories.

Best offer makes it move.  Email question."

""...do not expect to walk into a gun/pawn shop or gun show and think that the proprietor/dealer/collector should pay you the retail price listed within this text for your gun(s). Resale offers on many models could be anywhere from near retail to 20%-50% less than the values listed, depending upon locality, desirability, dealer inventory, and profitability.

It comes complete with the Light, an Arms Lever Mount (Quick Detach), pressure pad, BeamCover, Blue Filter, Red Filter, Beam Diffuser, IR Filter, MN10 125 Lumen Bulb, MN11 250 Lumen Bulb, Pouch, Velcro and all paperwork.  It is in great condition, but does show a few light scratches and dings.  All accessories are in good shape (most have never been used).  

There is nothing wrong with this light.  I won a new one at a recent match, and my wife is busting my balls about the sheer volume of surefire products I have laying around my house.  I've also decided to pick up a new play toy, so I'm going to throw this up for sale to offset the cost.

I'm listing it for $450 OBO, which is 60% off the retail price new.  I'd be interested in a Mossberg 930 JM Pro Signature Series shotgun in trade.  I'll add cash to make up the difference.  I'm not really interested in much else as far as trades go, but it can't hurt to ask.  That being said, ink work or stereo equipment offers will be ignored.

This thing retails new for $1100 from the surefire website.  Here's the link:

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.

 I have the original paperwork from the CMP for both of the rifles.

 I got an Anschutz 54.18 1907 so neither of these guns will get shot.  I also have another Kimber that I have customized and accurized so these are for sale.

 MORE INFO FROM KIMBER

 Top quality U.S.-made smallbore target rifles have been a scarce commodity for many years. Winchester decided in the late 1970s that annual sales of the legendary Model 52 target gun, seldom numbering in the hundreds, were insufficient to justify continued production. 

 Since then the 40X rifles made in Remington's custom shop have been the only smallbore guns made by a major U.S. manufacturer. German makers, especially Anschutz, have dominated the field. Most U.S. manufacturers have abandoned the smallbore target rifle, but a government contract helped Kimber. 

 With the help of a big U.S. government contract, Kimber of Oregon has set out to change the situation. The firm won a contract to make 20,000.22 rimfire target rifles, all capable of firing .700"" or smaller groups at 50 yds. with target ammunition. 

 With completion of government deliveries near, Kimber now is offering the gun to the civilian market. This rifle differs from the military version only in that the sight set is an optional accessory that most smallbore shooters will, no doubt, want to order with the rifle. 

 The loading platform of the singleshot Model 82 is inserted in the receiver and incorporates the ejector. The action is securely fastened to the stock by a pair of heavy screws; one through the rear of the steel trigger guard into the rear tang and the other through the handstop rail into the recoil lug. The recoil lug is dovetailed to the receiver, which is grooved to accept the rear sight. 

 Most of the Australian-made rear sight components are steel, with the housing and mounting bar made of a non-ferrous alloy. The mounting base secures to the corresponding receiver dovetail with two heavy clamping screws. The entire mounting system appears abundantly secure and allows the sight to be removed and reinstalled with minimal impact change. 

 The adjustment knobs are heavily grooved for easy turning and are located at the top and left side of the sight. Each is clearly marked for direction and scale, allowing easy return to any previous setting. The adjustments are faithful to their claimed 1/5 minute of angle (m.o.a.) increments. No backlash was n6ted. 

 The front sight is of the standard globe type and is made of a non-ferrous alloy. The 10 interchangeable inserts and the screw-in sight face and back are steel. The three post sizes and seven apertures that make up the front sight insert set seem adequate for shooting at most ranges and under varying light conditions. 

 The safety lever is typical of Kimber sporting .22s and is ""rolled"" on and off to positive stops. It cannot be applied unless the action is cocked. The bolt handle is not locked when the safety is applied. 

 The trigger assembly is fully adjustable for weight of pull, overall travel and sear engagement. The manufacturer cautions against making adjustments before reading and understanding the pertinent instructions; and then that adjustment be undertaken only by an experienced gunsmith or armorer. 

 The three trigger adjusting screws (accessible after the barrelled action has been removed from the stock) are each provided with two locking screws. An inspection port allows viewing of the sear/trigger engagement. 

 The instruction book states that rifles are shipped with triggers adjusted to a pull weight between 3.5 and 4.5 lbs., and that the trigger should not be adjusted to less than 2 lbs. Notwithstanding all that, the sample rifle tested at a very crisp 3 lbs., and no further adjustment was deemed necessary. 

 The instructions further state that the rifle should not be dry-fired, but it may be uncocked by holding the trigger to the rear as the bolt is closed. 

 The cylindrical 25"" barrel, factoryfitted with three sight bases (for scope mounts and the front sight) has a diameter of .928"". It has a 1 in 16"" righthand twist and is completely freefloated. 

 The manufacturer warns against the use of all types of Short, Long or hypervelocity cartridges. 

 Three buttstock spacers allow the length of pull to be adjusted between 117/8"" and 133/8"". The fore-end's accessory rail accepts the factory-supplied round hand stop.

Estate find in amazing condition.   Look at the condition of the bluing and the wood finish.  It it was used … it was lightly used with great care.  Just to be safe, I took this rifle to my Master Gunsmith for a safety/functions check and he gave it the green light.  All OK here.

This Browning BAR is the gold standard in deer rifles.  Browning makes many 30-06’s but note the details and compare apples to apples … this is their BAR and is marked as such on the barrel.  It is also marked “Made in Belgium.”

The scope is adjustable (3-9), makes targeting a dream and stay with the rifle.  The leather sling was also already on the weapon and transfers with it too.

Prefer FTF with required ID and formal bill of sale/transfer.  Would do an FFL through my local range/dealer at cost.

This is a great weapon and asking is under the money.  Email questions, for more pictures, or to see it yourself so that you can decide."

This is a sweet weapon … made in the USA.

Estate find … so I took it to my Master Gunsmith and paid him to go through it for a safety/functions check.  All OK here, so I tested it myself at the range.  This rifle feels like quality, is fun to shoot, and would make a great critter gun.  The 4x32 Tasco scope is nice and stop on target.

This gun is in great shape.  The collector who owned it must not have used it much at all.  Notice the bluing and the stock finish are in great shape … that is what attracted to me to it.

I ended up giving it to my father who kept it in a safe until recently.  It's a nice little EDC gun for those that want a slim single stack 9mm.  These are really hard to find (especially in this condition).
The reliable Model 908 was a compact variation of the Model 910. The Model 908's single-stack magazine gives the handgun a thin grip that's easier to grasp fully and less bulky. Smith & Wesson also gave the Model 908 a 3 1/2-inch barrel, making it extremely comfortable for all-day carry. The sighting system of the Model 908 consists of high visibility three-dot iron open sights, the go-to style for accuracy and fast target acquisition. A manual safety & de-cocking lever adds an extra level of protection and functionality to simple but modern 908. This pistol features synthetic grips and includes three 8-round magazines and the original factory carrying case with manual.

I'm willing to take offers on the price!!


WHY BUY NEW WHEN YOU CAN HAVE THE ORIGINAL!? :)
Here's a great 1995 Crosman 357 with a 6 inch barrel in REALLY NICE SHAPE, I assume it's in need of new rubber gaskets/fittings though, as an old C02 cartridge was found in it after it was sitting in non ideal conditions for an unknown period of time. They have also yellowed a bit. You should still be able to get em from crosman though. EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS GREAT! Sorry no clips/ extras, what you see is what you get.

This gun still cocks and dry fires perfectly and everything is in smooth working order. The bore seems pretty clean, I swabbed it a few times with a dry patch, but I would recommend cleaning it again. No chips on the grips or the gun itself. I cleaned/disassembled the thing from top to bottom to make note of any flaws, and found none except those noted.

Other than that, and some light surface rust/scuffs/oxidation, this is a great gun! And with a little TLC, you've got yourself a fun way to spend some free time in the fast approaching summer! And remember, I'm willing to trade! For any other info/pictures email is REDACTED, I'm an honest guy, I'll try my best to fill you in. :)

IN EXELLENT CONDITION!
This is a very early and Rare AR-15 with low 7XXX S/N (only 30.000 were made before Clinton’s 1994) = collectable. 

The rifle has all original parts. I purchased this one from the original owner. It has seen very little use. The original owner fired around 40-50 rounds while he was sighted and test-fired that rifle. He kept it unfired in excellent condition for 20+ years

Eagle Arms made some of the best pre-ban mil-spec 5.56 cal AR 15’s out there. They have forged, A2 design receivers, well finished, and very well spec'd - no different from nowadays receivers, except for the dark gray anodizing. Eagle Arms later bought out Armalite. They are still producing the top quality AR's.

Caliber: 5.56 mm NATO (not .223)
Action: Semi-Auto 
Barrel Length: 20” Gov’t Profile (not HBAR)
Barrel Twist: 1 in 7"" Rifling = will handle any ammo from 46 to 100 gr.
Receiver Finish: Original Charcoal Gray Parkerized

The rifle has original weighted A2 stock for more precise shooting. At buyer request that stock can be replaced with Black Magpul UBR Adjustable Stock for $200. The original A2 stock will be included.

Sorry, but I will ship to any a ban state where AR 15 are illegal. I feel for you guys because I live in Connecticut under NEW COMPLETE BAN. 

I will be moving to a free state and I will not have a need for this. That rifle is a good option for a MA gun-owner to have unrestricted and legal AR15.

The rifle is in CT and must go to an out-off-state FFL dealer, of course, for transfer in accordance with all applicable laws. That dealer must agree to accept that transfer. If you prefer, I will have my FFL to ship that rifle to your FFL.

No trades. I will not hold and wait. Please, leave you phone number and I will get back to you. Serious offers only. I will not answer to e-mails. Too many scams on-line."

You know who you are. You see dollar signs when you post ammo or firearms or firearm related things to sell. You charge outrageous prices on let's say ammo that will come down in price somewhat eventually. There is nothing wrong with making a profit. Don't get me wrong. But charging 400% markup on a brick of .22lr ammo? Common. Is that really fair. Put the shoe on the other foot. And then there are the jerks that put ammo up for sale but don't tell you they won't ship. Type in in the listing. It's not that hard. Then we have the ones that post ammo or related accessories, and don' t tell you that they have it listed elsewhere. You know the type. Then whey you go to send money for something you thought you had bought, you get the oh sorry, I sold it locally or I had it listed elsewhere. Let people know ahead of time. Just let people know that one, you won't ship ammo, and two, you have it listed or you have the option to sell locally. That's all you have to type in your listings. No shipping and item is for sale on multiple listings. Of course you have the real low life that agrees to sell you ammo. So you go out and get your money order ready and want to double check everything before sending it. Then the douche bag tell you oh sorry. I sold it too a friend last night. So there you are with a money order in your hand and fumes coming out of your ears. But all in all, there are more good and honest people out there that aren't trying to screw you over.

This is one of the most sought after SAA models because the .38 Special chambering was discontinued from the line in 1964. Colt SAA revolvers made in 1956 are also more desirable because it was the first year of second generation production and the hand-fit quality was the best. Colt made a total of 2,706 revolvers in .38 Special with 5 ½” barrels that year.

Positive proof that this is an original from 1956 is the low serial number (in the 5000SA range), plus the 3 digit assembly number, on the face of the cylinder, the loading gate and the rear of the frame. The revolver has a shiny bore and chambers, gently aged case colors and bright polished bluing on the barrel and cylinder. There are light scratches on the cylinder and minor bluing wear on the leading edge. The bluing is mostly worn off the front and back of the grip straps, so it won't hurt the value to shoot this one.

The action is smooth, the timing is correct, and it shoots very accurately. The photos speak for themselves, showing a used, but well-cared for shooter with blued/ color-cased frame and ivory grips.

Serious inquires only, no trades, payment by Cashier’s Check, shipped to your FFL.

Buyer also pays $30 shipping. Standard 3 day inspection (without firing) money back if returned in the exact same condition, minus shipping."

For sale I have a Norinco SKS I took on trade. I disassembled it and cleaned the barrel, receiver, and gas system. During reassembly I made sure to lubricate moving parts using either Tetra Grease, or Hoppes oil. I function tested the firearm the following day. This SKS is accurate and functions flawlessly.

Included in the sale will be the SKS, a Tapco Intrafuse stock (currently installed), a black folding stock (not sure of brand), and 500 rds of non-corrosive 7.62x39. 3 20 rd mags are also included, two metal and one plastic. The metal magazines seem to feed correctly where the plastic magazine does not seem to have the proper feed angle.

May consider trades, make me an offer. Will sell without ammo.
