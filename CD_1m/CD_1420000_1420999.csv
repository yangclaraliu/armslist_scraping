***New Gun Legislation In Rhode Island***

Chafee is announcing sweeping gun control regulations TOMORROW and it's not looking good for us, or for the Second Amendment in general. An inside source tells me that the legislation is to mirror the recently enacted (and ridiculous) Connecticut legislation, but with even further restrictions. You may not be able to get these as soon as next week.

I purchased this from Gunbroker for my now ex-girlfriend to use, and, well, she's my ex-girlfriend now. I have spent a LOT of money on this rig. Everything is brand new, and was purchased within the last month. What you get is (with what I paid in parenthesis):

Bushmaster ORC AR-15 w/Original Box - ($1499)
Low Profile Red Dot Sights - (Included)
Pro Low-Profile Bipod - ($35)
Forward Grip - ($20 - I lost a screw, easily fixed, I'm sure - I'll throw it in)
Original Bushmaster Aluminum 30 Round Magazine (Included)
Aluminum (Not plastic) Quad Rail - ($75)
(2) Thermold Polymer 20 Round Magazines - ($50)
Pillared Plano Hard Shell Case - ($40)
Aluminum (Not plastic) 45° Back Up Iron Sights - ($50)

Original Handguard is also included. It has some mars from being removed.

I have A LOT OF MONEY into this rig, and I should have thought twice before spending this kinda money on the broad. My new girl is scared to death of guns, so no go there. My loss, your gain, I guess.

I don't have any ammo for it (I already sold it), but I can steer you in the right direction to get hold of some for a decent price. Another thing you should move quickly on, as the legislation will also greatly affect how we can get ammo in the future. This gun law shit sucks. I think it's time we all moved to New Hampshire...

The rifle has never been fired. The rifle will need to be sighted as it's never left the gun safe at my old man's house since I got it. Sighting it is quick and easy to do.

I'd love to keep it, but rent is overdue, and I need the cash.

$1300 Or Best Offer. Serious buyers ONLY. Cash or USPS (Postal Service) Money Order ONLY. No trades. No deliveries.

Greetings, patriots.  Before responding to this ad I highly encourage folks to research this carbine.  This is NOT a run of the mill Yugo or Chinese SKS.  This also isn't a crime against nature... ala the dreaded duckbill SKS... that is so shamefully common to come by (what the hell is wrong with those people).  Finally, this isn't a cheap AK type conversion either, such as all the WASRs out there.  Plenty of folks are also asking plenty more for those cheaply made WASRs than I am for this quality made 7.62x39mm firearm.

This model came from the factory already manufactured to accept AK mags.  For those unfamiliar with AK type/related firearms, I ask that they read the last sentence again and realize its significance.  Year of production is 1993.  Matching serial numbers.  The fancy Monte Carlo stock is choice and rather easy on the eyes.  The 16"" chrome lined barrel has very clean and strong rifling that shines nice and mirror like (the supplied pic was the best I could do to give evidence of that; try holding a bolt back, simultaneously grasp a flashlight while keeping it lined up at the chamber, and then snap a pic... not easy).

While the ""M"" variety SKS is rare compared to the common Yugo or Chinese Type 56 (and I actually happen to dig the Type 56, unmolested that is), the MC-5D is rarer still.  This one is in excellent condition.  In my possession she has never been fired and the elderly gentleman I bought her from obviously babied her. 

Understand this, I'm not desperate to sell this piece. 

I bought this steel back when my AK mag themed armament on hand was found wanting.  I've since remedied that shortcoming.  Considering my other presently accumulated hardware, I can now stand to part with her.  If I don't, it sure doesn't hurt me to keep another quality 7.62x39 business instrument tucked away for a rainy day.  

****

Take this beauty with one steel Hungarian Tanker AK 20 rounder for $750.00 in dead presidents.

Is this your first time?   Do it right then and have some back up mags you can hunt with or... dare I even say... practice your rights as an American on American soil when traveling to lost states like Commiefornia.

Lose your cherry to a fine woman you won't regret as time passes... and take her home with all the necessary accoutrement to please her no matter what you two are in the mood for : with all other pictured mags (another steel Hungarian Tanker AK 20 rounder, one polymer 20 rounder, one polymer 10 rounder, and three steel Chinese 5 rounders, one of which found the holy spirit and rose as a 10 rounder/btw all mags have little if any wear) take her for $850.00 in dead presidents.

****

Aside from all the above, I tip my jaded hat to all my fellow patriots out there.  Know that we are legion.  Those with some salt on us know we're by no means out of the woods yet.  It's truly disturbing that there are a number of folks whom seem to think everything is all peachy now.  That is not reality.  Not by a long shot.  UBC and other sin pushed by traitors to this nation are just as much of a threat to our freedoms as the AWB.

The simple A3 upper receiver, Blackhawk Carbine Quad Rail Forend with picatinny rails, allows for the addition of almost any accessory you can imagine, although this gun has almost every accessory already. The 16"" barrel although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. And the collapsible stock makes this carbine very handy and compact.

LARGEST BLASER DEALER IN THE WORLD. ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CALL 1-480-585-5966. ALL AUCTIONS SUBJECT TO IN STORE SALES. SCHMIDT & BENDER TACTICAL SCOPES IN STOCK. FACTORY AUTHORIZED DEALER FOR BLASER-ZEISS-SCHMIDT&BENDER. The Blaser Tactical 2 is the latest, most accomplished rendering of the precision rifle developed by Blaser in cooperation with authorities. Each element is driven to supreme stability and reliability. High end accuracy was one of the principles during development. The highly stable synthetic stock and the receiver design based on one strong aluminium block holding the main parts are the essentials modules of a truly rugged rifle. Predestined for extremely rigorous use the rifle shows off its uncompromising quality. Locking system In 1993 the Blaser radial locking system made a desired dream come true: The straight, steady repetition without rotational movements of the bolt. The bolt rotation that used to be standard had often cost that vital fraction in precision. When the bolt is locked it centers automatically. The shooter is staying firmly in his aiming position. The entire operating is simple, smooth and allows more safety when shooting.. 1 Barrel and scope mount The barrel is easily exchangeable. It is fluted in order to guarantee optimum shooting characteristics. The barrel is equipped with a picatinny rail. It allows any scope to be mounted precisely and very low. 2 Receiver block The receiver block is bedding the barrel and contains the trigger assembly and the magazine. It is shaped out of one block of extremely tough aluminium alloy. This receiver is fundamental to the high durability of the Tactical 2. Thermally related tensions are impossible. 3 The synthetic stock The one-piece synthetic stock is absolutely stable in its dimensions even in extreme temperatures. Butt plate and cheekpiece are adjust­able in length and height. Butt stock Height and lateral position of the cheekpiece are fully adjustable. The butt plate is adjust­able in its vertical position. Length of pull adjustment is possible with spacer plates. Trigger The single-stage trigger is set to a weight of 1500 g at the factory. The trigger pull, the trigger position and the trigger stop are adjustable. Two-stage trigger optionally available. Magazine The magazine is easily detachable with one hand due to its convenient magazine grips. It is single-column and holds 5 cartridges. For the calibers .300 Win. Mag. and .338 Lapua Mag. it holds 4 cartridges. Locking Radial locking system with expansion sleeve. The bolt head is centering itself behind the cartridge when it is locked. The locking elements lock evenly 360°. Scope mount The scope is mounted directly on the barrel by means of the picatinny rail. Barrel finish The surface of the barrel is gas nitrated to achieve an extremely durable and easy to care for finish"

Classic Feel, Modern Design. No other 22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger® 22/45™ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol.

In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting, the 22/45 is available in a variety of configurations and barrel lengths, each with the same trusted reliability that Ruger has delivered since 1949.

This high quality Condor dual rifle case has the space to hold up to two assault rifles, shotguns or SMGs. Made with a durable nylon outer shell and thick inner foam membrane this case will keep your guns protected during transportation and storage. The case is secured with dual zippers and buckled straps.

The main 32 & 42 inch inner compartment features dual Velcro straps and end secure meant points to stabilize weapons while in transit.

The auxiliary 26 inch compartment is large enough to hold a SBR rifle, shotgun, or SMG. In the same compartment you will find two concealed inner 10.5x12 inch pouches with Velcro closers that can hold pistols, micro SMG's, magazines, or other accessories. The outside of the auxiliary compartment features a modular system: 4 rows by 7 columns of PALS webbing allowing for the attachment of any MODULAR compatible holsters, pouches and other accessories, as well as the three included pouches. Two 9x5 inch pouches and one 9x7 inch pouch are already attached. The two 9.5 inch pouches feature inner dividers and all of the pouches are expandable with drawstring cinches. On the back of the rifle case are padded backpack straps which are perfect if you need to hump your gear in a good distance. If not you can always tuck the straps away into a concealed pouch cleverly made into the back of the rifle case.
