This was the first bullpup shotgun Mossberg had ever produced & was available for civilian purchase as either a kit or as a complete gun in the mid 80's thru early 90's.
This gun is no longer being produced & quite hard to find


Holding 4+1 this is your average Mossberg 500 but factory converted by Mossberg into a bullpup form-  Used by military & law enforcement because of its compact design & awesome barrel control.
When shooting, the barrel doesn't kick up like most shotguns... instead kicks in towards the body- allowing you to stay on target thru multiple shots

I have a total of 7 boxes that I am willing to get rid of. I am contemplating dumping the Glock 30, I made the move to .40 and I am very happy. I went to Georgia Arms and picked up 1000 rounds of .40 to help make up my mind, plus my brother is begging me to sell him my Glock, so I will have to keep a few boxes for him if I sell it to him so he has some to shoot.

I saw a post where he wanted $250 for 365 rounds of a mix of ammo, so I figured $205 would be fair for 15 less rounds of fresh ammo.

$205 for all 7 boxes. I do not want to split it up."

It’s a model 1898 Krag-Jorgensen chambered in .30-40 Krag, and it’s 111 years old.  That’s the same as  Bilbo Baggins when he celebrates his eleventy-first birthday in The Lord of the Rings. That’s seven years older than the state of Oklahoma and eight years older than the Model T Ford.
Unlike tens of thousands of its unlucky brethren, my Krag somehow escaped the saws and files of the sporterizers and the choppers who are today snarkily referred to as “Bubba” by internet gunnies. But in the early days of the 20th century, surplus Krags were just old, cheap guns, almost given away by the government–they sold for as little as $1.50 through the CMP and the NRA.
A little extra cash, and a little bit of work by a gunsmith, and voila, the military-trimmed Krags became handy little deer rifles. During the lean years of the Great Depression, a cheap, easily-sporterized surplus rifle could mean the difference between eating meat and potatoes or just potatoes, especially in the rural, hardscrabble parts of America."

This is NOT one of the older series mini's that had accuracy issues (early 580-series and older models). This is a new production 582 series (Ruger re-tooled and tightened tolerances to 'better' the mini 14 around 2009, do a quick internet search if you doubt this). 

This is a great opportunity to own a nice, accurate, semi-auto that can do double-duty as home protection, and as a varmit/small game/deer rifle. New and unfired also means you don't have to wonder if it's had 10,000 rounds shot out of it.

I also have available an ATI Strikeforce tactical stock, new in box as well. Great way to turn the mini into a quick handling, easily customized weapon. $150 additional. Slap the tactical stock on for home protection - put the factory stock back on for hunting.

The Bushmaster C15 Carbines are a unique hybridization of traditional AR-15 type features with space-age Carbon 15 composite molded receivers for light weight and rugged durability. The Carbon 15's lightweight 14.5"" M4 profile barrel is made of chrome-lined chromemoly steel and includes an Izzy flash suppressor pinned and welded in place to achieve 16"" overall barrel length. The barrel and other critical steel parts are manganese-phosphate-finished for corrosion and rust protection. The Carbon 15's safety levers have color-coded markings on both sides of the receiver for quick visual check of firing condition. Package includes a 30-round .223 Remington magazine and a Red Dot Sight."

M48 Mauser Description:
""Some people may be getting the mistaken impression that these rifles were manufactured by Germans during the occupation. That is not the case. These rifles were manufactured with German technology in Serbia after the people had driven the Germans out of Yugoslavia.This is an important distinction, because that is one of the reasons why the Model 48 is recognized as an excellent example of the K98 type military rifle. The factory in Serbia was not bombed, like the German factories during the war. The factory in Serbia had a good supply of raw materials. And the Model 48 was produced by free people, instead of forced labor. All of which resualted in an excellent rifle in its own right, as well as an interesting piece of history."" -Mitchell's Mausers

New in box.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

New from SIG SAUER®, the P938 SAS. The pistol has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that’s ideal for concealed carry. It’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. The P938 SAS is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with custom wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights. The new SIG SAUER P938 SAS is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.

The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar. The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed. The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.

The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes. The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location. The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip. The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories. The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts. It comes in Black and ""BONZ"" camo versions and is reasonably priced for our distributors and customers alike.

Saiga 12g shotgun, stock preferred. Unless you had the conversion done professionally or you’re a great craftsman. There are a ton of these floating around with horrible chop job conversions that look like Flag this Ad for Removal!!!!! . If you don’t have at least a $20 adjustable gas plug on your gun, you know nothing about proper modifications. That cheap UTG quad rail and fore grip don’t make your gun worth an extra $500 dollars.


Glock Gen 4 in either 17 or 22. Night sights are preferred.


Springfield XDs .45


S&W 500es 2 ¾’’ barrel or the 460es. I don’t want any other one so please don’t email me about your 4’’-10+’’ barrel.


When writing, please tell me the condition of the firearm(high resolution photos are even better!), approximate amount of rounds fired, any magazines, holsters and anything else that is pertinent to the sale as well as the asking price. I am not interested in anything on else unless you want to sell me something for 50% of what I could sell it for on gunbroker.


I am a cash buyer. I have crisp $100 dollar bills ready to go. Local sale only please. I won’t do any type of shipping unless you want to send me the gun first. There are way too many scammers out there."
