Here is a little factory information about the PT101:

In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 101. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this model a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 101 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise."

Cheapest I have seen online is 80. Willing to let it go for 55.

NcStar Sniper Scope/Red Dot Combo Mark III Tactical 3-9x42 Illuminated Reticle
New in box, this scope costs 170 new at least. I will sell it for 145.
Reticle has the option for off like a normal scope, or on with your choice of color, red or green.
This scope is tons of fun for an AR style gun. Looks amazing on them and works fantastic. Go from long range sniper shots to up close CQ without having to change your optic. 

I am firm on these prices. If I don't sell them I will keep them. They are excellent scopes for the money and brand new. I will have something to mount them on eventually. If you want to trade I might be interested, just let me know what you have. Money included either way if needed depending on the trade.  The things I can think of off hand that I would definitely be interested in is some type of Night Vision scope, .223/5.56 ammo, .308 ammo, .22lr ammo, .45 ACP ammo, FN metric mags, Aimpoint Red Dot, or any Sig handguns (not the mosquito, real sigs). Any other trades you may have throw my way and what cash would be needed if any. I'm always looking for new stuff =)

btw: Ammo is something I am not desperate for. I will not pay or trade for ammo at panic prices. i.e. .223 ammo is NOT  worth a buck a round. To ME it is worth .35 cents per round. I might pay/trade .40 cents per round if its something i really want.

Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 2 boxes available (100 rounds total). Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly.

The rifling is sharp and well defined, looking almost new (don't know how it could look better honestly).

I'll include 60rds of .308 TulAmmo if you want it(disclaimer: the receiver is marked .308 but some people swear up and down you should only shoot 7.62x51 through these; many many people shoot .308s through Ishapores without issue, but caveat emptor). 

Alright; I've got to replace the windshield on my car and it's $230. To even out the cost, I just want to sell this ASAP for $230. 

Live in Monroe, will be in Kings Mountain this weekend, and can meet anywhere in between. Thanks guys."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

Brand NIB, Revolver, 6 Shot Western style single action revolver .22 LR caliber , w/ 6.5 "" BBL by Heritage Arms.  Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version.  Chambered for the .22 LR cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability.  The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.  

The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance.  A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action.  A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome.  There are other grip materials available.

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting.  Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

Here is detailed description from manufacturer site:

The MK1 series, developed by Primary Weapons Systems, is a significant product improvement for the M4/M16-type carbines and rifles. Utilizing our proven long stroke piston system, the MK1 series greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon making it as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after. 

The MK1 series has been used in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has gained wide popularity with security personnel, law enforcement and civilians alike. 

The origins of the MK1 series began with the fascination in the simplicity and reliability of the AK47 combined with a deep-rooted appreciation for the ergonomics of the M4/M16 platform. Having a significant understanding of the deficiencies in the direct gas impingement operating system found on conventional M4/M16-style weapons, PWS developed the MK1 series with the professional in mind. 

Significant improvements have been made over both the direct gas impingement operating system and previous offerings of piston-driven operating systems. The product improvements made by PWS have addressed reliability and performance issues as well as reduced carrier tilt, cam pin wear and carrier bounce. In addition, we have one of the lightest systems on the market today! 

An innovative hand guard system utilizes a proprietary non-free float system that allows the end user or unit armorer to replace individual rails as needed without removing the barrel, barrel nut or even other rails. This system allows the user to attach numerous Picatinny rail-mounted devices such as sights, lights, and laser aiming devices. 

The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available.

It does not have a butt plate but the guy that I got it from showed me video of him shooting it with open sites at 150 yards and was shooting 3 inch groups.  He used it for deer hunting in Missouri.  It comes with 39 rounds of British 303 bullets.  It would make a great hunting or collectible rifle.  Three19-360-2286
