Pulsar Digisight N550 Digital Night Vision Riflescope 76316 lets you set your sights on darkened targets. This versatile digital night vision scope from Pulsar combines a Night Vision scope with a digital Rifle Scope in a single package. The Pulsar Digital Riflescope features a built-in Infrared Illuminator to supplement low natural light levels. The rifle scope optics system employs an internal focusing mechanism (from 5 yards to infinity) with click-stop focus positions. The focusing system of the Pulsar Rifle Scope provides clear images at extremely short distances and optimizes image quality at all distances within the working range of the night scope. Windage and elevation adjustments are handled with a single knob, which switches between modes by pressing a nearby button. A 7/8"" Weaver scope mount rail allows you to attach additional accessories. The lens cap is permanently attached and flips up easily, sitting flush to the night rifle scope body.

The digital rifle scope and the built-in infrared light are activated by a gradual turning of the selector switch. The digital controls of the Pulsar Digisight Digital Nightvision Rifle Scope are easy and intuitive. The Main Menu controls the brightness of the targeting reticule, the choice of reticle shapes and allows you to set a custom running time. 

Several operating modes are available to the user:
Contrast mode - for sharp contrast increase
Color mode - successive change of the LCD display's illumination color
Sum Light mode - activates sensitivity enhancement algorithm

A Brightness Adjustment Wheel allows you to control the brightness of the screen's glow to preserve your night vision, and the inversion button allows an instant color of the aiming reticle from black to white. The choice of reticle color is subject to the target's brightness.

The Pulsar Digisight Night Rifle Scope is equipped with an external video socket for connection of video recording or playback sources. Pressing a button switches the unit from VIDEO IN to VIDEO OUT mode. A mini-USB slot allows the rifle scope to be connected to a personal computer. Users can upload additional aiming reticles, including custom user-created target reticles. Most functions of the illuminated scope can also be operated with a remote control unit.

The scope has been mounted but never got the chance to take it out. It is in like new condition or as close to new as it gets. Comes with original box, carry case, a CD, and all original paper work that came with it. 

I'm selling this and my Bushmaster BR308 rifle which the scope is currently mounted on.  I will sell them separately or as a combo pack. 

I'm asking $1,200.00 for this scope. Asking $1,200.00 for the rifle and $2,300.00 if purchased together.

I would consider selling the gun only for the right price. I am selling because I have only shot it 4-5 times since I have owned it and its just sitting in a case not getting used. I am asking 1700 OBO for everything but if you have cash make me an offer the worst I can say is no.

Manufacturer’s description follows:

The new M6-SL is a replacement of our base model M6 rifle of old. The SL, which stands for 'stretch-lightweight', incoroprates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifle. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date.

The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight.

The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated one-piece bolt carrier and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a Daniel Defense A1.5 fixed rear sight and a fixed A2 front sight post.

The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry-level price.

I have used for plinking and hunting jack rabbit with great success. The gun is very accurate. It is also a good self defense weapon that is easily concealed and has no hammer to hang up as you withdraw it and it is very compact. It comes in it's original box with all the original booklet and adjusting tool. I will also include a black shoulder holster OR a camo tactical holster with leg strap. Buyer is solely responsible for knowing the gun laws in their State.I will Not ship firearms to Maryland or New York State. This hand gun is NOT LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA. I need to know the name of the FFL DEALER you plan on using to do the transfer for you. This models feature sleek lines and a scratch resistant, non-glare military black finish with high impact grips. The polymer frame used on the 9mm compact offers the shooter several advantages. First, it will decrease the weight of the weapon. Secondly, the forgiving nature of the polymer will decrease the felt recoil when firing the weapon. The polymer frame that is used by Hi-Point is a very high tech, durable material that will serve the shooter for decades to come. I will ship by ground for a flat fee of $20.00 to an FFL dealer only."

Chinese type 53, which is the most crude and cheapest clone of the Russian M-44 goes for the below listed prices:

In a gun store: around $100
At a gun show: around $65

880 rounds of 7.62x54r on luckygunner.com(in stock) $230

So an asking price of $400 is about $70 over the high end of what this is worth.  Not to mention that the gun has never been fired!!! Except by a gun store(which is in the business of making money).  So it could likely need repairs.

This person believes that gun are worth what people are willing to pay, if this thought process were true then why is there the Blue Book of Gun Values?  Oh, I almost forgot, the numbers don't match either with really drops the value.

FLAG ADS ASKING OVER THE TRUE VALUE OF A FIREARM!!!
*****Update*****

Again people do your research:
1. These rifles come with the sling
2.  Most of us can get ammo cans for free(I get them all the time). If you want one and I have extra email me and I will give you one for FREE.
3.  Tax and Background check fee are the original buyers problem.  A private party sale is not subject to these so sellers should not expect to recoup these fee.

Also I offered the man $300 which is based off of fair market value and now he is angry and will not leave me alone.  I have told him ""Good Day"" multiple times to end the conversation but he persists to harrass me.  He is basically demanding that I prove to him what the value of this rifle is, isn't that something you should do before you decide to sell something?  Save yourself the time and trouble, but a rifle from someone respectable."

I bought in bulk a while ago with the intention of shooting  100+ rounds a week, then I realized shooing a subcompact in abundance is not overly enjoyable. So I have been going through it much slower. The ammo is reloaded (by my self personally) I have two different loaings (see below) these loads are both safely below Alliant's recommended load of 5.8 grains (http://www.alliantpowder.com/reloaders/default.aspx).

- 1000 rounds  with a .30 cal ammo can $400 (will not divide)
(Load is 5.6 grains of Alliant Unique Powder, a Remington 1 1/2 small pistol primer, with a Precision Delta 124 grain bullet, and mixed brass, this is my practice load to mimic 124 Federal Hydra-shocks)

- 100 rounds (loose) $45 per hundred (5 available)
(Load is 5.3 grains of Alliant Unique Powder, a Remington 1 1/2 small pistol primer, with a Precision Delta 124 grain bullet, and mixed brass, still a full power load just a little easier on the wrist). Pictures shows plastic box but that is not included.

Both loads cycle my LC9 without issue as well as various friends 9mms. 

If you buy the ammo can and want some additional 100 round lots I will give you them for  the same price of $40/100 as the can. My prices are fair so I will not lower them.

For sale is a LNIB Savage Mark II. It is in perfect condition and includes all of the original packaging and documentation (it has had - no exaggeration - exactly 20 rounds through it). Note that this is not the de-contented Wal-Mart Mark II; it has the two-stage accu-trigger and the factory sling mounts.

It also includes the following:

    Extra 10 round mag
    Weaver scope mounts, unused and in original packaging
    80 rounds of CCI Stinger (which according to Cheaper Than Dirt is now worth $804,723.42 alone)

The manufacturer's page for this model is:

http://www.savagearms.com/firearms/model/MARKIIG

(If you're wondering why we have a gun with only 20 rounds through it, the story is this: the wife wanted a bolt-action gun, so she bought this and started shooting it. Then a few weeks later she bought a 91/30. After shooting the 91/30, she wouldn't even acknowledge the poor Savage's existence. And then it sat in the safe, lonely and neglected until today.)

Price for all is $195 FTF in Charlotte with a NC DL and Bill of Sale.  Thanks for looking."

$550 for whole case, willing to negotiate/separate boxes if you can convince me to.

Because this is rifle ammo, must be 18 yrs old to purchase and must be able to prove it via government issued ID.
I reserve the right to refuse to sell this to anyone for any reason.
Prefer a local sale but contact me if you're a little further than reasonable driving distance.

I am cleaning out my shooting supplies and found some 223 ammo I loaded a while back. I have since switched to heavier 68-77 grain bullets (I have a 1/8"" barrel). This ammo was just intended for plinking for fun but is still pretty accurate (1"" or so offhand at 50 yards, last time I shot it). It is loaded with mixed brass, Winchester Small Rifle Primer, 25.5 +/- 0.2 grains of Winchester 748 Powder, and military 62 grain green tip bullets (paint has all wore off from storage). 

The price is pretty firm. If I sell it I sell it, if not I'm sure my Fiancee would be happy to shoot it up for me. I live in Kaukauna and work on the west side of Green Bay. If you want me to bring the ammo to Green Bay please try to let me know by 7PM the night before."

It is in new condition and comes with rings setup for a rail type mounting system. It's fitted with a Reticle 8 but can be changed out for others that are offered by Zeiss. This scope comes with a $2000 tag retail but I can't find the box and it has been mounted so I'm bringing the price down to other ""used"" scopes. There is a benefit to already having the rings if you plan on using a rail system like I did. If interested let me know if you want the rails as well if they will work on your rifle, no problem. Price is always negotiable but I'm not in a hurry so let's see if we can make it work.

RJ Martin’s blade design and grind gives you the piercing power of a tanto with just enough curve to the belly for slicing aptitude as well. The tanto point is even stronger than comparable tantos because Kershaw makes the tip thicker and gives it a tough flat grind. The result is an über-strong tip that takes on the toughest piercing tasks with no fear. But the RJ II isn’t done yet.

This knife offers a full range of cutting edges. The plain edge is ever so slightly curved, giving the RJ II slicing capability—something not all tanto blades offer. In addition, the blade is partially serrated to make cutting through tough or fibrous materials a breeze. The blade is made of 8Cr13MoV stainless steel that’s tough, wear resistant, and takes a keen edge. For a distinctive look and enhanced performance, the blade is coated with titanium carbo-nitride.

The RJ II also features 3-D machined G-10 handle scales and a secure stainless-steel locking liner. It opens with one-handed ease thanks to the SpeedSafe assisted opening system. Access it with the built-in flipper or thumbstud. The pocketclip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry. Tactical looks and a multifunctional blade combine in the RJ II—also available in a larger size as the RJ I.

 Technical Specifications
•2-Step Serration
Serrations assist in cutting through particularly tough or fibrous material, such as rope or cord. The Kershaw 2-step serration is a more aggressive style of serration.

•Flipper
May be used on either manual or assisted opening knives. The “flipper” is a protrusion on the back of the blade that the user can pull back on, or flip, in order to move the blade easily out of the handle.

•SpeedSafe®
Assists you to open any SpeedSafe® knife quickly and easily with a manual push on the thumbstud or pull back on the flipper; built into many Kershaw best sellers.

•Liner Lock
Locks the blade open during use; one side of the knife’s steel “liner,” the steel plate to which the handle scales are attached, moves into position behind the blade to securely lock it open.

•Reversible
Pre-drilled holes in the handle enable the user to change either the tip position or the side on which the knife carries.

I might be interested in trades, but NOT something that would qualify as another project .
-First is a Marlin Mod. 1897, 22 lever action, ser. # 241XXX. It's got an octagon bbl, with a rough bore (strong rifling). It needs an extractor, has no butt plate, and a thin crack in the bottom of the forend. Feeds and fires o.k, but obviously doesn't extract.
-Second is a Win. Mod. 1906, 22 pump, ser. #294XXX. This one has a really nice bore. It needs a carrier and a proper take down screw. The T.D. screw that's in it is not original and a poor fit. I have single loaded it and it chambered, fired , and extracted fine, but a carrier will make it a repeater again. Wood and metal on both are not great, but not terrible either. As stated I bought these as project guns.
I'd like $175.00 each for them + $15.00 mailing OR take both for $325.00 and I'll ship on my dime OR trade for ???

I am listing this here because when I talked online with several others about the house of horrors called Idlewild Doberman Kennel it was mentioned he also ran some kind of hunting club at the same location. One person I chatted with had been there and said this guys “kennel” is just one corner of his garage and that she could smell it from the driveway and she almost threw up when she entered it. That explains why my poor baby girl arrived with the skin conditions she had and smelling like an indoor pig farm in summer, and a blood disease.

Check it out for yourself before he deletes it, go to his pup page and scroll down, his red male that he was selling litters from that was supposedly tied to all kinds of Champion bloodlines and that he claims had all these high dollar DNA and medical tests supposedly done before being bred passed away last fall at FIVE years old !

Para‘s 1911 LTC 9mm pistol incorporates many desirable features of the original Colt Commander, plus a few ideas of its own. An alloy frame keeps weight down to a very manageable 28 oz. A ramp match-grade barrel measures out at 4.25"" - long enough for the 9mm cartridge to reach its full potential.

Metal surfaces on the LTC are coated with Para’s non-reflective Covert Black finish. This finish not only casts a very business-like appearance, but also stands up well against the elements. For positive manipulation, the slide features six deep diagonal grooves. Other key features include a flat, checkered mainspring housing and a beavertail grip safety. A single-side, frame-mounted safety is standard. Instead of the usual plug guide, Para went with a full-length recoil spring guide rod on the LTC 9mm.

Just back from Para USA where it received a factory upgrade to the extractor. With very few rounds fired and now cleaned, lubed, adjusted, and upgraded by the manufacturer, this is probably as close to new as a used pistol can be. 

Standard features 
Wooden Para Grips, Two Para Mags, Case, Manual, and Bushing Wrench.

* Reliability and trigger job by Tony Barnes of Brownells
* Fiber Optic Sights (front and rear, with dovetails cut and sighting-in also by Tony)

This is a very lightly used optic with no visible scratches or scuffs.  I took it off my AR-15 when i decided to do long distance shooting asking 430.00 obo.  This optic retails for 519.00 plus tax. Below is some information regarding this specific optic. My name is JoshREDACTED


Smaller and lighter than other holographic weapon sights, the EOTech XPS2-0 is an ideal compact option for your weapon platform. The XPS2-0 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
The XPS2-0 runs on a single 123 battery, making it small enough to leave plenty of rail space for rear iron sights, magnifiers, and other tools (the shortened base requires 2.75 inches of rail space maximum). EOTech also eliminated the battery cap and latch and replaced them with a simple O-ring tethered cap, helping the sight achieve better sealing. Note that the XPS2 is not night vision compatible.

Product Description
This sight is smaller than the former N-cell battery sight and runs on a single 123 battery. It also has a longer battery life than the N-cell style sights. Smaller, lighter and always fast with three reticle options. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights or NV mount.- Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length - Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space compared to the 4 inch N battery sights - Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved - Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to hover over the delta ring of the rifle - Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, 3X battery life of N cell sights - Reticle: 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot."

I have a Like New FNH FNP 45 Black Tactical for sale. I only shot 3 mags through this pistol and it was cleaned and put in the safe. There is not a mark on this gun. It is mint. If I didn't say it was used you would think it was new. 

These 45's have less felt recoil than a 45 from other manufacturers. The recoil is more like a 40 cal. Comes with everything that it came with from factory. 3- 15 rnd mags, padded tactical case, changeable back straps, manual, spent casing from factory, lock, etc.  Also comes with a NEW tactical FNH holster with 4 mag pouches and 2 New additional 15 rnd mags for a total of 5 mags that will all fit in the tactical holster and gun. This is as complete of a package you will ever find with just one purchase.

IL residents must have a valid FOID card.

$1125 Cash for gun without extra mags and holster.

I will not bother posting specs as they are easily found on Bravo Company’s website. If you are looking at this, you probably already know the specs.

The barrel has not been pinned so NFA rules apply. As noted it will include the Phantom flash suppressor if you want to have it pinned. If you want me to ship it to Adco or somewhere else to have it pinned, instead of you first, I will.

The master blade is stamped CASE XX only and that is all the numbers I can find on the knife. Knife is about 3 7/8'' long when closed. I looked up this type of knife in a book and it told me it was original made between 1940 and 1964 and could be worth as much as $600.00 if it was mint. No it's not mint but it sure gooks good.I want $75.00 cash or I am willing to trade it to a handgun of equal value. Knife is located in Lafayette Tennessee. Please call or text me at 1-REDACTED

From Sig: 
THE P238 GAMBLER, features the dead man’s hand, a two-pair hand, namely “aces and eights” gets its name from a legend that it was the five-card-draw hand held by Wild Bill Hickok, when he was murdered in 1876, at Deadwood, South Dakota. Since its introduction in 2009 the P238 has redefined the role of a .380 ACP caliber pistol for personal protection. The “Gambler” edition, will be available for a short time in limited quantities. The “Gambler” features a rendering of the dead mans hand in 24K selective gold inlay. The text “The Gambler”, name adorns right side of the slide.

The bike has 43k miles and is in pretty good shape mechanically with the carbs cleaned and synced, new spark plugs, new fork seals, new brake pads,  and a rebuilt starter all done this spring, and a new Interstate AGM battery installed this March.  Had a fresh oil change on 6/7.  CLean title ready to go.  Only thing I can say against it is that the speedometer is broken, but I've been using the tachometer to judge my speed without any problems.  Universal speedometers can be had for around $20, just hasnt been a concern to me.  These older Japanese bikes are also very inexpensive to insure, I paid only $150 for a full year of coverage.
I've been using it primarily as a commuter, gets a pretty consistent combined city/highway mpg of 40mpg, better if you do mostly highway riding.  Pulls hard and is very quick for ""just"" a 700cc, manufacturer's specs say these bikes put out 85hp.  I'm just looking to upgrade to a bigger bike as I'm wanting to do some touring this year.

I'll consider partial or possibly full trades on firearms for it.  Primarily interested in American or European made 1911's, glocks, and xd's.  No tauruses, hi-points or kel tecs, already have some of each.
I'm looking to sell/trade it for another motorcycle though, so I would trade for an 800cc or up cruiser or 500cc and up sportbike, though I'm more interested in cruisers.  Can add cash or some firearms of my own to even out a trade.
If you're just interested in buying it I'm asking $1300 for it.

I'm a motivated trader/seller, feel free to let me know what you have, the worst I can say is no!
