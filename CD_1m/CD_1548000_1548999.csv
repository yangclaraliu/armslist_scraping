The original bluing is perfect on the barrel and the original reddish tone on the action is also perfect. The serial number 8303 makes it... damn old. The number on the fore stock matches the serial number on the bottom of the trigger guard. It sat untouched in my dear departed dad's gun case for forty years. 
I refinished the furniture with dark walnut stain and 11 hand rubbed and sanded coats of poly. It's like looking in a mirror and it feels REAL good. This isn't the finish that was used on the original piece but it is a heck of a lot more durable.
The only new part is a correct reproduction Iver Johnson butt plate. I will include the banged up original piece and a second spare. There is a small slice of wood that had broken off from the top of the grip next to the tang sometime in the last century. (see bottom photo). I sanded the area down and continued with the refinishing.
This old shotgun was COMPLETELY dismantled, cleaned, lubed and reassembled. Lock up is real tight. 
Comes with two full boxes of new modern Federal Game Shok, 1165 fps, 2 3/4"", #6 16 gauge shells. This old shotgun may need lower velocity shells.
$250.00. For sale only. I am not entertaining trades.

An anti-gun bill that will criminalize the private transfer of handguns and certain semi-automatic rifles at gun shows will likely be heard this week or next in the House Rules Committee.  House File 285, introduced by state Representative John Lesch (DFL-66B), passed in the House Public Safety, Finance and Policy Committee by a 10 to 8 vote on April 8 after being amended to include a ban on private sales.  If HF 285 passes in the House Rules Committee, it will be eligible for final consideration on the House floor as early as this week.

This type of legislation is dangerous and must be stopped, as this scheme is the first step towards criminalizing ALL private transfers and can only be enforced with gun registration.  And, as we know from experiences in California, Australia and Great Britain, gun registration enables gun confiscation — only from honest citizens — since criminals do not register their guns or submit to criminal investigations.  According to an internal U.S. Department of Justice memorandum, ""universal"" background checks will not work without requiring gun registration.  Read the memo and get the facts here.

Please contact your state Representative and members of the House Rules Committee today and demand that they OPPOSE HF 285 in its entirety.

An anti-gun bill that will criminalize the private transfer of handguns and certain semi-automatic rifles at gun shows will likely be heard this week or next in the House Rules Committee.  House File 285, introduced by state Representative John Lesch (DFL-66B), passed in the House Public Safety, Finance and Policy Committee by a 10 to 8 vote on April 8 after being amended to include a ban on private sales.  If HF 285 passes in the House Rules Committee, it will be eligible for final consideration on the House floor as early as this week.

This type of legislation is dangerous and must be stopped, as this scheme is the first step towards criminalizing ALL private transfers and can only be enforced with gun registration.  And, as we know from experiences in California, Australia and Great Britain, gun registration enables gun confiscation — only from honest citizens — since criminals do not register their guns or submit to criminal investigations.  According to an internal U.S. Department of Justice memorandum, ""universal"" background checks will not work without requiring gun registration.  Read the memo and get the facts here.

Please contact your state Representative and members of the House Rules Committee today and demand that they OPPOSE HF 285 in its entirety.

A complete, comprehensive course, as only the NRA could create! This private lesson, up to three students, should last about four hours. I will not leave until you or your group have successfully demonstrated that you could load a cartridge safely. 
My specialty is pistol cartridges, but rifle is not much different. I have no experience with shot shell reloading. I do have much to offer, drawing on my own experience and background. I won't just be reading the script!

I am looking for a ""Field & Security"" combo shotgun.  I am not picky about the type.  I would prefer something along the inexpensive side like a Stephens 320 Combo with the 18""/28"" barrels.

But, I'd settle for any sort of Mossberg or Remington combo, or actually any type at all.

If you currently own one of these types of shotguns, and if you consider it to be in pretty good condition, and if you'd even remotely CONSIDER selling it, I'd like to talk to you by telephone or by email.  Please contact me here through Armslist and we'll figure it out.  

I am very optimistic that if we talk that we can work something out.

Maybe about a brick through it altogether, in great shape. Only selling because I just bought a dedicated 22lr upper, so I don't really need this one too. 

$530. May be interested in pistol trades if the trade wows me, mostly I like 9mm. Would also be interested in ammo, 22lr, 223, 9mm, brass factory ammo only and not at idiot prices, I'm still getting all three calibers at retail prices, so I'm not going to give you crazy value for yours in trade.

The rifle fires great, is in like new condition, and is incredibly accurate. The proprietary Melonite treatment to the inside and outside of the barrel has shown to be superior than chrome lined barrels with regards barrel life and accuracy, some have even reported increased velocity due to a much lower coefficient of friction and the lack of material deposit inconsistencies that the chrome lining processes produces. Since I have only put 300 rounds down range, this barrel has a lot of life left and I have had no failures to feed, fire, or eject. I will include 2 PMAGS with the rifle and have extras if you need them.

Owner of Buffalo Bore Tim Sundles on 380 +P Ammunition:

The 380 auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 380 auto suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and played with nearly all of the existing available 380 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense.
This 380 Auto+P ammo will better all American made 380 Auto ammo by 150 fps to 200 fps in all bullet weights we make. This is a serious improvement in this typically anemic cartridge. This 380 auto+P ammo is more powerful than the typical 38SPL ammo made by most American ammo makers and you'll get 7 shots of it in a small/flat/light weight 380 versus 5 shots out of a bulkier 38 SPL J frame revolver. Additionally, with the 380 you'll get much faster reloads and the little magazines are flatter than a speed-loader used for a J frame."

6- .223 shells ready for powder (same as above)

24- Winchester .224, 55 grain, soft tip projectiles

141- CCI 500 small pistol primers

""The R100 is a rendition of the M1911A1 that is visually faithful to the original design. It has a spur hammer, M1911A1-style grip safety, and arched mainspring housing. Offered in .45 ACP only, the R100 has a matte-black finish and comes standard with Hogue® rubber grips. The slide is manufactured from CNC machined bar stock with a low-cut ejection port, the frame is steel investment cast, and the barrel is hammer forged stainless steel—all manufactured to ISO 9001 and NATO AQAP 120 quality standards.

The Regent R100 accepts virtually all aftermarket parts made for M1911-style pistols, giving you the ability to customize your pistol. Also, almost all aftermarket accessories designed for M1911-styles can be added, whether it be specialized custom grips, added sights, tactical enhancements, or other customizations."""

944,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1548944,For Sale/Trade:  Modified Original Xbox w/ Loads of Installed Games + Extras,"Altoona, Eau Claire, Wisconsin",$ 75,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 1, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Looking to sell my fun little toy; a modified original Xbox (i.e. NOT AN XBOX 360). It has a different operating system on it alongside the standard Xbox OS, so not only can you use it as a normal Xbox and play games from disk, but it has some extra features that make it pretty sweet. The original Xbox harddrive has been replaced by what I believe is a 300gb IDE PC harddrive, giving this thing a ton of storage. On top of that, you can even connect it via an FTP server to access videos, pictures, music, etc. that is stored on your computer on the Xbox, making this thing essentially a media PC along with being a gaming console. The real bread & butter of this, however, is the fact that it has a TON of games preinstalled on the Xbox itself that can be played just like a normal Xbox game. I will include a list of all the games on the bottom of this post, it is ridiculous. On top of that, it has a couple different emulators on it that I have never really played around with. It comes with the console itself, one power cable, one RCA (red/yellow/white) cable, and one Logitech wireless controller w/ the dongle for the console. I am honestly not in a hurry to sell this, since it's got a lot of awesome games on it and honestly is pretty rare to find these days, since finding the modchips and whatnot to do this is pretty difficult. I would be willing to let it go for $75 cash or a good trade though. I am willing to meet in the Altoona/Eau Claire area, but no shipping.

Seriously, go to either West Coast Armory in Everett or Bellevue and get yourself 4 boxes of Magtech 9mm 50 rounds at 16.99 each. Last time I check they allow you to take 4 boxes per day. That's 200 rounds. 

Math:
$16.99 + tax = $18.60 per box of 50 (.37/round)

50 Rounds  = $18.60 
100 Rounds  = $37.20
200 Rounds  = $74.40

1000 Rounds = $372

See? Compare these prices with the gougers. They are charging 300 bucks for 500 rounds? Unbelievable. 

I ask all of you please do the following.
1. List up on Armslist the prices you've seen at your local gun shops the price of ammo and please keep updating it. Put the Price/Round on the title so we can compare.
