READ and HEED the warning on the back of the box.  This is very high power ammo.  For liability reasons, Winchester trys to sell it only to law enforcement.  Some of it finds its way into the free market anyway.  It is perfectly legal for non-law enforcement - Winchester just doesn't like it.  Apparently they think you are not smart enough to be trusted with it.  Do not shoot this +P+ ammunition from Aluminum Revolvers!

Comes with 2 factory 10 round mags and 2 aftermarket 13 round mags all fit flush. This is a great shooting .380 no longer available for purchase here in the US. Also included are all items included in original case: blue plastic factory case itself, grey cardboard outer factory case, lock, manuals, 2 cleaning brushes, parts cup. I am also tossing in 50 rounds of .380 Magtech jacketed hollow points and 110 rounds of FMJ target rounds. 100 of the FMJs are reloads (none were ever fired in this gun, just bought to have due to ammo shortage in case I felt the need to take it to the range but never did) the other 10 are S&B factory rounds I had laying around for years.

These sell online with 2 mags and no ammo for $850+ in worse condition. Take this chance to own a unique firearm no longer available and the best .380 I have ever fired! 

Price is firm lowballs will be ignored. I have no problem keeping this pistol or selling via online auction if need be. Buyer must have valid Indiana ID, license to carry, and sign bill of sale, or meet at local gun shop to fill out 4473 form for transfer of ownership ($20 expense to buyer)."

As can be seen by the photos, this is a pretty little 22.  This was a project rifle intended for use by my kids and I ended up with a little pink cricket rifle instead.  This rifle has a refinished stock and fore arm as well as a refinished and sealed receiver.  The receiver is dovetailed for scope mounts and the rifle has a tube fed magazine.  I purchased a brand new inner tubular magazine tube for this rifle and it provides reliable feeding.  Like so many of these older 22's the barrel has an extremely slight barrel bulge near the muzzle (which doesn't affect its shoot-ability or accuracy in the least bit).  This would be a great starter rifle as it has buckhorn style open sights and a dovetailed receiver for scope mounting and is very light weight.  The rifle is in great working order and ready for its next owner.  I also have a rather beat up 4X Tasco Scope made in Japan (back when the glass was the same as Bausch and Lomb).  Glass is exceptionally clear for its age.

Saiga 12 smoothbore autoloading shotgun is designed for tactical professionals and sport hunters alike. It is perfect for police and military operations, as well as taking small and medium-sized game in all weather conditions.

Some of the buffer tube had been filed to ""fit"" the rifle (this was not necessary, but has never been a problem to me). It fits in the receiver, but you can always swap it out later if you wish.

About 6,000 of these pistols were manufactured. This particular pistol was manufactured by Henry Aston of Middletown, Connecticut in 1852. .54 caliber smooth bore barrel that is 8 1/2"" long. Has original brass blade front sight. Swivel steel ramrod that is threaded on the end is in excellent condition. Original brass mountings have nice patina. Lock plate is marked ""U.S./H. ASTON & CO."" in front of the hammer and vertically stamped ""MIDDTN/CONN/1852"" to the rear of the hammer. The trigger on these Model 1842s was the only component blued and this trigger still amazingly shows considerable original blue finish. Hammer spring is still strong and pistol is fully functional in half and full cock. Stock is in excellent condition with strong and crisp WAT and JCB cartouches. WAT cartouche is that of Captain William Anderson Thornton of the US Ordnance Department, who worked inspecting arms from 1840 until 1866. The JCB cartouche is for Lieutenant John C. Beaumont who was a pistol inspector in the early 1850s. Barrel tang is dated ""1852"" and is marked ""US/W.N/P"" on the left side of the barrel. There is pitting on the top of the barrel near the nipple. Nipple is some corrosion but still appears functional. This is a very fine example of a US Model 1842 Pistol that was in use prior to the Civil War. This pistol is an antique so it can be shipped to anyone.

The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13"" length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4"" - 14.5"" LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. 
The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. 
Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine.

The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.

He ,and his donation post have fooled some people,but not all!  
Michael Frank aka 22ammo.net has been banned from purchasing ammunition at Shooters Outpost in Hooksett and also from advertising on northeastshooters .com and other popular sites to include AKFILES.

He is NOT a  Non profit with the State of NH - but claims all profits go to the same.
It is suspected that he's using NH Camps to look like he's legit, but there is no accountability with the funds he has collected.

He claims to purchase ammunition for the summer camps that is hard to get (mostly .22) but is selling the same hard to get ammunition to include .22 to get more for the camps.

When asked why he's selling items and cash that were donated by others for summer camps, he claims that he's doing nothing wrong. When I Informed him that he should be a legal non profit to raise the funds and have them accountable, he said that he knows what he's doing isn't the right way,but he doesn't care because he gave some to camps and can prove it.
Problem is: How much was donated vs how much was taken in.

He spent the day protesting in front of Shooters Outpost to get others to listen to his nonsense, only to make his cause much less credible.

Bottom line: Please donate directly to a charity of your choice, and put Mr. Frank and other suspected scammers out of business."

This comes with the original box, book, lock, two 15rd mags and one 10rd mag. It was a promo gun of some kind, so the original box is cardboard and not the typical plastic HK box. I meticulously maintain my guns and this one is no exception. It's in excellent condition. I never carried it, so there is no holster wear. It was only a range toy and a way to train with the same platform as my USP .45 with less expensive ammo. The only reason I'm selling this is because I just got an excellent deal on a P30 and want to give that a try for a while.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."
