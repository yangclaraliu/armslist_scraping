77,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1741077,For Sale:  Strider Special Mission folding knife,"NE Suburbs, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania",$ 280,"Listed On: Friday, September 20, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Strider SMF folding knife: Description: Strider Knives is an American owned and operated company. The SMF was specifically developed for Det 1, the first SOCOM unit of the United States Marine Corps. It was also the first tactical knife to be issued within the USMC. The simplified construction gives the knife a lightweight format without sacrificing strength. The history, features, and hard-use nature of the SMF have made it the icon it is today.
The half-and-half construction incorporates a titanium lock-side with a G10 single scale. This hybrid construction lets you have the best of both worlds -- the firm lockup of a framelock with the light weight and grip quality of a G10 handle. The handle incorporates pronounced finger grooves to help you index your grip, and it flares out towards the butt-end to provide a good grip without any backward hand sliding. The titanium pocket clip is mounted for tip-up carry.
The 3.75 inch blade is made from premium S35-VN stainless steel ensuring exceptional edge holding. The Strider SMF pivot screws are oversized for high strength and durability. Handles are screwed together using oversized Torx screws for a very tight fit. Finally, the handle spacer is integral to the G10 scale. It is not a separate piece but rather, machined out of the G10, so the spacer is not a separate piece like with other folders. This extra work ensures that the Strider SMF is a folder that will hold up to hard use. An outstanding example of custom American ingenuity, design, and craftsmanship!"

I am including everything needed to start powder coating as soon as you get it. I have an eastwood dual voltage powder coating gun that works great. It has eastwoods performance kit which includes a fluidizing kit, two performance deflectors and five extra powder bottles. I have close to 1/2lb black, 1/2lb mirror red, 1/2lb starlight purple, 1/2lb diamond black, 1lb white, 1lb metallic blueberry, 1lb safety red, probably some other powder I'm forgetting I also have a full silicone plug kit for plugging threaded holes ranging from 1/8"" up to 3/4"" and there are 5 of each size. I have a full roll or fiberglass masking tape. I also have a 1lb spool of .041"" safety wire for tying up powder projects. I built a small ""paint booth"" out of 1x2 with a steel rod that works great for hanging parts on and coating. I also have a sand blasting cabinet that comes with it. It is a harbor freight unit. I bought it for $180 and had to put another $80 into it to make it work correct. I added a huge halogen light inside it because the light that was in it was weak and you could not see anything inside. I bought a new blast gun because the one inside would not run right. I added the new gun and it ran great, I then modified the gun that came with it and it now runs great also so it will come with two guns. Each one works best with different types of media. I do have sand in it now that is new and will come with it. I also have 50lbs of brand new walnut shells that will come with it. I use a standard cooking oven that has been converted to use for powder coating. The inside dimensions are 22"" wide, 18"" deep, and 15"" tall. I have done a lot of work with this setup and it works great Im just running out of stuff do and would like to move onto a new hobby.

This is a slightly used Winchester Model 70 in .243 WSSM.  This rifle is a FAST shooter and this package includes the following ammo (the numbers in parenthesis are average bullet velocities I chrono’d myself):

  18 rounds of Winchester Ballistic Silvertip 55gr (4,087 fps)

Advanced design, superior sighting and battle-ready toughness define Troy Industries’ Di-Optic Aperture (DOA) Folding Rear BattleSight. These sights provide lightning fast target acquisition and are manufactured to exceed military specs. The optically engineered apertures center your eyes instantly and effortlessly providing a clearer target picture than with round apertures. The sights feature two settings, one for up to 300 meters and a second for up to 500 meters. This versatility makes the DOA ideal for military, law enforcement and home defense applications. These advanced sights have been extensively field-tested and, like all Troy Industries products, are Battle Ready. Note: Sight is designed to work on same plane rail systems only. Will not work with a railed gas block that is higher or lower than the receiver. Features Faster target acquisition with Di-Optic Aperture Increases accuracy to 550m Quick install, easy adjust 0.460″ profile when folded Protected adjustment wheel Dual same plane aperture .50 MOA per click Aircraft aluminum 6061 & stainless steel Type III hard coat w/ black oxide or Flat Dark Earth finish

In addition the extractor has been modified, the feed ramp polished, the rails polished, the extractor ramp modified, the BHO modified, the internal spring for recoil has been changed and the BHO spring modified.
The gun has a Chaos Titan Quad Rail System that hinges up out of the way for easy access to the dust cover.
It also has the Chaos HK Style sights installed.
It has a Custom barrel shroud that has been designed so that a brake such as the Tromix shark brake which is included, can be used with the shroud.
The Bolt Carrier has been completely polished and while the extra work down it's length does not add any performance to the gun it does add some flash.
The charging handle is custom turned and welded to the carrier in the Galil style and then that was polished as well.
The trigger pull is approx 4 lbs.
19"" barrel.
An Over Molded Hogue Grip installed.
Paint has been touched up with a solvent resistant Ceramic based paint.

The rear tang has been removed and the rear of the receiver has been reshaped and an internal support block has been installed to support the ACE hardware.
ACE lightweight stock with Foam cheek weld and ACE Push Button folding mechanism with a 1"" ACE Butt pad really pads down recoil.
Couple that with a Hogue over molded pistol grip and a Tromix Shark brake which alone reduces felt recoil by 15% and the gun is a dream to shoot.
The gun can be fired with the stock open or folded.
We then drilled a 4th port in the barrel and slightly enlarged the other 3 gas ports to aid in the gun's ability to cycle low brass ammo such as bird shot and the low recoil stuff.
A RAM ambidextrous mag release extension was also added.
An after market recoil spring was also added.

Fire the gun, release a mag, lock open the bolt, all without taking your hand off the pistol grip.
The gun handles flawlessly as all guns modified by our gunsmiths go to the range for testing and 20 or more rounds put through them before shipping.
This is a new gun under warranty-we list it as used because it is not the way it comes from the factory.
The BHO was notched and reshaped for greater reliability and so it doesn't poke into your finger with the trigger in it's new location.
A Krebs Custom safety has been added as well for the fastest use of an AK safety ever. We have even added a detent to help keep the safety from rising too high on the receiver."

I have a very nice Remington 870 Wingmaster 20 gauge shotgun with 28"" improved cylinder choke.  It is in very nice condition, minor handling marks, a few dings here and there, but overall very nice, especially for its age.  

The nice thing about this 870, is that it is built on the standard, or large frame that the 12 & 16 gauges were built on.  This means that just about any stock set that you want, you can get.  There are very few 20 gauge stock options, but hundreds of 12 gauge options, if you wanted to replace the original wood stock.  These standard frame 20s are hard to come by, especially in this condition.

Holster, 5 magazines (3 are brand new) 1329 rounds with ammo can. The ammo alone, if is worth about $450...

Pristine barrel when I found this little gem at the Cabellas in Boise. I inspected it and fell in love, I wondered if it had ever been fired with such a clean barrel.

I bought it from a Cabellas but also figured it came from a collection as clean as it was. I have all the receipts, over 1300 rounds are included, a holster and all the original parts to prove I did a complete Harrington upgrade with all the original parts delivered to you as well. 

It was an amazing difference shooting this fine CZ with the Harrington kit installed, nice clean break at around 3lbs made shooting this radical infamous little round so much more accurate. 

All I can say is it is a hoot to shoot and you will feel the history, it is a collectable you can enjoy shooting, reliably time after time with the Harrington upgrades. 
Like I mention above 5 mags, over 1300 rounds, ammo box and holster included.

Have a pristine Springfield made M1903 up for trade here. Made in 1932, has a 7-31 dated barrel with absolutely pristine bore. Has scant style stock, I think it's an early replacement but it's super clean with no cracks, splits, dings, etc. A top-notch 1903. Looking to trade it for an AR15 or an AR10 upper or lower. Contact me via email to make an offer. Thanks!

I got this on Friday to add to my collection purely for the girl to shoot when we go to the range.

She doesn't seem to like the feel of it as much as I was hoping that she would. Oh well.

Its never been fired, and it comes with all the accessories. 

I opened the box to show it to her (the box is a little bent and such for some reason, but it's still intact from what I can see)

This rifle has the factory installed (and very cool) Lasermax laser system (MSRP for the laser unit alone is $149, it sells for a bit less at retail) 

This laser is super bright and I am told to be effective to quite a distance even on a bright day.

I replaced the laser batteries just to be certain that you'll have a full charge.

The Carbine is a black beauty. It has a rail to mount a scope or red dot to right on the top (some do not). original 10 rd magazine is included, as is everything else that it came with (tools, extra screws, documentation, etc) 

No shady sales. First come first serve. These are still really hard to find. I will throw in 50 rounds of 22LR ammo with the rifle. 

The price is $350 firm cash no trades. For pickup only, I can't deliver.

---- for RI CCW (Carry Permit) holders ONLY ----

If you also have your RI CCW and can present it to me at the time of sale, the price is $325 firm. This only applies for CCW carrying RI residents because the process is much simpler."

We had them build to our specs. You can use this can on everything from 300 Blackout to .338 Lapua Magnum.

The T.H.O.R PSR over the muzzle brake suppressor was engineered by AWC in partnership with Surgeon Rifles.

This suppressor was designed for the US Special Operations Command's Precision Sniper Rifle solicitation.

The T.H.O.R. PSR suppressor mounts over our muzzle brake for a faster attachment method that maintains the accuracy and repeatability of AWC thread on suppressors.

Manufactured from Titanium, the T.H.O.R. PSR suppressor is one of the lightest suppressors on the market to achieve minimal point-of-impact shift.

The muzzle brake by itself is an extremely effective recoil reducer. When sound suppression is desired simply thread your T.H.O.R. PSR suppressor on to the muzzle brake.

The Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 tactical scope gives the shooter a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. This NXS retains a slim profile and is easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. 

Nightforce uses outstanding glass and coatings in all their scopes, and the 5.5-22x50 tactical gives you superb resolution at high magnifications. It is the ultimate long range scope. The 50mm objective lens gives you maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This Nightforce scope gives the shooter precision accuracy at the longest ranges, yet at 5.5 power remains highly effective for shots at close ranges. 

The MOAR reticle is an improved, more versatile version of the NP-R1 reticle. The MOAR has subtensions that are thicker than those of NF’s traditional reticles, which makes the reticle easier to see against dark backgrounds. The MOAR has 1 MOA spacing on the horizontal and vertical axis’, and this is a great tool for precise range-finding and hold offs. The first hash marks on the reticle are 2 MOA from center, and the crosshair is 1 MOA in length."

It is like new, in the original box. I got it from a guy who said it had never been fired and sat at the back of his safe for years. Then it sat in mine for a while. I cleaned the heavy storage grease off of it, and put it in my pocket a couple times, but I never got around to firing it. . . Basically, it doesn't appear to have even been fired, so it's either new, or like new. 

The AD M-1, is the smallest way to put full-house .357 Magnum in your pocket. Its not the lightest .357 Magnum (the Scandium and Titanium S&W 340PD is 3 oz lighter), but at 15oz, it is pretty light. And, as you can see in the pic next to my old J-frame bodyguard, the M-1 is significantly smaller -- frankly, if it was any smaller or lighter you wouldn't want to fire a powerful round from it, as any 340PD owners can tell you  And, for you Derringer enthusiasts out there, the AD M-1 is about 2/3 the overall size and weight of the Bond Arms derringers with a comparable barrel length, but with a much easier SA hammer and trigger pull. 

The M-1 is nicely made of polished stainless steel and rosewood grips. It features multiple safeties, including a hammer block for safe carry, including pocket carry. Comes with original box, and if you're nice I can toss in some .38 special for practice, and a few rounds of either Hornady .357 Magnum, or Hydra-Shok .38 Special +p+ ""Law Enforcement Only"" defensive ammo for carry purposes. This is a perfect vest, boot or pocket gun, or a purse gun or garter gun for that special lady.

This unique, proprietary, fully adjustable (drop-in) trigger is CNC machined from billet 6061 T6 aluminum and hard anodized to withstand the affects of environmental stress and chemical exposure. The Fulcrum Trigger offers both pre-travel take-up and over-travel engagement adjustments, thus providing the user with optimal control and customizability.

Tuning action is achieved by two opposing, conveniently located 2/56"" adjustment screws. This quality allows the user to precisely tune the feel of the trigger to his or her preferred specifications, including desired pull weight and fore and aft travel distance.

The trigger is capable of producing pull weights of 2 lbs to 2.5 lbs depending on pistols slide to frame fit. The trigger reset (point which trigger has to return after firing a shot) has been shortened by half so the gun can fire mechanically faster.

The Fulcrum Trigger utilizes a distinctive, spring loaded, anatomical engagement safety, which maintains full responsiveness and reliability without ever sacrificing safety. The Fulcrum Trigger's precision-machined trigger bar boasts mirror polishing on all engagement and contact surfaces. This element greatly increases the sensitivity and overall performance of the trigger.

The Fulcrum Trigger is compatible with all Glock 9mm from Generations 1 through 4, and is easily installed by the consumer. The dynamic features of the Fulcrum Trigger allow the shooter to transform their factory Glock trigger into a highly accurate, dynamic and reliable trigger system.

Light slender and quick-pointing never described a semi-auto better than the Benelli Montefeltro 20-gauge and 12-gauge shotgun. The Inertia Driven® system in these Benelli shotguns requires no springs or gas cylinder under the forend. That allows the Montefeltro’s forend to be slim and graceful while the lightweight anodized aluminum receiver keeps weight to a minimum.

The 12-gauge and the 20-gauge shotgun are chambered for 3"" magnum loads making the Montefeltro equally at home in New England woodcock cover or a Louisiana duck blind. This is one gun that looks as good as it shoots. Stocked with beautifully finished satin walnut the Montefeltro is the gun for the wing-shooting purist who wants the feel of a classic game gun with the added advantage of a semi-auto.

Likely from the 60s or 70s. This pistol was built for accuracy.
 Built with all military parts including National match slide, BBL, bushing,front sight, and Bo Mar rear sight. Slide to frame fit is tight. These guns were often built on Commercial Colt or Essex frames so that the pistol belonged to the match shooter, rather than the US Government. If it was built on a WWII frame, it belonged to Uncle Sam, and had to be left behind when the soldier was transfered to another duty station. Also the commercial frames held a Match grade "" tune up "" better because the steel was a lot better in the 60s or 70s than in the 40s. This one is built on an Exxex frame.The pistol is in excellent condition. No Calif sales. Face to face in Oklahoma with OK drivers license. FFL required outside OK. $35 covers transfer and shipping."
