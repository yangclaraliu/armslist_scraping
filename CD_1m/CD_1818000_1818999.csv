The surplus ammo can be found for 20 cents a round and sometimes less. This is from a recent import to the US and as with most other Type 53's the stock isn't perfect.

3X Magnifier Description(not eotech): The 3X magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with holographic sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. This magnifier is a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with the included twist to side mount, the magnifier gives the user something never before possible – the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice-versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their sight on their platform. This versatile magnifier also can be used as a handheld magnifying monocular for discrete observation and identification.
The included mount for the magnifier is the twist to side mount, which allows for quick attachment and detachment. The mount fits any MIL-Std Picatinny Rail.

 I can go north up 23/I-75 to 10 west to Clare then west to Baldwin OR
 I can take I-96 West through Lansing and Grand Rapids then north on 131 to Reed City, then west to Baldwin. I can also meet someone on my way back home if that works better for you.

 New In Box Colt Delta Elite 10mm 1911 SS Stainless Steel 02020 w/ 2 eight round Mags

 This NIB Colt Delta Elite Stainless Steel 10 mm pistol with 2 mags is up for sale. The time-tested Colt Government Model is available in 10mm. Colt was one of the original pioneers in adapting a combat pistol to the potent 10mm cartridge and the first to successfully manufacture a 10mm caliber pistol in the United States. The Colt Delta Elite®, a longtime favorite amongst combat pistol shooters, offers the power to hunt medium sized game with near .41 Magnum ballistics in a legendary 1911 style pistol. Features High Profile Sights with Dots,Commander Style Hammer,Standard Safety Lock,Standard Grip Safety, and Lowered Ejection Port. 

 The Colt is $1000 FIRM with no hassles and fees involved with shipping and FFL fees on both ends that the buyer always gets stuck with.  Let me just say this is far less than I paid and it just makes me sick to sell at this price, but $8000 in concrete and a new garage are not cheap so I must sell!!!!
 I did just buy a box of American Eagle 180 grain FMJ 10mm 50 round box at Jay's in Clare about 3 weeks ago for $38.16 with tax. I will sell you these at my cost if interested.
 Any questions please email me at REDACTED
 or call or text me at REDACTED

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.  The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

You can see by the factory test target it is quite accurate. It just is a bit heavy for my enjoyment, I like the 452 Style better, so I'm putting this up for sale.

I don't think you can get a 452 TH Varmint anymore, as most all 452's have been replaced by the 455. Grab hold of this legendary rifle while you can. It needs a good home.

Not selling scope or rings, just the bare rifle.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

You asked and we listened. The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, v5 is perfectly adapted for end-users who plan on attaching the ever popular red dot, holographic or magnified optics to their firearm. The slick top monolithic upper receiver provides operators with valuable top rail real estate for accessories that fit their shooting needs.

Daniel Defense was always apprehensive about releasing a factory made firearm with a set or clap style gas block. Therefore the Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, v5 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

From the factory this costs $465.00, I'm asking for $200.00 and you pay the shipping. Its a big bag so it'll probably be around $40.00. The system includes the following:

-light sleeping bag
-heavy sleeping bag
-pillow
-stuff sack

Both sleeping bags are zipped together light inside of heavy in order to achieve the 60 below zero rating. The bags can be used individually if desired. Allows you to tailor your sleeping around the seasons, light in summer, heavy in spring/fall, and both together in winter. Wiggys makes premium stuff and this bag is no different. The bag has been used only once and is in near new/perfect condition. My wife is having a baby and I need baby stuff more than I need a sleeping system. Let me know if you have any questions."

754,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1818754,Want To Buy:  Spare 1 box of 22lr?,"Bozeman/Belgrade, Bozeman, Montana",$ 30,"Listed On: Friday, June 28, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,You stocked up on some federal value packs of 22lr? I'm looking for a box of Federal Champion value pack (525 rounds.) I'm looking for this kind as my M&P 15-22 is a bit picky on ammo but its never complained about this stuff. I've been looking for months and every time I get close someone wants an insane amount of money for it or I just missed it by a few people. Its to bad because I think a lot of people hoard what they get instead of get out and shoot it. So if you can spare a box of this for a realistic price let me know.

It's all stock except for the white lettering which can be removed if you dont like it. 

Comes with the holster and 2 magazines pictured plus a second ""crossbreed supertuck style"" holster not pictured. 

I feel it's a great price since it's less $ than you can buy it for new if you can find them if you figure in the cost of a holster. You wont find any flaws either, it looks new! 

May consider trades for Gen 4 Glock 9mm or maybe a .40 must be in like new condition. Possibly others but don't be offended if I say no."

This is a stock RGuns-brand lower receiver with six-position M4-style stock.  This is a complete lower with all parts installed and is ready to be attached to your upper receiver.  Receiver is marked with RGuns branding and .223-5.56mm caliber.

The RGuns trigger, which was very gritty, has been replaced with a CMMG standard trigger, making this a very useable lower receiver.  The lower will also include the original RGuns trigger if the buyer wants to switch back.

This lower has been used to fire less than 100 rounds and is in ""like new"" condition.

This complete receiver, without the CMMG trigger, is currently being sold by RGuns for $220.00.  I am asking $150.00, and am open to negotiations.  Will sell face-to-face only, preferably in Southern New Hampshire.

I will control my rage from falling on those that post ammo for insanely priced ammo.  I will not send hate emails.  I will not swear at them.

And I WILL silently and relentlessly flag their posts because I will not let them turn Armslist into something like Craigslist's 'services offered' section...littered with spam and worthless listings.  Literally every ad is trying to sell ammo for double what you can get it for at Gander Mountain in Rogers or online (like slickguns dot com or gunbot dot net).
