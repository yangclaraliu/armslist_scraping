For a custom rifle. Just because, here is an exact description from the CL post and I figure ive owned and built custom rifles before but gave it up to focus on this for a while ready to swap back. I would have to value the trade at 1200-1500, not 4 month ago prices but today local store prices.
Shoot me offers let me know what you have worst I can say is no, but I have done full custom ARs and even built a few SKS bullpups so please dont consider me an idiot and offer me a 700 dollar AR with a 100 dollar sightmark
Here is my 90 gallon saltwater reef tank with 30 gallon for sump. I have all the parts to make it work 1200gph return and PVC DIY hang on the back and return line with all the right backups installed this thing is totally flood proof. Tested it out fully it will not fail but my cat found the plumbing too interesting and its in a hard spot to protect so I took it out. Presently running well with a TUNZE SKIMMER and a 350 Powerlifter.
The package
1.	100ish lbs of super premium live rock VERY PURPLE lots of coralline it came out of a 6 yr old tank and is the stuff that goes 15-20 A POUND retail
2.	30 lbs of live sand some algea but its being managed well
3.	2 LARGE anemones a Green carpet who fully opened is 14 inchs $130 retail and a Condi who has a taste for small chromis but retail $50
4.	2 large clarkis male and female bonded pair hosting the green carpet, haven't spawned yet but they are pretty new to my system bought em from a running tank and very happy eating well
5.	2 green damsels or reef chromis not sure which but green cute active and peaceful
6.	1 large coral banded shrimp who is quite happy, had em a long time he molts A LOT so very healthy and pretty cute, he and the large female clown pick on each other but its not causing any stress both happy and healthy
7.	 Alll the buckets you could ever need I think I have 10 5 gallon HEAVY duty food grade with lids and marked for diff purposes, 
8.	Fish acclimation box $80 A LOT of extra heaters (I run a 200watt in it now and my temp is a very stable 77.2) The powerheads I have A LOT, several small 800gph cheapos running in it s a single hydor 1150 dual wave style. I have a power head controller as well the little interval thing All of them work and I can provide more detailed pictures. You can always use spares and I have a lot of extra parts from various large system break down purchases
9.	MISC stuff chemicals salt test kits. . ... the stuff you need for this system water conditioner fish food frozen and flake common sense you take it all
10.	The lighting system is two tier and 4 level. I have a 4 bulb 36inch T5 that runs well as well as a 24inch LED I use more for a spotlight They both can be run whites or blues only and I use it to duplicate a 24 hour light cycle pretty effectively. I will also include all the power cords I use to presently run the set up. They do put off some heat so I have a fan mounted to blow cool air onto them but all you need is good airflow and you will be fine.
11.	LITERALLY YOU NEED 2 power outlets and a 4foot wide 4 foot high 2 feet deep space and this can be running in your house within hours

Okay heres where im sitting, there is literally $5000 invested in this system and retail it out with google I dare you to tell me im asking too much. I love this tank but with work I am gonna have to travel A LOT and I want this to go to someone who can take good care of it. I can take more pics or answer more specifics for SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY, I will not deliver I can help break down and set up plus im a nice guy call if you have questions but you need a pickup truck and a strong friend would help. TOTAL WEIGHT OF EVERYTHING IS 1200-1300lbs water weighs a lot and I live on the third floor."

This is a 1942 Springfield Armory M1 Rifle. It is not an original rifle as the operating rod has a relief cut and it has a late Poppet type Gas plug. It also has a Benicia Arsenal rebuild mark on the stock. I would consider it a restoration rifle as the lockbars should have been discarded during rebuild. I have owned this rifle since 2008 and function has always been 100% with Lake City and HXP M2 ball ammunition. It's a fine shooter, but I am slimming my collection to a more manageable level, so this one needs a new home.

The M-1917 Kerr Sling is not included with the sale.


The details are as follows:

Stock: WWII Walnut, Serifed P firing proof, Faint boxed JPL (VERY FAINT)

Local (Mpls/St. Paul Metro) trades considered, but cash is king.  I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only (shipping charge and FFL Fees, when applicable, are additional).  All firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll. 

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly.  If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply.  I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

I'm open to trades, although I'm not really looking for much right now.  CX4 9mm carbine with cash on my end is about the only thing I'm looking for.  Also an all black SR9c.

Air Pistol for sale for $150.00 or trade for 9mm ammo.

This pistol is made in Germany and distributed in this country by Beeman, Pyramid Air, and a number of other on-line dealers.  This is a single-stroke-pneumatic airgun, and does not use C02 cartridges.  Does not have springs to wear out or take a set.  One cocking stroke compresses air to a very high pressure in a very small chamber.  Rifled barrel.  Zero recoil or vibration when fired.

Do not confuse this with the similar looking BB gun Beemans sells for $20.00 or $30.00.  They have nothing in common except both being vaguely Walther-ish looking.

Unlike C02 or pump guns, this type airgun gives consistent velocity for each shot.  The pistol itself cost $225.00 a few years ago.  It has a remarkably light and crisp (adjustable) trigger, and amazing accuracy for a gun in it's price range.  I bought this with the idea of being able to practice at home on the cheap, but my wife has objected strongly to pellets whizzing down the hallway, so I may as well sell it.

I DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO POST PICTURES!  PLEASE DON'T ASK.  SORRY.
You should not have any trouble Googling up a picture on the Pyramid Air or Airguns of Arizona websites.  The gun is in excellent condition.

Hi- I have a 10 month old Mossberg 715t. I bought it 8 months ago from the original owner  through here and because of how hard it is to find ammo I have only had the chance to shoot it once. It is the carry handle model with the 25round magazine. Has a red laser and flashlight attached and I will toss in a vertical front grip and a 22 scope (not sighted). It has less than 150 rounds through it. I would like to trade it preferably for a Mossberg 500, henry 22 rifle, S&W M&P Shield, Ruger 10/22 takedown, or deer/hunting rifle.  Will take cash if its an offer I can't refuse, but prefer trade.

This scope kit is specifically designed to fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

Leave the power set on 2x or 3x in the field and you’re ready for close-in, fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For long shots at smaller targets, turn the power ring up to the full 6X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is a great combination of a lightweight mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.

Also have 4 30 round mags I will throw in as well.  Will also throw in hard case for the rifle.  Thanks!"

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. The Nano's modular structure, ergonomics, and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.

sorry about upsidedown pics, I'm far from even an ok photog, email your number and I can text proper ones...

On a side note please don't email me telling me you can build lowers all day for 200 bucks, I don't buy garbage parts, and my gunsmith doesn't use garbage parts, if you want an r guns lower or a mag tactical lower that will probably blow up in your hand then by all means go and buy it, I'm selling this lower or anything else for that matter because I have extra parts and have more ar's than your mother has shoes in her closet, so I understand if you like junk, but if you want to drive an 83 Honda civic thats your own business, I enjoy a higher quality of parts.

The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

I have a lightly used quad rail.  I have no use for it any more on my AR15, but it is in near perfect condition.  It comes with all the parts needed in addition to the Magpul rail  covers.  Perfect setup for carbine length rifles because it will cover over the gas block and make it nice and clean.  If you have an A-frame gas block/front sight, you'll need to pay particular attention to it's distance from the front of the upper.  This rail is EXACTLY 9.25 inches, measured on the top rail.  You won't be disappointing with this rock-solid, VERY good looking quad!  Here are the exact specs from the YHM website on this part:

These unique forearms feature diamond shaped heat vents, an extended top rail for gap-free installation, “T” marked rails to mark accessory locations, they accept our end caps, and utilize our anti-rotation screws for secure installation. The forearms and barrel nuts are made of 6061-T6 aluminum and hardcoated to military specifications. The jam nut and anti-rotation screws are steel and plated a matte black finish to match. Assemblies include: one jam nut, one barrel nut, two anti-rotation screws, and one forearm tube. Overall Length 9.2 Inches. Weight 15.2 oz."

Vepr Super .308 Win caliber rifle, walnut stock, 10-rd magazine Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr Super is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. Vepr Super in .308 Win caliber features a front sight / gas block combination and a fluted barrel with greater surface area for more effective cooling. The venting at the tip of the RPK style barrel acts as a built-in muzzle break and also created a look unique to the Vepr Super rifle. The furniture for this firearm is a solid piece of precision shaped walnut that runs the entire length of the body, ending at the foregrip. A unique feature to this particular firearm is the ambidextrous magazine catch release for ease of use for any gun enthusiast. Unlike an AK or the standard Vepr rifle, there is no scope rail attached to the side of the receiver. Instead, there is a rail system built into the receiver directly, just above the fire control group and below the top cover. A scope mount can be attached to this rail system. Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. They are shipped with one 10-round magazine, a cleaning rod, and a cleaning kit.
