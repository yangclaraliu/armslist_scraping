(NO MANUAL SAFETY/DECOCKING LEVER) The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing full power loads. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

The first thing to get most people’s attention is the wide-body grip portion of the frame. At first glance, it looks to be too wide for a good grasp for shooting, but it is thinner overall than a single-stack 1911 with grip panels. The overall width of the grip portion of the Fatboy frame is almost one-tenth of an inch thinner than a single-stack 1911 with grip panels. The Fatboy eliminates the need for grip panels at all, as the frame serves as the grip, and is textured for a secure hold on the pistol.

Almost every piece of this Fatboy is made of steel. The only exceptions are the polymer base plate on the twelve-round magazine, the spring retainer on the dual-spring recoil guide rod, and the aluminum trigger. Everything else is a matte-black finished steel.

The upper is spikes along with the bolt carrier group. She has a tac latch charging handle to finish her top half off.
Probably the most impressive thing about this set up is how the upper and lower receiver match up. Boys she is tight, tight. No slop. Absolutely awesome! Now her lower half is primarily spikes with some Seekins stuff sprinkled about. The mag release and bolt release are Seekins, the trigger guard is a spikes tactical engraved PA for Primary Arms, the fire control group is a spikes nickel boron battle trigger, and the grip is a Hogue rubber over mold with storage. The stock is a magpul CTR and the buffer kit is spikes except for the Noveske sling adaptor end plate. This is a really bad rifle. I’m asking $1600 for her.

""Any cartridge that does not have the cross and circle (+) in its
headstamp is not NATO approved, no matter what the ads say. Real NATO
ammunition must be manufactured under NATO surveillance and be certified to
meet strict requirements for velocity, chamber and port pressure, barrel
time, temperature stability, barrel erosion, waterproofing and other
characteristics. Furthermore, NATO ammunition must be produced by a
specified facility in a NATO country. Ammunition made by surrogate nations
cannot carry the NATO symbol or interchangeability code. An item often
overlooked is that M193 Ball 5.56mm ammunition cannot be NATO approved,
since the official NATO round is the SS109 (U.S. M855) cartridge.

Legally,these are imported as pistols,not rifles, therefore they are not bound by the regulation (usc 922r) limiting foreign made parts in assault rifles. This means that the ENTIRE weapon was made in the Romanian Cugir arsenal, where they make their military weapons. Most AK's circulating in the states have been re-manufactured, by law, from a mix of foreign and US made parts. So,while this is a Romanian weapon, and even imported by Century Arms , it hasn't been cobbled together out of mismatched parts by the infamous ""ham-fisted chimps at CAI"", like the sometimes-questionable WASR AK's. This is ALL genuine East Block AK, the reciever,trigger,chrome-lined barrel,etc. and everything is straight,solid and very well put together.
I've added a few extras, like a Picatinny/tactical rail forend, a sling mount adapter and a very nice sling, a Krinkov flash hider, and a slightly larger after-market grip ( or I could put the original Bake-lite grip back on it.) I'm also including the original wood grips, as well as a couple boxes of good Russian ammo.
(Now, the usual fine print: No checks, no shipping, FTF local cash sale only, purchaser MUST be over 21 and Georgia resident, with valid ID to prove it. Fortunately,everyone I've met on Armslist and Craigslist have been real solid folks, but if I get any sketchy/thug/criminal vibes, I'm just walking away. I'm the original purchaser, and a 50-year old Georgia resident with my CCW permit, so all my ducks are in a row here, and I don't need any headaches. )
Thanks..........M."

The Zeiss Conquest 3.5-10x50 MC Rifle Scope Matte Black is the ideal rifle scope for hunting in low-light conditions, and for those who want great performance and rugged versatility. The Zeiss Conquest Riflescope 3.5-10x50 M-C Matte Black features a 50mm Objective diameter, which captures even the smallest amount of light and displays a bright, vivid picture. These Zeiss Conquest Riflescopes are great in low-light conditions such as at dawn or dusk. The Zeiss Conquest Riflescope 3.5-10x50mm M C also has a 3.5x-10x variable power magnification. This magnification is perfect for a rifle scope as it is low enough to have the right amount of light transmission for close shots, and high enough for long range shots. Zeiss Conquest 3.5x-10x 50mm Rifle Scopes have a Field of View of 35.1 ft giving hunters a wide area to work with. Also, Zeiss Conquest Riflescopes have MC Multi-Coated optics providing maximum light, color fidelity, and the contrast needed to spot animals in thick cover. In addition to these technical features, Zeiss Conquest Riflescopes 3.5-10x50 MC are built tough to survive the sudden changes in weather. These Zeiss 3.5-10x 50mm MC Matte Black Conquest Rifle Scopes are Waterproof in compliance with ISO 9022-8, and Fogproof by being Nitrogen filled. Standing by the quality of their product, Zeiss has applied a Lifetime Transferable Warranty to all Zeiss Conquest Rifle Scopes. With the wide field of view, fast optical system, and large 50mm objective, the Zeiss 3.5-10x50 MC Matte Black Conquest Riflescope shows why it is one of the most reliable hunting rifle scopes for early dawn and late evening hunting."

Columbus/Harris Co., Columbus, GA, Georgia",$ 800,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 4, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"For sale is a nearly new Romanian ""Draco"" AK-47. Legally,these are imported as pistols,not rifles, therefore they are not bound by the regulation (usc 922r) limiting foreign made parts in assault rifles. This means that the ENTIRE weapon was made in the Romanian Cugir arsenal, where they make their military weapons. Most AK's circulating in the states have been re-manufactured, by law, from a mix of foreign and US made parts. So,while this is a Romanian weapon, and even imported by Century Arms , it hasn't been cobbled together out of mismatched parts by the infamous ""ham-fisted chimps at CAI"", like the sometimes-questionable WASR AK's. This is ALL genuine East Block AK, the reciever,trigger,chrome-lined barrel,etc. and everything is straight,solid and very well put together.
I've added a few extras, like a Picatinny/tactical rail forend, a sling mount adapter and a very nice sling, a Krinkov flash hider, and a slightly larger after-market grip ( or I could put the original Bake-lite grip back on it.) I'm also including the original wood grips, as well as a couple boxes of good Russian ammo.
(Now, the usual fine print: No checks, no shipping, FTF local cash sale only, purchaser MUST be over 21 and Georgia resident, with valid ID to prove it. Fortunately,everyone I've met on Armslist and Craigslist have been real solid folks, but if I get any sketchy/thug/criminal vibes, I'm just walking away. I'm the original purchaser, and a 50-year old Georgia resident with my CCW permit, so all my ducks are in a row here, and I don't need any headaches. )

I am selling my .308 Remington R25 rifle with some accessories. This AR works and looks great. The gun does have a little rubbed off paint on the forearm of the gun, but other than that, it is in great condition. It has a threaded, bull barrel(not standard for this model) and a scope. I have it sighted it in and it shoots sub-MOA at 100 yards, which is very accurate for a semi-automatic rifle.

I am including the gun, P.E.P.R. rings, Bushnell Elite 5-15x50 scope(waterproof, shockproof, and fog resistant), a scope sun shield, a really nice 2-point sling, recoil pad, a 5-round magazine(the original mag), four 20-round magazines, and a box of .308 ammo.

I'm asking $2,350.

For fastest response, call or text me at (615)four nine six-5760. Thanks.

This Mossberg was purchased from a private seller who bought it off the shelf new and never fired it. He was on a waiting list for a nicer one and bought this on impulse
My wife has put about 50 rounds through it and I have cleaned it thoroughly.
It has 1 magazine (10 rounds). It also has an Israeli fore grip on the quad rail that I purchased and installed.
I gave $325 without ammo (during the craziness after Obama started running his mouth about gun bans), and I know I won't get that out of it..I believe this gun is worth $225, as that was the price about a year ago before the panic.  I have it listed as $300 because it comes with almost 2k rounds and an after market fore grip.
I won't take less than $300 for the gun and ammo.
I will not separate them. I will trade for an M-44 Mosin only or a bolt action .223 rifle only. I am making this sale as a gift to my wife, so it has to be what I'm looking for.
If you offer me ""$200 cash"", like the word 'cash' suddenly makes my gun less valuable, you won't receive a reply."

Passive retention


Passive retention: 

Fobus Passive retention system allows an instinctive and quick draw, and is proven to be the most effective way to draw.

The holster mechanism acts like a spring on the guard area and holds it firmly in place.


Rubberized Paddle:

FOBUS™ introduced a supportive backing for most of its holsters to tighten the attachment to the body and maximize comfort.

This backing significantly betters the agility of the paddle and improves the way the holster is secured to the body.



How to use:

Tighten your belt

Place the holster on your hip and make sure the paddle is pushed all the way down on your belt.

Draw fast and decisive, in an upwards motion as if you were in a real critical situation.


A few warm words about Fobus:

Established more than 25 years ago, FOBUS™ is Israel's largest manufacturer of holsters and accessories for small arms. 

FOBUS™ holsters and pouches were designed and made especially for the Israeli security services and SWAT teams.

This rifle is in a mint condition with couple of very small handling marks, basically invisible. All original and hasn't been used much. I’m the original owner. I purchased it over 14 years ago, took it to the range only once and shot 40 rounds of Remington Match through it and its been sitting in my safe since. The bore is in excellent shape and the pictures show all the rest of the gun. It comes with original owner’s manual, box, two 8 round magazines and sling. Also in auction I’m including Simmons Whitetail Classic 4.5-14 x 40 scope (never used) with B-Square **COLT logo** scope mount and Harris bipod adapter.

I am all for it. 

  However, in the mean time, I am also all for getting a profit wherever you can, and as the current market stands, it is a sellers market.  

  What I am not for, is all of these pissing and moaning (and largely uneducated) people  complaining about the prices that people are asking for their weapons and ammunition, ESPECIALLY these morons that rant on here claiming that it is somehow unpatriotic to ""take advantage"" of people during these turbulent times in the market by charging the prices they are.  Every single person who has said this is either uneducated, or understands how the market is supposed to work and just wants to bitch.  Either way these idiots need a lesson in the american economy and how it relates to the price you pay for the tings you want.

  The idea is a simple one my friends, it is called supply and demand.  The price of every single thing you buy is decided by a number of factors, but the biggest one of all is the fair market value, which in turn is regulated by 2 things:  The supply of the item readily available on the market, and the DEMAND for the item by the consuming public.  When the market has an excess of items available and a low demand for them by the consumers, you will see prices drop for said items.  When the demand rises and the supply starts to drop, the value of the items begins to rise, and in turn the price rises.  Once production catches up with the demand, the prices go back down.  This concept  is as old as dirt, ever since man kind began bartering and trading, and it is this concept that controls the market price for  billions of items world wide;  Including and not limited to guns and ammunition.

  Ever since this scare started, I have profited a significant amount from the buying and selling of ammunition, as well as the trading of guns.  I have bought at bargain prices and sold for great profits, and not only will I not apologize for that, I will go further to say f*ck you if you have a problem with it.  This is america, this is a free market, and it is up to the individual to jump right in to it and make a dollar wherever they can.  If you do not like the idea of paying the prices that are being asked, then here's an idea.. DO NOT PAY THEM!  Wait for the market prices to go back down, or if you claim you can find the same items at a store or online cheaper...here's another idea, GO THERE AND BUY THEM! Why not just do that instead of getting on here and pissing and moaning to people and on this website about prices?  If you turn on the television and you do not like what is playing, do you write the producers sobbing about it, or do you change the f***ing channel?  It is time for everyone to put on their big boy pants and big girl panties and understand the fluctuation of the markets, and act accordingly.  This is just how the world works, and if you are not smart enough to understand that, then you likely have no business handling a firearm in the first place.  

  There are a lot of ways to get around the market prices in private sales.  Just OFFER what you are willing to pay to the seller.  The worst they can say is no, but you would be amazed at how many people are willing to settle to make the sale.  That is how I get my good prices, and it works.  Offer something up for a partial trade.  The fact is you may not be able to get the price you want, so offer something you can part with as a trade.  If you and the seller cannot come to an agreement, just walk away.  How hard is that?

  Lets just all be adults here people.  Grow up, get with the program, and lets ride this market wave the best we can until it comes crashing back down and everyone can be happy again."

This one is probably 1980 vintage, in very excellent condition, recently put new magazine release on rifle and has 5 brand new magazines.  This is a .22LR rifle that is very accurate to the early AR-15 rifles.  I understand the US Military has used this model for training purposes from time to time and that it is the rifle used in the early Walking Dead movies.  Good shooter, this brand is said to be very accurate.  This one appears to have had very little use over the years and will be a good addition to any collection as well as be useful to target practice.

Asking $475.00 which includes the 5 new magazines that cost $37 each and are the last ones in the US to my knowledge.  Text or call REDACTED to purchase.
