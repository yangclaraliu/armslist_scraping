""Snow"" trigger guard, larger for use with gloves
Naguya arsenal-toriimatsu first series pistol.
Made April, 1941
This is a true war relic, it was brought home in a marines bag from ww2 and put in a chest since then. It received it from a guy who got it from his grand fathers estate. 
I had a gunsmith look at it and he said he sees no reason it shouldn't fire, the outside looked a little beat up but the innards looked great.
I took it apart to ensure no broken springs, quality firing pin, all of that, I included many pictures of it. Everything had altered petina but no rust or pitting. There is minor pitting in the barrel, but not deep enough to make its functionality questioned. The barrel is chrome like clean. I polished every piece of it and it went back together well. I love this gun and will never see one again. It's comes with one magazine and no ammo. Any more questions free to ask. 

I am looking for around 900 for it, obviously negotiable. I need at least 350 in cash in order to stay married but am open to trades for the rest. Or full trade if its the right one."

Aside from the handgun, manual and hard case ... It comes with 5 total 15 round magazines, the two that came with the pistol and 3 additional ones I ordered from Caracal that are unused new.  Also when I ordered those mags I got from Caracal their green fiber optic front sight that is uninstalled.  I have two sets of Traction Grips, one black and one grey, uninstalled.  Also from Galloway Precision I have their uninstalled Performance Trigger Spring Set.  And there is a Sticky Holster to fit the gun.
And something you will not find anywhere else is a set of magazine extensions and a grip plug that was custom made for me by a talented guy.  There is a custom Finger Extension Floor Plate that gives you a bit more grip for this handgun, as well as a Grip Plug that it matches up with to fill the hole.  Also there is an really long grip extension floor plate for you to use a 18 round magazine in this gun and fill in that gap created by the longer mag.  (18rd mag not included)

If you are reading this I am sure you know what you are looking at and know about Caracal and the current recall.  So here is your chance to get one of the collectable Waffen Werks C QS models to keep as is, or send in to Caracal for repair and return.  Or if you do not care about that you can see this as buying a brand NEW Caracal pistol as they will replace this one with a new one if you choose to do so.

I know how much I can get from Caracal by returning it all to them for a refund so I am offering this package up to anyone who wants to beat that before I send it in.

Here it is.  You've been looking at Remington model 700's for weeks, but haven't been able to find THE model 700.  You want something unique?  Something your friends don't have?  Something you would be proud to own and show off.  Say you're wife wants John and Missy to come over for dinner.  You don't necessarily care for John, but you would like to show off your NEW model 700.  John is intrigued.  He likes it; however, John can't find one because they're IMPOSSIBLE to find - with the exception of this one.

This is an XCR - that's right... It doesn't get any better than this:

20"" bull barrel (Fluted) CHECK - oh, and it's stainless... yeah, throw it off a cliff into a river, get in your john boat (without John) and go fetch it... it'll be fine and still shoot .5"" MOA.

Remington's 40x Trigger? CHECK - adjust it however you want with a simple turn of a screw.

Black Trinyte finish?  CHECK - leave it laying in a bed of salt and bull urine?  It's FINE

.223 bolt action? CHECK - The most popular .22 caliber in the world!  Ask every coyote you've ever shot with a .223 and he won't be able to reply because he's dead.

Bell and Carlson OD Green and Black webbing stock? CHECK - The BEST of the BEST.  Bell contacted Carlson and said, ""Hey, let's make a rifle stock fit for a king, shall we?""  And they came up with this beautiful piece of artwork.

Let's have a synopsis of what you're getting:

-NEW Remington Model 700 XCR Compact Tactical - .223
-20"" Bull Barrel (Fluted) - Stainless coated in Remington's Trinyte finish
-Remington 40x Trigger
-Bell and Carlson OD Green and Black stock - Free Floated Barrel
-Box, manual, paperwork, rifle lock, etc.

-Mil-Dot Reticle (True Mil-Dot)
-Leupold Alumina Flip-up lens caps
-Box, manual, paperwork

I'll see the items separate or together.  You'll get a deal if sold together.  MSRP on the rifle is $1,500.  MSRP on the scope is $1,499, however, I am realistic and know they can be had online for $1,200.  Please do not waste my time nor yours.  I won't entertain low ball offers.

As you can see from the pictures it has no visible signs of wear on the barrel and it could easily pass for new.  It has mainly sat in my safe and it was new enough that it came from the factory with the updated recoil spring assembly so you don't have to worry about this gun not working perfectly.  I have never experienced a malfunction with it.  I did have a 3 1/2 lb. trigger connector installed by a Glock Armorer as well as the AmeriGlo iDot Pro night sights. http://www.ameriglo.net/catalog/sights/pistol-sights/glock/night-sights/complete-sets/i-dot  The part number on those sights are GL-201 and they cost over $100 and are similar to the XS Big Dot sights except these have a nice orange colored ring around the front night sight to make it stand out even better.  These sights have Trijicon inscribed on them since they use the same glow in the dark parts of the sight as Trijicon's own sights.  Trijicon may make these sights for AmeriGlo as far as I know.  This Glock comes with the original case and everything that comes with a brand new Gen 4 Glock 19.  There's no need in sending me an offer less than $650.

The Primary Arms optic (Aimpoint clone...these are HIGHLY sought after due to being a near 1:1 of the Aimpoint T1 series optics, being reliable and holding zero on 12ga and operating the same as a T1.  It took me over 4 months to finally find one) in a lower 1/3 co witness mount. 

I also have a Primary Arms 3x magnifier with Long Eye relief in an American Defense lower 1/3 cowitness mount I can add on for an additional $150.  I use it for my AR's with 5.56 and .223 and it is great beyond .22lr.

I am asking $1,000 for the Smith and Wesson 15-22 with accessories (or $1,150 with the Primary Arms 3X long eye relief magnifier) which is right at my costs since the panic buying began and all of the components in the package are very difficult to find (excluding the Gen 2 MBUS).  


So, with this package comes:
- New in Box Smith and Wesson 15-22
- Magpul Gen 2 MBUS Sights
- Primary Arms Red Dot Sight (Aimpoint T1 Clone) in lower 1/3rd co-witness mount
-Magpul CTR Stock
-Four New Factory Magazines
-(I have a Magpul MOE+ grip that is Flat Dark Earth I can include for free)



If interested, I also have several thousand rounds of .22lr I can add if meeting Face to Face.  I have conducted more than 2 dozen online transactions and I know the process.  I can ship to an FFL from my FFL if unable to do a face to face.  I accept Paypal for payment (add 4% for their fees) or cash.

I have lowered the price of this set-up to AT COST pricing...meaning I am not making any money selling this package at this point.  I am not in a hurry to ""get rid of it"" so this is my best pricing...especially in this market...also have .22lr Federal Bulk Pack I can add at $110 for 2,100 rounds...which is what I paid for it as well..

I am 20 years old. I do not have my Concel carry. I am legally alowed to buy a gun from a private seller but not a a FFL dealer. I am completly open to filling out a bill fo sale and the transfer forms which would include my drivers license number. I also have two recipts in which i bought my ar15 and shotgun from outdoor emportium. I can show you them so you know that i am legally allowed to own. The recipts have my name on it which you can match with my id. Please do not email me saying i am not legally alowed to buy its getting quite old and annoying. if you read into the law it states that i just can not conceal carry it. I can meet up on mutual grounds and ti does not have to be at my house like other emails i have been getting. My old range before i switched to West coast armory lso told me that. We can meet at west coast armory or your range if its different depending on distance. Just remember i cant do the transfer there because then id have to be 21. I have to do teh private sale transfer papers.

I just received this in a trade a little less than a month ago and I have fired 200 flawless rounds down range. I am unsure of the round count but from the looks of it, I'd guesstimate 600-700 rounds.

This RAMI is a SA/DA, Polymer frame, no decocker with adjustable factory glow sights. The adjustable rear sights have the factory green glow dots, the front sights are factory but I've removed the green glow dots (mucked up from gun powder) and made the front dot bright white for faster sight acquisition.

This a great carry or range gun as it is dead on accurate and low recoil for it's size. 

I do not have the case or original paperwork as I received it in a trade that way.

Gun comes with:
CZ RAMI 2072 P 9mm
(3) 10 Round Magazines
(2) 14 Round Magazines
(1) Pistol Rug to carry everything

Trade Value is $675.
This CZ is very hard to find and if you know CZ's they make some of the most reliable firearms in the world. 10 round mags are going for $40 - $50 each, 14 round mags are going for $50+ on gunbroker.

It's 2013... Upload a picture
It's a website to sell, so list a price, it's not our job to sell it for you
Don't flood this website with your dream price.  Do some research, gunbroker.com is a great resource to get an idea of a price.  Listing your Kimber $300.00 more than its worth is crazy
So is listing a gun that is USED at $50-$100. More than you bought it for

And here's a tip, if your selling a colt, or a compound bow, you don't have to list it everyday
We see it, we saw it the 3 times you posted it prior as well

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters."

The rifle is zero'd in at 250 yards. The rifle also comes with the stock scope and ammunition clip. 

This rifle has about 100 rounds through it, and no scratches or imperfections. It has been thoroughly cleaned after each use and i will throw in a Bore-Snake cleaner in .308. 

The 770 in general has had a reputation for a sticky bolt, but after I bought it I got a new bolt from Remington and after working it in it feels as smooth as a 700. The bolt on this rifle slides with ease and operates better than a brand new 770 rifle. This rifle also has about 8 months factory warranty and i can include the original receipt for that warranty. I am selling because I am building a custom AR15, and it has proven to be a lot more costly than expected.

***I will be in Richmond this weekend for the gunshow and will be able to sell anytime then. I recently moved to Delaware for a job so this offer is from  March 1st to March 3rd. If you buy you must sign a Bill of Sale***"

For Trade Only:
 2 Century Arms L1A1 FALs. 21"" barrel on one 16"" on the other. Awesome guns both run 100%. Ban models, no flash hiders. At least 8 mags with them, I have more laying around the house and in cars and stuff, you can have all I can find these are my last FALs. Good shape for milsurp stuff.

More pics of anything available on request.
 I planned on switching my semi auto 308s over to sr-25 style mags and rifles before the world went gun ban crazy and slowly have been buying some. These are my last FALs and I would like to see them both leave at the same time. I have OCD about owning different rifles that take different mags. only one type of 308 mag in this house is the plan. Variety is the spice of life and nightmare of logisitics.

Wanted to trade for: 
Any 308 rifle, lowers, uppers, etc. that accepts LR-Pmags/SR-25 Mags/DPMS mags/etc...
 Nice scopes for a semi auto 308. FFP mil or moa. Was thinking HDMR, would like an XRS, FFP mil or moa. Or IORs.
 Anything else interesting. Just PM me and ask if you are interested. I dont want a stevens 200 in .270 though...

Edit* Can trade up or down. I have cash to add to any deal or can accept some.
