The CZ-99 pistol (also sometimes referred to as CZ99) was developed by the former Crvena Zastava arms factory from former Yugoslavia, now Zastava Arms Co from Serbia and Montenegro. The CZ-99 was developed as a service pistol, and is also available for export sales. The copies of this pistols were briefly manufactured in Israel and South Africa. In general, CZ-99 appears to be a good combat pistol, well made, relatively inexpensive and with decent ergonomics.
The CZ-99 is apparently patterned after famous SIG-Sauer P226 pistol, but with several modifications. The CZ-99 is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. Barrel is locked to the slide by single large lug, which engages the ejection port. The Browning-type cam system is used to lock and unlock the barrel from the slide. Frame is made from aluminum alloy, slide is stamped from sheet steel, with separate steel breech block insert, fixed by the cross pin. Double action trigger system, with external hammer, has an automatic firing pin safety, and ambidextrous decocker levers, on both sides of the grip frame. The decocker levers also operate the slide stop, reducing the number of manual controls. Pistol is also equipped with loaded chamber indicator. Standard version of CZ-99 has no manual safeties, but there also is a version with manual safety, mounted on the slide. This version is designated as a CZ-99S. Compact variant of the basic pistol, with shortened barrel and slide, is designated as CZ-99 Compact. Standard sights are of fixed variety, with white dot inserts, and both sights are dovetailed into the slide.

The Primary Arms optic (Aimpoint clone...these are HIGHLY sought after due to being a near 1:1 of the Aimpoint T1 series optics, being reliable and holding zero on 12ga and operating the same as a T1.  It took me over 4 months to finally find one) in a lower 1/3 co witness mount. 

I also have a Primary Arms 3x magnifier with Long Eye relief in an American Defense lower 1/3 cowitness mount I can add on for an additional $150.  I use it for my AR's with 5.56 and .223 and it is great beyond .22lr.

I am asking $1,000 for the Smith and Wesson 15-22 with accessories (or $1,150 with the Primary Arms 3X long eye relief magnifier) which is right at my costs since the panic buying began and all of the components in the package are very difficult to find (excluding the Gen 2 MBUS).

- New in Box Smith and Wesson 15-22
- Magpul Gen 2 MBUS Sights
- Primary Arms Red Dot Sight (Aimpoint T1 Clone) in lower 1/3rd co-witness mount
-Magpul CTR Stock

I can ship to an FFL from my FFL if unable to do a face to face.  I accept Paypal for payment (add 4% for their fees) or cash.

***TO THE BUYER OF THE RIFLE/PACKAGE ONLY*** 
I have lowered the price of this set-up to AT COST pricing...meaning I am not making any money selling this package at this point.  I am not in a hurry to ""get rid of it"" so this is my best pricing...especially in this market...also have .22lr Federal Bulk Pack I can add at $110 for 2,100 rounds (have 4,200 rounds)...which is what I paid for it as well..

""We are proud to announce that within a matter of days we will be going live with a new program. Due to a bill currently moving through the Colorado legislature, there is the possibility that Colorado residents' ability to purchase standard capacity magazines will soon be infringed. Before that happens, and Magpul is forced to leave the state in order to keep to our principles, we will be doing our best to get standard capacity PMAGs into the hands of any Colorado resident that wants them.

Verified Colorado residents will be able to purchase up to ten (10) standard capacity AR/M4 magazines directly from Magpul, and will be given immediate flat-rate $5 shipping, bypassing our current order queue.

Our customers outside of Colorado, please know that our PMAG production will continue at an ever-increasing rate until we do relocate, shipments to our distributors in other states will continue, and that we do not expect relocation to significantly impact PMAG production. We are also aware that Colorado is not the only state with existing or pending magazine capacity restrictions; we are working on programs for other affected states as well.

Full details and instructions will be announced when we are able to go live; please watch here for the coming announcement.""

Each metal frame P Series pistol is made of hard-coated A356T aircraft-
quality aluminum alloy; Rugers proprietary Terhune Anticorro stainless
steel (chrome-molybdenum steel in blued models); nearly indestructible
resin grip panels; custom, compounded polymer frames of the P95 andP97;
and long-strand fiberglass filler that is a natural shock absorber.
P Series pistols easily field strip for cleaning, without the use of
special tools, into five major subassemblies. Ruger offers several
ambidextrous variations on the proven P Series double-action
design.Operating features:
All centerfire models include a firing pin block that prevents firing
unless the trigger is completely pulled and held fully back.Manual
Safety models incorporate a manual ambidextrous lever that, when
engaged, prevents firing unless the lever is in the ""fire""position.
Decock-Only models allow safe return to their ""at rest"" mode when
either ambidextrous decocking lever is depressed. After decocking, the
gun can be fired by a double-action pull of the trigger without further
manipulation of the decocking lever.

It does include a soft carry case. It has a light, small hairline scratch just under the ""U"" in the engraved ""RAGING BULL"" logo on the side that is unnoticeable until you see it upclose due to rubbing against another gun in my gun safe [you can faintly see the scratch in the photo], the other ""white"" specks are dust or glare from camera flash.

Product Specifications:
• Manufacturer: Warne Scope Mounts

• Type: Ring

• Finish/Color: Matte
• Fit: AR

Warne's Maxima Quick Detach Rings are the most durable and versatile quick detachable mounting system available. Each ring is precision CNC machined from sintered steel technology, a process that allows intricate steel parts to be formed and then fired -- retaining the strength properties of steel while adding the necessary ductility that scope mounts require for perfect grip contact around the circumference of the scope.

The Maxima QD rings sport the unique Warne indexable lever system which allows the user to remove the optics from the rifle then reattach it without the loss of zero, as well as allowing the location of the lever to be indexed once the rings are affixed to the bases. After the levers are tightened, simply pull out on the lever, turn it to the desired location then let it snap into place. When used on the all steel Warne Maxima bases, we guarantee accuracy of within 1/1000th of an inch when removing and reattaching the optics. Unique to the industry, the Maxima QD has a square stainless steel recoil control key. This ensures a positive recoil engagement surface across the full width and depth of the recoil slot in the base. The recoil control key guarantees the position of the rings will not shift or move under fierce recoil and also protects against peening or swaging when mounted on aluminum bases.

*These are in the original package, new condition, no scratches/marks, mounting tool included."

New AR15 built from scratch. Put 90 rounds through it with no malfunctions. Hits dead on with minimal recoil and smooth cycling, thanks to free-floated barrel, mid-length gas system and Yankee Hill muzzle brake/compensator. I love shooting this rifle because it's really LOUD but it only kicks like a .22, and the sights actually stay on target, making follow-up shots a breeze. This is ideal for home defense or hobby shooting.

DSArms stripped upper receiver assembled with Palmetto State Armory upper parts kit. 

FN 16"", Chrome-Lined, Midlength, Lightweight (.750"" diameter, not the .625"" Pencil Profile), dimpled to fully secure set screws for Troy Micro Gas Block, which were also Loctited in place. 

Semi-Auto Phosphated Bolt Carrier Group. I would have preferred a nice Nickel-Boron or chromed BCG for easier cleaning, but I was lucky to find this one for a reasonable price and it functions without issue.

BCM Gunfighter Mod.3 (Large Latch) charging handle. Makes off-hand charging easy while shouldered.

Muzzle device is a Yankee Hill Machine ""Aggressive End"" combination Compensator/Muzzle Brake.

Barrel is Free-Floated thanks to an 11"" Flat Dark Earth Troy Alpha Rail handguard. I will include the extra rail sections and Allen key that came with the handguard. 

Magpul Flat Dark Earth MBUS flip-up sights.

Code Red Firearms lower receiver, built with DPMS Lower Parts Kit.

ERGO Flat Dark Earth Ambi Suregrip. I love these things. Rubbery feel gives a nice, solid purchase to really control the rifle. 

Generic Mil-Spec Buffer Tube/Buffer/Spring from riflegear.com with an ambi sling plate and a Chinese copy of a Flat Dark Earth Magpul CTR stock. I didn't realize it was a knockoff, so I'd rather be upfront about it. It rattles like an M4 stock but otherwise works just fine as an adjustable stock, and you can always change it if you like. I'll be glad to show you how to remove it if necessary.

Knowing the current political situation and it's effect on the firearms industry, I'm including 4 Magpul 30rd PMags, loaded with PMC 55gr ammo.

The current lack of parts availability and inflated prices made the build much more difficult, not to mention slow, so please understand that this is being offered as a complete package w/ mags and ammo, and priced accordingly. This is a great rifle that is easy and enjoyable to shoot.

I can throw in a zombie sling and single point attachment.

I also have 160 rounds of .223.

I will not be unreasonable, but I will not give it away.
I did pay taxes, background and extra for the accessories."

I have never carried this gun nor slipped it in and out of the holster 1000 times, just once it fit and got put away. I buy holsters for all my guns even the ones ill never carry. To me it a necessity not an accessory. like a case for a phone.

Now why am I selling it?? Even tho it impressed the fuck out of me with the accuracy and no malfunctions, I still am old school and prefer an all metal gun. I Also own the beretta PX4 storm super duty 45, and that is the only plastic gun I will own from here on out. I love it and highly recommend it!!   

I would like to sell it all together, but if it is the Hi-cap magazines you want make an offer for all of them. I will not sell and ship them one at a time. Yes the mag pouch will come with it. the 13 round will stay with the gun.

1911-22 SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOL cal.22LR 10 ROUNDS TAN FINISH
Item Number: CF401-046
The TAN model is a special edition with slide in ""tan"" colour and standard blue frame. The original M1911 was a single- action, semi automatic pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

It has the original Willy's stamp on the firewall under the hood. This jeep is in excellent condition, mechanically sound, runs and drives GREAT!! Absolutely nothing wrong with this jeep mechanically or cosmetically. I did a mechanical overhaul on this jeep so it has all of the new regular stuff it would need, brakes, brake lines, fuel lines, spark plugs, wires, distributor cap, alternator, solenoid, ect, ect. 4 wheel drive (must lock front wheels to engage 4 wheel drive), 3 speed, low and high gears, transfer case, can NOT get stuck in this thing!! It has the military tires so that the enemy can NOT tell which way you are going if they try to follow your tracks, wheels are left hand threads. The front windshield folds down. Jeep is is equipped with an ammo can as a glove box, cb radio with speaker, military police siren, blackout light. I have many miscellaneous extra parts to go with it. It has a gas can mount on the side and I have extra gas cans to go with it.

 I can not guarantee that this jeep was in the Korean War but it was built at the end of the war, also the military cut it in half for shipping purposes and welded it back together. I also have roll bar, canvas top and doors for it (not shown in pictures). I did this jeep as a U.S. Army military police scenario, it is lots and lots of fun. I am in not hurry at all to sell it and am more interested in someone taking good care of this jeep as I have. If you are trying to make a profit off of me and this jeep than please don't waste my time. I want somebody to appreciate it as much as I have. When I got insurance on this jeep, they told me it was worth $8,000 in it's worst condition and $16,600 in it's best condition. I would guess that it falls somewhere in the middle but I have it insured for $8,000. Like I said, I am in no hurry at all to sell it so if you are interested please make me an offer. I am willing to do a cash sale or a trade and cash sale or just a straight trade if the price is right. E-mail me your offers, you never know you just might have something I can't live without"

These cars are very collectible and the 260's were only made 2 years 1974 and 1975 and the 2+2 was only made 1 year in 1974.

I just recently bought a Sig P225, and am in love. So, now I am looking to trade my beloved XD45 for a Sig to place at my bedside. This is the one and only reason I am thinking of getting rid of this pistol. I have had zero malfunctions of any kind EVER. I will check out Blue Book on offers as well. Not saying that to be rude, but you wouldn't believe the amount of times someone has offered me like a Bersa Thunder 380 for a Sig Scorpion... I am not an idiot, and if we are going to do business you shouldn't be one either.

I am starting to prefer 9mm.... I am into 45 acp still though, especially for home defense. Really just looking for Sigs, but may consider other pistols. I am not into .380, .40, 38 spl, nor wheel guns, shotgun, rifles, on this fellas. And if it isn't a Sig, it's going to need to be a trade in my favor unless it really blows my socks off.

I stayed in the camper at 25 below zero for a week and it stayed 70 degrees in the camper just fine. Last summer I decided that the camper needed some upgrades. One thing led to another and I gutted the exterior of the camper to change some things up. Camper was reframed, new and more insulation in walls, fiberglass exterior walls instead of metal, rebuilt roof with more insulation and exterior is 1 sold piece of rubber instead of metal with seams. Interior has got new laminate wood flooring and the kitchen area walls have been redone with the look of a tiled wall. Interior has a three burner stove, lots of storage cabinets, sink, water tank, thermostat/ propane heater, lights, plugins, can run on batteries or 220/110. This camper was being rebuilt to be a go anywhere and live in style and comfort.  This camper gets many complements and is very rewarding on any trip it is taken on. 

I had the camper on a ford f250 with a 6 1/2 ft box and it worked great. I sold the truck and i would like a new project, so.... Campers got to go too. I would like to get $4000.00 OBO.

I can send more pictures to interested buyers.

Bought this gun brand new at the last Indy 1500 Gun Show.  I've put 100 rounds through it.  It's an awesome gun, no problems with any of the rounds fired.  Cleaned after both trips to the range.  The guy that sold it to me told me that it was a rare combination to have the stainless top with the black bottom, if this is true or not beats me.   I bought new black grips for it (have wooden grips as well) and a nylon trigger as well.  I have only installed the grips so far, but will throw the trigger in with it.  Comes with a Fobus Paddle Holster.  I either want to sell it at an asking price of $800 or trade it.  I have a Springfield XDM .40 so I wouldn't trade for one of those.

The Smith & Wesson Model 59 is a steel, DA/SA action, 9mm semi-automatic pistol introduced in 1970 by the American company Smith & Wesson. It uses a Browning-type locking system. The firearm was originally designed for the U.S navy as a high-capacity pistol. The Model 59 was issued to Navy SEAL commandos for evaluation in the field.

 Up for sale is a Beretta PX4 storm sub compact 9mm. It has exactly 250 rounds through it and cleaned deeply after each shooting (only 2 sessions). Its in good shape and has no dumb scratches other then wear. There is not a one scratch on the slide nor the whole gun for that matter. It comes with 3 17 round magazines and 3 20 round magazines and also a flush fitting 13 round magazine for carry purposes if needed be. Also has the beretta holster that was made for the gun along with original box ext, and a mag pouch. I have never carried this gun nor slipped it in and out of the holster 1000 times, just once it fit and got put away. I buy holsters for all my guns even the ones ill never carry. To me it a necessity not an accessory. like a case for a phone.

 IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO READ THE TOP START HERE.

 Exactly 250 rounds through the firearm. (not a one scratch on it). 9mm
 3- 20 round OEM beretta magazines. Never used never even loaded.
 3- 17 round OEM beretta magazines. only one used once. others are brand new, never used never loaded. 
 1- Flush fitting OEM 13 round magazine very lightly used.
 2- extended clip adapters
 1- mag pouch (fits all the mags in).
 Beretta OEM holster off of there website. (Its called the Ghost) Right handed.
 Original box (case), back straps and whatever comes with the gun new. 


 Now why am I selling it?? Even tho it impressed the fuck out of me with the accuracy and no malfunctions, I still am old school and prefer an all metal gun. I Also own the beretta PX4 storm super duty 45, and that is the only plastic gun I will own from here on out. I love it and highly recommend it!! 

 I would like to sell it all together, but if it is the Hi-cap magazines you want make an offer for all of them. I will not sell and ship them one at a time. Yes the mag pouch will come with it. the 13 round will stay with the gun. 
 as for the whole package Make an offer and be realistic. would consider some trades, but not many. I just about have every gun I want.
