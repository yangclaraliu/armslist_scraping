back in the 60's but not used very much.   ***I just looked on Guns International and they had one like mine for $1000***   Serial number 1050804 - 28 inch barrel, full choke.
I'm just assuming it's a 60's gun---it should be of that age.   Will look nice in that 
Model 12 collection or very usable-that's what I'm thinking for that price.***Update***
The serial number dates this gun as manufactured in 1947***"

The Model PD can be loaded with six .45 ACP pistol cartridges in the detachable internal magazine, plus one in the chamber, and was very popular with police and civilian users in the self-defense and backup gun role, especially in the United States.

The Star PD improved on its predecessor (Star Model PKM) by using a low-profile adjustable rear sight and by removing material from the slide and other small changes. These modifications, combined with its aluminum alloy construction, resulted in a slim, compact, lightweight and relatively powerful pistol, revolutionary for the time. 

It comes with 2 extra buffers, a recoil spring not yet installed to reduce felt recoil. Original grips, case, extra 7 rnd mag. Nice lightweight, 25oz, package. Good carry gun. I have another. This pistol has a good following. Not a range gun. Jeff Cooper put it best. ""Carried often, shot little"". This pistol has a small following of folks who love them. 
Also a Bianchi #6 IWB holster."

Since then I have put somewhere around 1000 flawless rounds through it (did not keep an exact count).  It has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  It does have an idiot scratch (my first 1911) and faint stain in the checkering on the housing.

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  

The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

I have placed the gun on a Gunbroker Ad due to limited response on Armslist.  If you live in Ohio and wish to purchase I am willing to meet halfway from Lewis Center up to an hour of drive time.  If you are further away and wish to purchase I will drive an hour to meet if you cover the rest of the distance.  This would save significant shipping and FFL costs.  If you are interested please contact me about the details of meeting before placing a bid.  

Will sell for $2200 FTF and end auction if no bids have been placed.  Once a bid is placed on gunbroker will sell through auction only.

This thing is huge! My dad used to love carrying it around east wenatchee area to shoot badgers from more than what seemed a football field away. I was only allowed to shoot it once when I was younger.
The bluing is very nice, with some holster wear on the muzzle. The original wood grips are in great shape. 
You can view the pistol before obligating to buy it, I'm always happy to show it off :)

 Snap-on's WB410 wheel balancer combines electronic accuracy with high reliability in a heavy-duty automotive and truck wheel balancer that is as profitable to own as it is easy to operate. Featuring automatic weight recalculation and six balancing modes; normal, static, and four custom, the WB410 is the most technically advanced automotive and truck wheel balancer in the industry today. 

 WB410 Automotive and Truck Wheel Balancer Features: 
 Fast and Simple Wheel Balancing
 A single wheel balance spin cycle of between 8 and 20 seconds (depending on wheel size) is all that is needed. The large display shows the exact weight requirement and location. No guesswork or wasted motions. 
 Automatic Weight Recalculation
 Balance the wheel in the normal mode, then select any of the four custom modes or the static mode. The wheel balancer's computer automatically recalculates the amount of weight and location for you, allowing you to balance wheels quickly, accurately, and easily. 
 Built-in Reliability, Simple Design
 Advanced, solid-state design means fewer moving parts and minimum downtime. All major wheel balancer components can be replaced in the field. 
 Performance You can Afford
 The WB410 wheel balancer plugs into any 115-volt outlet-- no expensive wiring required. It conserves energy by powering down when not in use. It automatically powers up when you mount a wheel. Completely portable; roll the WB410 wheel balancer to the truck and operate the internal rechargeable battery or connect it to any 12 volt battery. The patented built-in lift mechanism will raise a 500 pound wheel effortlessly. 
 Safe, Accurate, Low-speed Operation
 The WB410 balances truck wheels to 0.25 oz. (5 gm) accuracy at an operating speed of 70 rpm, eliminating the need for a cumbersome safety hood. Automobile wheels can be balanced to 0.10 oz. (2 gm). Automatically senses for truck or automobile wheel balancing mode. 
 Self-Calibrating
 The WB410 wheel balancer calibrates itself accurately and automatically. Simply press a button, attach the calibration weight and spin the wheel. 

 WB410 Automotive and Truck Wheel Balancer Highlights: 
 Dynamic and static balance, twin plane balance. 
 Fast, single-spin cycle

Here is your chance to own a unique piece of WWII history.  This rifle was almost certainly smuggled home after capture by one of our fathers or grandfathers.   Because there were only 8000 of these ever made, one in perfect condition is worth $10,000 or more.  Since this is genuine history, it is not in perfect condition.  First off, there is no scope, and the scopes were numbered to the gun.  That being said, very few type 97s have scopes at all and only a handful have matching ones.  The mount on this gun is fine, so you could pick up a scope or replica at a gun show or ebay and mount it easily.  Next the stock has been ""duffel cut"", meaning the very front part of the stock has been cut off and the front most barrel band(a numbered part) is missing.  This is why the mum and all of the rest of the bluing is in excellent condition, our hero cut it down and stuffed it in his personal duffel rather than have it ground up and shipped home properly.  Finally the magazine floorplate is a mismatched number, this was common due to en mass cleaning  and practice sessions and probably happened before it ever saw service.  All of the rest of the numbered parts match and are in great condition, including the bolt shroud witch is often missing.  The rifling is not too bad, and it shoots just fine. I'll even throw in half a box of hornady 6.5 jap ammo.  Since this is not a perfect gun, its not worth 10,000.  But its also not a $300 Arisaka you find in pawn shops.  I think $1000 seems fair for a very rare piece of history that is in decent condition and functions just fine.  I would almost rather trade it though, so let me know what you have.

This is an American clone of Steyr's AUG made by the same people who make brutally efficient knives, MSAR. 

This package includes a coyote brown STG-556, a VERY RARE $195 split-level 12"" top rail, three magazines, a $90 MSAR 6"" side rail (not aftermarket and not installed at present), Giles sling, uninstalled $45 Trigger Tamer and a $30 Ratworx thread adapter to convert from AUG's left hand thread to 1/2 X 28 right hand thread to allow for your choice of hiders, brakes or suppressors. 

Even with the Ratworx thread adaptor, QD flash hider and my suppressor in place it is still shorter than a collapsed 16"" M4!

The magazines included are one 10 round, one 20 round and one 30 round mag. This firearm is easily converted to left-hand use by simply changing the bolt and moving the block-off plate from the left to the right. Installing the Trigger Tamer is a 10 to 15 minute operation that results in a trigger pull of about 2/3rds the regular weight.

MSAR is now taking pre-orders for their .300 Blackout barrel. Changing barrels takes less than 2 or 3 minutes and since .300BLK uses the same bolt and mags you can carry one gun to shoot both calibers!

Available, but not included in the price, is a matching EOTech 553 and Sneaky Bags 30” Covert Rifle Bag that I will include for an additional $700. This is a $700 holographic sight and $150 pack that are both new as well. The Sneaky Bag looks more like a skateboard backpack than a carbine pack.

This is a sweet rifle. I have over $1700 in this package. I might even throw in some ammo, so this is a complete platform with all extras you need to go out and shoot. It's seen about 500 rounds so it's broken in but in great shape still. Really smooth action and very clean. If you are unfamiliar with Wyndhams, just look up reviews. They are great guns, basically the original bushmaster designs. Eats all ammo like a champ."

Barrel # 28REDACTED 9-83 82472 (USMC Med weight NM Broach cut rifling, 22"")
Bolt  TRW
Rear sight NM2A
FT sight NM052
Op rod. H&R
Trigger is SA
Bedded stock (still in excellent condition) sans a few scratches from use and safe storage.

Basically the rifle made the trip to Camp Perry every couple of years and while there, the guys from Springfield and some service buddies made improvements.  I added the Springfield Government Model 6x40 scope with BDC reticle.  It is not zeroed to the rifle, as I had it on my other M1a the last time I went to the range.

This is not a safe queen, nor did it hang over the mantle.  It was shot, cleaned, shot some more and so on.  The rifling is superb and the best guess we have on round count is between 680 and 720 rds since 1984.  

  I prefer to sell locally, but will consider shipping to your ffl, but only after you understand what you are buying.  Prefer phone calls over email, as I'm not near the computer very often.  Please no picture collectors, I suck at taking pics and unless I think you might actually be a buyer, I won't be sending dozens of pics.  

This is an example of what an M1A is supposed to be.  Not a roll of the dice modern built NM that may or may not shoot sub moa.  This rifle is what you would expect it to be.  I don't have primo, pristine, never seen daylight weapons, I shoot my stuff.  I'm selling this to fund an expensive transferable I've got my eye on.  I won't be taking trades or low ball offers.

Would a Old Model Ruger Vaquero .44 magnum be of any interest to you? I have a discontinued, ec, 7 1/2 in. barrel Stainless Steel Single action pistol to offer in trade. The bore is spotless and the value on these are only going to increase. The Old Model has a heavier barrel, frame and cylinder to withstand the high pressure hand loads that hunters favor. These discontinued models are already as scarce as hens teeth and if you can find one they are going for 640 to near 800 dollars.
Mine is not an 800$ piece. No box or papers and it's been shot some, but value is what it's worth to YOU. I value it at 600 dollars.

Withe either a Don Hume IWB holster if you""re a righty or a Blackhawk CQC Level II OWB Kydex paddle holster, if you're a leftie. Depending on the trade caliber I can include 80 rounds of (mostly) Blazer  180 grain fmj, 25 Remington Golden Saber jhp and 20 Hornady Critical defense jhp. Cash Value for all the Star stuff 400. Trade value 450-475
 Let me be Clear: I'm in this for trades not to make money or for you to take advantage of me either. I believe that if we're trading for something we both want then we're three quarters of the way there. But; if you want my gun and three hundred, don't waste my time.

Ideally suited for informal target shooting, plinking, small game hunting, and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate. The 10/22's heat-stabilized, glass-filled polymer trigger housing assembly is precision-made of high-tech material for improved manufacturing tolerances, impact, and abrasion-resistance, and has an unmatched ability to withstand the elements. The hammer-forged barrel is locked into the receiver by a unique two-screw V-block system and the A380 aluminum alloy receiver is precision-machined to provide long-term reliability to the 10/22 action. Ruger's patented, detachable 10-shot rotary magazine features a unique rotor to separate cartridges and provide reliable feeding. The easy-to-use extended magazine release provides smooth, no-fuss removal of the unique flush-mounted magazine without leaving it exposed to dent or creating uncomfortable protrusions at the rifle's balance points. The 10/22 carbine has a contoured buttpad and barrel band. This variant comes with a LaserMax laser in addition to the standard gold bead front sight and adjustable rear notch.
