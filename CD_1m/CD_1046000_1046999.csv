Trades: The only trades I will consider is for a full size Kimber 1911 or Specifically Springfield Trophy Match.  We will work out details if one is offered.  I do not want anything else... no need to offer it.  The answer is NO!

Other info:
H&K USP 40 with Jet funnel magwell and 8 Mags.  This pistol was used as my carry gun when I lived in FL.  Obviously I cant carry here in IL but, its a great pistol!  Like all my firearms, this has been taken care of and cleaned after each range trip!  If I had to make an honest guess at round count I would say its just about 2,000 which is nothing for a pistol like this.  I cant say enough good things about H&K as a company or product.  I obviously have to hold the pistol and company in high regard if I was willing to trust it on my hip in case of emergency!  

The pistol comes with original box, paper work, and spent shell as it did from H&K.

The pistol is right at 95% in my estimate.  There is a small amount of holster wear at near the front of the pistol and some minor cycle wear on the outside of the barrel. Nothing out of the ordinary.

To add to that, this specific H&K has a Jet-funnel Magwell (best magwell on the market for any gun made IMO) as well as 8 Mags!  4 are your standard 13 round mags that have the original bases and 4 are 16 round high cap mags with updated floor plates to snap right into the jet funnel.

The Jet Funnel Magwell is going to run around 100.00 bucks and the mags are now selling for 85-100 bucks each with the base pads!!

The 4 13 round original mags do not come up with updated floor plates but, they are easy to change and find. (I think they are 8 bucks each)

I will keep the ad up for roughly a week, if nothing this will just go over to Gunbroker.

Please feel free to ask any/all question on the pistol.

Thanks,

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

333,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1046333,For Sale:  HK USP 40 With Extras ( H&K USP40 ),"Mokena, Chicago, Illinois","$ 1,100","Listed On: Monday, February 11, 2013",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Make:H&K

Model:USP

Caliber:40

Location (city or county):Mokena

Price: 1100.00 (firm)

Will ship (Y/N): Yes (Only if FFL accepts a private sale) and on your dime

Trades: The only trades I will consider is for a full size Kimber 1911 or Specifically Springfield Trophy Match. We will work out details if one is offered. I do not want anything else... no need to offer it. The answer is NO!

Other info:
H&K USP 40 with Jet funnel magwell and 8 Mags. This pistol was used as my carry gun when I lived in FL. Obviously I cant carry here in IL but, its a great pistol! Like all my firearms, this has been taken care of and cleaned after each range trip! If I had to make an honest guess at round count I would say its just about 2,000 which is nothing for a pistol like this. I cant say enough good things about H&K as a company or product. I obviously have to hold the pistol and company in high regard if I was willing to trust it on my hip in case of emergency! 

The pistol comes with original box, paper work, and spent shell as it did from H&K.

The pistol is right at 95% in my estimate. There is a small amount of holster wear at near the front of the pistol and some minor cycle wear on the outside of the barrel. Nothing out of the ordinary.

To add to that, this specific H&K has a Jet-funnel Magwell (best magwell on the market for any gun made IMO) as well as 8 Mags! 4 are your standard 13 round mags that have the original bases and 4 are 16 round high cap mags with updated floor plates to snap right into the jet funnel.

The Jet Funnel Magwell is going to run around 100.00 bucks and the mags are now selling for 85-100 bucks each with the base pads!!

The 4 13 round original mags do not come up with updated floor plates but, they are easy to change and find. (I think they are 8 bucks each)

I will keep the ad up for roughly a week, if nothing this will just go over to Gunbroker.

Please feel free to ask any/all question on the pistol.

Thanks,

342,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1046342,For Sale:  Complete Upper with BCG $400 Colt Noveske Rock River Spikes Bushmaster,"Richmond, Virginia, United States",$ 400,"Listed On: Monday, February 11, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Sorry about the hook, but I'm tired of the games...Please Read...
I just tried to buy a ""Complete Upper"" from a guy only to find out that the BCG is not included. When I asked him about it he said that the ad Clearly States that it doesn't come with the Bolt Carrier Group.
OK. Fair enough. It's just something I'm trying to get used to. I've built 3 ARs and on my last one, I decided to buy a complete upper.

Six months ago, when I bought a complete upper it meant that it was ready to slap on the lower and it was ready to shoot. About 1/3 still needed the rear sight but the BCG was part of a ""complete"" upper. Ever since the guns/parts/ammo shortage started, guys are selling ""complete uppers"" without the BCG. I say ""guys"" because complete uppers are impossible to find from dealers. But so are BCGs. You gotta be lurking on the internet all your waking hours to be lucky enough to grab a BCG from some retailer that has 20 of them for sale.And not only that but the BCGs are selling for $300-$500.  If you don't make the purchase within 30 minutes, they are sold out. It's just frustrating to see a ""complete upper"" for sale that is useless with out the BCG. Sure it clearly states the BCG is missing, but I betcha there are a few new guys in the game that don't catch that. They get their complete upper only to find out it is not complete. And their AR Build is put on hold indefinately. And the new guys, the guys we are supposed to be helping, has almost no possible way to get a BCG. About the only thing he'll get is an education. Come on people. Is this about the all mighty dollar? Or are we better than that?

Due to the structure of our operations, this would be entirely possible, hopefully without significant disruption to production.

The legislators drafting these measures do so in spite of the fact that nothing they are proposing will do anything to even marginally improve public safety in CO, and in fact, will leave law-abiding CO residents less able to defend themselves, strip away rights and property from residents who have done nothing wrong, and send nearly 1000 jobs and millions in tax revenue out of the state.

If you are not local you need to pay an additional $75 for FFA dealer to ship it as thats what my local Gander Mountain told me it would cost me to have it shipped.

PS: Please do not ask email me about other items that are not posted on here. I am only selling a (Taurus .17 Revolver), (Bersa Thunder 380), and a (Remington Model 710 30-06 Riffle with Scope).

I have a brand new Korstog rifle that is manufactured by Adams Arms for them this is a quality rifle thats brand new to the market place. Included is a ton of extra that didn't originally come with the rifle starting with a rear sight made by UTG, (3) 30 round magazine by Syntec Mags, an Allen tactical style case, and don't forget I also included 2 boxes (40rds) of Federal 5.56 ammo so you can go straight to the range a try it out. All these extra would cost you well over a hundred dollars I'm including them with the gun that is brand new never fired.

I am only selling this to pay taxes, otherwise I'd never let go such an amazing gun. It shoots with barely any recoil and has never once given me any malfunctions regardless if I used surplus ammo or factory. It is also incredibly accurate. Also worth noting is that these are the Arsenals that were manufactured from Bulgarian parts before they just started converting the Russian Saiga's. They are generally regarded as better quality than the Saiga conversions like the SGL 31-61, etc by many enthusiasts and sport some really awesome build quality. I wouldn't hesitate to take this gun to war, it has ran like a clock from day 1."

This rifle is in excellent shape mechanically and the function is flawless.. The stock had a few rubs, marks and dings, so I sprayed it with a very light coat of automotive black finish. It turned out looking new, but you can still see the marks, they're just all black now. I did no refinishing on the metal. It was cleaned and wiped with an oily rag. That's all.

It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are open to the public.

A whole new legend.
It may be related to the Model M82A1, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

The barrel is a very good shooter, only tried 107 SMKs. I am the 2nd owner. It has about 300 rounds through it. I only put 50 through it. It consistently shot 5 in the 1/3 MOA, and that confirms what the first owner told me he was getting using Varget. He bore scoped the barrel when new, and didn't like an area near the muzzle, so he had it cut to around 27.5” and target crowned instead of the Savage 11 degree. Very nice job on the crown. I have been shooting a 6BRX, so this one won't get much shooting time, so it's up for sale. The chamber on this gun is perfect for jamming. Some of the Savage F-Class 6br chambers had way too long a freebore. This one is perfect.
