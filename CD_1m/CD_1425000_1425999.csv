It was designed in Germany by Erma Werke.  It bears a striking resemblance to a Walther PPK and may fit in the same holsters.  Like a Walther, it is double action on the first shot, meaning the hammer does not have to be cocked to shoot if a round is in the chamber when the weapon is drawn.  This enhances its value as a defense weapon. Although many criticize the .22 as a defense weapon, I have never seen anybody willing to be shot by one.  Nine rounds of .22 hollow point can be very discouraging to a predator.  After the first shot the hammer remains cocked until lowered.  With a round in the chamber, one can apply the safety and then pull the trigger to lower the hammer because it has a hammer block safety.  It can easily be carried with safety on as it pops off nicely with a nudge from the thumb.  Sights are decent.  Bluing is excellent except for the place where the safety touches the slide.  I bought it as a handy outdoor general purpose pistol and can include a very sturdy ""Fidragon"" holster that keeps dirt and brush out.    One 8 round magazine is included.

274,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1425274,For Sale:  6.5 Carcano 1929 Beretta Gardone Italian Army Carbine,"Grey Forest, San Antonio, Texas",$ 150,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 9, 2013",Rifles,no type,6.5x52 Carcano                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Offered for sale is a WW2-era Beretta Gardone carbine chambered for the 6.5 Carcano (6.5x52mm) cartridge. It was manufactured in Italy in 1929, during their preparations for WW2. It loads from a 6-round clip which ejects out the bottom once the last round is loaded. It features a pivoting rear sight, adjustable out to 1500m – pretty optimistic for a rifle with a 17½"" barrel !

This particular weapon is in very good shape considering it is about 84 years old and was used in a war! It has the desirable and unusual octagonal barrel extension. There is no rust evident, and most metal pieces retain their original finish, though there is pitting on most of the metal parts. The bore and chamber both look good, there is plenty of rifling left, and there is little or no muzzle erosion. The bolt face was apparently rewelded, and it looks like a solid repair. I have never fired this weapon, but I would expect it to shoot well. All the serial numbers match on the barrel, receiver and stock, and there are original proof marks on most metal pieces, as well as a factory stamp on the stock. The wood has a nice varnished finish, and of course has a range of scratches and dings and some discoloration from use and age.

The sale includes a green cotton web sling with metal and leather attachments. The buyer also gets the first opportunity to purchase 60 rounds of loaded ammunition, 186 Remington Core-Lokt 140-gn PSP bullets, and a set of Lee dies for this caliber.

Another interesting aspect of this weapon is that it is nearly identical to the rifle used by Lee Harvey Oswald to assassinate President Kennedy in 1963. Much of the controversy surrounding the shooting centered on the question of whether Oswald could possibly have fired three aimed shots at a moving target in eight seconds – but if you buy this rifle you can try it out for yourself!

$150 cash and the rifle is yours! I'd prefer to sell everything as a package, so I'll be happy to make a good deal to anyone who will take the ammo, dies, etc. as well. I prefer a face-to-face transaction for cash in the Northwest San Antonio area. Please be prepared to show your driver's license or CHL and sign a bill of sale."

(I'm not sure why, but Armslist won't let me deactivate this posting). So let me stipulate here first that I'm a new poster here, but I am not new to shooting or online firearms transactions. I doubt any of you know me, so if you want to check my credentials you can see either my ebay or gunbroker account history for purchases and sales (username danalog02 for both). I have also been a long time USPSA/IPSC shooter with the North Tennessee Practical Shooters near Nashville, TN.

Hopefully this will calm the nerves of anyone who is interested in buying my immaculate black Rohrbaugh R9s (9mm) that I purchased new a few years ago from Outpost Armory in TN (a bit south of Nashville). I paid almost $1200 for it new, but of course I can't expect that back. I am also including the original documentation, carry case, two (2) total magazines, 4 extra recoil springs and a Desantis Nemesis pocket holster. I also changed out the stainless grip screws with black stainless for the blacked out look. I'd really like to get $850 shipped out of it to your FFL of choice. No ammo included. Gun has had less than 100 rounds thru it, just the occasional trip to the indoor range to remind myself what it's like to hang on to it with defensive ammo. Email me thru here for more info.

The Remington Golden Saber High Performance Jacket is designed for law
enforcement and personal defense and successfully combines match-type
accuracy, deep penetration, maximum expansion and near 100% weight
retention. This handgun ammunition is built around the hollow-point bullet
design and the spiral nose-cut feature permits mushrooming at lower
velocity without sacrificing penetration or terminal performance. The High
Performance Jacket is made entirely of cartridge brass, which releases
energy over longer distances while mushrooming. The cases are nickel plated
for reliable feed, function and extraction. Primer and mouth waterproofing
are standard."

Regardless whether you are plinking, shooting competition or dealing with varmint. It is very slightly used with roughly 100 rounds gone through it, then it sat in a closet for 6 years, receiving the slightly wear that comes along with that, so very very little wear. IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE CHARGING PUMP, however go to champions choice catalog and it is fairly painless to buy one.  On a personal note I enjoy these high powered air guns because it is basically a single shot 22lr and yet it shoots clean, without the grime that comes from cheap 22 ammo. By the way this rifle is a bolt action so no need worrying about a stupid charging spring wearing down. I set the price at $500 because this is a very high quality weapon and it actually cost me far more.

 This is quite the deal I'm offering here. Whoever buys it has the means to replace all the parts and essentially have a brand new pistol internally. All the parts and accessories would have to be shopped for separately and they weren't cheap. I won't budge a penyn under 500 bucks for it.  The holster allows the user to holster the weapon in a completely safe manner while one quick hard push of the weapon through the holster racks a round into battery, cocks the hammer and takes the weapon off safe.

 I will consider trades for other guns, especially 1911's or a S&W J-frame or a couple nice Mosin Nagants. NO trades for anything else to include vehicles. REDACTED"

_________________________________

Offered for sale is a WW2-era Italian Terni rifle chambered for the 7.35 Carcano (7.35×51mm) cartridge. It was manufactured in Italy in 1939, during their run-up to WW2. It loads from a 6-round clip which ejects out the bottom once the last round is loaded.

This particular weapon has been ""sporterized"" with a cut-down, reshaped and refinished stock. Despite being 74 years old and surviving a war it is in very good shape. There is no rust evident, and most metal pieces have good finish, with only minor pitting on some metal parts. The bore and chamber both look good, there is plenty of rifling left, and there is little or no muzzle erosion. I have never fired this weapon, but I would expect it to shoot well.

The sale includes a green cotton web sling with metal and leather attachments. The buyer also gets the first opportunity to purchase 206 rounds of loaded ammunition, much of which is in the original packaging from the days before WW2, as well as 72 shell casings, 146 bullets and a set of Lee dies for this caliber.

$100 cash and the rifle is yours! For $500 you can have the ammo and all the reloading components as well. I'd rather sell it all together, so preference goes to somebody who will buy the whole package. I prefer a face-to-face transaction in the Northwest San Antonio area. Please be prepared to show your driver's license or CHL and sign a bill of sale."

I mostly shoot 5.45 and also have a mid length 5.56 , so I no longer need this one. It just collects dust in the safe.

I am asking $650 for it. I think this is a reasonable price considering the market for these right now. Just check Armslist or Gunbroker. No price gouging here . The rear sight alone is about 70 bucks.

I will let it go for 600 if you don't want the rear sight.
