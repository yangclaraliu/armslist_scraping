Double Barrel Couch Gun. 
This shotgun has a 20 inch barrel. The stock has been chopped to a pistol grip. It has been professionally done and custom carved to fit right into your hand. A picatinny rail has been professionally fit and mounted on the foregrip. Because this shotgun is so small you can mount a front grip or possibly a flashlight for home defense.  The wood furniture is in perfect condition, recently refinished. The finish on the metal is in great condition with minor wear. 

This shotgun is just big enough to stay out of class 2. It's overall length is just over 26 inches and has a 20 inch barrel so this is the smallest shotgun you can have without needing a class 2 weapons license. It is a blast to shoot and looks and functions great!

if you are looking for a Mossberg 500 or Remington 870 forget it!  Everyone owns one of those. Buy this unique, one of a kind, custom shotgun and have some fun.

This is a beautifully engraved Springfield 1911-AI .45 auto. The pistol, a full-size (“’ barreled) 1911, chambered for .45acp, bright polished stainless and genuine Ivory grips. The work was done by Frontier Classics in Texas, and the work is excellent, and covers about 95% of the pistol, however all of the original Springfield markings remain. The pistol may have been test-fired, but it is in truly MINT (98%) overall condition inside and out. The pistol comes with the original factory plastic box, serial-numbered to the gun, and with a factory plastic holster, mag holder, cleaning rod, and manual (no extra magazines, however). This engraved Springfield Armory 1911 looks just like an engraved Colt, the only real difference is the price, which is quite a bit less than what a similarly-engraved Colt would sell for! * All ITEMS ONLINE ARE SUBJECT TO PRIOR SALE IN OUR RETAIL STORE. * NO LAY-AWAYS ON ANY ITEM* Please do not send us an email regarding this item unless you have a sincere interest in purchasing it, rude and/or inappropriate comments will be reported to Gunbroker.

There is an attachment (Safariland 745BL-2) you can purchase for about $15 on eBay that allows you to quickly and easily  snap it onto a duty belt. 

$65 shipped. Any questions email me at REDACTED or text me at REDACTED. Thanks

The Safariland SLS holster features a smoother single-motion draw, as well as greater protection from weapon take-aways. The hood can only be released by simultaneously pushing down and rotating forward, and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It's also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb-break snaps."

All of it is hard to find stuff as follows:

1 box original Black Talon ammo in .45 ACP - $60

2 (20) round boxes surplus 6.5 Carcano ammo with FMJ (nickel jacket) bullet - $35 for both.

2 boxes 30-06 Red Tracer ammo by Talon Mfg. - $60 for both.

2 boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser FMJ bullet & 2 boxes of 6.5 Swedish wood bullet ammo. The wood bullet ammo was considered to be ""blank"" ammunition when used with a special  adapter that shredded the wood bullet. However be extremely careful if firing without adapter because wood bullet can be very dangerous at close range. $50 for all four boxes. All of the 6.5 Swedish ammo above is non-corrosive.

5 boxes WWII era 8x56R ammo. This ammo was German made in 1938. This is the correct ammo for the M95 Steyr ""straight pull"" carbine & long rifle. The ammo is in amazing condition given it's age and each box and every individual round bears the date of manufacture, and the proof mark German  ""War Eagle"". The vast majority of this ammo will fire reliably and I shot many boxes through a M95 carbine I used to have. Recoil is quite heavy though in the carbine. This ammo is a ""very collectible"" piece of WWII history. Price is $20 a box or $80 for all five. Each box contains 10 rounds packed on 2 blued steel M95 stripper clips which sell for $5+ each on Gunbroker & Ebay today.

I know that flipped ammo prices have become the norm but add up the rounds and costs and it is clear that this is not at gouge rates. 

 You must buy all of this ammo together, I will not break it up.

To be straightforward I see rifle prices taking a huge dip over the summer and there are purchases I want to make so I've decided to sell some ammo to put towards them.

I checked whatever the reasonable Midway or Natchez lowest, ""out of stock"" price on ammo and came up with a reasonable total, therefore I am firm on the 755 because I added it all by cents per round. I will shoot and enjoy all of this and have no problem holding on to it.

These are very real 1 armed bandits from Reno NV back in the 80's
these are REAL $1 slot machines and would be great in any Man Cave/Gaming Room
By Law you can't use these for real gambling and are being sold/traded as fun toys for anyone's personal game room!!!!

BOTH work on Real $1 IKE Dollars OR $1 Gaming Tokens

One is a 3 coin 1 line machine
the other is a 3 coin 3 line Machine
both have been serviced and work!
I have $100+++ ship $1 gaming tokens, these sell from $3.00-$6.00 each on eBay
Next I have $400 in REAL $1 Ike Dollars you can buy these at any coin store and run from $1.50-$2.50 each
so in truth there is $1000.00 +++++ in just dollars and gaming tokens for the Machines

(I also found a site that sells $1 gaming tokens at 500 for $200.00 for an extra $100 these can have your own personal name or type picture on one side, this is a 1 time charge so any other coins you have made will only cost the price of the tokens!!!)

These type Machines sell from $1500 for a parts machine to $5000.00 for one that has all the bells and whistle. 
so was thinking around $4000-5000.00 for the pair would be very fair for trade value, as for cash make me a very fair offer. this means it should be very close to the trade value
I'm pretty firm on the value....
now if you want me to add the $100+++ tokens it will be $200.00 cash or $300 in trade 
for the $400.00 in the IKE Dollars I want $500 cash or $600 in trade value
Both those values are more then fair for what these are!!!!!
these were cruise ship tokens back in the 80-90s and why they are worth up to $6 each from collectors, and the lowest bid was like $325-3.50 each and just over $6.00 on the high end, and over 1/2 the Ike Dollars are at least BU/UNC  which fetches much higher value so up to even $14.00 so those could be worth a lot, but took yrs to collect so that we could have fun when you hit the jackpots, and it is great sound,

 These type front one arm bandit machines had big SS catch trays so when the coin fell in it made a huge noise besides all the bells, buzzers, and ringing the machine does, the sound of the dollars would get people to come to those type machines because it sounded like you were winning way more money lol :)
these are great fun coin banks!!!! NOT FOR GAMBLING!!!! ""(

ok lets talk....
coins are not for sale without machine unless they sell separately
 (if I sell the slot machine without the coins)
if so the lot goes and then will take offers on them
it took a long time to get this many! places would have less then $20 of them at one time. if only $1 or none.... so best they go with............................"

The full size is currently my bed side at the moment. It has Trij Night sights, extended barrel, and a leather Beretta right handed holster. Tho I have never carried it. I buy holsters for all my guns even though I know ill never carry them. It also has everything that comes with the gun new and probably something else i'm forgetting. This gun shoots exactly where you aim it, I was blown away. Between both the reliability and Accuracy! it may be the single best polymer pistol I've ever shot or owned. Very good shooter I cant say enough about it. No Malfunctions ever and its as smooth as butter. Its a gun where if you have the time you just want to pull out and rack the slid a couple times. 

The Sub-Compact currently just sits in the case it came with, along with plenty other pistols I own.  I bought a lasermax laser for it from Beretta along with a Beretta holster. Once again I never Carried this gun as well, so there's absolutely no holster wear on it. I also never shot the gun with the laser on it. This gun is spotless like new. I fired 250 rounds through it the end of last fall within 2 sessions. Really nice shooter as well. No Malfunctions and aim is very good for the size of the barrel. 

Besides the Magazines that come with each gun I have 7 extra mags. 4-20 rounders, and 3-17 rounders. both guns share the same mags for those of you that don't know. I have two magazine adapters for the sub-compact. The 13 rounders that come with the SC will not work in the full size because they wont reach of course."

The Luger has the earlier style of receiver that did not have a stock lug on the backstrap. The pistol has Imperial proofs on the left side of the receiver. Serial numbers on the pistol are matching, except for the toggle assembly, which is a replacement, and the magazine, however the mag is a correct wood-based WWI magazine. The pistol’s original finish exhibits quite a bit of wear with considerable freckling on the receiver, and holster wear on the tip of the barrel and the sideplate. About 50-60% of the original straw remains, and overall finish condition is about 70%. The original wooden checkered grips are fairly worn with lots of service marks, they rate 75-80%. The bore is a little frosty, but rifling remains. There are NO importers markings anywhere on the pistol. This is an honest early military Luger that has not been messed .

Our Holsters are comfortable from Day One. We use a very high quality Leather. Comfort is one of several factors that drove us to start making these. No weeks of uncomfortable break in here!
for IWB, I know many of us have bought DOZENS of holsters trying to find Comfortable. We hope we've found the magic mix of Comfort/Quality/Price Point. With the Option to remove the clips and wear OWB when you choose, We hope to add value as well. 


We're always open to requests, and can custom make something different upon demand. 
There are 3 holes on each side to adjust for ride/cant.



will be expanding my # of molds continually. Let me know what other guns you'd like to get one for and if I have enough demand, ill get a mold for it.

903,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1554903,For Sale:  Blaser Tactical 2 .338 Lapua Magnum,"Brandon, Jackson, Mississippi","$ 3,500","Listed On: Tuesday, May 14, 2013",Rifles,no type,338 Lapua                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This Rifle is in awesome condition, with less then 50 rounds, This is a must see and a much HAVE for any real rifleman. Below are all the factory spec. I am willing to travel within a 100 mile of my house to meet up with buyer. I prefer face to face transactions. 

The Tactical 2 is the latest, most advanced version of the precision rifle developed by Blaser. Each design element was driven by the requirement to create the best shooting platform possible. Exceptional accuracy and ruggedness were the key design criteria during development, with effective engagement ranges of 1500 meters or more routinely possible. Advanced engineering and uncompromising quality are evident in every facet of the Tactical 2. This is a rifle that will provide unparalleled accuracy for a tactical rifle and consistently reliable performance regardless of the operating environment. This weapon system is presently in use by by several allied forces in the war on terror and has proven to be one of the best precision rifles available to the professional soldier. 

The Tactical 2 is a bolt action rifle featuring Blaser’s revolutionary straight-pull action. When the bolt is closed, the 360 degree radial collet expands into the locking groove in the barrel. The straight pull action features no rotating parts and assures rapid reloading with minimum movement. By virtue of it’s design, the rifle can easily be converted for left or right hand shooters. A special advantage lies in the fact that the bolt handle can be configured on the non-firing side, allowing the shooter to operate the bolt without shifting the firing hand from the rifle. The shooter can easily change calibers by replacing the barrel and bolt head, in less than a minute, without special tools and no change in accuracy. 

Barrels are cold hammer forged out of high tensile specially hardened steel. The barrels are fluted and plasma-nitrided to provide maximum resistance against corrosion and abrasion. An M1913 Picatinny rail is fixed to the barrel, ensuring full compatibility with a wide range of optical sighting systems. When the barrel is removed from the rifle, no re-zeroing is required, since the scope remains on the barrel. The muzzle end is threaded for an optional muzzle brake or suppressor. 

The receiver is machined from aircraft grade billet aluminum alloy and is the interface for the barrel, bolt assembly, trigger assembly and magazine. A recoil lug of hardened steel is integrated into the receiver. The entire unit is fixed to the stock, eliminating temperature induced distortion. The outer surface is hard anodized. 

The ergonomically correct stock is injection molded out of fiber reinforced polymers and is absolutely stable, even under extreme temperatures. The butt plate and cheek piece are adjustable for length and height. The pistol grip has a base plate for maintaining hand position. The stock features an optional rear rest for setting rifle elevation during prone shooting. The stock includes sling swivel disconnect points and an adapter rail for mounting a bipod. The stock is ambidextrous and all components can be mounted on either side. 

The trigger system is fully adjustable. Trigger weight can be adjusted from 2.2 lbs to 3.3 lbs. The position of the trigger and the trigger stop can also be set by the user. The rifle has a cocking slide on the rear of the bolt housing. The cocking slide is operated in the same manner as a conventional three position safety. When the rifle is on “safe” (de-cocked) the firing pin is not under tension, eliminating the possibility of unintentional discharge. The rifle is carried in the de-cocked position and is manually cocked prior to shooting. The rifle can easily be de-cocked by hand. When reloading the rifle after a shot is fired, the rifle remains cocked. The magazine is a single row design and injection molded out of fiber reinforced polymer. The feed lips are stainless steel.
