Overall condition is pretty good for a rifle made in 1936 or 37. All numbers are matching. Most of the bluing is worn off. Years ago someone varnished the wood, does not appear that the wood was sanded, the varnish is starting to wear off in places. The rifle functions well as the Boys Scouts were using this rifle last year. I am not interested in trades, cash only. Thank you."

GET YOURS WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!! The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

I'm selling it because I got a new hunting rifle, and am not shooting this one enough to justify keeping it. There have been about 100 rounds shot through it, and was thoroughly cleaned after each time at the range.  I have put a Nikon P-223 Scope on it zeroed at 100 yards with P-series mounts. This scope utilizes Nikon's Spot On system for long range shooting. It also has a fore grip, mounted LED flashlight, and Troy rails. It comes with two 30 round clips, 275 rounds of ammo, a dual mag attachment that attaches the two magazines for faster reloading, and a magazine weld grip that attaches to the front of the mag weld to aid in movement and stability in close quarters and moving objects. I also have the original flip-up battle sights if you wanted to remove the scope, or have the iron sights mounted at a 45° angle. The price is $2,000 OBO. Must have cash, with valid TN drivers license and signing of a Bill of Sale. If your interested, or have any questions, email me at REDACTED, thanks!

 The Silver bar you see on the can indicates Silver Tip. 

The Silver Tipped 149 grain Boat Tail bullet in this ammunition is unique in that it has a steel shank in the center of the projectile beneath an exterior coating of lead that is bonded to the bullet jacket. This allows the projectile to stabilize in flight and provides the accuracy and penetration of a steel core round while not being harsh on the barrel or bore as is the case with a full hardened steel core. It is the absolute best of both worlds.

 Also, the Boat Tail Bullet is more aerodynamic and allows for a flatter trajectory and greater accuracy over a long distance.

 This ammo has a copper washed steel case and is berdan primed. The case neck and the primer are sealed for moisture protection. It comes packed in 20rd. military packs, 440rds. per sealed spam can. As with most surplus 54r ammo this ammunition does have some mildly corrosive components so remember to clean your weapon after firing.

Mostly just putting it up because i feel there's a vet out there that would appreciate it more than i do. I am not really interested in selling for cash, but if there's a vet out there with a nice trade offer, send it my way! Maybe a Beretta M9A1 or 92A1? These sell for $700-1000 but if i'm dealing with a vet, you'll be getting a deal.

Please refrain from sending me messages consisting of stories about your military hardships and why you feel you deserve the gun, followed by an offer of cell phones, body armor, etc. I feel bad turning them down but it has to be a trade consisting of something that interests me. Mainly looking for a vet who has an M9A1 or similar that would appreciate this more than their basic pistol. Other firearms may interest me as well so send offers my way!

Item Specifications-FROM MANUFACTURER WEBSITE:

Holds 30 rounds of .223/5.56mm Ammunition
Dark Earth Anti-Tilt Follower
Premium 17-7 Stainless Steel Spring
Reinforced Composite Magazine Body and Floorplate



The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine.

These pistols were imported (and that fact documented with the words ""EXCAM HILEAH FL"" very crudely stamped on an otherwise very nice case finished side plate) by EXCAM.

The guns are well made, this particular model has a brass frame and plastic grips with a thumb groove on the left side of the grip for the right handed shooter. The gun and stamping are solid, and I don't know much about Tanfoglio but I know EXCAM was some sort of importer in Florida.

I have had some nice guns, and some shooting irons. I've always shot everything I've owned, and this particular .22 small frame Single Action revolver has always been a great shooter. My dad picked these up at a gun show somewhere in the Milwaukee area, in the late 70's or early 80's.

Loaded with five, each one weighs in at 33 and a 1/4 ounce.  These guns are a solid hunk of metal, and they point shoot like crazy.  From the first shot out of the box, the fixed sights have always been dead on the money, but the crazy fun thing about these guns are that they are GREAT point shooting.  Yeah, I like high end guns, but when you get a good shooting gun like this, it's just a fun time everytime it comes out.
Sadly they have been sitting in a drawer for years.  I really want to sell them as a pair. 

Deer hunters used to buy these like crazy, for shooting at camp and taking into the field as a lighter weight belt gun to accompany the hunting rifle.  Fishermen loved having them in their boat as a snake gun. Just regular old every day shooters loved them for fun at the range or for a good pest gun on the old home place or even in the city with the wrong kind of snake.

$300.  Good deal- here's one that went for over $200.  Why not get two?
