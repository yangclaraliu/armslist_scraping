Want to Buy:

Looking for a cheaper option to obtain a milspec forged stripped lower receiver. Basically my thinking is that there is someone out there that has a lower receiver obtained during the craze, is realizing that things are slowly getting back to normal and wants to recoup some of the monies they spent during a moment of hysteria.

What I want:

I don’t care whether the receiver has a horse, a snake or Mickey Mouse on it and trying to convince me that a symbol makes a difference might be met with a frown but certainly not a response (truthfully though if I had the choice I would like a stag or a spider symbol but it doesn’t matter much to me). If you have any questions about whether I would like your receiver just send me the part number and I will respond with a yeah or nah verdict.

What I don’t want:

  80%, anything polymer, anything that has been “experimented” on (sorry but crayon and nail polish “upgrades” will just piss me off and force me to not do business with you) and finally anything that doesn’t have a good track record of accepting standard USGI or PMAGs .

About me:

I am completely legit NH concealed carry permit holder, NH resident, proud American and a card carrying NRA member. I do not screw people over and refuse to be screwed over so if you are looking to play games or get rich I can assure you I am not the one. In closing I just want to take a moment and apologize to anyone who may find this message curt or mean but then again anyone that I would care to apologize to would understand the curtness of this message when dealing at this site."

You will like this little snubbie. I love these revolvers. Get a Smith for the price or a little more than a Taurus and have a gun you can trust your life with. Easy to train your wife, girl friend or daughter to use for protection. No jam worries here. Get her shooting right a the range and 5 shots is all she'll need to protect herself. Of, you can use it as an inside the pant, pocket or ankle gun. Works either way. 

I would like to trade this for a .357 2"" Smith if you have one you want to work a deal for. Of course both sets of grips would be included in a deal for the .357 S&W.

Will also trade for a fair amount of .38 special ammo.

For daylight operation, choose the high contrast black reticle for precision aiming out to 600 yards, or switch to red or green for better contrast and faster targeting. Like all Burris optics, the AR-332 is waterproof and built to last. Multi-coated lenses reduce glare and ensure brighter images. Lightweight and compact, it comes with integrated lens covers and a Picatinny rail mounting bracket. It also easily mounts on an AR carry handle. This Close Quarters reticle performs at long range with proven Ballistic Plex style drop compensation. It includes integrated lens covers, multicoated lenses and a Picatinny rail mounting bracket.
- Comes with box and all paperwork

Built from premium parts kits with all matching #’s. All have chrome lined barrels with excellent bores. Todays new made AK type rifles do not have the same quality as these military issue rifles. Because of barrel import bans modern AK’s are sold with ordinary steel barrels which wear & corrode faster than chrome barrels. Those with original European fire control parts require US magazine follower. Others I have with US triggers take any hi cap mag. Each gun supplied with 2 of the correct mags. Universal US made followers available @ $6ea.

Will accept Paypal or Money Order. Sorry no trades.
If you are buying an AK it is important to know what you are buying. ATF stopped import of certain parts of the AK, most importantly the barrels. Therefore most of your AK 47's today will have miss matched US made barrels, some chrome lined some not. The days it is hard to find an AK which is built right, IE:  with the correct high quality imported chrome lined barrels because the parts have all dried up."

The LCP .380 with Laserguard helps LCP owners get on target quickly and
assuredly through the use of the easy-to-find red laser dot. When gripping
the pistol normally, the instinctive front-activation button allows
shooters to project the laser wherever the gun is aimed. This provides
immediate feedback and gives shooters confidence their shots will hit their
target.

I wanted to keep this rifle build fairly simple considering it was made with Russian tools in Egypt. The upgrade on this rife were aimed more for function rather than the more abundant tactic-cool rifles that are becoming more and more popular. The mods start with a tapco ak74 muzzle break which by chance functions excellent,Significant recoil reduction. The standard front sight post was removed and replaced with a hi-viz style tapco post,green in color. I installed a tapco single hook trigger which was an excellent upgrade from the stock trigger which had alot of trigger snap.i also installed a recoil buffer to reduce wear on Internal parts,along with an enhanced notched safety that holds the bolt carrier group from being closed between reloads.
Brown U.S palm grip installed.

I love this rifle. However I have plans for another build to keep busy.
I've put 200 rounds through it at the range the rifle comes with a hard case ,U.S palm stock cheek pouch ,surplus cleaning kit, 10, 30 round mags and 1 drum. No ammo.
I really can't emphasize enough ,know your federal ,state and local laws. I will ship to an FFL ONLY as long as you pay for shipping. Please no low ballers or sketchyness.
I don't care what story you have,or  where you live. I will not ship to NY,CA,NJ,MA ,CN or any other state where firearm manufactures are relocating there business because of strict firearm legislation. But I digress... 

As far as trades... I'm looking for a medium to high end AR upper or upper parts along with a cash deal. I'm really not interested in anything else at this point but it wouldn't hurt to mention trades as long as there firearm related.

This is everything you need to hit the woods except a release and hunting tips. I have hunted with this bow for two years. A shoulder injury has put me on the sidelines, so the bow has to go. As you can see from the pictures, the bow is in great shape. There is minor wear of the lost camo pattern forward of the handle. This does not affect the performance of this bow. For more pictures goto: http://smu.gs/15wA4QQ and use password ""bow"" to see the pictures.

I added a Cisco flip cam (HD video camera) with a custom bow mount. This is great for getting video of the hunt."

617,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1497617,"For Sale:  1943 SWISSVALE PA. Military stamped pistol only 55,000 made.","Cumming, Atlanta, Georgia","$ 3,000","Listed On: Sunday, April 21, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Union Switch & Signal company of Swissvale Pennsylvania, primarily made railroad signaling equipment but received a contract on May 5, 1942 for the manufacture of 200,000 M1911A1 pistols.  The first pistols were accepted by Ordnance inspectors in January 1943, but the company received word that their contract would be canceled, due to a severe drop in requirements for the pistol.  Within a month U.S.&S. had signed a contract to supply carbine parts. On March 8, 1943 the company was officially notified that their contract had been cut back from 200,000 pistols to 30,000 pistols.  However on June 26th, when the contract was nearly complete, and many of the workers had been transferred to Carbine operations, the company received a letter of intent to purchase an additional 25,000 pistols.  The last of the pistols was shipped on November 27, 1943.  55,000 Union Switch and Signal pistols were delivered serial numbered from 1041405 to 1096404 with peak production reaching 650 pistols a day.   
U.S.&S. pistols are the second rarest of the M1911A1s (55,000 produced), only the Singer is rarer (500 produced).  None of the Union Switch & Signal 1911A1s have the crossed cannons ordnance stamp even thought the practice was standardized in late 1942. Also most of the early pistols up through about serial 1060100 received no “P” proof on the slide and frame.  From about 1060100 to about 1082000, the “P” proof was applied, but at the Left edge of the slide where the curved part meets the flat.  This was due to a poorly drawn ordnance drawing showing the placement of the proof.  From about 1082000 to the end of production, the “P” was placed in its normal location on the top of the slide (center in front of rear sight).  When the ""P"" proof mark is found it will be on both the slide and receiver and be of the same size. Notice the ""P"" proof stamp is smaller then Colts but still an uppercase letter.

The number of different machining operations performed by US&S on the parts for the pistol, was 600. These required the services of 658 different machines; 421 types of cutting and drilling tools; 239 different fixtures, and 447 different gages. While the Government owned the machines, gages and fixtures, US&S provided its own perishable tools. The receiver for each pistol underwent 106 individual operations, during which some four fifths of its weight was machined from the original forging.

Another interesting fact is the development of the US&S firing range, the design of which was later adopted by various pistol manufacturers including Colt. On the range each of the 55,000 pistols produced was test fired 21 times. Not a single pistol manufactured and assembled by US&S was rejected by the resident ordnance department inspector, of the 55,000 pistols fired by the US&S inspector before being passed to the Government Inspector, only two failed in one test. They were found to be completely automatic in action, firing seven shots with one trigger pull. US&S was consistently rated high in tests for Interchangeability of parts.  The test was conducted once a month, the four producers of the pistol being required to send six pistols each to the key inspectors of the small arms pistol industry integration committee. The pistols were taken apart, the parts scrambled, and the 24 pistols re-assembled.

It is reported that Union Switch & Signal produced high quality pistols and did not experience the extreme production problems that Remington Rand and Ithaca had. The ordinance department reported the Union Switch & Signal pistols had a superior finish and consistently rated high in the interchangeability tests. According to the Springfield Research database a lot of these pistols were shipped to the Navy and the OSS.

This early example has the P on both the slide and receiver which is unusual. It was not acceptable for one reason or another and sent to the Salvage Crib to correct the malfunction.  This happened to many pistols, and is only noticeable on this one because of the late date of adopting the P.  There were so many, for example Ithaca sometimes had 10% or more, they became backlogged and often took several weeks or longer to get repaired depending on the severity of the problem.  By the time this pistol was submitted or resubmitted for acceptance the P proof mark had been adopted.  This pistol is a very collectible oddity ."
