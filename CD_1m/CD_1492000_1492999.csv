Here is a Rossi 20 Gauge Coach Gun. It has 20"" barrels, has the original Rossi butt plate. It is an older model with an S-prefix, 5-digit serial number, and the cross-bolt design. It is the same as the Overland model, but it was made before they were named Overland. Unfortunately, it was stored poorly and has rust and pitting on the external surfaces. However, the bore is perfect and I don't think I've seen a nicer one. The pitting is on the right barrel near the muzzle, the bottom between the two barrels, and on the barrel rib near the muzzle. There is also light pitting on the left side of the receiver, and a scratch on the left side of the butt stock.

The gun is nice and tight. The 20 gauge Rossis are especially nice because the frame of the gun is actually sized for a 20 gauge instead of just having 20 gauge barrels mounted on a 12 gauge frame. This is a really nice gun.

These Rossi shotguns are great because they are solid and reliable, and there are no extra safeties like the unnecessary tang safety that you find on currently manufactured hammered shotguns.

More photos available, just ask.

Price is $300.00, plus $30 for shipping and insurance."

I paired a colt upper with CMMG Lower.  Has a brand new, never fired 9mm bolt carrier group along with complete CMMG lower.  I've tried to take detailed pictures of the colt upper so that you can see the specific, Colt-stamped markings that make this a rare upper.  The magazine pictured is not included.  As you are likely aware, virtually no one is producing 9mm AR platform right now given the demand for 223/5.56.  This is a great firearm that is much less expensive to shoot.   

I will ship through an FFL to any legal state in the US for the actual shipping & insurance costs.  Local sales will be facilitated through a local FFL.  This complete rifle, since constructed has not been through live fire testing.  If you have any questions, please ask.  Call Eight Zero One 201-4568.

This is a Model 1894 takedown that was manufactured back in 1901. Chambered for the .30 WCF (.30-30), it wears a 26"" octagonal barrel. The finish on this rifle is completely original and there's quite a bit of it! The receiver retains about 80% finish with some handling marks and a touch of light corrosion along the upper left edge. The barrel and magazine tube retain even more finish and rate 92-94% overall. There are some handling marks and one ding to the side of the barrel on the right side. The rear barrel sight has been removed and a period Lyman No.1 combination tang sight (correctly coded ""DA"") installed. Judging from the finish on the tang and lack of sight elevator wear on the barrel, this tang sight has been installed for a long while, probably since the rifle was new. The rear sight dovetail is filled with lead. Some case colors are still visible on the more protected surfaces of the lever. The stocks are in very good condition with handling wear, some dents and scratches. There are no cracks or chips and quite a bit of original varnish is still visible on the butt. The butt-stock displays exceptional figure, particularly on the left side. The rifle is in excellent mechanical condition...the takedown is nice and snug and the action is crisp. The bore is very good, near excellent with strong, sharp rifling that is lightly frosted but without any pits.A neat old Winchester in far above average condition!

- Close quarters work requires split second target acquisition and aiming. The AR-332 delivers on both fronts with its unique Ballistic/CQTM lighted reticle which can be adjusted to match any lighting condition day or night.

Like all Burris optics, the AR-332 is waterproof and built to last. Multi-coated lenses reduce glare and ensure brighter images. Lightweight and compact, it comes with integrated lens covers and a Picatinny rail mounting bracket. It also easily mounts on an AR carry handle.

I have around 100 shells for it, a bandoleer sash and a buttstock shell holder,  hunting and target loads.

Its in good condition, the bores are great, lock up, unlock is great, shoots great, 
the only real wear is shown on the stock, its has a few cracks that are still holding strong, iv been to the range multiple times with it and they havent grown or loosened up at all.

The metal under the paint is good too, i have pics before i painted it, and the paint is rustoleum camo, quite a few coats on, with a satin clear on top, durable stuff under regular use, but with enough effort and chemical stripper, it can be stripped off to bear metal again.

when broken down, in less than 20 seconds, it can fit into a backpack easily, and deployed in the same short amount of time, in the event you find zombies roaming your town., and the shell holder on the stock with the bandoleer sash means youll never be without readily available ammo.. :)

The Bushmaster facility in Windham was closed and the employees were laid off. Soon afterward the original owner stepped back into the picture. He still owned the facility as he had been leasing it to Freedom Group since selling Bushmaster in 2006. He also had a 5 year non-compete agreement that was expiring soon. He must have felt as I do, that no one can make these rifles better than the folks in Windham, Maine so he decided to put another company together and put the workers back in business making these fine rifles. The new company was named Windham Weaponry and commenced manufacturing operations over the summer of 2011.

This is a gun I got years ago from a friend. On the Right side of the slide it says POLICIA DE LA PROVINCIA DE BUENOS AIRES followed by the serial number 79185 under that is slightly more worn and it says DAVIDSON'S GREENSBORO, NC  but still readable. On the Left side of the slide it says D.G.F.M - (F.M.A.P.) DGFM means ""Direccion General de Fabricaciones Militares"" translates into ""General Directorate of Military Factories"", FMAP means ""Fabrica Militar de Armas Portatiles"" translates into ""Military Small Arms Factory.
On top of the slide is also the Serial number.
On the right side of the body of the gun is also the Serial number again just above the trigger. 
On the barrel is also stamped the Serial number. All the serial numbers match.
I don't believe it has the original magazine which is stamped on the bottom COLT 45 AUTO, I think the originals had the serial number on them but not 100%.  Included with this are 3 additional Magazines a 9rd w/extender, 10rd w/extender, and 15rd. 2 state 45 Colt Auto on the bottom the 2 with extenders do not and I can't remember if they are Colt or not.
 Also I will be throwing in a box of Ammo if the offer is right.  
Shoots right on target. Great gun just don't need it anymore.

When searching for information about this gun I did find out based of the serial number it was made in 1953.

I believe this gun is in all original condition. Someone on a forum recently bought one for $800 in NC but his I believe was not in as good condition and the writing on it was not as crisp as mine. But like I said make an offer. I can email you more picks if your interested. Thanks"

Carried very little. Comes with everything pictured. These are great from a safety stand point. Easily and safely chamber and unchamber a round without engaging the slide or cocking the trigger. Safer to carry loaded with the double action with the hammer down, but after the first round you get that sweet short and accurate single action trigger pull from then on, unlike the LCP, KelTec or others, better aim after the first shot locks that hammer back. Extra mag and two magazines of self defense ammo, factory case, and a older leather holster. Must have a valid permit or CCW in hand for show and tell. If you want your wife to have a pistol, the 25 is what you need. That way if you make her mad she's not chasing you around with a 45acp. Loaded with straight ball you're much safer."

This revolver has a bobbed hammer and is double action only. 
I thought that someone had cut this hammer but it truly has not been. It is double action only, so it makes me believe it came from the factory that way. This makes this seems pretty rare to me!
I bought this a while back from an older Gentlemen I know, but not really sure about the age of this gun or the round count. I have only kept it in the house for personal protection. The finish in not the best, he kept it in the leather holster all the time. Not the best idea.
I have some .38+P ammo for personal defense and also almost a entire box of .38 fmj ammo.
The holster in the picture is also a S&W brand.
I  just put these Hogue grips on it and I also have the original wood grips.

I just recently bought this gun new from shooters supply, and outfitted with a rail and some Magpul furniture. I only shot the gun once, and put 120 rounds through it.

2 20 round boxes of Remington UMC 223 ammo     =	16
Magpul Moe AFG   =	34

Sling not included.

Total =  $ 1285

The PRICE IS FIRM. 

NO TRADES EXCEPT 9mm ammo (at 15 dollars per 50 round box), or an advantage arms Glock 17 22lr conversion kit towards the price of the weapon.

If you want the package minus the magpul furniture or quad rail, just subtract the price of the  items you don't want from the package, and that will be the price. (I can sell the accessories on ebay).
