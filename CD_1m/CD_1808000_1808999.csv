I will be fair on prices, but if it's needing parts or a lot of work I will not pay retail.  I go by bluebook value.  So, if it's missing parts or the blueng is worn off or other issues I cannot pay bluebook excellent condition value or what you see one on gunbroker for that has been listed for 30 days AND NO BIDS and a ridiculous price."

I purchased it about 3 months ago probably less than that. I have the receipt if the buyer wishes to view it. It has exactly 175 rounds through it, not a single issue with any of the various types of ammo I have used. Gun was made late last year according to the factory casing that comes with the firearm when purchased.

This firearm comes with the following:
-Case
-Fire arm with regular and extended magazines.
-All paperwork ( I did not fill out the lifetime warranty card so new buyer can do that if they wish)
-Factory casing and envelope stating born on date.
-Magazine holster
-Firearm holster
-Magazine loader
-Talon gun grips (Rubberized texture) perfect for added control and concealed carry as it won't rub you raw like sandpaper grips. I can remove these if buyer wishes before purchase. However they are a great addition feel free to google reviews on these.
-Mirror polished barrel/trigger lever/guide rode/pins not some cheap at home job professionally done and it shows.
- Firearm has been meticulously maintained in the short time I have had it. Stripped down bare every range trip cleaned and lubed. You would be hard pressed to find residue anywhere on this firearm.



Only reason for selling is I have purchased another pistol and do not need this one. I am in no rush so please do not waste my time with ridiculous offers, I will keep it. Btw this is not the essentials package it is the ""upgraded"" version with the extras that come in the case.

$400 must sign bill of sale

Pictures can be seen below. You can see just how good the barrel is polished in first picture, all other parts are the same quality. I can provide more pictures of the firearm via email at REDACTED or by text @ REDACTED"

I'm willing to throw in several hundred dollars for the right gun with the right goodies. Again, I wont physically have the gun until September just FYI. I also wont have any pictures until September as my grandfather cannot operate a digital camera.

The front sight was slightly tilted to the right, so I enlarged the screw hole and shimmed the sight base. Then I took the scope off, used a level on the scope mounts for reference, the rear sights were right on. After that, all the sights were on the same level plane. Used pieces of shim stock (1/16"" by 1/2 by 10"") across scope base, rear sight and front sight and looked down the barrel. Everything was almost perfectly parallel. Then, performed a ""trigger slop elimination"" and polished the sear/hammer surfaces. No spring cutting or angle changes. Results feel like about a 4-4.5 lb trigger with very little creep. Gun has only had about 10 rounds through it. Blueing is super, wood only has the one little nick shown in the pic. No box or papers, no sling but does have swivels.

As a result of these upgrades, the gun is astoundingly accurate and completely reliable. 1 hole groups at 20 yds from a rest accurate.  It runs perfectly on any ammo you stick in it.  You donât have to choose between accuracy and reliability. 
Magwell has been opened and blended for lightning fast reloads. 
Sights are currently Dawson adjustable rear and fiber optic front. 
Trigger is currently set to 4lbs. 
The Bad
The gun needs a refinish. It has been carried and competed with. I would have done this prior to sale, but thought the buyer may want a different color scheme than basic black and a better price to boot. 
Options
Sights - If fiber optic sights arenât your thing, I can install the factory tritium 3 dot night sights. 
Grips â The gun is currently wearing black VZ Aliens. Buyer can substitute with his/her choice of any grips pictured, including the Operator IIs on the STI. (STI not included!!!)
Safety â If you supply an ambi safety, I can fit it for you. (ambi safety wonât work with the Alien grips, but will with all others)

It does not come with extra mags.  It has maybe 100 rounds through it.  I bought it as a plinker, and never really used it.  I was active duty, and spent more time abroad than home.  Fast forward 10 years, and it is sitting in my safe waiting for someone to actually use it.  

These have a lifetime manufacturer's warranty.  I have researched the value and feel 250 is a very good price.  Aftermarket support is high, and the gun is a one owner low round machine ready for your ownership!"

This pistol was purchased new, opened-fired for about 50 rounds and then closed up. The pistol fired, ejected and cycled every round perfectly. The gun is very accurate. This pistol was designed to be the ""Glock Killer"", I'm sure some would agree and others would disagree but this is a very nice pistol in perfect condition. Literally not a mark on it. Comes with the factory box, paperwork, two 17 round (PLUS) mags, key/lock. This pistol has trapezoidal sights to help the shooter aim quickly and more naturally. As well as a low bore axis to keep the gun from jumping/recoiling. I wasn't sure if that was true until I shot it and wow there is very little recoil! The best thing about this pistol that many may not here about is the size of the grip. This is a skinny grip (compared to Glocks) and is much more manageable for anyone with medium sized hands. The pistol also has an integrated rail for lights in lasers built into the frame. This is a great piece and I don't want to see it go but I need the cash. Here is a link to my auction on gunbroker for this pistol. The pictures from this auction are of the actual pistol for sale. I'm listing here in case anyone local is interested and wants to purchase it outside of gunbroker.

These can both be purchased with the handgun, but they are not included in the above price.  Also, I modified this pistol.  I removed the pistol's pivot pin and replaced it with a H&K retaining pin.  This allows you to completely remove the upper from the lower receiver.  This makes cleaning much easier.  And finally, for the right price, I can include a 9mm barrel for the Finnish KP-44.  Modifying this barrel to fit the trunnion on this rifle would allow you to shoot 9mm ammunition through this pistol.  Email me for pictures.

It is a lot of fun, clay pigeon pieces, 12 gauge shotgun hulls and the like don't stand a chance at 100 yards. This model has a 22"" barrel that has a factory black matte textured finish, same with the target stock. This does have the Accu-Trigger and built in pictinny scope mounts, no iron sights. I have put about 300 rounds this rifle and have had great times shooting her. I will be selling this with the original box, and three magazines (two factory 10 rounders and the original factory 5 rounder), as well as with the tasco 3-9x 40mm scope that is on top in the pictures. The scope is clear and fully functional, it does have a white scuff on it but no other dents or damage of any kind. The rifle is in outstanding condition, I don't think there is a mark on it, except on the bolt itself as the finish has worn down from use. This is a great rifle and a unique stock configuration that is very desirable for it's looks and function. It's unfortunate that I have to sell it, but I need the cash.

It is a very old mine cut diamond that has been certified and appraised at $2250. I am looking to trade it for either a Kimber or Colt .45. I figure this should be about double the value of either handgun.
 Second, I have a certified black diamond that weighs over 9.5 cts. Try finding anything like this in any other jewelry store anywhere. This black diamond appraised at $3350. For this I would like to trade for either an AR-10 (.308) or some combination of Colt or Kimber .45. I would also be interested in a Colt python or anaconda as well!
