I bought a Para Ordnance P14-45 Limited in April of this year and immediately switched out the original adjustable sights with XS Sight Systems adjustable night sights. At the same time, I had the same gunsmith, Andy's Custom Guns of Arvada, CO., KG coat the entire pistol flat black. I then decided that I did not want adjustable sights, so I ordered a new slide from Para USA. Call me crazy. 

***THIS LISTING IS FOR THE SLIDE AND XS SYSTEMS NIGHT SIGHTS ONLY!!!***
This listing does NOT include any internal slide parts EXCEPT for the firing pin stop. You will need to provide your own extractor, firing pin, firing pin spring, etc. as I put these parts into my new slide. This listing does NOT include the barrel, guide rod, spring, or bushing. This listing does NOT include the frame or any parts associated with the frame, including magazines. 

The pistol was NEVER FIRED while this slide was on it!!! It is as new from the factory, except for the finish change. The stripped slide is $393.00 from Para. The sights are $150.00 from XS Sight Systems. That comes to $545.00. These are as new with no use or wear and tear. I have reduced the cost significantly by offering them for sale at $350.00. Price includes shipping. Thanks.

These HIGH QUALITY 80% AR-15 Lower receivers are TRUE BILLETS. That means they start as one solid block of 7075-T6 Aluminum and are fully machined down to military-spec tolerances. They come with an integral Trigger Guard for added strength and rigidity. There also have very subtle and slight grooves machined into the front of the magazine well for extra grip in any situation. The operations left to be completed are as follows: fire control group slot, trigger pin hole, hammer pin hole, and the safety selector hole. This is a not an FFL item and can be SHIPPED TO YOUR DOOR. This is not a complete receiver and still requires some machining in order to have a fully operational firearm.

For those who are not, their warranty is lifelong, transferrable, and unconditional. They will repair or replace your broken or damaged optic no matter the reason.
Read the details here:
http://www.vortexoptics.com/content/vip_warranty

The RS Regulate AKML mount is rock-solid. Your optic will keep its zero when taking the mount off and on your rifle.

I purchased both of these a little over a month ago. For the Vortex I payed $199.95 and for the AKML mount I payed $135, both from AIM Surplus. The reason I'm selling:
1) I didn't know how bad my astigmatism had gotten until looking through the SPARC. What is a 2 MOA dot appears to me as roughly a 8 MOA dot. My astigmatism makes lights look all fuzzy, I didn't think I would have this problem with a red dot during the day. (The problem is not the SPARC, I've had people with good eyesight tell me it looks fine.)
2) I just picked up a VEPR and want to use the funds to get scope for it.

I'm asking $110 for the AKML mount and $170 for the SPARC (with doubler, and low/high risers), $280 for both. You pay shipping. Shipping will be exactly what it costs to ship to your location, no more.

Note: This setup does not cowitness. Takes one second to remove and get to your iron sights.

This is a great way to get lots of ammo all at once and not have to worry about sales tax, shipping, availiblity or limits on the amount you buy!"

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. 

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. 

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Accu-Set is an exclusive design for accurately controlling amperage or heat output. As you turn the Accu-Set™ control,
the indicator more clearly shows the amperage setting.
The precise control of the Stickmate LX allows the operator to adjust output by as little as 1-amp increments.
Users can always get the exact heat they need, unlike the step control design on competitive products.
Allows you to quickly select low or high range without adjusting the output leads.
100 amps AC.
With two AC ranges to select from, you have greater control of weld performance.
Varnish protects and lengthens the life of the coils inside for increased reliability.
The cooling fan runs continuously and helps to extend the life of the power source.
Five-year warranty on transformers, stabilizers and generators; three years on electronics (drive motors, rectifiers);
and one year on guns.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

This rifle was one of the designs that Remington Defense submitted for the Military SASS trials. This is a very nice unfired .308/7.62 Nato AR-10 style rifle meant to replace the Remington M24 sniper rifle. The US Military opened up SASS trials to all manufactures that built precision AR-10 style rifles. Like Remington Defense, FN, DPMS, KAC, etc. When the Military decided to postpone the winning rifle KAC filed a law suit against the US Military Department. The sniper choice of summited rifles Was the Remington XM110 because of it's reliability. The Knights rifle was a bit more accurate but reliability issued ensued because of such tight tolerances. In the end they selected the Knights Armament rifle. This is not only a collector piece but a shooter as well and it will only go up in value as the years go by. Truly an investment. Mounted on this rifle is a Leupold Military Mark 4 34mm tube 6.5-20x50 in Mark 8 34mm mount. This is what was used in the trials and is an awesome sniper rifle and optic setup."

A reproduction of the 1873 Single Action. This model is one of the most accurate in appearance while reproducing the Old West tradition of the classic sixgun chambered for rimfire cartridges! While maintaining the true to form classic design, our Single Action revolver is a hybrid of modern technology and manufacturing with the feel of the Old West. This revolver is crafted with a steel rifled barrel, with most of the mechanism and components constructed from a special formulated alloy that offers greater ductility and flexibility assuring long lasting reliability and durability. Black plastic chequered grips give feel and balance, while a manual locking safety provides additional protection with a highly visible red indicator showing when it's ready to shoot. This great little pistol is available in .22 LR and .22 Win Mag., and at a price that will fit any shooters budget without sacrificing quality.

A reproduction of the 1873 Single Action. This model is one of the most accurate in appearance while reproducing the Old West tradition of the classic sixgun chambered for rimfire cartridges! While maintaining the true to form classic design, our Single Action revolver is a hybrid of modern technology and manufacturing with the feel of the Old West. This revolver is crafted with a steel rifled barrel, with most of the mechanism and components constructed from a special formulated alloy that offers greater ductility and flexibility assuring long lasting reliability and durability. Black plastic chequered grips give feel and balance, while a manual locking safety provides additional protection with a highly visible red indicator showing when it's ready to shoot. This great little pistol is available in .22 LR and .22 Win Mag., and at a price that will fit any shooters budget without sacrificing quality.

I purchased this rifle brand new from a local Tulsa Gun Shop. I have put about 60 rounds (Remington UMC) through it using open sites and at 25 yards, groups were quite small, it appears to be very accurate at that distance.  Overall condition is 99%. Due to the price gougers and continuing ammo shortage I have lost interest in the sport. Includes the original box and the original (2) 30 round magazines.

I will sell to Oklahoma residents only WHO CAN LEGALLY OWN THIS GUN, over 21 years of age, willing to show me a valid OK Drivers License, provide me their DL Number and sign a bill of sale. If this is a problem for you, don’t bother responding.
