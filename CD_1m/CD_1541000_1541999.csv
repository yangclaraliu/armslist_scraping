The rest of the gun retains I'd say around 90% of the nickel finish and definitely shows it’s age but is obviously all original. Overall this is a great piece for the collection. The grips are in great shape as well. I tried to get some good pictures here and of course I'll try to answer any questions you have. Being an antique, this does not require an FFL

The 1200 and 1201F and FP are no longer manufactured and the Benelli Super 90 is the current version.

High quality lower parts kit that includes a superior ALG QMS fire control group. The ALG Defense Quality Mil-Spec (QMS) Trigger is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the QMS is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however the majority of the associated grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the well known reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs. Kit includes everything needed to assemble your stripped AR-15 lower. Parts are 100% made in USA!"

This is top quality ammo normally not available to the public. The absolute best you can buy in case you need to use your gun in a self defense situation. It is legal for civilian ownership, and many people including myself think that the best way to avoid complications in the event of having to use a firearm in self defense is to use the same ammo as the police would."

Many young men and women, on the occasion of becoming an adult, receive a .22 rifle, as a symbol of trust, maturity and their American heritage – and many other shooters, young or old, buy a Ruger 10/22 as their first rifle. Many elect to enhance the utility of this lightweight 22 rifle by adding a quality scope. 

Compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles. The eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of many full size scopes, but because of their short length they have to be mounted further back on the receiver to maintain proper eye relief. 

We have a Picatinny rail top mount for the Ruger 10/22 rifle that mounts further back on the receiver to accommodate mini-scopes in obtaining a full field of view. This four power scope, with it’s Range Finder reticle, can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This mini-scope kit is an economical and functional accessory for Ruger 10/22 rifles and especially for the Ruger Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled and stored.

16"" Deep x 33"" Wide x 12"" Tall. Outside dimensions of machine = 
25"" Sides x 37.25"" Wide (front) x 75.75"" Tall


The safe is very well built, incredibly sturdy with lock and key.  It is equipped with a set of two - 5 LED light strips that really light up and show off the quality inside. The outside and inside has been cleaned, old paint removed, and repainted back to its original glory. I replaced all the labels with brand new labels. I have wired the machine to be able to be plugged into any standard 110V outlet so it looks like the machine is on and running. The lower level can be used to store ammo. The lower level also can be filled with sand/concrete to add additional weight or the machine can be bolted down to your floor for security. This safe is strictly a theft deterrent. I did not install any fire, or flood proof protection. A lot of time, work and money went into this safe and it is very nice looking. I’m asking 750.00. Email with any questions. Thanks"

UPDATE:  Only have 3 left. Since they don't come with load assist buttons I bought some and during the install the magazine pin had to be removed. The mags look great and now they each hold 25 rounds rather than 10. Ammo is for showing it holds 25 rounds and is NOT included with magazine.

Cash in Person only
With the powerful, spring-piston break-action of the Stoeger X20 air rifle, you can propel .177 alloy pellets at a potent 1200 feet per second. The ergonomic cocking grip permits quick and easy, single-stroke charging. And the X20’s rifled, blued steel barrel provides accuracy and years of service.
The airgun comes with standard fiber-optic front and adjustable rear sights. The fiber-optic inserts—single red front and two-dot, green rear—make target acquisition easy in varying light and weather conditions. All X20 receivers feature an integral dovetail scope-rail. For added security, the air rifle has an automatic, ambidextrous safety, easily accessible on the rear of the receiver. The trigger assembly can be screw-adjusted for second-stage length.

X20 models are available mounted in a Monte Carlo-style stock that makes target acquisition quick and easy. Stocks are available in hardwood, black synthetic, and genuine Advantage Timber camo finishes. The raised, ambidextrous cheek piece lets you shoot comfortably, regardless of hand preference. Checkering on the pistol grip and fore-end ensures that you’ll have a firm grip in wet weather. A rubber butt-pad provides a firm shoulder mount and steady control.

Add an extra level of performance by selecting any of the X20 Combo models with factory-mounted, 3-9x40 parallax adjustable riflescopes.

The X20 is ideal for plinking and all kinds of target shooting, and takes the field with sufficient power for pest control and small-game hunting.

The Nano's extremely low profile, snag-free design makes it easy to carry
and draw from concealment. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis
the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is
simple to disassemble and maintain. The light, durable frame employs
thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass-reinforced
techno-polymer. The Nano's sights are user-adjustable with a 1.3mm hex
wrench. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine
release button can be easily reversed. Modular structure, ergonomics and
ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The USA, the Nano frame is available in multiple colors.

This Walther Talon Magnum Air Rifle is a powerful .25 caliber rifle that features a robust spring piston break barrel mechanism for maximum velocity with just one cock of the air rifle. At an amazing 1000 feet per second with a standard lead pellet and a zooming 1000 fps with a hyper velocity pellet, this .25 caliber air gun is an ideal air rifle for varmint game hunting, plinking and small pests. It's made of a strong, weather resistant synthetic stock. It's topped with a sturdy rail for holding the included 3-9x32 air gun scope with duplex reticule. It also has TruGlo fiber optic sights for use without the scope. Unique to this pellet rifle is its adjustable length of pull provided by removing or adding the included inserts between the vented recoil pad and the stock. This magnum rifle also sports a Monte Carlo stock design with a right-hand cheek piece and checkering in the grip and forearm. This Walther rifle has an automatic safety and large muzzle brake to ease its operation and handling. This Talon Magnum air rifle by Walther is one of the best quality, high velocity rifles with a black synthetic stock on the market.

The BIG magnum powder. This slow burner gives real magnum performance to the large over-bored magnums, such as the 300 Win Mag, 300 Remington Ultra Magnum, the 30-378 Weatherby Magnum, and the 7mm Remington Ultra Magnum. This powder is highly regarded by most magnum afficionados.  This magnum rifle powder has exactly the same burn speed as standard 7828 and uses the same data. However, due to the super short kernels, metering is virtually as good as a spherical powder. This allows up to 4% more powder space in the case and in many loads yields more velocity than standard 7828. Such loads are marked with an asterisk in the data to show where standard 7828 will not fit."

The asking price is less than I have in it (I paid $349.95 plus tax/background for the gun) plus probably $70-$80 for the extra mags and rail adapter. So because of that, the price is firm at the moment. This also comes with the original plastic case and owner's manual.

You must be legal to own a handgun in Wisconsin and preference is given to CCW permit holders. If I don't sell it within 48 hours, I am taking it to Gander Mountain or PT Firearms."

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years."

The shotgun also has a Browning brand case, and a non-browning shell catcher. All original OEM items that were included with the purchase are included (extra choke tubes, etc.)  This shotgun is one amazing shooter, is very accurate, perfect for trap/skeet, has a great weight/balance, and has amazing sights. Lastly I'm a guy but at 5'7"" the ""Ladies"" model just fit me better than the standard Sporting Clays Model. I will be uploading some pictures of the shotgun over the next few days. Currently I have the shotgun for sale on consignment at a Glendora, CA. gun shop, but I figured I'd also post an ad here.  Please email me with any questions, or offers. Since the shotgun is on consignment at a shop it may sell any time now so if you're looking for a beautiful trap/skeet shotgun then I'd recommend jumping on this great deal for a like new shotgun. Oh and I honestly don't want to sell the shotgun but now that I'm married some of my ""toys"" need to go. :-( Anyone interested can also feel free to contact or see the shotgun at Gunslinger's Gunshop in Glendora, CA.
