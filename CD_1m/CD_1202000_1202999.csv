This special corrosion resistant limited production AR15 rifle takes cheap surplus AK74 ammo, which will save you $500 every time you buy 1000 rounds. Buy 3000 rounds and the rifle pays for itself and is free basically, it would cost you $1500-$1600 more to buy the same amount of 5.56 ammo and 5.45 is arguably a better round. Super light recoil with same or better ballistics and velocity but tumbles on impact to produce some very devastating wounds. Wideners has 1080 round cans in stock right now for $180 but it can still be had for as little as $160 per 1080 rounds. Shoot 4 times as many rounds as your buddies for the same cost. For those of you that are not familiar with the AK74 or 5.45x39 caliber ammunition, see below for an interesting read. 

For sale is one brand new Spikes Tactical limited production run complete 5.45x39 caliber 16"" upper receiver group with the latest in corrosion resistant finishes, mated to a brand new Palmetto Sate Armory complete forged alloy lower receiver with 6 position collapsable buttstock. It has never been fired, and has a nice trigger pull. This Corrosion Resistant Upper features a Melonite finish inside and out, a top quality Lothar Walther Barrel with Nickel Boron (NiB) treated M4 Extension, Melonite coated F-marked FSB, Melonite coated Gas Tube, Stainless Roll Pin, and Melonite coated A2 Flash Hider. Built to handle the dirtiest surplus ammo with no ill effects and still be a breeze to clean.

During the 1960's the Soviet military made the decision to convert their assault weapons from 7.62mm to a reduced caliber of higher velocity. This was based in part on studies of the American made M-16 during the Vietnam conflict. They felt that the United States may know something they didn't and decided to follow their example. This did not sit well with Mikhail Kalashnikov who felt that the M-43 7.62x39 cartridge was sufficient for all modern battlefield needs. Even so he began work on a new weapon to chamber the smaller cartridge.
The task of designing the cartridge fell to a group led by Viktor Sabelnikov. Other prominent designers on the team were Lidiya Bulavskaya, Boris Semin, Mikhail Fedorov, Petr Sazonov, and Petr Korolev. Their task was to develop a 5.45mm low impulse cartridge that would be more accurate than the cartridge currently used in the AKM assault rifles.
The result was a small caliber bullet of very high velocity. The bullet also has good sectional density and a fairly flat trajectory. Despite being lighter in weight than its predecessor, the 5.45mm cartridge retained the same lethality as the older round. It can penetrate a 5mm steel sheet at 350 meters, not bad for a 53 grain bullet.
Another feature that contributes to the lethality of the cartridge is that it becomes unstable when it strikes an object. This means that although it flies perfectly well through the air, it tumbles violently after striking a target - creating a larger wound channel when compared to a normal bullet. This was accomplished by leaving a hollow space at the front of the bullet which makes the round imbalanced on impact with flesh or wood.

REVIEW: This caliber is just great fun to shoot. We tested it in a Romanian rifle with eight 30 round magazines. Recoil is SO LIGHT and it functioned 100% of the time. No malfuntions at all. Overall, this is SUPER GOOD SURPLUS."

This one does not have much of the thick protective black paint left on it that was gooped on for storage originally, but there are a few spots that still show a little of it as you can see in the pics. Most of the paint flaked off when cleaning the cosmoline off of it when I first cleaned it up.....It appears there must have been oil or grease on the rifle before they brushed the paint on it so it didn't adhere well to most spots. The finish underneath is a light parkerized finish though and looks much nicer than the tar black coating. All numbers match on this rifle that I can see including front muzzle cap, stock, barrel, receiver, and magazine. The stock still has stock cartouche, small rack number painted on side of stock, & serial# stamps on forend are light but still visible. Mainly looking to trade, but will also consider cash offers."

 NRA Instructor

By completing this class you will then be eligible to apply for your Kansas Carry Conceal License through the Attorney General's office.

The class covers CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Self Defense, and Interaction with Law Enforcement. 

There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

You can bring your own pistol for the shooting portion along with 50 rounds of ammunition. I recommend using a .22 however any caliber is accepted. If you don't have a pistol yet or would just like to borrow mine I have a .22 Ruger.

ARMSLIST and all other gun marketplaces are community run for the most part. As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds. 

I have upset a few of the posters here as being a socialist.  I am far from that - I believe as a community we can police our own good and bad behavior.  Helping each other and fair profits are a good behavior.  I consider gouging a bad behavior.  If you consider it an acceptable behavior, buy from them at the inflated prices.

These folks only have a business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement.

NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but we have the Boulder Airlift from Magpul to cover our AR15 needs, and we can also find many of the other magazines now online.  Use a search engine to save yourself big bucks and compare pricing.  

After the panic that $800 Glock is going to be selling new in the gunstore cases for upper $400 to mid $500. When you find them now, that is what they are selling for NIB.  Nothing in the Colorado bills will change the pricing structure or their availability.

I personally believe every time I skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, I have just become part of the problem. Send them an email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back to where they all belong. 

I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy to a word file and please repost it later today or tomorrow.  The average life span of this post is about 20 minutes - this message is really upsetting the profiteers.

Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The price regularity will only return if we make it. 

AR-15: $600-$1400 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)
AK-47: $400-$900
SKS: $300-$500
SCAR 16/17: $2000/$2800
AR-10: $1000-1600
Glock: $400-600
10/22: $229
ACR: $2000
1911: $600-$1100
9mm ammo: $0.30/round is on the higher end
223/5.56: $0.40/round is on the higher end
.308/7.62 NATO: maybe up to $1/round (but on high side)
.22: $0.05/round is high

Again, feel free to add your $0.02, make changes, repost, and if you believe they are overpriced flag them. That is why Armslist has the flag option – it is intended to be community regulated."
