This is one bad ass piston rifle.

I am asking MUCH less than what these are going for right now.  Comes with everything you see in the pics below.  The factory box, the HK 30rd magazine, the owners manual, the HK tool, the HK front and rear sight posts (never installed on the rifle....the rails do not have a single mark on them..).  It's date code is BB (2011).

You opening this ad shows that you know the quality of HK firearms...they are simply the best fit and finish out of every single firearm item I own.

I do accept Discrete Paypal (+4% for their fees)  and I can also email more pics upon request...It is a beauty.

Asking price is $5,200 (this is a reduced price for a quicker sell).  I can ship FFL to FFL as well...I have dropped the price $300....I really don't want to post this on GunBroker...


In regards to the current pricing, please reference for sale threads like this: http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=330942745....And I am not running a bid system.  So you can buy it now for my price or best reasonable offer.

And there are others similar in pricing....I just don't like GunBroker....seems to be a way to completely rob people blind with their bidding...HOWEVER, if it doesn't sell soon enough I will have to create an account and take it to GunBroker."

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame"" and was the basis for the Model S&W500, the most powerful production revolver in the world. This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning. For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."

I dont expect it to be in perfect condition however the firearm must be in good working order. I am not 100% firm on the price so if something nicer and reasonable comes along I can throw down extra. Also have some .223 ammo (on Monday will have 9mm .45and/or .22lr ammo too) I can throw in if you are in need of or looking for ammunition. I'm expecting over 1,500 9mm and about 1,000 .45 (mainly all Winchesters) in this week (hopefully .22lr also) that I can throw down with the cash or whatever's clever.

Please email me. If your offer is good I'll send you my number back so we can discuss details further over the phone. I would post my number in here but last time I did that I ended up having to change my number due to telemarketers and prank calls. I do not ship firearms, I only sell them Face-to-Face. I may however ship ammo and/or accessories depending on where you are located (you pay for shipping). I will follow ALL laws so yes that means you must have picture ID & either CWP or PPP in order to buy any handgun from me. Thank you for understanding :)"

I have two Beretta 92FS, 9mm, Made in USA  for sale. These are new in box and come with two 15 round magazines. 
The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. 
The 92FS, Beretta's premier full metal gun, most resembles the military M9 9mm pistol. Accurate out of the box, this workhorse features an open slide design that virtually eliminates jamming, a safety system that combines de-cocking with a slide-mounted positive thumb safety, and a combat muzzle crown. Beretta's proprietary black, non-glare Bruniton finish gives your 92FS a wear-resistant coating, which means it will stand up to any special duty. The Inox model features a stainless steel slide and barrel designed for corrosion resistance.

I am constantly looking for good deals on large quantities of new .45 ammo to resell at a reasonable fixed price, regardless of the brand of ammo. My intent is to hold the line at or below $30 per 50 round box during this weird shortage for as long as possible. Yes, I make a couple of dollars per box, I make no apologies for that, but a small profit enables me to locate other supplies and quickly purchase good ammo for resale.

I have no purchase limits, if it's in stock and you have the cash, I will sell as much ammo as you want. It might be a good idea to email or text message me first if more than 20 boxes at a time is wanted.

At this time I do not stock any other calibers other than .45 (sorry, no 9mm or .22), I have enough problems finding .45 to keep supplied. Thanks to all of you who have bought my ammunition recently."

The Springfield Armory Black Stainless 1911 is a piece of art. The stainless steel frame and slide are finished in matte black, then the flats are polished, leaving a subtle dark tone in the flats that looks like a custom finish. 

The pistol features G10 grips, adding to the striking looks. VZ grip tape was added to the front strap. Like all Springfield 1911's, it has a skeletonized aluminum match grade trigger with adjustable overtravel. This Black Stainless model is fitted with black-on-black combat sights. The pistol has an ambidextrous safety, not just for left-handed shooters, but also for competition shooters who need to shoot weak-hand. Front and rear slide serrations are also helpful for competition shooters. 

If you're looking for a serious pistol for target, defense or competition shooting, but want one with good looks, you'll want to check this one out. MSRP was $1219 from Springfield. I am asking $850."

Barnett Quad-300 Compound Crossbow:
The Quad-300 is the fastest, most powerful production crossbow in the world. Barnett's leadership in innovation and superior technology is truly evident in this bow. Details such as the extended trigger pull which allows a much longer power stroke and the heavy duty components used in assembly are simply not found on other crossbows. The unique System 4 limb design, teamed with Radical Cam Technology and the continuous flight track assembly delivers incredible power, speed and performance. The Quad-300 is capable of delivering real speeds of over 300 feet per second when using 2219-XX75- 20"" hunting arrows. With this tremendous speed and heavy arrow projection, the power of the Quad-300 is bone crushing upon impact. In terms of speed and power, Barnett's Quad-300 out-performs all other production crossbows.

Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet
accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the
gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level
carbine features a 16' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with
Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible,
six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs.
The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice
on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of
velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock
makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

I am shocked to see russian made steel case ammo listed here for those prices and I can't believe people would actually be paying that much money.  A fool and his dollar are soon parted I suppose.

FYI everyone looking for ammo, don't buy into this whole market scare, ammo shortage BS--We gun owners/enthusiasts are doing this to ourselves! First, stop hoarding ammo that you don't need, Second, stop paying stupid prices for ammo, and Third...get out there and look around!!  Just last week I bought 120 rounds of steel case .223 ammo for $30  or about  .25 per round.  I also picked up 150 rounds of .40S&W for $45.   All you gotta do is ask the guy behind the counter when the next shipment is arriving, and be there when it does."

The Bushmaster Carbon 15 M4 Carbine is a unique hybrid of traditional AR15
design and space age Carbon 15 materials. The upper and lower receivers of
the C15M4 Type are molded of Carbon 15 compo which offers a weight
savings of 3/4 of a pound compared to the standard forged aluminum
receivers. In addition, these molded receivers are completely impervious to
moisture, rust or corrosion and offer a 40% increase in strength over
aluminum. The Carbon 15 material is the same throughout, so there is no
surface finish to wear off or require maintenance.

Its greatest value comes from the features that have defined the M77 Mark II family of rifles for the last 20 years. With a one-piece bolt that has proven to be one of the strongest on the market, integral scope bases which can never shoot loose, and a diagonally angled forend screw that adds accuracy by securely pulling the barreled action down into the handsome, black laminate stock for accurate shooting, the M77 Mark II Target rifle proves its value as a workhorse in the field and at the range."

This isnt a cheap set up for a .22 and its a very very hard to find one since the mags will be banned within months and probably so will the rifle unless you already own it. Makes shooting fun again when you can leave the range with 500 rounds of ammo shot for 50 bucks ?

If the mags are banned they arent going PERIOD I can try and find a 10 round to add in those are cheap online but I will not ship to states with size limiations PERIOD and I have google so dont lie to me I will check

Your funds have to clear my bank account first so if you paypal (which I prefer the funds have to hit my account ususally within 3 days and I will ship within 24 hours of the funds in my account. 
Legally speaking the gun has to ship to your FFL but the mags and other toys ill box and ship to you directly You will pay shipping costs (around $30 -40 not super bad and get it within a few days.

I do not list my cell phone and I am open to trades anything really I love military gear but guns are king so is coin silver and gold but any trade HAS TO EQUAL or surpass asking price

The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action. The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action. The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system. The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus. The innovative Noreen Bad News .300 WIN MAG provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. The Noreen 338 Lapua weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless, Piston-driven semi-automatic action Effective to 1500 yards Accurate, powerful round Modest recoil Weighs just 13 pounds Receiver is machined from a billet of 6061 T6 aluminum 26” barrel (1 in 10” twist) Full-Length picatinny rail on receiver 5 or 10 round magazine accepts 300 gr bullets Full Custom muzzle brake The finish that Noreen utilizes is not Cerakote, so it may scratch and show wear more easily.

The silhouette is 28 inches high, 32 inches wide and is made of 3/8 inch steel plate that is hardened to 500 Brinnell. Silhouette plates are rated to accommodate 7.62mm NATO, but have been shot them with .300 Winchester Magnum at ranges as close as 200 meters without ill effect.

LaRue targets are battery powered and will cycle through approximately 1,800 down and up cycles before requiring a recharge. After being hit, the target returns to the upright position and automatically shuts off until the silhouette is again hit and knocked down. This is the primary reason for the systems long battery life. It also precludes having to turn the targets off and on, although there is a master on/off switch.

The targets are weatherproof and can be left out without damage. Users have reported leaving LaRue targets exposed to the weather over a year's time without affecting their operation. LaRue Tactical stands behind the quality of its targets and will repair or replace any target that is found to be defective."
