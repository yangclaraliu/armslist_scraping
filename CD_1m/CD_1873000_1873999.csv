If you are new to the pistol market, I highly recommend that move onto another pistol. 1911's are generally recommended for the advance user who is knowledgable and familiar with the mechanics of the pistol. I am selling it due to current issues with the pistol and I believe the pistol needs to belong to a person who is more knowledgable than I am. Decide if you are willing to work on the pistol.
Issues:
1. A friend of mine who is very knowledgable with firearms inspected the pistol. He stated the pistol is definitely worn and everything appears to be stock.
2. Stove pipes
3. Does not cycle the next cartridge completely
4. I believed I have damage the recoil spring, by putting the opened ended side of the spring towards the recoil guide rod and firing it. I tried to replace it with a new Wilson Combat Spring, unfortunately it did not resolve the issue.
5. I was informed that I am the second own of the pistol, when I bought it at an expo in D.C.
6. I am unable to isolate the problem(s) that may be causing the malfunctions.

Additional Details:
Magazines: 2x 7 round magazines that came with the pistol. 3x 8 rounds magazines bought at the same expo.
Rounds Shot: 700-800
Manufacture ammunition use: Remington, Winchester, and Privi Partizan
Customization: The only thing I did added to the pistol was adding white out on the front sight. GI sights are very small. Some of you may find this humorous and the hardcore fans might be disgust.

Buyer will have to pay for background check. I prefer to meet in Colorado Springs area."

I began with a brand new in box DPMS Oracle RFLR-OC, a 16"" 1:10 twist barrel, an A3 style flat top upper with forward assist and dust cover, and a 20 round magazine.

I removed the factory hand guards, pistol grip, collapsible stock, gas block, and buffer.

I media blasted all the parkerization with Aluminum Oxide, soaked everything in degreaser, then gas treated it to remove the oils, then repeated the degreasing process until nothing came out of the parts.

I upgraded the handguard to a 12"" J.P. Enterprises free float and the factory gas block to a Troy Industries low profile gas block. The stock was upgraded to a VLTOR E-MOD and the grip to a CAA Mako 6-piece interchangeable for individual fit. The buffer was upgraded to a heavy buffer to absorb additional recoil.

All parts were then individually Cerakoted in Graphite Black and Burnt Bronze with the receiver getting a custom tiger striping, and oven cured. This is the most reliable and wear resistant finish you can get.

What you have is now an accurized, virtually maintenance free AR-10 that will turn heads everywhere you go.

Price for the rifle is $2200. Optics and mount were only put on for illustration and are not included. The rifle remains unfired. I am an individual collector, and this is from my personal collection.

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. 

Gun is new in box. We are not accepting trades, but we accept cashier's checks, money orders, cash, and all major credit cards. We can ship to a licensed FFL dealer, and all sales are final. Please make sure that you can legally own this firearm before you purchase it. Thanks for looking!"

I am looking to get $600 shipped, $550 cash FTF OR BEST OFFER

From the Sig Sauer Website:

SIG SAUER's new Classic centerfire pistols new .22 LR Rimfire models. The same P220®, P226®, and P229® that have been used by civilian, law enforcement, and military personnel the world over, can now have these same models factory built in .22LR. The SIG SAUER® Classic .22’s are built on the same frame as their centerfire counterparts.

All three Classic .22’s feature the same SIG SAUER Four-Point safety system which employs a decocking lever, a patented automatic firing pin safety block, a safety intercept notch, and a trigger bar disconector. The new machined slides also feature a front sight adjustable for drift and a rear sight adjustable for both windage and elevation.

With the purchase of a new SIG SAUER Classic .22 shooters can now enjoy hours of serious training at the range for a fraction of what they would pay practicing with full recoil centerfire rounds.

SIG SAUER Classic .22’s are shipped in a lockable case with two 10-round magazines.

Be sure to check out the new SIG SAUER X-CHANGE Kit™ is the perfect accessory for your SIG SAUER Classic .22 rimfire pistols. Now shooters can add SIG SAUER centerfire performance with just the change out of the slide assembly, barrel, recoil system, and magazine to any of the standard production pistol calibers; 9mm, .40 S&W, and .357SIG. Exchanging components does not alter the reliability or accuracy of either assembly.

Owning a SIG SAUER Classic .22 and a centerfire X-CHANGE Kit provides the added benefit of owning two pistols in a single premium package. More shooting at a lower cost with the full size SIG SAUER pistol you’re accustomed to; the SIG SAUER Classic .22 caliber pistols that now include the option for centerfire performance with a SIG SAUER X-CHANGE Kit.

The Owall Carabiner by Petzl is a straight gate symmetric carabiner that is designed for aid climbing. The carabiners oval shape prevents dreaded shifting when you're aided on sketchy placements. The Owall is great for racking because it was designed so gear doesn't bunch together. The snag-free keylock gate allows you to on-clip your previous hook placement without bumping it off the ledge. This device's oval shape facilitates use with a pulley and is easy to flip over making it ideal for pitons or etriers.

Incorporated into the Cordoba is the 10-mm tapered sporting rib favored by competition shooters and porting to keep barrel climb to a minimum.

The ComforTech stock cushions the blow when ammo isn’t measured in boxes, but by cases in an afternoon. The ComforTech system also helps reduce barrel climb and puts the shooter back on target 69% faster, so that the Cordoba just may be the fastest field gun ever built.

I fired around 4 mags (100 rounds) through it and the gun performed perfectly.  I had no intention of selling this, but my car has engine problems, and I'm currently on disability so money is tight, so I'm forced to liquidate a few things.

If you would like technical information about the gun, it is all available on Mossbergs website, www.mossberg.com ...

Altogether the new prices of everything adds up to over $500, I'm asking $370 + shipping.

It is in very nice condition and has the threaded barrel and original wood furniture. Has a very low round count and works flawlessly. I was told this is a paratrooper model with the shortened stock, and it has an AK74 style muzzle break on it now. I also have the thread protector so you can take off the muzzlebreak and go w/o if you want. I have a 5round hunting mag, and 1-30round metal mag that goes with the rifle. These are extremely rare and this one is in great shape. Might consider some trades but mainly looking to sell. I would trade for an FN five-seven pistol, Sig 556R or maybe a regular grade AK with some cash or a pistol added in. I do have some additional steel mags but they don't go with the weapon. The cash price is $1350 Thanks!"

The Blackwater Grizzly is a 6” SERE knife that’s virtually indestructible even in the most demanding survival situations. Built to get you home alive, the Grizzly is your ticket out of adversity. It’s the last survival knife you’ll buy. The experience and toughness that goes into Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape for U.S. Special Operations troops has created a hard working blade that is ideal for military and rugged outdoor pursuits. 
The Blackwater Grizzly is currently in use by Naval Special Warfare cadre and is designed specifically for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training. Ideal for both the demands of bushcraft and wilderness survival use the Grizzly also comes into play as a self defense weapon and edged tool. 
Custom serrations at the base of the blade flow through bone or branch. Made to be hammered, abused, and stressed to tis limits, the blade will stay razor sharp though extended use, requiring only minor strop. The ergonomic American G10 laminate handle scales with ""Bear Paw"" grip conceal a cavity for fire starter, fishhooks, and other survival gear. The hollow handle gives the knife a forward balance point that makes cutting, chopping, and hacking less fatiguing. 
The 6” sword-grind blade is machined from German Uddeholm Niolox niobium-enhanced stainless tool steel tempered to a Rockwell hardness index of 59. The thumb ramp features wire stripper jimping in the three most popular gauges. The Grizzly 6 is the ultimate combination of cutting tooth, strength and durability.

The gun is in great condition and is probably the firearm I have had the most fun shooting in my collection, the weight on the barrel and extra long cylinder make even hot .454 loads more like hot .357 and makes .45 colt shoot like 9mm

The lusterous blueing on the slide, barrel and other hard parts is nicely contrasted by the lovely walnut stocks with the carved S&W and Gunsite Raven logo's which is echoed in the Raven engraving on the receiver. The frame is made from Scandium. The sights are Novak low rise and make for a smooth, no snag draw from a holster (no front gold bead). The barrel is 4 1/4"" with a match grade barrel bushing. The trigger is adjustable. The gun comes in the factory lockable protective case with the original manual, barrel wrench, 2 S&W OEM ACT made, 8 round magazines and sealed packet containing the sample factory fired casing. 

I am the original owner and have fired this very accurate pistol less than 100 rounds of Federal and RP 45 ACP hardball. The earlier manufactured pistols like this one (SN FSP 0798) were completely hand fitted for maximum accuracy and reliability. The gun is in completely stock, unmodified condition since new. I will offer approximately 2 and 1/2 boxes of new RP (2 boxes of 50 rounds 230gr RN, approximately 1/2 box of Federal 230gr RN) to the buyer at my cost from about a year ago.

I play by the rules. For sale face to face only to bonafide Arkansas resident with proof of Ar residency, otherwise it has to go through (or sale to) an FFL. 

I also believe in describing an item accurately. Feel free to check my feedback on ebay (handle- achildofthesky )I am an individual and not a dealer or business and because of this, the gun is sold with out warranties of any type on my part and all sales are final. That said, if you have been looking for a truely nice example of these accurate and finely assembled and increasingly hard to find pistols you will not be dissapointed with this one. I have a couple of other high quality collectable guns I will be selling to help generate funds for a home purchase."
