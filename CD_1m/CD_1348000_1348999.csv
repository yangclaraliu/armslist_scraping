***I am willing to meet at a local range for test fire and accuracy tests***

I built this rifle over a year ago and only got to fire 140 rounds through it at the range. I was planning to use it for competitions but sadly I can't afford it any longer.

I'm only asking $1,900 which is more than fair for a rifle of this caliber. It's been my prized possession and I want to find it a good home. I spend countless hours tracking down only the best parts for the rifle and then piecing it all together.

I bought this about a month ago looking for a .22 caliber plinker, but decided to get a Sig 522 instead.

I did take it out of the box and discarded the box, but other than that it's got everything and has not been fired at all. I installed a new scope better than the one that came with it, so you get a bit of a bonus there.

These sell retail for $160 plus tax, I will sell it for $150 cash including the new scope. Not looking to make any money on this, just looking to get out of it a fair price. I'll even throw in a couple of 50 round boxes of .22 caliber ammo if that sounds fair.

I bought this about a month ago looking for a .22 caliber plinker, but decided to get a Sig 522 instead.

I did take it out of the box and discarded the box, but other than that it's got everything and has not been fired at all. I installed a new scope better than the one that came with it, so you get a bit of a bonus there.

These sell retail for $160 plus tax, I will sell it for $150 cash including the new scope. Not looking to make any money on this, just looking to get out of it a fair price. I'll even throw in a couple of 50 round boxes of .22 caliber ammo if that sounds fair.

Must meet at an FFL and you are responsible for the FFL transfer fee. In Greenville, I go to a place that charges $25, so that might be easiest. If you want the gun shipped, it will only be shipped to an FFL and your FFL must email me their license so that I can confirm the destination. Will not ship to states were AR-15's and high capacity magazines (30) are illegal. Shipping is $35 via UPS, if needed in Alaska, shipping would be $50.

Payment can be made in person (if meeting in person, price is not negotiable when I arrive, we will discuss the selling price prior to meeting), cashier's/certified check in person or via mail, credit card (4% charge on gun, or gun + shipping), or discrete gift paypal (4% charge on gun, or gun + shipping).

Why mess around with an AR15 that was built by a no body with no warranty and a big price tag.

I just decided to keep my two AK-47's because I have at least 4000 rounds of the 7.62x39 so I'll sell my only AR-15. I just like the Russian round better and it is a personal preference.

This is a heavy profile chrome moly vanadium 16"" steel barrel which has better accuracy and will hold tighter groups after repeated shots, than the lighter AR15 barrels. 

This model comes with a detachable handle, 6 position stock, and a Picatinny rail for simple optics attachment. The upper and lower receivers are machined from 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum forgings for light weight and added strength.

Comes with hard Bushmaster case and two Bushmaster 30 round mags, front detachable handle and a shoulder strap.

Also have 210 rounds of .223 ammo with additional (2) 30 round mags and (1) 40 round mag to throw in for the right deal.

Looking to trade for Glocks: G19 or G21SF or G32 (in either Gen3 or Gen4.) or a quality 1911. Will consider as partial trades other handguns as well. I like 9mm &.45 ACP.

I would prefer a good trade; but would also be OPEN to an all CASH offer for everything.

Send me an email with what you have or your reasonable CASH Offer. Any potential trades has to be in Like New Condition."

I am out of state but I want to get you guys as many of these awesome mags before that idiotic law takes effect in July. 

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

Shipping is via Priority - I am offering a discounted flat rate of $5 for CO residents only (I usually charge $10 for 5 or more mags... it costs me $12)

Prices for CO only are $24 each, $23 each for 5 or more, $22 for 10 or more and I'll do $20 for 20 or more. Again, these are CO only prices... they don't apply to any other states."

Mil spec barrel with chrome lining, chrome lining in the receiver, 16"" barrel (the shortest legally allowed without permits and fees) removable carry handle with picatinny rails underneath. Never been fired, kept in its case since I bought it. Unlike DPMS and other cheaper brands, Bushmaster anchors the bolt key, inspects the bolt for weakness, and magnetically tests the BCG. The bolt weighs roughly 1.5 ounces more than many lesser brands due to them shaving off the rear section of the bolt which compromises long term reliability and fatigues the buffer spring due to less mass and faster cycle rate than originally designed. The front sight is also made to be used with a flip up co-witness sight. something most rifles overlook. The collapsible stock has 6 adjustment settings instead of the usual 4, and the fore grip is thinner than others, which allows for a much better grip on the rifle. Bayonet mount and barrel notch for a grenade launcher make it as MIL-SPEC as a civillian can get from bushmaster. Comes with everything shown.

I'm getting out of the military and have no use for all of this anymore (except for the small amount I kept for myself).  These supplies save countless Servicemen and local lives in Afghanistan.  If some of these supplies seem ""too advanced"" for what youre looking for, youre probably right.  These are current military issued combat trauma supplies so these supplies are directed towards gunshot wounds, amputated limbs, sucking chest wounds, severed arteries, and shrapnel.

-(5) Quik Clot Combat Gauze 3in. X 4 yards (heat free/X-Ray Detectable)
-(2) ""H"" Bandage Comprehensive Combat Dressing (compression bandage/hasty tourniquet/emergency sling)
(1) HALO Chest Seal for sucking chest wound/torso wound

(1) NATO tourniquet (not new, used for instructional purposes and carried with me in Afghanistan.  This tourniquet will never break...ever)

(3) Disposable Large Chemical Heat Pack (great used when treating for shock)

It does have standard sights as well, which are under the  removable sight hoods.  The weapon comes in it's original plastic box with papers and 4 factory magazines and has had 500 rounds shot through it.  The gun still looks like new, with only slight scratching on the weaver rails from removing the sight hoods which I don't like when shooting indoors.  The only adaptation from stock is a set of ambidextrous grips as opposed to the right hand only stock grips, which I prefer because they more closely replicate my 1911.  I am attempting to purchase another 1911, so I am grudgingly parting with the Buck Mark.  The link below shows the only Target 5.5 available for sale, currently bid at 506 without FFL and other charges, with 8 days remaining.

The SAM7R Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability Summary: SAM7R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. FEATURES 100% new-production parts and components.

Parts such as the barrel bushing, trigger, hammer, etc. were polished and left in the white.  It now has pearl grips on it that were hand polished.

For those who don't know what blueing is, it's a a process that turns the metal blue (black), but will allow it to shine.  The standard GI, and most other guns, are parkerized.  Parkerizing is a similar process but coasts the metal in a matte black finish.

I still have the wood handgrips that I'll give with the pistol.  I also have 2 magazine that will go with it.
