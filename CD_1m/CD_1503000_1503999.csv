Comes with a Wilson Arms 24"" stainless bull barrel with a 1:8 twist, Versa bipod (if you've never used one they are a free float mount to track mobile targets, and extend with nothing more than gravity, and has a quick detach from the mount, olds forwards or backwards), Olympic Arms lower 6 point stock, 3-9x40 Bushnell DOA scope (Brand New from the box), 2x5 round Bushnell mags (brand new) and 1x30 round PMAG, 140 rounds of 55gr target ammo, 40 rounds of Hornady Steel Match BTHP, and 40 rounds of Hornady 55gr ZMAX (same as AMAX just for you zombie fans), and gun case.

The rifle was built on a challenge that deer couldn't be taken down with a 223. Within less than 2 hours we dropped 7 deer. Each dropped within steps from the hit. I was shooting the Hornady 75gr Superformance Match BTHP which for those ballistic/kinetic fans out there means that this rifle is one of the only that can achieve over 1,000 ft/lbs of kinetic power being delivered at 200 yards. Most other AR15s are achieving 700-800 ft/lbs.

As mentioned above this is a VERY sweet rifle. I'm in no rush or need to sell and I'm only selling because I just completed an AR10 build that is better suited for the land we hunt which offers, in some places, line of sight out to 3 miles. We don't intend to shoot that far, but i needed something with a bit more oomph at 500+ yards.

I'm not one of those price gougers/hikers who’s looking to rip you off. I live by a strong code of business ethics. I have just over $1700 in the package I'm offering and fully understand that I will not receive the amount in return. Therefore I'm selling the entire package as mentioned and within the photo for $1400/obo

Not interested in trades unless you're willing to trade an AR-10, and I'm willing to negotiate on reasonable offers.

It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator. The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. Proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. Operation: The .22 caliber HK MP5 A5 operates on a blowback system. The bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation.

All 1086 actions come with a integral .250” recoil lug and 20 MOA 1913 picatinny rail that runs the full length of the action, as well as a side mounted bolt stop that is shrouded to help prevent accidental releasing of the bolt.

The raceway on the right hand side has an anti-bind rail just below the ejection/loading port, the purpose of this rail is to insure smooth bolt operation as the locking lug passes through the loading port.

Apparently this thing is sort of a rare bird.  Remington only made the model 78 for 5-6 years and I dont see the lightweight version available at all.

I purchased this rifle in Oregon in 1988 simply because the stock stood out a little bit and I couldn't afford the fancier models.  This was my very first big game rifle I ever bought with my own money at the age of 13.

The rifle is in excellent condition for its age.  I've always carried it with the gun chap on it so there's no nicks or dings like you normally see on used guns of this age.  It's also a real tack driver with my handloads.  Sub 1"" groups at 200 yards are possible if I'm shooting good.

I have shortened the length of pull 1/2"" by cutting 2"" off the stock and adding a Pachmayr recoil pad.  The stock is hollow based to reduce weight.  The action is blueprinted, the trigger is set to 2 pounds and is tuned very crisp.  

The rifle comes with a new Leupold 4-12X40mm scope, weaver rings and bases, a leather sling, and the gun chap.

I haven't carried this rifle in the field in the last six or seven years due to the old scope losing it's nitrogen and having plenty of other rifles ready to go.  I put the new scope on it but this rifle is still the odd man out.  It might have been my first big game rifle but the last few are what floats my boat.

Better to let it go to someone that can appreciate it than let it sit in my closet collecting dust.  I think $300 is a fair price to ask.  It's a bit more than I paid for the gun new but there's over $300 in accessories on it.

I can completely wipe out all data from your hard drive for you, turning it into a blank hard drive. Data will absolutely not be able to be recovered with data recovery programs, keeping your identity and information safe. This is perfect for selling your hard drive if you've upgraded to a new one. This process is extremely time consuming. A 320gb hard drive takes a bit over 5 nonstop days to wipe. There may be a waiting time before I am able to get to your hard drive.

Note that your operating system (such as Windows XP, Vista, 7, or 8) will be gone as well from the hard drive. Plan accordingly.

this rife can really out shoot it owner, out of a vice this gun will shoot what i stated above with the proper ammo or load.

shipping/ face to face

due to the amount of money we are dealing with, im willing to drive up to 200 miles to meet from knoxville tennessee (with in tennessee of course). i am willing to ship on your dime via ffl.

no low balls, dont bother stating your case to me, this gun is very hard to find right now and when you do they are still 1500-2k with higher round counts in worse shape. this combo ran me 3k+ to build with out taxes,shipping, labor or misc parts.

Never been carried so there aren't any holster wear marks or anything like that (again, excellent condition).

NEVER FIRED asking 800.00
The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. INOX version.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

It's in almost new condition as it was reconditioned with the lamate stock before being surplused out.  All the numbers match and it would likely start to have some collectable value in time.

Here's the deal.  This gun is heavily modified.  I did it because I could and quite frankly the stock gun couldn't hit the broadside of a barn if you were inside of it!  LOL  Actually I've shot a few sks's and it was about on par with the rest of them.  

The action is glass bedded to the stock and is rock solid.  One can still remove the stock but it takes a bit of effort/prying to do so.  The action has been blueprinted and is very smooth.  The trigger is heavily modified to reduce triggerpull and creep.  A bit of grinding and welding involved with different springs.

This rifle holds inside 2.5"" at 100 yards so it's fairly accurate now.  I put about a thousand rounds through it then tossed it into the closet where it collects dust.  This gun just isn't for me.

Shame I modified an early Russian SKS so if your a collector this one probably isn't for you.  If you just want a gun that goes BANG everytime you pull the trigger and is extremely accurate, for an sks that is, then this is a killer deal.

862,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1503862,For Sale:  Stringer Federal Spike Strip System (NEW),"Savannah, Savannah, Georgia",$ 350,"Listed On: Monday, April 22, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The STINGER system employs high strength, hollow steel spikes that penetrate all types of tires – including self-sealing and run-flats – and deflate them in a regulated manner. This prevents blowouts, slows the perpetrator’s vehicle to a safer rate of speed, and allows him to make a controlled stop. And STINGER spikes are effective on all types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and buses.

Rock and Tilt Mechanism
The STINGER SPIKE SYSTEM uses patented technology to ensure effective tire penetration. A typical chase intervention flattens one to four tires, safely slowing and stopping the vehicle in just minutes. At the initial contact, the assembly automatically rocks toward the tire, pointing the spikes directly at the tread, allowing the full length of the spike to be used for penetration. And as the spikes pivot into the tire, the safety tip guards are pushed down. 

The assembly continues to rotate with the motion of the vehicle, driving the spikes deeply into the tire. The hollow spikes control the tire deflation rate, preventing a blowout and sudden loss of control.

The rolling tire then tilts the spike system in the opposite direction, allowing the spikes to pull completely out of the assembly. With the next rotation they are pushed fully into the tire – leaving no debris on the roadway. A tire typically picks up 4-6 spikes and deflates in 12-20 seconds.

Safe and Easy to Use

The STINGER device is designed for quick, reliable operation. A simple pull on the handle or a toss is all it takes to position the spikes. The single, accordion-action element deploys almost instantly, giving officers time to take cover. Extra-width road coverage and low visibility minimize avoidance by fleeing suspects. And, after spiking, a simple yank on the handle quickly retracts the unit, clearing the road for pursuit vehicles and other traffic.

STINGER Models
All STINGER models incorporate a reusable modular base, with molded sections built of high-strength, resilient synthetic polymer, which stands up to hard use under the harshest conditions. The base is designed to endure numerous pursuits and has withstood impacts in excess of 130mph. If, however, a unit is damaged, the individual sections are easily replaceable. And the connecting hardware is stainless steel for long life. The individual spikes are made of 304-T7 stainless steel for superior strength and effective tire penetration. All STINGER SPIKE SYSTEMS are supplied with replacement spikes, spike safety guards, a spike replacement tool, and a quick-deployment carrying case.

 The 15.5-foot Trooper model is wide enough for multi-lane roads. 

•Patented rock-and-tilt technology works on all car, truck, and bus tires

It is a Remington model 597 Sporter Stainless in .22LR.  There is a cheap 4 power scope installed, and will be included.  It's not much of a scope but it is perfect for a .22, and has held zero for many shots.

It has a 20 inch barrel, and while it isn't the bull barrel, it is still a very heavy barrel.  

I have read a lot of complaints about the magazines jamming in this model, but the only problem I have ever had with the magazine is the catch/release mechanism inside the action.  There was a pin that kept coming loose inside that when loose, the firearm wouldn't hold a magazine in place.

I developed a fix by installing an extra take-down pin that holds the pin in place, and now that it can NOT come loose, it has not failed once.  The magazine feels like a center-fire rifle when you install or pop one out of the rifle.

I have the stock plastic magazine, as well as 2 metal magazines from www.keepshooting.com.  All of the magazines are listed as 10 round mags, but the 2 from keepshooting really only hold 9 each.

Sorry, but I don't have any airtime on my phone right now, so e-mail is the only way to get a hold of me.  If you don't want to wait for me to check e-mail, go ahead and call my phone 3 times in a row.  I won't be able to answer, but that will tell me I need to check e-mail and get back with you asap.  REDACTED  Please allow 15 to 20 minutes at least for me to get back with you, as I have to leave the house to use internet.

I also have the key that can lock the trigger, as well as the manual for the scope.  $150 Firm.  If you need me to sweeten the pot, I will throw in a little bit of ammo, (I don't have that much to give away, but it would be enough to test it out and get a little bit of practice."

During the recent gun crisis I was always able to find ammo and it is still more available and cheaper than 223/556.  Plus it is powerful enough to hunt deer out to 150 yds or so. 
This platform is cheaper than anything comparable and there are a multitude of affordable modifications and accessories available - detachable mags(conversion takes less than 5 minutes) to very cool bullpup conversions (I just ordered one from Shernic Gunworks - checkit out on youtube - pretty awesome). These are very fun guns to own and in my opinion they are superior to the more popular AKs. - the AK is stamped out of sheet metal where these are milled and much sturdier construction.  The SKS also has a 20' barrel - is inherently more accurate and gives the bulet more velocity than the 16"" AK.  If you want something short like the AK drop it into a bullpup stock and you've got a $1,000 gun!  
I bought several the day after Sandy Hook from www.samcoglobal.com and just don't need multiples.  So I'm looking for cash or trades to enhance my vintage gun collection."
