I would like to trade my very nice to excellent example of the 1944 dated Mosin Nagant PU sniper rifle for an original matching New England Westinghouse M91 Mosin nagant.

The Mosin Nagant PU sniper that I offer up in trade is one of the better examples and is not currently and may never again be available for purchase (by maker and model year) by any of the major importers.

It is from the more desired Tula arsenal and has no visible [I], [X] or [/] refurbishment stamps on the barreled action, stock or scope, it's all stamped matching with the letter prefix's (no lineouts), has an excellent bore and the original crown, the optics are sharp and clear as well.

This rifle in not upgradeable within it's category and I wouldn't even consider trading this rifle if it were not a duplicate for me.

So... if you have an original and matching numbers New England Westinghouse Mosin Nagant you would be willing to trade for a very nice Tula PU sniper please send me an email and we'll get it done.

Many detailed photographs available to ""NEW"" owners considering a trade.

TIA"

This a fun and handy gun. My example has 2 magazines: 1 original and one aftermarket - both have fed flawlessly for me.

This old timer is heavily pitted and most of the finish is gone - hence the price. (How many Colt semi-autos have you seen for under $300 lately, of any model?). This is a fun, reliable, and accurate shooter that you can carry concealed or throw in the glove or tackle box without worrying about hurting its collectability. 

Did I mention that it's fun? It's very controllable. Accurate follow-up shots are a cinch. It's a great gun to break in beginning shooters, having limited recoil and muzzle flip.

I also have 131 rounds of fmj ammo and 17 rounds of 60 grain Gold dot hollowpoints.
I will sell all 148 rounds for $45, or sell the gun and all the ammo for $300.

Again, that's $280 for the pistol and 2 mags,
$45 for the ammo, or
$300 for pistol, both mags, and all 148 rounds of ammo.

445,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1132445,For Sale/Trade:  Guitars and guitar stuff...,"Lacey/Olympia, Southwest Washington, Washington",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, February 24, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for grabs: 
(1) An acoustic 6-string, which is an Olympia OD-3, made by Tacoma.  Some nicks and dings, but nothing major.  Pickguard was removed, and a string resonator was added behind the bridge, which is entirely removable.  Plays good, sounds good, and am getting rid of it to free up some space, as we are moving soon.  Asking $50.00 for it, but feel free to make an offer.
(2) An ""S-style"" electric guitar, which I bought off a buddy years ago because I loved the neck; straight, very playable, and with surprisingly decent frets and nut (nut does not seem to be plastic...I'm guessing bone or synthetic bone).  Body is banged up, and I began sanding to refinish, but decided I liked the look of the partially-sanded body, so I stopped.  Bridge is replaced by a pretty nice floating 2-point tremolo, and tuners are swapped out.  Pickguard is scratched to hell, and I replaced the pickups with a covered Gibson in the rear, and a Seymour Duncan Full Shred in the neck.  Never did the wiring, though.
  Other items included items:  An E-bow, which has never been used.  A pretty spiffy Dickie's padded gig-bag in woodland camo.  Seymour Duncan adjustable brass nut. 2 sets of Volume and Tone knobs in black and white, with the black set being Fenders, that are still in the original package.  1 set of the original single-coil pickups (3), with pots and switch.  1 unknown make/model humbucker.  Another set of pots w/ selector switch.  Several various switches: 2-way, 3-way, 5-way.  2 packs of Capacitors.  2-spools of 24-g wire.  T-style pickguard, all kinds of screws in black and chrome, extra set of tuners.  Original tremolo bridge (minus arm).  Danelectro ""Honey tone"" amp.  Amp cable.  Beringer practice amp (not pictured) that is beat up, but worked fine the last time I plugged it in.    Several sets of strings, which  are pretty old.  I'd only use them for the set-up, so you aren't wasting good strings.  A bunch of other stuff.   If you pay the asking price, I'll throw in a NIB soldering iron, with everything you need to do the wiring on the pickups.  You could have this guitar fully playable in an evening, even if you've never soldered before.  I just don't have the desire to finish this project, so it's been collecting dust for a few years.  Oh, and many of the items came from a now-defunct Mom-and-Pop music store, and still have the original price tags on them.  Asking $100.00, which is less than the cost of the two humbuckers I named.

Buy the whole deal (electric and acoustic stuff) for $125, and I'll throw in a bunch of old music books for various musicians/styles...from classical, flaminco, and irish folk tunes, to Billy Joel, Rancid, and 1990's/2000's pop.  MUST BE WILLING TO PICK UP IN LACEY!"

it's both a beauty to hold and behold. john lundemo managed to create a truly amazing, wield-able blade for its length, and david schlueter was able to create a rock solid, totally one-of-a-kind mount. it's been my favorite piece since i got it, and has made any other custom pieces i've bought-or even handled-since seem kind of boring, frankly. i always swore Iwould never sell it, but I've gone in a different direction with my collection. I've had this for about 10 years, so I'm not positive what it would cost now. At least $6-7k. I'm asking significantly less because, well, I'm not in this hobby for profits:-)"

This is the latest version of the Colt Gold Cup series model 05070X. From Colts site: The Colt Gold Cup is known as the finest shooting semi-automatic in the world, and is the standard for competitive guns. The first Colt Gold Cup pistol was introduced in the late 1950’s to give competitive shooters a gun to take directly from the dealer’s showcase to the firing line. Colt Gold Cup pistols have been used to compete in local club matches through the National Matches at Camp Perry. It features an Adjustable Wide Trigger, National Match® Barrel, Adjustable Target Sights, and many other refinements as standard. It is your responsibility to know if you are legally allowed to own this gun in your state. I will ship fedex 2nd day air for a flat rate fee of $40.

I believe in telling you everything I can think of about a rifle when selling...so prepare for a long description!

About this Rem 740:

Obviously the main attraction to a 740 is that it's semi-automatic. Semi-auto action in 30.06 is obviously quite powerful. Made in the 50's, they are old rifles, but many of them still shoot well. Being semi-auto, they are not as accurate as a bolt action (but they aren't extremely inaccurate either). I would rate mine personally very good for deer size game for 200 yards (maybe more, but 300 would be pushing it since you may miss the vital area you were aiming at). Only you know your hunting habits, so if you normally hunt in woods, where 99% of your shots are ~200 yards or less, then this is a good rifle for you. If you normally hunt in fields where over 300 yards is the norm...then personally semi-auto action isn't worth the bit of accuracy decrease for you, and you shouldn't buy this.

Reliability: 740s are known as hit and miss on reliability. Half of them are bad and jam a lot, half very good and don't jam at all. I've shot Garand era surplus ammo and hand loads and had good results with both, so I strongly believe this is one of the ""hits"" on reliability. I've only had 1 jam, and that was my own fault for experimenting with dry lubes. This doesn't like dry lubes, stick with the normal oil lubes (I use Gunzilla, which can be used dry or wet, I recommend using it and using it wet).

Personally I believe they are all reliable, but that half of the people don't treat them properly. Do not run the gun (or any semi-auto) un-lubed, make sure it's lubed. Do not store it for long periods (long as in between hunting seasons) with a round in the chamber or it may end up stuck since it's a chamber with tight tolerances. And don't store the magazine loaded for long periods, since the feed lips are sheet metal and the constant pressure will bend them slightly over time leading to less reliable feeding. Follow those rules (good rules for any rifle) and they are reliable guns.

Longevity: 740 barrels typically last a couple thousand shots. Because of this, they are hunting rifles, not target rifles (which is why I decided I should sell, since I love to target shoot, yet I refuse to target shoot with this rifle because I don't want to increase its shot count that much...so I'm not getting as much use out of it as I'd like). I'd estimate a couple hundred rounds through this one currently, and guns lubed with Gunzilla (which I use) often can have barrels last double the normal shot count. So this gun still has plenty of shots left in it, but will suit a hunter much better than someone that likes to let off 40 rounds every weekend for fun.

Magazine: 4 round capacity (so 4+1 with 1 in chamber). 10 round magazines are available, but wait to buy them. The magazine ban craze has increased demand for the 10 rounders and made them cost a ridiculous amount right now (which is dumb, since even if the bill passes, 10 rounders are still legal, why hoard them?). But once it settles down 10 round magazines are very available from multiple companies. It comes with the standard 4 round magazine which holds the action open after the last round and has a button on the magazine to allow it to shut the action if you don't want it held open. Helpful because after the last magazine round it's held open, then you can put a round in by hand, then hit the button on the magazine to close the action. So even after expending the magazine you can operate it one shot at a time without taking the mag out and reloading it. It's a nifty feature that I love. Do not store loaded for long periods. The spring is gonna last pretty much forever on this thing, but if left for months loaded the strong spring can slightly change the angles of the lips just enough to change reliability. This magazine was never stored improperly and has never ever failed to feed, it is a great magazine.

Cleaning: I clean and lube religiously with Gunzilla cleaner/lube. I also use a boresnake so that I don't do any rod damage to the muzzle area. You'll find this thing extremely clean and lubed, to the point where you'll have a hard time believing it's ~60 years old!

Scope Mounts: These rifles have no scope rail, they have scope mounts that screw into the top (and therefore stay zeroed better in my opinion). This rifle comes with a set of scope mounts (worth about $20, included for free). They are the see-through mounts: you can still use the iron sights even with the scope mounted.

Current Worth: In the current market I've seen these for sale on 3 occasions. Twice at gun shows, and once privately online like I'm selling. The gun show prices were $425 and $450 (the latter including a second magazine) and the online seller's price was $450. None of these included the scope mounts that I am including for free (cost me $20) and I am selling for a lower $350 price. Therefore I have to be pretty firm on that price, since it's very very fair already! I'm not in the gun selling busines or trying to make profit, I'm just trying to get fair value for a gun I don't get as much use out of as I should, so I'm not going for the high end of the going prices at all. You can make another offer if you'd like, but in all likelyhood unless it's the full $350 I likely won't take.

What's included?

This does NOT include the accessories in the picture (except the scope mounts, it does include those). But I can include some of them as follows:
- Recoil Pad/Reducer (brand new): $20 extra
- Stock cover with loops for extra rounds (brand new): $5 extra
- Sling + Sling mounts (about 1 month old, as if new): $15 extra
- Scope: not for sale, not included (family heirloom)
- Scope Mounts: Free/included (as if new condition)
- I CANNOT include any ammo in the deal since I hand load and therefore it would be illegal for me to sell the ammo I own, sorry.

Trades: I am interested in trades. 30.06 only since that's what I load! Like I said, I'm selling because I love to target shoot, and this is more of a deer rifle. If you have a cheaper bolt action 30.06 with a long barrel life then I'm willing to look up the normal going rate and take that amount out of the $350 asking price as a trade. Not looking for trades where I'd have to add money to the transaction though.

How to make the transaction?

I live in West Branch, MI. The fastest and best way would be to meet me there and do the transaction for cash in a safe public place. It's on I-75, so chances are if you drive much you probably drive by it and we can make the transaction then.

I can ship from my FFL to your FFL if you want to ship instead of meet, but you'd be responsible for paying the 2 FFLs/shipping and paying up front before shipping (you can use escrow if you pay the escrow fees). I'd assume that's not the most desirable way because of the extra cost for you though...but it's an option if you want it.

I also end up in the Flint/Lapeer area and the Ferndale (metro Detroit) area at least once every few weeks, so can do the transaction at either of those two places if you're willing to wait a week or two. I may need a deposit to be sure you're serious about buying before I'm willing to say it's no longer for sale though. Of course, there's more logistics/time involved if we go that route, but we can work it out on an individual basis if that's what works best for both of us."

This particular rifle is in the hard to find BLACK finish. It comes with all the accessories and paperwork as shown in the pictures. This is a super-hot item in our current legal climate, so don’t wait to bid or use Buy-It-Now. This configuration has the benefit of having similar feel, operation, and maintenance to the familiar AR15/M16/M4/MR556/HK416 variants of the standard US military service rifle, but is chambered in the much more effective 7.62 NATO round. It also has the benefit that it will accept most, if not all, of the wide variety of accessories that use Picatinny rail mounts. This rifle is, of course, semi-automatic only. (You have to tell some people) This rifle is superior, as are most SIG products, and will probably not be able to be re-stocked because of supplier backlog for a long time…probably longer than you have to get one before some anti-gun legislation prevents you from obtaining it! Now is not a time to wonder and wait, it is time to act! So bid early, or better yet achieve certainty and use Buy-It-Now! Other than statements made herein, there are no representations except that you will get the firearm in the pictures if you make the winning bid and comply with the requirements of the auction. All firearms, or firearm-accessories, should be inspected by a qualified professional (gunsmith) after change of ownership, and before new owner use, including this one. Any safety related repairs or adjustments recommended by the gun professional should be implemented before loading with live ammunition. Read and follow manufacturers’ directions before use"
