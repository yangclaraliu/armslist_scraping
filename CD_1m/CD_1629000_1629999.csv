I have for sale: Remington Model 742 Woodmaster 30.06 Sprg. Semi Automatic. This gun holds 4 in the clip and one in the chamber. This is a hunting gun and was used as a hunting gun. The gun must be kept clean so it  will shoots and auto reload without a problem. Gun has open sights and for me was accurate (I was shooting Corlock ammo no problems) but can jam on corroded or dirty ammo. Has a scope mount – not sure what type, looks like maybe a weaver - ? Gun is not perfect but in good shape. See pictures gun had a trace dot of rust on left side – see picture. Previous and original owner lightly sanded spot off. I added a small amount of dark blue to cover it up. I have just re-cleaned the gun and the bore looks to be in excellent shape. Remington barrel code is C W.  A magnet sticks to the receiver where the serial number is located on the left side. Price is $345.00 to sell. I am sure a bolt action gun with a scope is a better gun – so I don’t need to be told that again and again. 
My ""new"" rules: If you want to buy you will have to show me your drivers license and answer the same questions on a federal form showing that you can legally own a gun.  I am not interested in a cash offer that starts with the number 1 or 2 unless you have something to trade for plus cash or a trade that is equal or more in value trade. My first dealing fell through and I am again ready to sell. I may throw in a Baraska Scope Plinker model."

This AR comes with everything that came in the box along with some extras which include a quad rail, a fore grip, a rubber form fitting pistol grip, an extra pmag, and 2 boxes of ammo. The accessories are made by UTG which is a reputable manufacturer. You get everything you see in the picture. I understand prices are going down and prior to all of this commotion this AR sold for around $1049 +tax. I feel my price is fair in comparison with all of the similar Bushmaster AR's on armslist.com. There are some of the same Bushmaster models posted on armslist in upwards of $1300 without all the extras. This is a great deal considering whomever buys it will get all of the extras as well as save on the actual cost of the AR itself. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. I am not trying to make money off anyone. My receipt reflects I paid $1099+tax for a total of $1197.91 for the AR alone w/o the extras. This is the model that Academy is selling for $1099 + tax. If this ad is still posted I still have it. NO TRADES. Thanks for looking!"

The rifle features an upgraded drop in quad rail ready to accept any attachments.  The rifle has a  16"" Chrome-lined, chrome moly vanadium barrel.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine-length gas system.   The M4 profile barrel  is magnetic particle inspected and then phosphate coated to mil-specs.

The rifle has a full auto M-16 style bolt carrier group installed for better reliability, and a slower, smoother action. The rifle also has been equipped with a Burris AR-536 5 power tactical prism sight.  The sight features 10 different illumination settings in red or green, and has an integrated bullet drop compensator for a 55 grain bullet in the reticle.  This sight system is simply amazing.  The rifle also comes with 4 30 round magazines, a single point sling and sling adapter that has replaced the original end plate, a bulldog tactical case that holds 4 magazines, and 100 rounds of federal XM193 5.56 ammo.  The rifle has been bore sighted and the scope system has been zeroed at 100 yards.  20 rounds total have been shot through it to zero and check functionality.  All parts used on this custom M-4 are to military specifications and made in the U.S.A.

Just got this car last year, but have since purchased a piece of property in a very remote area of southern Missouri. We are building a house and moving down there as soon as it is finished, and the roads are too rough for us to even try to bring the Camaro down there. So, as much as we hate to list this beauty, since it will be useless to us in the deep woods, we are selling it. Bottom line price is $22,000. That is $2,924 under blue book (private seller value), and $7,990 under what you'd pay at a dealer or auto auction....so whoever gets her from us is getting a pretty amazing deal. A year and a half ago, we paid $27,000 + $7,000 financing charges for it...so $34,000 all together.  Used it for a year and a half and we're knocking $12,000 off what we paid for it.  It's fully loaded and everything is factory...with upgraded premium alloy wheels and low profile tires from the dealer...and there are around 23,000 miles on it. Thanks, and hopefully someone takes me up on this great deal, so we can get the house completed and move out there as soon as possible without worrying about where to leave the car.

Here are some listings for the exact same car....in multiple colors. You can see that the price we are asking is $900 lower than the cheapest ad on the page...and $7,997 cheaper than the most expensive on the page. So, you're getting the best deal around on this car.

It is one full case of Vintage Remington Kleene-Bore for Long Rifle. And to the disdain of some who do not believe me, I did drive over 6 hours to purchase this find. I drove 5 hours to Indiana and back.

I am asking for $1500 for this case and I will consider trades as well. I will not be seperating this case into bricks, so it is an all or nothing deal.

There were some who thought my original price of $70 a brick was insane, and they were right, so I raised the price. It is still under the estimated true value of $2000, plus there is the value of the original wooden case, which sells for up to $100 by itself at the antique stores."

Manufactured by KCI of South Korea , Glock drop-free magazines for your Glock .40 handgun. These aftermarket Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer (fully metal lined). This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height.

Fits all Glock .40 pistols such as the 35, 22, 23 & 27 models
Capacity: 31 Rounds
Caliber .40
Construction: Polymer/Steel
KCI manufactured and made to last.
This quality replacement magazine for a Glock .40 firearm is constructed from steel and polymer just like the factory Glock mags. Each will work with all generations of Glock's including those with ambidextrous magazine releases & can be rebuilt using factory magazine parts.

Like many new magazines, these have an extremely stiff springs from the factory. It may not be possible to initially load them to full capacity. Loading half of the listed capacity and leaving it loaded overnight before the first use will ease future loadings. These do take some break in time to get these to work in some cases.

Please note: This item is sold as is since it is an aftermarket Korean magazine and not a Glock factory OEM magazine. They are priced to sell no longer available and to most people are worth taking the plunge.

The accessories are made by UTG which is a reputable manufacturer. You get everything you see in the picture. I understand prices are going down and prior to all of this commotion this AR sold for around $1049 +tax. I feel my price is fair in comparison with all of the similar Bushmaster AR's on armslist.com.

I'm selling to fund another project.  ( So i can buy other firearms and over price them for a handsome profit ) 
Feel free to ask questions but lowballs and trade offers will be deleted. ( but don't be in a hurry because I buy and sell so much crap I have multiple email accounts and Armslist IDs- )

Sorry folks but $1200-$1300 just won't do it. (Unless you wish to drive to Cleveland ave in Columbus - then you can buy a brand new one )"
