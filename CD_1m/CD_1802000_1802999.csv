The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment.

Exterior dimensions 8"" X 10 1/4"" X 14"". Interior dimensions 6"" X(' X 12 3/4"" with a shelf. I recently obtained a longer gun that requires a bigger gun safe and so I no longer have need for this safe. This is in excellent condition.

Comes with mounting screws & instructions, security cable (bought separately), the 2 keys, and the shelf inside.

This is not a biometric safe that opens by fingerprint; only by either the combination of the four buttons or with a key. No interior light. The safe requires batteries for the button open/close operation. Full disclosure: although the button opening feature works fine, I noticed that the safe uses up the batteries quickly; and so I've been only using the key to open the safe. Maybe I'm not doing something right and you'll have better luck. The metal construction and inside hinges are outstanding for security. Can fit around 4 compact handguns or other valuables. Cost comparable to regular key gun safes.

Ruger 22/45 pistols have offered shooters the familiar feel of a 1911 pistol with the performance and value of a Ruger rimfire pistol. Sturm, Ruger is proud to introduce a thoroughly modern family of autoloading pistols, which combines the best of both - the New Ruger 22/45 Mark III pistols. All 22/45 Mark III pistols feature: An unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in the ""SAFE"" position. A magazine disconnect to prevent accidental discharge when the magazine has been removed. The first-ever visible loaded chamber indicator for a .22 rimfire pistol. New front and rear sights for faster, more precise target acquisition. New precision-molded polymer grip frame with a serrated front strap and checkered grip panel areas and back strap for a great appearance and comfortable, non-slip hold. A manual safety that positively locks the sear. An internal cylindrical bolt construction ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving-slide designs. A new, contoured ejection port and tapered bolt ears. Two ten-round magazines and high-impact case included with each pistol. All adjustable sight .22 pistols come drilled and tapped for a Weaver-type scope base adapter, included with each pistol.

It was made by the U.S. Training Rifle Company for training during the WWI years to our troops, cadets, academies ect..

It is in pretty good shape condidering what they were put through. It has a black walnut finger groove stock, and all the other parts are made out of metal. Bolt functions just like a 1903. Has the same weight, length, and feel of a 1903 springfield. There were made this way to copy it in feel and look so the soldier would be familiar with it. Bolt action works like a rear 1903 and firing pin inside bolt cocks and releases when trigger pulled. 

http://user.pa.net/~the.macs/USTR.html  here is a link to info on this rare training rifle. The most common found training rifles found today are the WWII era Parris Dunn rifles which are not as detailed and authentic to the original 1903 as these were. 

This one does not have a rear sight leaf and looks to never have had one nor a front sight and no rear sling swivel. In overall good shape and a lot of history behind it also.

The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

ATI tactical adujustable stock with pistol grip. (for a Home ""d"" shot gun a pistol grip WITH buttstock is better for control, its much harder for someone to wrestle this away in a struggle)

With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands."

This gun was purchased new in March 2013.  Since then I have put somewhere around 1000 flawless rounds through it (did not keep an exact count).  It has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  It does have an idot scratch (my first 1911) and faint stain in the checkering on the housing.

Offering at $2400 which is a $500 savings over retail/pricing for a new Executive Target  either directly from Ed Brown or from other online sellers (possibly more if you include potential costs for shipping, FFL, taxes).

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  
The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

Please no lowballs or offers to trade.  I am only listing to put some money into another project, if there are no reasonable offers to purchase the other project will wait.
Local FTF sales only at this time, must be willing to show Ohio ID and sign Bill of Sale.  If there is no local interest I may list on gunbroker at a later date."

So basically I bought a rem 700 and it shot amazing for a out of box rifle (1/2 moa) so I decided to leave the action, barrel, and bolt alone because every gunsmith said just leave it so I did! bought the aics so then it is 100% free float put the trigger and everything else on and after I was done with it. The best I shot was a 5 shot grouping of .297 MOA!!!!!! Most high powered 308 builds don't shot this well. I need cash so I can buy a bike! So NO TRADES!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Still looking for a trade....and I'm about to pull this add again...





Guys and Girls on armslist, I have some nice, well cared for firearms that I would love to trade for other well cared for FIREARMS... 

With that said (this might get wordy),  whatever standard you want to use for value is fine with me but if you are using what you paid during the ""pre-ban panic"" months as your value, then in fairness, we will use what my guns were worth then too... Please don't discount my guns to todays prices but expect to recoupe what you overpaid for yours 3 months ago...   example; a Taurus TCP .380 isnt equal to a Judge in value... I will trade the judge for one but I will also need about $300 cash (remember I have ammo to go with it)... Hopefully this math is understandable.... 

On to business... Here is what I have and what I feel the values are (I am trading not selling) :

Ruger Mini 14 Ranch Model 223/5.56 - With 10(30rd) factory mags+2(20rd) factory  mags+1(5rd)factory mag, Walnut factory stock+Choate Synthetic Folding stock, Scope+Ruger Rings, Cordura case.   = $1100 Trade value at pre panic prices and I want to sell it as a set not piece part.

Rossi 38 snub + 50rd box of FMJ + 20rd Box of JHP + speed loader + holster. = $350 trade value 

Mossberg 715T - 2 mags. Flat top version. Brand new. = $350 trade value

Winchester 370 - Professionally reduced and crowned 18.5"" barrel... $150 trade value

Taurus Judge Public Defender SS + 5 20rd boxes buckshot + 2 10rd boxes PDX + 1 50rd box 45LC = $650 trade value (there's well over $100 in ammo alone)

******WHAT I AM SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR:*******

COLT LE 6920 MAGPUL edition AR-15

.380 (specifically looking for a SIG .380, COLT Mustang .380 and may consider a taurus TCP) Not really into the LCPs

S&W M&P 15-22 (Rifle not pistol) 

******IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY OF THE ABOVE, PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME TO TRADE OR OUTRIGHT CASH BUY... IF I CANT TRADE THEM, I WILL EVENTUALLY SELL THEM BUT NOT INTERESTED IN CASH RIGHT NOW UNLESS YOU ARE ADDING IT TO A TRADE THAT I AM LOOKING FOR...

I love all you gun folks and Im not trying to be an ass, but my email has been flooded since I put up the original add with people trying to trade me everything under the sun... I hope I don't offend anyone and if I do, it was not my intent..."

A Ultra-Rare! 1981 mfg, RPB Industries sapM10 ""open bolt"" in 9mm cal. Comes with (2) 32rnd factory steel mags. These were banned by ATF and can absolutely never be made again, but the select few stamped SAPM10 (semi automatic pistol) were grandfathered in and considered exempt from this ruling.it has been said that there are less than 400 of these still in existence, most were picked up by class 3 dealers and converted to fully automatic weapons. This could be the last chance to legally own one of classic weapons! You may not need it today, but you may be glad you have it tomorrow! RPB (which has been rumored to stand for Rape, Pillage, and Burn... but actually stands for the initials of the company founders) manufactured the only semi auto open bolt variety of the M10 ever made, most were stamped ""sM10"" but a very few were made with the model stamped as ""sapM10"" (an abbreviation for semi auto pistol) These few are the only open bolt M10's which are not banned as assault weapons by the state of CA. This is a very rare variant of an extremely hard to come by pistol. In 1979, Wayne Daniel manufactured a semi auto only version and somehow (miraculously, I still don't know how he pulled it off) was able to get the BATFE to approve it as a Title 1 firearm i.e. a 'Regular' gun. The open bolt semi auto M10 pistol manufactured by RPB were initially made using surplus SMG parts bought from Military Armaments Corporation when they went out of buisness in 1978. The period of manufacture was short lived however as in 1982 - the BATFE reversed its decision on approving the open bolt semi auto guns when it was found that they were easily converted to full auto. Effective June 21st 1982, any new M10's made as open bolt pistols were to be considered Title 2 firearms (i.e. machine guns).... These were produced for less than 3 years and can never be made again. In case you don't believe that there is any way this can be legal please read the text of the ATF decision rule 82-2 which banned any more of these from being made but allowed the ones already in circulation to be grandfathered. This is sold as a unique collectible pistol, you are responsible for complying with all state and federal laws (i.e. don't do anything illegal with it, to it, around it. Don't think illegal thoughts, don't contemplate any hypothetical, don't ask any STUPID questions, and don't discuss anything nefarious even as a joke...)

These are steel core..  restricted as armor piercing by the BATFE. EXTREMEMLY RARE.

It goes for $2-$3 a round on GB in smaller quantities.

I need money now, and I'm looking to sell it for around what I've got in it...   60 cents a round 1,000 round increments.  Want less?  check GB for ""32 Armor"" and my auctions will pop up...   but expect to pay a lot, lot more.   

There's a lot of profit potential here...  I've never seen it sell for less than $1 a round...  and that's very abnormal for it to go that low.

All ammo is cheap stuff, either steel casings or mil-surplus, most is non-corrosive (I think the 30-06 and 7.62x54R is the only corrosive ammo, oh maybe the 8mm's too). If you have any requests for another caliber I don't have or would like 'more premium' ammunition feel free to make a request, I have access to all sorts of stuff, though I don't have much of a discount.

I'm aware pricing is not ideal, however it is in stock, and I can get much, much more (unlike most retailers these days). I'm only trying to make a few extra bucks so I can continue to invest in brass, and continue to supply our citizens with ammo. I'm using the profits to start up an alternative news website for my own personal investigative journalistic activities for the upstate NY region. So the slightly inflated pricing is funding a local movement for truth... if you're into that kinda thing..... or gave the slightest bit of a f'ck to read my long winded message."
