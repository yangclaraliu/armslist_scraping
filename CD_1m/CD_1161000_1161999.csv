INCREDIBLY HARD TO FIND!!! 

This is an ORIGINAL, un-modified Franchi SPAS 12 shotgun with the original, un-modified safety.  

This is one beast of a shotgun and would make the perfect addition to any true tactical collection.  Minor wear on the finish around the folding stock from very minimal use.  

The semi-auto functionality of the shotgun is noted to be in working order, however the pump-action could use some work as it is currently non-functional. 

The folding stock even includes the hard-to-find detachable hook!  

We're selling this strictly as a ""gunsmith special"" firearm as it does need some work to really make it 100% and it's not fully ready for the everyday man to take to the range.

  In purchasing this firearm you acknowledge that no warranty is included and it is STRICTLY A GUNSMITH SPECIAL FIREARM that is in need of repair work and no returns or refunds will be accepted."

FYI you can order a plain black phosphate BCG from RedX $115 it won't be nickel boron and you will have to wait 3 months to get it. But you can order one if your not in a hurry. I ordered this one December 1st 2012. It just came in today. I have no use for it, the gun I bought it for has been finished for 2 months. 

I had to go pay idiotic money at the beginning of the year for one to finish my gun. And now it's time to replace that money with what I get out of this one.

A little history...  
The metal processing of Suhl naturally led, during the Renaissance, to other major local industries, including gunsmithing and armoring. Suhl was a major producer of cannons throughout the seventeenth and subsequent centuries, and Suhl cannons were used by many European powers. A major arms company that was located in Suhl for almost 200 years was J.P. Sauer und Sohn GmbH, producer of hunting rifles, shotguns, and pistols, such as the Sauer 38H, until moving operations to Eckernförde at the end of WWII. Other prominent firearms manufacturers in Suhl included Simson, (also known as BSW and then Gustloff Werke under Nazi rule and Ernst Thälmann Suhl under Communist rule), and C.G. Haenel. The largest manufacturer producing firearms currently in Suhl is Merkel GmbH, who make both rifles and shotguns.
During the Cold War, the East German national shooting arena was located at Suhl, and hosted many top-level competitions, including the 1986 ISSF World Championships. Although surpassed in this respect in the unified Germany by the Olympic shooting centre at Munich, Suhl remains an important place to the sport. It hosts Germany's only school for armorers, and a well equipped museum of weapons."

  Product description from NAA:
""The NAA .22 Long Rifle is the most popular Mini-Revolver ever produced. With the many current accessories, it is versatile for many applications and is the standard by which other Mini-Revolvers are judged.

As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.""

My Mother Purchased this to replace a .22 Mag pistol and did not realize it was chambered in .22 Long riffle NOT .22 Magnum.

But more importantly, I've been flagged twice by scam artists trying to get you to buy their crap for 3 times the price.  Magpul announced on their page they will be releasing pmags for CO residents soon.

https://www.facebook.com/magpul

""We are proud to announce that within a matter of days we will be going live with a new program. Due to a bill currently moving through the Colorado legislature, there is the possibility that Colorado residents' ability to purchase standard capacity magazines will soon be infringed. Before that happens, and Magpul is forced to leave the state in order to keep to our principles, we will be doing our best to get standard capacity PMAGs into the hands of any Colorado resident that wants them.

Verified Colorado residents will be able to purchase up to ten (10) standard capacity AR/M4 magazines directly from Magpul, and will be given immediate flat-rate $5 shipping, bypassing our current order queue.

Our customers outside of Colorado, please know that our PMAG production will continue at an ever-increasing rate until we do relocate, shipments to our distributors in other states will continue, and that we do not expect relocation to significantly impact PMAG production. We are also aware that Colorado is not the only state with existing or pending magazine capacity restrictions; we are working on programs for other affected states as well.

Full details and instructions will be announced when we are able to go live; please watch here for the coming announcement.""

Made in the USA!

This item is BRAND NEW, and still in the factory packaging, I will try to get better high quality images posted very soon. When you want the best in sling and mounting systems for your tactical rifle then Magpul is a high quality product that's designed for the occasional shooter as well as for heavy tactical use. This will work on any type of sling attachment mount. Each end of the attachments has a small easy to use lock/unlock sliding piece that prevents it from becoming unattached from a mounting point accidentally which is my favorite feature. This sling can be used as a single point sling, or can be used as a traditional sling where it attaches to 2 points on the weapon. This is why I like this system for a sling, very versatile, well made, and solid piece of tactical equipment to have that can very easily switch from one weapon to the next.  

To get a hold of me you can email or text/call me at (Three Three Six)8zero3-3zero24, a text message is the fastest way to reach me though. I prefer a text or an email as I can not always answer my phone, but will reply immediately to any texts. Sorry, listing my number normally has caused me to receive telemarketing calls. Make me an offer, but do not wait long... because these items get bought up fast in today's market. I do expect this to sell at the asking price quickly because I have priced them to sell! I don't mind driving to meet if distance is a problem.

I will be getting some Magpul 32pc Complete Rail Panel Covers any day now. I sell out of them almost Instantly when I have them. So if you want a set at an unbeatable price just let me know and I can go ahead and reserve a set for you."

The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

""Magpul is proud to announce the “Boulder Airlift”, our program to make sure that responsible Colorado citizens have the opportunity to own standard capacity PMAGs prior to the potential implementation of pending legislation that would infringe on their Second Amendment Rights. The program will be open to all responsible CO residents, (with both billing and shipping addresses inside CO) and provide access to a limited quantity of PMAGs. Remember to contact members of the Senate and the Governor prior to ordering and urge them to oppose HB 1224.

Full details at http://www.magpul.com/colorado

Similar to the Berlin Airlift, the Boulder Airlift will bring much needed supplies to freedom-loving residents trapped inside occupied territory. While we plan to initially use FedEx or UPS instead of aerial delivery, we figure that $5 flat rate shipping will make up for any loss of “style points.” 

The increases we have made and continue to make in production capacity will allow us to open this program with very minimal impact on the number of PMAGs we are shipping to our dealers and distributors out of the state. We are also aware that Colorado is not the only state with existing or pending magazine capacity restrictions; we are working on programs for other affected states as well.""

This gun belonged to my grandfather.  He worked security at Rich's Department Store and there is a Rich's price tag you can kind of see on one side of the box.  Not sure if Rich's used to sell guns way back when? And he bought it for work from there? Not too sure of the story there, but he did use it for work.
I myself used it for executive protection jobs while I was a private investigator for Pinkerton Consulting & Investigations.  So, it has some history behind it between my grandfather and I.  It is used and I would say it's in good condition.

The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp.

Ruger 10/22 Takedown stainless with multicam stock. Gun is factory new in box. make me a fair offer for trade and its yours. This rifle will only increase in value as there were only 1000 produced last year for one distibutor in the world. Willing to travel within reason to make sale. 575 firm Low ball offers will be ignored. For those of you complaining that I'm asking to much then go buy it somewhere else and stop wasting my time. If ad is still up rifle is still available. 

If you’re not familiar with the 10/22 Takedown, it’s Ruger’s newest version of the 10/22, designed to be broken apart at the barrel for transportation, and comes with a custom backpack and carrying case that’s large enough for the rifle, spare magazines and plenty of ammunition, plus anything else you might want to take on a short hiking or camping trip. Ruger’s Takedown uses a set of adjustable locking lugs with a lot of mass to latch the barrel in place. Unlike the threaded screw-in barrels of other takedown rifles, Ruger’s system will last longer and endure more wear. If it ever gets to the point where the locking system gets a little loose, it can be easily adjusted for a tight fit again. It’s also a lot faster to break down and reassemble. 
It may weigh a little more than other takedown rifles at 4.67 pounds, but it is a 10/22 so it has a massive aftermarket and will last forever. Other specifications include an 18.5-inch barrel, a 13.5-inch length of pull and a gold bead front sight."

The rifle is in very good condition, bluing is nice, has laminated stock.
The bore on this rifle is absolutely awesome, one of the best I have seen on a surplus rifle.

Shoots great, very accurate. Action is smooth. Comes with approximately 150 rounds of surplus ammo on stripper clips.

Ok, people have been asking me about the markings on the gun. Here is what i can tell you:
All markings are clear and legible. There are two nazi eagles, one near the rear sight and one on top of the receiver above the chamber area. There is also BCD with a 4 on top if receiver.
The numbers DO NOT MATCH. The bolt has a matching number ELECTRO-PENCILED on it. 
Mod. 98 on left side of receiver. There is a matched number embossed on the buttstock.
I cant post enough pictures to show all of this.

$350. This is a steal at this price and if it doesn't sell, that's fine with me. I'll just keep shooting it.

New for 2013
Tactical Solutions’ TSG-22² 17/22

Popular kids always get the best gifts. It’s not always fair but it’s true. The popular Glock® pistol is no exception.

The TSG-22² quickly and easily converts any generation of the Glock models 17, 22, into a .22LR pistol. Machined from a solid piece of heat treated 4140 steel, the TSG-22² maintains a similar weight and feel to your factory Glock allowing realistic shooting and training.

A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 ²fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.

As with our other conversions, the savings on ammunition will make you glad you made the switch. Options such as a threaded barrel make attaching your favorite accessories a snap.

Unmatched performance, design, and usability make the TSG-22² the best gift for the most popular of pistols.

Heat treated 4140 steel slide with Nitride surface treatment for optimum strength, increased corrosion resistance and increased wear resistance.

The TSG-22² 17/22 easily fits all generations of the following Glock® models: 17, 22, 34, 35, & 37 with no gunsmithing required.

Comes with one durable polymer 15 Round Magazine featuring a last round hold open.

Available with a standard barrel or optional threaded barrel** in ½” x 28 TPI.

*THIS KIT INCLUDES THE THREADED BARREL*

This is a BRAND NEW kit in the box with the threaded barrel unlike the Advantage Arms kit.

905,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1161905,For Sale:  Winchester Model 1912 12 gauge,"Cumming, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 450,"Listed On: Thursday, May 23, 2013",Shotguns,Winchester                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This Winchester Model 1912 12 gauge shotgun was built in 1914.  From what I've read and been told by those who collect them, the finish on the receiver for some reason fades faster than the barrel. This can be seen in the pictures below. (in the last picture, it is second from the top) The bore is perfectly clean, with no rust or damage.  There doesn't appear to have been any modification at any time.  To the best of my knowledge, this gun is chambered in the factory 2 3/4"".  I have not fired this particular gun, though based on condition I wouldn't hesitate to after a qualified smith inspected it.  This is a great example of a Classic Winchester designed shotgun.  It holds up to 6 of the 2 3/4"" shells in the tube with no plug installed.  All the parts are forged or machined, and the reason that Winchester quit making it was that it became cost prohibitive and couldn't compete with other manufacturers offerings of the time. (And as we've all heard so many times, they just don't make'em like they used to) I have many pictures available, these ads only allow up to 3 per listing.  I can also take pictures of any areas desired.  $450 cash only, no trades.

Also, I have had several inquiries about shipping this shotgun and out of state buyers wanting to pick it up face to face.  Current BATFE rules and regulations state I CANNOT sell a firearm to anyone not a resident of my home state (GA) without going through a licensed FFL dealer and filling out a form 4473.  I can ship it to your local FFL dealer of choice after receiving a copy of the FFL dealers license, and the buyer will have to pay the $25 outgoing FFL transfer fee from my local dealer.  It is C&R eligible.

Anyone who would like to see this shotgun in person is welcome to email and set up a time to do so.  All meetings to view will take place locally at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming, right off GA400 exit 13.  I will need to see at a minimum a GA drivers license.  This shotgun is listed by the BATFE as C&R eligible, so those holding a C&R license may have it shipped directly to them.  Anyone else wanting shipping not holding a C&R license will have to use an FFL licensed dealer.  As long as the ad is still up, the shotgun is still available."

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at info@freerepublicfirearms or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."
