Caliber: 556
This is a brand new in box receiver made by Mag Tactical Systems. This is chambered in 556 is unbelievably light.  While the MAG Tactical Systems Ultralite Gen-4 ultralight AR lower receiver's aerospace aluminum alloy is a 6,000-series-equivalent alloy versus aircraft-grade 7075-T6 aluminum, it's plenty strong and coated with a proprietary ""high-phosphorous nickel coating"" that is then over-coated with the end-user's choice of boron nitride, boron, nickel boron, teflon electroless, Cerakote Ceramic (Desert Tan/Flat Dark Earth or Black) or DuPont Teflon One Coat. The high-phosphorous nickel coating provides hardness, while the additional coating enhances the anti-corrosion/anti-abrasion aspects of the receiver even further. 
Three main bullet points on the Gen-4 Ultralite lower from the company literature on it:

- The GEN 4 receiver has an integrated trigger guard that will allow the use of cold weather gear.
- The GEN 4 receiver has reinforced trigger & hammer axle pin placement points.
- The GEN 4 front pivot pins are reinforced to eliminate any fracturing during torque when receiver is in the break down position.

Selling for $650.  Includes gas block and gas tube.  Willing to ship if you cover the cost.  Please email and I will get back to you.  Thanks

Specs:

Noveske's Stainless Steel AR-15 Match Barrels feature their exclusive 5.56 Match Mod 0 Chamber, designed to offer outstanding accuracy with both 5.56x45mm NATO and 223 Remington ammunition. Composed of 416R stainless steel that's hardened to 30 RC, the bore is given improved polygonal rifling that slightly boosts projectile velocity and reduces the speed of the bore's erosion, meaning superior accuracy retention that outlasts that of barrels with conventional rifling. 

Noveske Shooting Team (NST) match barrels have a lightweight contour, bead-blasted satin finish, M4 extended feed ramps, and are threaded at the muzzle for the addition of flash hiders, muzzle brakes and/or sound suppressors. Each barrel is shipped with a pinned, low profile gas block, gas tube and barrel extension. This NST 18"" barrel has an intermediate length gas system, which is 1.5"" shorter than a rifle length gas system. The intermediate position is optimal for an 18"" barrel since it maintains reliability while also keeping the gas port pressure lower than shorter systems for a smoother recoil impulse.

Note: I am cleaning out my deceased Father’s loading supplies, and as he reloaded for a number of people, there are items I have no use for. So I am offering the following brass cases for sale or trade. Loaded rounds listed are most likely reloads and unless the loading info is listed on the box (if there is one) I have no idea of what they are loaded with or at. While my Father was a very competent hand-loader, you use them at your own risk. I advise disassembling loaded ammo and using the components to reload your own rounds.
As such, I also have no idea how many times these cases have been reloaded. Most of these need a good tumbling, but if I have to take the time to do that myself, I'd have to ask more for them. Why bother adding to the cost when the buyer can do that for themselves for free?

Of the three dealers nearest me the highest quote I got was  $749 with the 20 round mag so don't waste my time emailing me with all this $900-$1200 Harry-Reid/Obama-lovin pricing bologna. I will pay up to 800 or more if you have extra mags or ammo that you want to sell with it.  Not really interested in a scope though.

The rifle features LWRC's exclusive spiral-fluted barrel. The technology affords shooters an impressive 20% reduction in barrel weight and improved balance-- all while retaining the same accuracy and durability their match-grade cold hammer-forged barrels are known for. Additionally, the Modular Rail System is borrowed from the REPR 7.62mm series-- allowing users to select the areas to employ Picatinny rails. This results in a smoother and lower profile. It's been mathematically proven to increase a shooter's velocity while decreasing wind resistance-- thereby making the LWRC SPR truly High Speed, Low Drag. The LWRC SPR is also outfitted with Magpul's ACS butt stock, Bravo Company's charging handle, and LWRC's own flip-up front and rear sights."

It has all the features and safety you come to expect from a Model-7 action (a shorter version of the Model-700), A 20 MOA scope rail is mounted to the receiver using M24 type 8-40 screws. The X-Mark Pro™ trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs and provides the feel needed for precision shooting. The barrel is a 5R 1:7 twist and threaded 5/8-24. A thread protector is included. The nitride surface of the barrel, bore, and chamber provide maximum service life and durability - longer than even hard-chrome but with the accuracy potential of a stainless barrel.

REDACTED

From Wickapedia:
The Beretta 950 Jetfire is a simple blowback pistol with a single action trigger mechanism and tip-up barrel. The frame is made out of aluminium alloy, the slide and barrel are carbon steel.
Early models (*950B* Pre-1968) do not have a safety lever, employing a half-cock notch on the hammer instead. Later models (*950BS* Post-1968) are provided with an external safety lever.
[edit]Intended market

The Beretta 950 Jetfire is a backup, self-defense pistol that is intended for undercover agents, police officers or individuals licensed to carry a concealed firearm for self-defense.[citation needed]
[edit]Limitations

The .25 ACP cartridge is not very powerful, but a well placed shot is lethal. The safety system is very basic. The accuracy of the pistol is adequate although the small grip and short sight radius may limit some shooters to be effective only at short ranges. Its small grip also makes it prone to bite (the slide can cut the top of the shooters hand when fired). As the pistol lacks a shell extractor, relying instead on blowback pressure to clear the shells, misfires are easily removed manually by tipping up the barrel and prying out. The pistol is also produced in .22 short model.

I was almost scammed by them. Luckily I recognized Julie and told Josh he was attempting a straw purchase of my rifle (using his producer's money along with a fake name and address).

 They went by the names Chris and Cheryl when they met with me. They tried to buy 30 round magazines just outside Denver claiming they were legal residents of Clear Creek County (For those that don't know, Denver residents are prohibited from owning, buying, and keeping standard capacity mags within the city).  That's why they had to try to conceal their identities and true residency.  They broke SEVERAL laws while trying to make ME out to be the bad guy.

 Just be aware that they are out there. If anything smells funny walk away...or point out the illegality of their activities.

 Edit: Thanks to those that have contacted me. I'm sorry to hear there are other victims.  Many of you have asked about their vehicle. They were in a black Cadillac crossover. I'm fairly certain they were filming from a late model Jeep Grand Cherokee across the Home Depot parking lot. I had a phone interview with 9news about this and I have filed a written report with a supervisor at the ATF Denver field office.  Keep the faith.

 BTW, their contact info is as follows:
 REDACTED - Hidden camera reporter
 REDACTED - President of KDVR (he actually responded to my email...totally worthless brush off)
 REDACTED - Reporter
 REDACTED - He's the producer. Josh tried to use Chris's name and mountain residency (and cash?) to purchase my gun after I told him I couldn't sell high cap mags to a Denver resident.

 Give em a piece of your mind. If anybody is hooked up with RMGO or a decent lawyer I'd like to get this to them as well. Let's get this out there. 

I've been contacted by a lot of other folks who were scammed by these people.  Let's keep getting the word out.  Contact RMGO, ATF, 9NEWS (they helped me and are well aware that FOX31 uses illegal journalistic practices), and all the scammers I listed above.  They shouldn't be allowed to get away with these straw purchases and skirt magazine limits just because they are ""the media.""  They used corporate $$$ and a fake address.  Surely, they could be in deep legal trouble here.

Edit again:  Just so you guys know I HAVE reported this.  I called the ATF Denver field office and they were very receptive to my complaint.  They elevated me up to a supervisor and took a written statement.  People have suggested reporting this to FOXNews, Glenn Beck, etc. Please know I'm doing everything I can.  I don't have those kinds of contacts but if you can help please let me know.  Most importantly I want to save you guys the time and embarrassment of ending up on a ""hidden camera sting"" for conducting an otherwise legal activity.  The only ones breaking any laws here are the FOX31 folks!"

If you don't know about this gun, do some research then come back and buy mine. 

This is THE CHOICE for a daily carry revolver. The cylinders are flattened for a thin profile. Also, it fires from the BOTTOM cylinder butting the bore in line with your hand. Full power 357 magnum loads feel like a hot 38 spl load. It's a 6 shot, DA/SA concealed carry monster. The front sight on mine has a floruscent green painted ramp to help with your sight picture pick up. 

Mine is a little bit of an ugly baby which is why the price is lower than what you'll typically find. The previous owner had it duracoated green. There is some holster wear on the duracoat and it has the cylinder ring that all revolvers get once they've been cycled a few times. 

Comes with factory box, papers, service record, holster and some ammo if we're meeting face to face. If you have property and you are close I will let you test fire it, bring a standard 357 mag with you to compare, the 200DS will win every time. 

Can ship to your FFL for a small fee if you are to far away to meet face to face."

Made in 1995 and it has been Cerakoted Coyote tan and a gray ATI folding stock set added. I had heard some bad stuff about Maddi and when I got this rifle I did some research on them and found out that the rifle is as close of copy to a true Russian Ak as there is. The reason for that is that in the 60s when the Israelis’ kicked the Egyptians butts once again the Russians picked up a complete AK factory and moved it to Egypt and ran it for them for years. There are some later ones that had some problem but the ones made up into the late 90s are good. This one does not appear to have been shot much. The ATI stock set is a recoil reducing set with rails and is a very nice addition to the AK. Comes with 2 metal 30rd magazines.
