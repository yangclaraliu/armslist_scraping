Aftermarket modifications: Adjustable comb and adjustable butt pad - both done by the Country Gentleman.

Bought this Perazzi from a fellow club member - who kept it very clean. Since I have owned it I have followed suit and have been diligent about keeping it clean. After every use I cleaned and oiled to ensure top condition.
I bought it in March and have run approximately 1,500 shells through it. Not sure how many were put through before I bought it but my guess is not a huge amount.

Gun shoots perfectly, breaks targets and shoulders like a dream!! 

There is one small knick in the stock - which the original owner told me his second time on the skeet field a chunk of clay it it. Other than that it's in great condition with minor signs of wear. 
I have included a photo of the knick with a coin to reference the size.

** PLEASE NOTE: I have a small piece of dust stuck in my camera lens - so when you look at photo #2 you will notice a discolored little spec just off center around the 10 o'clock position. That is a product of my camera and NOT a discoloration of the gun**

This gun has not been consumer fired (FYI - Sig's GOTM's did not come with a grip band.) Photographing a two-tone pistol is a little difficult. The reflective areas on the slide and frame are from the shipping oil that is still on the gun. This gun has just sat in the safe since the day I bought it.

A batch was imported through Robinson Arms several years back and we've just had a run of them over the last year or so and they're about gone.  Molot will only be doing 23"" 7.62x54r VEPRs with an unfinished stock and normal front sight post and there are only a few batches coming, one in July, maybe one towards the end of the year according to Wolf.  Immediately after this model dried up, their value has soared.  

The VEPR follows the RPK design with thick barrels, 1.5mm thick receivers, and reinforced receivers and trunions.  There is nothing better than these, not the saigas, not the bulgarians, and definitely nothing American made.  

Chambered in 7.62x54r (about on par with 30-06) in the 20.5"" thick barrel with integrated sights on the gas block - aka ""version 2"" this gun can easily head out to 1000 yards and more.  I've removed the light layer of lacquer it came with and applied 4 coats of tung oil on the walnut stock and handguard, put a swivel stud in the handguard closer to the receiver and mounted a bipod on it - this is done to reduce barrel harmonic interruption and movement when loading the bipod.  

This gun also has the best Russian glass you can get, the POSP 8x42B PRO scope made in Belarus.  This scope is the best they got in the Motherland and it is current military issue.  It has the larger dials for greater reticle/range/wind management.  It's not even listed yet at Kalinka.  The glass on this is on par with the higher quality German optics.  This scope also has a low-light red lit reticle.   I also have a Krebs Custom safety lever which is designed to be manipulated with the fire control hand/finger, it also has a bolt hold open slot to keep the bolt carrier back.

The bipod is a simple Blackhawk sporter that does the job.  I've also installed a CNC Warrior muzzle device that greatly redirects gas to reduce felt recoil some and keep the nose down, it also tames the fireballs you get from surplus 54r ammo.  I didn't have the heart to replace the beautiful walnut stocks so I haven't bubba'd it with polymer furniture though I am tempted.

I'm including 880 rounds in 2 sealed tins of 148grain silver tipped Bulgarian (10/72) ammo.  THis was $200 plus for me to buy.

The gun cost me 1300, optic 325, bipod 40, tins of ammo are 100 each, muzzle device 25.  This gun has maybe 50 flawless rounds through it with DMR (designated marksman rifle) precision of just under 3"" at 100m.   I can hit the 200 and 300 yard plates at the range readily with this gun and I'm sure i could do 3MOA quality hits out to 1000 as this cartridge can do it.  With quality 7N1 ammo or American made 54r ammo, this will likely be a 2MOA gun or better.

I'm asking $1700 for all of it which is a loss to me and definitely of no profit to me.  The optic comes with a camoflage padded bag (from Belarus), there's 2 Russian 5 round mags with it, and a handsome box it all came in.  I'm not desperate to sell so I'm not very flexible on the price.  I will require a bill of sale and verify that you are a Montana citizen.  The only real trade I'd entertain would be for a S&W 1911sc or a STI Trojan 5 and cash.

YOU GET:
-Molot VEPR 20.5"" in 7.62x54r with two included 5rd mags (10 rd mags available at  Carolina Shooter's Supply), cleaning kit that comes with the gun included
-POSP 8x42B PRO scope with low-light red illumination (switch) with camo bag
-Bipod installed
-CNC Warrior Russian muzzle device

Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you.

Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail.

You are bidding on a Limited Edition Sig Sauer Sig SG551 originally brought to you exclusively by West Coast Armory. Completely assembled by Sig Sauer, this rifle is one of just 250 built from new-in-box Swiss SIG SG 551 rifles that were stuck in customs before WCA and SigSauer rescued them and built these limited edition collector's pieces. Learn more at www.sig551.com.

Do not confuse this Sig Sauer SG551 with the latest release by Sig Sauer, the 551-A1. This rifle is comprised of a Swiss made lower with matching serial numbers on the upper and lower receivers. This is truly a collector's piece that has the capability of being your everyday rifle as well. This fine rifle features an adjustable gas operated piston driven long stroke system that is considered the most reliable system made today; it is very accurate and fires from a closed bolt. The trigger mechanism has an ambidextrous safety and fire selector switch that has four settings: ""S""—safe, ""1""—single fire, ""3""—3 round burst and ""20""—fully automatic fire. Note: this rifle is semi-automatic and has a factory guard installed that prohibits the selector from moving to the burst or full-auto positions. The trigger is enclosed in a pivoting trigger guard which can be folded down to the left or right side allowing for unhindered operation with winter gloves."

This could be the 40th SAA pistol made.
A family member purchased this pistol more than 20 years ago as a cowboy action pistol. I have inherited this revolver and have done a considerable amount of research. A local expert was of the opinion that this was the original 40th SAA produced but some parts had been changed and modified over the last 140 years. I have looked at online pictures and cannot find the exact pistol combination.  The serial number 40 is stamped on the underside of the frame,  two places under the grips, and on the feed side of the cylinder.  The grips are wood,  each with a Colt medallion.
The barrel is 4.75"" which should have been an original 7.5"". 
The cylinder rotates properly but does not lock up therefore I do not recommend firing!
I have checked some online forums and some have suggested that it could be a ""Mexican"" production.  Apparently the Europeans produced these in the late 1800's  and imported then through Mexico.
I cannot verify any of this with any certainty.  It is one of two situations: a Mexican produced gun or the original 40th produced frame with changed parts.
 If it is the real deal the pistol is almost priceless.  If it isn't,  similar Mexican models sell for well over $1000 in this condition.
Gun is antique and sold as-is.
My need for quick cash could make you a fortune.  Otherwise this is a more than fair price for a relic!

The gun has been camo'd previous to my purchase, and it was done nicely. It shucks well, and fires perfectly. It comes with some 12ga rounds, a camo carrying case, and approximately 60 clays, along with a hand thrower. 

I'm really only interested in trading for a few cheaper handguns, as I just purchased some land and I wouldn't mind having a few lesser-expensive guns to keep out at the cabin.

Something along the lines of a smaller 25, hi points, cobra, etc. if you just have a single handgun, let me know the cash that you're willing to throw in with the trade. I would like the trade to include ammo, so let me know!

-I would really like to get a Mil-Mil First/Front Focal Plane scope/reticle (FFP not SFP) but would be fine with a Second Focal Plane (SFP, normal American reticle focal plane) reticle as well.-Prefer variable power scopes but am willing to consider fixed power as well.

-Prefer magnification ranges between (3-9, 3.5-10, 4-12, 4-16, 6-18, 3-18, 3.5-21, 5-25) (3X, 4X, 5X, or 6X power)
-Matte black or stainless(silver) finish preferred. 
-Open regarding turrets and parallax adjustments. 
-Prefer any objective size between 40mm-56mm 

-Regarding reticle, i am open. I like Mil-Dot and other ranging (Mil-Mil) reticles. Illuminated or regular. BDC reticles with MOA holds are good too. Otherwise for non-""busy"" reticles i am okay with regular ""Duplex"" style reticles but prefer #4 German or Varmint style reticles. (Such as Leupold's- Leupold Dot, Special Purpose Reticle, Boone&Crockett. OR Zeiss's- Rapid Z 600,800, or 1000. OR Meopta's- Mildot Special, 4B, 4C-RGD, 4K, McWhorter HV.

The CZ-52 is the early version of the Tokarev (made in 1953). Chambered with a powerful 7.62x25 round. This pistol has power equal to a .44 Mag, no B.S. I have personally tested it through steel at certain thickness's and it goes through the same as a .44 Mag will. Even tried to compare to a .45 ACP and the .45 mushroomed out where the CZ went through. (just an example of the power) Will turn heads when fired at the range without a doubt. 

This is a very reliable pistol with no problems. I bought the extra barrel and firing pins mainly for the fact that they were available and I had the money at the time. I've put at least 500 rounds through this CZ and never had an issue. Plus it never hurts to have additional parts for your weapons. : )

4 Magazines (8 round originals) - bought 3 seperately at $20 each - Sportsmansguide.

2 Hardened steel replacement firing pins (Both bought at Sportsmansguide -$25 each)

I also have a HP maker for the 7.62x25 round (paid $20.00 at Sportsmansguide), but the bit has come out and would need to be JB welded, works great when it is in place. I have roughly 8 HP rounds left from before the bit came out that come with it too."

Sold my Mini, no longer need this mag.
Used in great condition. Includes mag loader.
This is a stock photo, but is identical to mine.

This drum looks and works exactly like the Beta C-mag.
In fact, the parts are interchangeable, so in the event that you need to replace something later, you can buy parts from either KCI or Beta.

Please Note: This mag is for the Ruger Mini-14 in 5.56/223 Rem caliber only.

It will NOT fit any standard AR-15/M4 platform. It looks to me like you could get a replacement magwell stack, and probably use it on an AR, but I haven't looked into that option.

This page (http://www.ar15.com/forums/t_3_17/495935_.html) has an excellent side-by-side comparison between the Beta C-Mag and the Korean KCI drum mag. If you check the photos, you'll see that they are nearly identical in construction. 
Actually, I think the KCI has a better finish.

FREE SHIPPING via USPS to anywhere in the lower 48.

This will be my last post and final reduced price of this ammo... I will not accept trades or Paypal for this ammo... Sorry. Hand to hand transactions only. I am debating just pulling this ad and purchasing a LR308 anyway ,if this cannot be sold without scammers. I am selling my high quality remaining stash of 308/7.62x51 ammo. It consists of :

510 rounds of M80 Nato ammo (impossible to get )
200 rounds of high quality Argentine M80 in a sealed battle pack
180 rounds of completely backordered and discontinued Zombie Max 168 Grain 308 (same as Vmax) except has match quality brass and is going for almost $3 a round but is impossible to find anymore. New in Box. Retail when it was even available was $40 for 20.

I am blowing this all out and (Will Not separate) for one crazy low price as I have a 50 cal BMG now ...and no longer a 308.

The price is firm and I'm sure I could get more on GunBroker, but maybe someone local can benefit from it. At less than a buck a round that’s crazy low! 

Good Luck!

Whatever it is needs to be street legal. It's ok if it needs some work and alittle TLC but I prefer if the vehicle runs well. Just seeing what's out there so shoot me an offer. All e-mails will be answered or text me at: eight 3 two-4 five 8-seven 7 three 3. No phone calls please."

The Winchester 1911 SL holds five shells in a tubular magazine located under the barrel.  Around the magazine there is a coiled spring that brings the barrel back into place after the gun is fired. This is all very similar to the Browning Auto-5, but this is about where the similarities end.

The biggest difference is how the 1911 SL is loaded.  One of the parts John Browning patented was the charging tab on the bolt of the Auto-5.  That is a pretty important part of the shotgun and Winchester couldn’t use one. To charge the 1911 SL the shooter had to cycle the shotgun the same way it worked when fired — by compressing the barrel to work the action.

This is not easy to do.  Winchester put a checkered area on the barrel to act as a grip.  The shooter grabbed the barrel, placed the butt of the shotgun on something hard and pulled.  Depending on how it was gripped, this could cause the muzzle to be in an unsafe place.  This is how she earned the nickname “the widow maker.”"

It is in very good condition with little to no wear. This is just a Gen 2 that has not seen much shooting time and lots of safe time.

CORBON began as a custom bullet-making company; we made bullets for hunters going to Africa to hunt the Big 5 with a handgun. CORBON's Bonded Core Soft Points are designed to retain their weight and stay together while crushing through heavy bone and tissue in large game. CORBON's Penetrator and Hard Cast loads are designed for very large, tough-skinned and heavy-boned animals. The Penetrator loads use a heavy, full jacket with a hard linotype core. The Hard Cast load is made from a hard linotype lead with a proven LBT nose design. These two loads cause a through-and-through hole, breaking even the heaviest bones. Our customers have taken large game such as Moose, Brown Bear and Cape Buffalo with our Hard Cast and Penetrator loads.

""The Target Grey stainless Ruger GP100 was one of our most popular double action special make up revolvers.

The GP100 has been the workhorse in Ruger's revolver line for years. When they started putting the Target Grey finish on some of their other stainless guns, several of the Lipsey's employees commented on how good it would look on a GP100. The Target Grey finish was applied by taking the stainless parts and putting them in a tumbler. This gave the stainless that darker almost titianium look. The guns came out very nice and now that Ruger doesn't do that finish anymore, it will be a great addition to any collection. ""

980,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1545980,For Sale:  AR15 ATI Scorpion Recoil system Stock,"Brookfield, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 45,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 30, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my new never used ATI AR15 Scorpion recoil system stock and grip. The cheek plate on the stock is adjustable, it has a rubber recoil butt pad and a rubber recoil shock absorber on the hand grip. The reviews that I have seen on this stock are phenomenal! I assembled this stock and intended to install it on an AR15 that I had but sold it so I have this as an extra.

Check out the youtube video for the review, the video features the Shotgun stock but the properties and functionality of the AR15 stock is the same. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W-9ahy6Yio

I purchased the stock and pistol grip as a package for over $55 bucks so $45 bucks is a reasonable price.
