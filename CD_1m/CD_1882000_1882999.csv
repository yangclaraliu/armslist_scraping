You have been lowballing and ripping off so many people, then selling for so far above retail, that I'm sure more than a few people are fed up with it, so it's no surprise your ads get flagged so often.

Your constant 'WTB GLOCKS' ads, then combined with your ripoff tactics is what gets you flagged, Einstein. 

Stop trying to act as a dealer without an FFL (which is ILLEGAL btw), give people fair offers when buying, and quit overcharging when selling, and you MIGHT stop getting flagged so much.

Seriously? Offering 325-375 for Glocks and then trying to sell them for 550-600?? 

YOU are part of the problem. Stop trying so hard to scam folks and maybe you won't get flagged as much. If you are getting flagged enough to bring your ads down, it's more than one user, but rest assured that this user will flag each and every ad you post until you decide to stop ripping people off and start treating people fairly.

You think you're slick, but folks have caught on, Mr. R********n.

One of the first Bush rifles made. Back in the hay day of quality, the mid 80's. This is the father to the scout rifle and the grandfather to the socom. It has all USGI TRW parts.

USGI parts include:

TRW entire trigger group

TRW bolt

TRW operating rod

Unitized Gas system

Sadlak NM spring guide

Corret USGI Wright rear sights for TRW

KMT trigger guard

KMT buttplate

USGI Fiberglass stock

USGI Vented handguard

Vietnam nylon sling

Heel marked in the desired 7.62mm marking. Bolt was originally a commercial springfield bolt. The usgi TRW bolt was new and installed, lapped, and headspaced by the very well respected Ted Brown from the Shooters Den. The throat erosion reads 0. I've shot this rifle once and it ran with no hickups. I shot over 100 rounds.

She wants a small semi-auto with an external safety.

The 2 top choices that I am familiar with is the Sig Sauer P238 and the small Colt Autos in .380 caliber.

I can not afford to do a straight cash deal so I am offering in trade an original Smith & Wesson SS Model 60 .38 Spl. This gun is a collectors item and it is in excellent condition except for a small chip at the top on one of the grips. The serial number shows that it was made back in the early 70's. 

I also have a box of .38 Spl ammo and an inside the waist nylon holster. Hopefully you would have some ammo for whatever it is that you have. I can add some cash if it's really necessary.

Would like to do this as quickly as possible because the Gun Show is in Palmetto this weekend and I really don't want to go there. The dealers are charging way to much and I don't feel like fighting the crowds.

I live in North Sarasota County and am willing to travel a reasonable distance to meet up with you in a public place. Please don't ask me to drive all the way to Orlando!!!

If you respond to this ad than I will assume that you are a Florida resident over 21 and not a convicted felon. That is good enough for me.

If you have something that you think we can make a deal on please contact me.

 Edit | Favorite  The .308 Oracle, much like it’s 5.56mm little brother, is one of our most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Just add optics and ammo and it’s ready to hunt or turn heads at the range.
 Oracle is an excellent entry-level upper assembly that incorporates the versatility of the A3 Flat-Top configuration in selecting a preferred sighting arrangement with a solid, fully functional foundation of quality components. It is the perfect way to get into the larger, more powerful LR-308 platform, and is an ideal candidate for future user customization.
 The Oracle features a 16"" Heavy Contour Barrel with a versatile 1:10 rifling twist rate capable of stabilizing a wide selection of different bullet weights. It utilizes a flattop upper receiver with forward assist, ejection port door and integral shell deflector. The upper comes equipped with heat resistant polymer handguards, single rail gas block, charging handle, complete bolt & carrier assembly, and an A2 birdcage flash hider. Aluminum parts are hard coat anodized to mil-spec, steel parts are manganese phosphate treated (parkerized) matte black. ONLY ONE LEFT

We retired it at work because it would start losing the picture when it would run too long, like if we had a meeting that went all day or something.  I hooked it up in my garage and watched the Super Bowl without any trouble, and I used it a bunch during the spring to watch movies and never had any trouble.
Here lately it’s been doing it again – I don’t know if it’s because it’s too hot out or what, as it seems like it’s doing the overheat thing right away when I start it up. In any case, I can’t use it so I’d like to sell or trade it off to someone who can figure out what’s going on and get it working properly again.
It’s an LC-XG210, with an MSRP of $5,995. It shines at 3500 lumens (I have two bulbs for backup) and has a throw distance of 4.5 to 32 feet, which equates to an image size of 31 to 283.7 feet. According to the specs it will work with 720P, 1080i, and of course your standard 480 as well. DVI/VGA, Component, Composite and S-Video inputs, so you can hook all sorts of stuff up to this projector!
I’m looking for $500 Cash OBO, or trade. Email is best, as I don’t have access to a phone while I’m at work."

Additional, the standard Hogue grips that came with it were excessively large for me so they where replaced with a set from:  http://www.altamontco.com/experimental/products/pistol/ruger/#Ruger_gp100.php Specifically, snake skin back strap and snake skin silver black wood inlay. Similarly, I can come down 40$,  if your not interested in the grips. I do not however have the originals grips so you would have to order a new set.

It is not an Action Arms. The difference between the 2 are very important to value. Far less of the Magnum Research were imported About 100-1 (Research on the Internet) The Magnum Research has an Original Galil flash hider and bayonet lug. It will accept bayonets from an M-16 or M-15 The Action Arms imports are transitional guns. The Magnum Research Galils are far more desirable because of the import stamps, unique features and roll markings. This gun is in very good condition and has been fired very little. It's chambered in .223/556. Comes with 1 -20 round mag"
