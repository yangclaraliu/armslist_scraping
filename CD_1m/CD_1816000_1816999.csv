PLR-16
The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

The holster is black, right hand. I wore it less than five times before getting a new holster, and then selling the weapon. I forgot to throw the holster in when I sold the weapon.  As you can see in the photos, the holster is in excellent, nearly new condition, with only some rub marks on the black finish of the snap, which isn't visible when worn, anyway. It's a very nice holster that rides nice and high, with a great draw angle.  Please note, I have no idea if it fits any other weapons or not. I paid $60 new for it, and Tagua lists those models as $55 on their website, but it appears they don't even make one for the Para anymore. I am offering it at a rock bottom price of $̶3̶0̶  $25.

I'm selling a few of my guns to make the downpayment on a new home, so I cannot entertain trade offers. I would like to do this as a cash sale, face to face transaction. I may be willing to strip the rifle down and sell the rifle and ammo, sell the other accessories separately. I would rather sell it as a package, but need to get the last few dollars to get our home purchase completed.

If you are interested in in parts of the package but not all, please email me so we can discuss prices on the parts you want.

If you went out and bought everything in this package today at retail prices it would cost you $2715 with the ammo, almost $3000 after taxes and fees. I have reduced the price to  $1650 saving you well over $1000 on a first rate rifle, top shelf accessories and good quality ammo at current retail prices. I repriced all the components yesterday morning using the lowest prices I could find on armslist, upstateguntrader and all the major chains as well as some smaller dealers to ensure I am offering this package at the best possible price.

If you have questions please don't hesitate to shoot me an email. I'm happy to provide as much information to potential buyers as I can. It's one of my favorite rifles, but having the opportunity to buy a home of our own outweighs my like for this rifle. Eventually I'll buy another one just like it but for right now I need the cash to finish off the down payment.

I am open to negotiations on the package price. Shoot me an email with offers.
Thanks for looking."

Trigger group was replaced by a custom designed Tapco G2 trigger. All measurements of the original hammer were transferred to the G2 hammer. This makes for an action that has no drag, period. The gun was refinished in Armor Black Ceramic Ceracoat Firearms finish. After removing from the oven this gun was built out. It has a Tac-47 Auto Gas System. This system lets you set it for the weakest shells you want to fire and forget about it. Anything heavier and the excess gas pressure is vented away to keep from damaging the rear trunion. All Saiga 12's should be built with this system, most are not. Other modifications have been made to the gas system to virtually guarantee this gun will shoot the lightest cheapest ammo you can find. Since it has been used as a demo gun the gas is set up already, you can be assured it will shoot anything. A M4 6 position rear stock was added, rear pistol grip, front UTG battle pistol grip, aluminum quad rail, flash hider/door breacher, BSA red dot optics, soft case, one brand new magazine in package 10 round magazine and one standard used 5 round magazine - the other magazines shown in the pictures are not included.Cash Only.."

This SIG has the specs here:  http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p220-carry-equinox.aspx.  This is in excellent shape - comes w/two magazines, all the stuff as-new from the SIG Custom Shop.    

Love the gun, but have always wanted a SIG Scorpion model, and time is almost up for private trade w/out the hassle of background checks costing $$$ for both parties...

Will require bill of sale/trade and a peek at your CO ID (Colorado Residents only!) or CCP - have no problem showing you that I too am legal and legit.  

No worries on this one, not desperate to move it, definitely keeping it if there is no-one out there interested in a trade.  Price is firm."

This pistol has not been a carry gun for me, aside from being in my glove compartment on the few trips I make to the crappy parts of the city it has sat in my safe since Feb. My personal experience with this weapon has been fantastic and has never failed on me in the huge number of rounds I out through it (300 hah). It is a 9mm Luger Legally owned with original purchase receipt and roughly 700 and summin rounds. Package deal ammo must go with firearm.


Why am I selling this pistol you may wonder:  Well shit comes up and ya just could really use the cash.

I believe it is a 3.8 inch barrel with a 13 round mag.

Ammo is a mixture of PMC, Winchester and Federal.. some hollow points but most are FMJ. Asking price is Cash $500.. Again package deal, pistol and 700 (possibly more) rounds."

(avg 8315 miles driven per year so consider this low mileage on a 17 year old car, that being said I know my car inside and out) I have a car fax report dated January 18, 2013 for you to even look at if you come to see the car. Have my Texas title in hand ,Asking $3000 OBO ($2750 OBO less the system): no salvaged title, no rebuilt title and I have paperwork and receipts for work done from 2004-2013. Motor has never been turbo'd or super charged.

Quick history on car fax:
Even though car fax estimates about 5 owners I am actually the 2nd owner of this car from about 61k miles and have had it since January 2004. 

I have keep this car well maintained as my husband is US Army mechanic and we have done all the modifications ourselves and any major work has been done thru Volkswagen Dealerships in Indiana, Germany, Texas and Florida and Euro tech shops, such major work that has been completed within the last 3 years thru 3rd party is: 
Crank position sensor done at European Autohaus Tampa March 2013
Wheel Bearings front end alignment done at Reeves Tampa, Florida January 2013, 
Front Strut mounts January 2013 at Pep boys in Tampa, Florida,
Front control arms poly urethane bushings pressed at Eurotech in Killeen 2011,
AC restoration- compressor condenser and fluids at Garlyn Shelton VW in Temple, Texas in March 2012,
New Kuhmo xpert KH20B P 195 60R 14H tires just put on this past July 2012 at Sears automotive in Killeen, Texas. 

We have a HnR 40/60 cup kit on the car and all poly urethane bushings on all control arms and pivots it has a very stiff ride, October 2010 GSP drive axles front replaced, running mk4 calipers and stainless brake lines , had rear brakes and pads all done in June 2012 . Put on a Magnaflow exhaust this past summer in June 2012 . I have the Thule 444 specialty roof rack with 50lb load bars on the roof, Sun guard tint front(32%) thru back(darkest on rear quarter windows 05% and back hatch 05%) Audio system includes Kenwood Sirius ready cd player with usb and audio out hook ups along with JVC speakers thru out front doors and tweeters ATX 1000-2 amp Infinity amp and 10 inch CVR sub in the rear. New battery bought from Sears in 2012, We have kept up with all regular standard oil changes using 5w 20 full synthetic. Just replaced the heater core June 2012 , Replaced fuel pump relay, distributor cap and rotor, crank shaft position sensor in March 2013. Replaced Vehicle speed sensor in April 2013 as well as AC shutoff sensor and o rings. I have a stack of receipts on the purchases we have made for it thru out the years and what else we have replaced on the car. As well as my partially scanned copy of the vw gti/golf bentley manual as well as the digital copy on CD.


Cosmetic wise the car is a northern car it has some rust spotting on the rear by the tail lights when you open up the hatch, a little bit of rust forming by the driver's side window on the ledge , has rust on the bottom of the rocker panels. My clear coat is in a peeling stage on the rear hatch with every car wash I'm losing a little bit each time with the high pressure washes. I am currently missing part of my side skirts, I have been searching LKQ for golf's with them and haven't had much luck, Interior has normal wear and tear, but there is some heavier wear and tear on the front driver's seat edges. The rear hatch top cover and wheel well cover we modified in Texas with wood and pleather wrap giving it a nicer appearance and still fully functional. 

Mechanical wise things that will need to be done/ tinkered with, recently doing the struts they noticed at pep boys my coolant leak coming from the radiator, it's a very small leak but will need attention (we are adding a little bit of coolant about every couple weeks) for this fix it would be to replace the radiator and those run about 80-125 bucks if you do it yourself. The coolant pressure tank should also be replaced in the process those run about 20-30 bucks online. Reason by it the coolant light is flashing as soon as you turn on the car so pressure is not stabilized in the tank. We replaced the Vehicle Speed Sensor on the car but the gauge cluster tends to go off and on again with all the warning lights come back on so it's a bit annoying. The car is throwing the engine code p0501 which is that sensor but we replaced it with OEM part and it still has gauge cluster speedo issues not too sure what else can be cause it and I don't like tinkering with the electrical system but we replaced the clip on the back wire harness to see if that was the problem because we had noticed a broken clip but it's still being intermittent with working. Driving on bumps in the road will sometimes cause it to stop working then come back on. 

The car has its bulk history over the last 9 years that will come with it, which is always good when buying a older car. 

If you're interested in seeing and potentially buying the car please contact my husband or me Eight1Three-Seven8Nine-Six5Three9 or Two5Four-Two5One-Eight3Five5 only serious inquires please and no low ball offers ie Kelly Blue book does not accommodate for upgrades so don't low ball me your prices off of there.

This has been my pride and joy for 30 years, although it was made in 1928. I do not know if the magazine is as supplied originally. It matches the nickel finish well.

The Great John Browning invented this brilliant specimen of the armory arts, forerunner of the 1911 Colt 45. Blue versions of this pistol were used in many films by actors Peter Laurie, Sidney Greenstreet, Bogart, Regis Tomey, Mary Astor, etc. It is probably the most popular Colt civilian handgun of the 20th Century.
