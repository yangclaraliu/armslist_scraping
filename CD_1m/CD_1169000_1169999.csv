I am constantly looking for good deals on large quantities of new .45 ammo to resell at a reasonable fixed price, regardless of the brand of ammo. My intent is to hold the line at or below $30 per 50 round box during this weird shortage for as long as possible. Yes, I make a couple of dollars per box, I make no apologies for that, but a small profit enables me to locate other supplies and quickly purchase good ammo for resale.

I have no purchase limits, if it's in stock and you have the cash, I will sell as much ammo as you want. It might be a good idea to email or text message me first if more than 20 boxes at a time is wanted.

At this time I do not stock any other calibers other than .45 (sorry, no 9mm or .22), I have enough problems finding .45 to keep supplied. Thanks to all of you who have bought my ammunition recently."

I put $1 up for the price because I'd rather trade for something else, but if I had to sell it I wouldn't let it go for anything less than $800 without the scope, after all it is a collectors with values going up.

It is new in the box. It has never been fired other than the factory test round. I am not trying to sell this glock for $800 or $900 like some crazy people on here. I paid $599.99+ tax. I am selling for it less than what I paid for it after tax. This is a better deal than as if it were in stock at a store. (which there not) I did not buy this to make any money. I just changed my mind and found a shot gun I'd rather have. The guy at the gun shop said Glock was 1,000,000 guns behind. I don't know if thats true or not but they are indeed hard to find. I will also throw in a box of personal defense ammo for $20 more. Your choice of ammo is below if you would like it.

You need to carry a full-sized pistol behind your hip, you don't want to wear a jacket or your shirt tail out, you want stationary holster placement, and you want total concealment.

That's a lot to ask, but one Federal LE agency and many CCW customers asked. Galco delivered, with our SkyOps™ tuckable concealment holster.

The challenge was to design a belt attachment that provides secure carry at the desired angle while remaining inconspicuous. With a J-Hook or C-Hook, the holster can tilt and dive. While a pair of loops on either side or a single, wide loop around the belt can provide stability, they can also advertise ""Gun!"" to observers across the room. The solution is the patented Galco Y-Hook™, premiered on our SkyOps holster. The Y-Hook grips as securely as a full loop, yet disappears to all but the most trained eye when worn on a black belt.

The SkyOps will not win the competition for easy on-and-off, nor for quick draw and re-holstering. But when it's all about stealth, and wearing a jacket is not an option, the SkyOps sets the standard against which all others are measured. Constructed of premium saddle leather, the SkyOps fits belts of 1"" and 1 1/4"" width.

Made for semiautomatic pistols, the SkyOps is ambidextrous and available in black finish."

Some people are converting their long barreled SKS rifles into the shorter 16"" barrel that the SKS Paratrooper has. It makes them easier to stow, and a lot of people feel they are more balanced at that length without any change in accuracy. It's legal and fairly easy to cut and crown barrels (as long as you don't go shorter than 16""), and this sight was manufactured to attach simply and easily to the end of the shorter barrel, a whole lot easier than dealing with detaching the original front sight and trying to adapt it to the tapered barrel through machining.  I was going to cut down my barrel, but ended up buying a Paratrooper model, so now I'm selling the sight, and also my longer SKS rifle (in a separate listing on Armslist). The sight is $50, and well worth it if you want to shorten your barrel. Price is firm, as this was fairly expensive. Lower offers will not be replied to."

The shelves were full of Pistol Ammo. Those big blue boxes, 250 or 350 rounds don't remember. There was a sign that clearly said there was a limit of ONE box per customer, and customers there were many. But that did not bother you. You put three cases of shells in your cart and told the rest of us you were going to call your friends and have them come down there to pick up the other boxes. Nevermind the other gentlemen patiently waiting their turns to make a selection, you just took the last three boxes.

Almost EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to that Fleet Farm I meet new, friendly, like-minded individuals in the gun/ammo area. Today I am ashamed to think that I have anything in common with someone who would behave as you did, someone who thinks like you do.

Gun owners, as a group, have a lot of work ahead of us. The behavior you displayed today leaves me concerned, there are people out there who know you, and to them, you are a 'gun guy'. Hopefully they know more than one, because you sir are a poor representative of the outstanding men and women I have met in the shooting sports.

From Nighthawk Custom:
We have received several requests for a 1911 style pistol with as thin of grip as possible. The reasons vary from something that is easier to grip for more control, smaller hands, or something for ladies to use. Based on these requests we are proud to introduce our collaboration with Richard Heinie: the new Lady Hawk.

The Lady Hawk uses a both a frame and a mainspring housing that have been thinned down and scalloped to reduce the overall circumference of the grip. We also install thin Alumagrips to further reduce the circumference of the pistol grip. These features make for a pistol grip like no other, a perfect fit for those with small hands or for a female shooter.

The first thing we were asked was ""Can I get it without the Lady Hawk model name on it?"". So we have decided not to put ""Lady Hawk"" on the slide unless the customer requests it. The Lady Hawk comes standard in 9mm, but is also available in .45ACP or .40 S&W. The Lady Hawk also comes standard with a Titanium Blue Frame and Slide finish with polished Stainless Steel controls, but is also available in any other Nighthawk colors. All black with stainless steel controls is a popular option

Most of the Glocks and ARS on here are over priced. The prices have dropped considerably. Go to GunBroker.com and see for yourselves. Ammo is also cheaper. I just bought a glock 19 gen 3 and a glock 23 gen 3 and a glock 21 gen 3. I paid less than $ 600 a piece for them and they all had 3 or more mags and 2 of the glocks I bought had very bright trijigon night sights. I also know where you can get BNIB stag and Bushmaster ARs for under 1400. in Williamsburg. These prices are insane and if you dont pay attention then go ahead on out there and keep letting these guys screw you out of money that you could be using for ammo or mags or even a custom job on your new firearms. Springfield XDs 45acp concealed carry only cost 558. These guys on here selling a used XDs for 675 and labeling it as new there is no dealer function test it gets tested at teh factory. I just bought a BNIB XDs for less than 600. Dont be a victim just because  the Obama administration is screwing us dont mean we need to screw each other.
