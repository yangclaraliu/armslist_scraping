Grendel was a hot manufacturer of mostly high capacity weapons in the early 90's. 
When the first assault weapon ban came, Grendel silently faded away. They were resurrected 4-5 years later as KelTec, same owner, at same Florida location. Today, KelTec is the third largest manufacturer of handguns in the USA. If this Grendel resembles a KelTec you've seen that is why. The slide, frame and firing mechanisms are made of high strength steel, with high-impact strength polymer material for the grip, mag well, trigger, trigger guard and magazines. 

This is a lot of firepower in a very small package. The .380 cartridge is no slouch and many feel that it's about top of the line for a truly concealable pistol. This P12 is much smaller and lighter than compact high capacity 9mm's and .40's handguns. Gun comes all original; in the factory plastic case, manual, parts list and 2 magazines. Manual is 14 pages, very thorough on; features, operation, disassembly, parts and cleaning. 

Magazines holds 11 rounds, with one in the chamber (P12 = 11+1). 
Design of this pistol allows it to be carried safely with a chambered round. Fire mechanism is double-action with a low inertia safety hammer system for safe carry, thus not requiring an external safety.

 Technical Specs:

 Caliber .380 automatic
 Weight, Loaded 13 ounces
 Gun Length 5.3 inches

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

DARK EARTH COLOR

Type ""F"" Traditional Double Action (Safety/Decocker combo lever)

The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol is the most advanced sub-compact sidearm of its kind. Built around Beretta's latest Px4 modular technology, the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. Available in two calibers (9mm and .40 S&W), the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system. A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant. The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable back straps (included). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. A reversible magazine release button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a smaller and larger size button (optional). An interchangeable slide catch can also be replaced with an optional extended profile configuration. A standard Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) allows for an array of after market accessories.

The gun is setup for turkey hunting but also has a full choke and improved cylinder. Both are Mossberg AccuMag choke tubes.It also has a Carlsons extended choke tube with it.The constriction on this choke is 690. Also included is  a TRU GLO Extended turkey choke.

I used these for several cowboy action matches. I have carried the revolvers while hunting. They could use polishing. I have both boxes.

I will not split this up. I either need two revolvers and a belt for SASS matches or I cant use any of it.

I made these grips while I was in gunsmithing school. I made this belt and holsters. The loops hold 45 colt. The belt and holsters are lined with pigskin. I wear a size 44 belt.

In 2008 I totally disassembled these guns, masked off everything but the top straps and bead blasted the top straps to reduce glare.

Both revolvers have the Belt Mountain base pins fitted. These pins use a small allen set screw to hold the base pin to the barrel. These base pins do not jump. This does make for a very small mark under the barrel. You have to remove the base pin to see it. You have to be familiar with base pin jump to really appreciate this. I also have the original base pins. One picture shows the base pin on one gun and the top strap of the other.

I also have a Marlin 1894 Cowboy Deluxe in 45 Colt on Armslist."

Nice aluminum boat with the bench seats.  I'm the second owner,  looking to get rid of the boat only because we need a pontoon for more family trips.  I'd really like to keep this reliable boat, but I have no room for it.  Motor runs great, for a 1976, it's a tiller but could use a new prop ($100).  Sale will include shorelander roller trailer, with spare tire, and newer lights. Have had 7 in the boat and still cruises nicely.  Can include 2 cheaper Humminbird fish finders, a brand new vexilar trolling motor transducer only, (NO vexilar included head unit included) will include two transom mount minnekota trolling motors (1 x 36 lb and 1 x 40 lb)  one of these doesn't work if I remember correctly, one optima battery included.  four removable rod holders for trolling.  

Please understand the boat is not in like new condition, it's been used, there's some rub spots on the outside, there's some wear from the seats that used to be in it on the benches.  There's 4 sealed holes from previous motor mount.  It's in good usable condition, does not leak a drop!  Trailer has lifetime license.  I'm going to get the license renewed on the boat tomorrow, so it'll be good for a couple years. If you seriously interested I will take the cover off and get some pics.
**No cash offer will be entertained under $1100.    Let's not waste each other's time.  I'm not going to drive my boat to the north suburbs, I prefer to meet in the middle, or have you come to me.

The rifle is notable for its portability; it is less than 21 inches (530 mm) in length when disassembled and weighs 3.25 pounds. Disassembly requires loosening a barrel retention nut by hand or with a supplied tool. It is designed as a hiker and camper utility rifle, and appeals to the same market as the AR-7. The Model 70P is based on the earlier Marlin Model 70 (currently listed as Model 795) that has a fixed barrel and conventional stock. Its semi-automatic action originated with the Marlin Model 60. The Marlin Model 70PSS variant has a synthetic stock and stainless steel barrel.

The rifle has an open rear sight and ramp front sight with high visibility orange post surrounded by a cutaway hood. The receiver has an integral .22 tip-off scope mounting rail. Swivel studs for a carrying strap are embedded in the synthetic stock. Included Marlin accessories are a 7 round metal magazine, a tool for adjusting the barrel nut, and a padded nylon carrying case designed to float in water. Optional accessories from Marlin include 7 and 10 round metal magazines   10/22

It is chambered in .38 Special and has a 4in Barrel.  The Military & Police model was built first in 1905 and this one is the 1905 - 3rd Change, manufactured in 1910 (Verified with the S&W Historical Department).  The pistol is in very good condition with the only real wear being from its life in a holster.  The blue is about 85% to 90% condition.  There is almost no rust on the frame and the barrel bore is very bright and free of any pits.  The pistol appears that is has always been cleaned and serviced.  The hammer and trigger are as smooth as butter on glass and the cylinder locks up tightly.  The trigger in the single action position is 1.5 to 2lbs and only about 5 to 6 pounds in the double action function.  This is a classic S&W that is used just enough that you can shoot it without hurting its value.  These old frames were not built to handle hot loads so Plus-P loads are a no-no in this pistol.  She's quite a pleasure to shoot and you can feel the quality.  High book on this pistol is $1450.  It is fairly priced at $650 (well below it's 85% Book value).  The pistol comes with a vintage and well worn holster.  What I would like to trade this revolver for:  A Smith & Wesson or Colt Snub-Nose Revolver.  I will look at others if they are of quality construction.  Send me an email with your contact information and any trade offers and I'll get back with youASAP.  Any email that does not have a name and contact info will be ignored.  Rude people and Low-Ball offers will be ignored."

It's pretty sweet looking, two tone with a stainless frame, carbon steel slide and carbon steel components. These are nearly impossible to find in MA - get it while you still can.

This is a Loaded model and features a 3"" ported barrel, beavertail grip safety, skeleton trigger (trigger pull set as #5), and it's got a really nice combat thumb safety (I believe this is all stock from Springfield). It comes with one mag and a nice overmolded Hogue monogrip.

The gun has definitely been shot, but has not been abused and is in very respectable condition. Lockup is tight, and all the parts are well fitted. Only real ""flaw"" I can find is a small tear in the rubber grip near the magwell (caught it with a magazine during a hasty reload). I'd say overall, finish is 90%, mechanics is 100%.

$995 OBO, cash or discrete PayPal +3%. This gun is owned by a MA resident and will be transferred face to face on FA-10 in the Concord, MA area.  I have excellent feedback status on other websites which I'd be happy to share.  

Will consider trade for a Beretta CX4 or Beretta 92FS + cash.

PLEASE don't PM me and ask if the gun is still available - if the ad is up and doesn't say ""SPF,"" the gun is still available.

I have to sell one of my AR's and after some research, I decided on this one.  After having an armorer go over my collection, he suggested this was the one to go.  I asked him:

Why?

Because ALL OF IT'S PARTS ARE MADE IN THE PHILLIPINES

Don't believe me?  Field and Stream did a piece on them...  Here's a link to I think the second page, where they SAY they assemble parts ""made elsewhere"".  Not a single CNC machine to be found, not a single barrel made there - nothing, just assembly.

Oh, big deal, the DEA contracted for a thousand of them...  Good to know the mighty DEA wants the things, I don't.

So, it's a typical RRA and I've put maybe 60 rounds through it.    Unfortunately I'm into it for 1400, and that's the price firm as it is.  Cash only, no trades.  Make sure you're legal to own one, I'll need to see your ID and you should be able to legally own one, I'll check while when we meet at my own expense.   In the meantime, take a look at the photos on Field and Streams website.

I'm not going to go into an economics lesson here, although it seems some people need one. Supply and demand is supply in demand.. there is no REGULAR price or Obama price or any of that other BS. Guns are as good as gold, and there is no negotiating pricing for gold.

With that being said, We are headed straight into a war VERY soon and gas prices WILL go up, IMO. So a truck.. is not going to jump off the paper and sell itself. My weapon will. If you have a realistic ""non whiny"" offer or inquiry i am interested in getting something done. Must be at least a 1500. I am not interested in selling this weapon. Trade only.

I know the law states that in Florida it doesn't matter but it's my gun and if you want it then be ready or don't call.

 I have heard some of these go full auto but never has for me...and never converted it to do so. This one works perfectly. I dont think it has been used much. I think I've only shot about 70-100 rounds through in since I've owned it.(10 years)...I looked up my recipt.

I've had this for many years but just never shoot it. It is a nice pre-94 ban gun. Thats mostly why I've held onto it. It also has the threaded barrel so thats also nice. If you have  seen my other ad, I just bought a bunch of other gun stuff recently and would like to sell this these to help recoup some money. If you have any questions I will answer them as soon as I can. I prefer email but texting or calling is alright too if you need a quick reply. If you call and leave a message please let me know in the message what it is for. number is below.

SAFETY           THIS IS THE XD SERVICE MOD. XD 9611  2/13 ROUND MAGS
Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.
Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.
Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.
Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.
Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.
Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case W  FXTRAIS
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.    W/LASED 725

XD 9611 2/13 ROUND MAGS PRIVATE PARTY
Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.
Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.
Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.
Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.
Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.
Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case W FXTRAIS
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries. W/LASED 725

I have a like new AR15 carbine as shown in the example picture below. My camera stinks so this is the best way to represent it. It is the DS-4 type setup as made by Double Star out of Winchester KY. It has the M-4 profile as shown but I have added a metal rear flip up sight to the rear. Also it will come with 2 used GI metal mags and 2 black pmags and 20 rounds of brass ammo to get you started. Maybe had 100 rounds through the gun at most.

This custom shotgun is a must see. With its single-digit serial number, it is from a limited production run of only ten made. It has 20"" barrels with 3-inch chambers and is made of 18-2 polished stainless steel - and so marked. It has a gorgeous, Grade 2 wood stock set with engravings. It's slim and nimble, and an absolute pleasure to handle. Please don't confuse this one with what passes as ""coach guns"" these days. This one is up to the quality guns of the past - with some added benefits from the modern age.  German-made quality, throughout. 

This is one of the most effective and history-proven personal defense firearms ever designed. It's also probably one of the very last types to ever be included in any new, mindless legislation. This firearm should last several lifetimes of serious use due to its superior craftmanship and the material from which it is made.  Maybe the ultimate SHTF firearm . . . ?

SIRIUS GUNS is a Davidson’s GOLD dealer and a stocking dealer for Springfield Armory, Beretta, Kahr, Magnum Research, Ruger, Smith & Wesson, and Taurus.

FNH USA                      FNS-40    

The FNS 40 is the result of years of research incorporating the most
precise engineering and product development to bring the most
highly-advanced striker-fired pistol to the American law enforcement and
personal defense market. The FN FNS is a true double-action pistol with a
pivoting hinged trigger featuring an exceptionally crisp break and a short
travel to reset. The matte black polymer frame comes with four
interchangeable backstraps to customize grip fit and is designed with a
low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced control. The
fully-ambidextrous controls are shaped for easy access without snagging on
holsters or clothing. The contoured frame-mounted manual safety is ideally
placed for positive operation by either thumb. The FNS-40 offers a
hammer-forged stainless steel barrel. The slide features front and rear
cocking serrations and is topped with three-dot fixed combat sights with a
Deep-V rear sight that allows for better visibility of the front sight for
faster sight picture and target acquisition. The FN FNS also is equipped
with steel frame rails that can be easily replaced.

FN 66943 FNS FNS-40 40 S&W 4"" 14+1 Poly Grip Blk Frame/Stainless Slide

The FNS 40 is the result of years of research incorporating the most
precise engineering and product development to bring the most
highly-advanced striker-fired pistol to the American law enforcement and
personal defense market. The FN FNS is a true double-action pistol with a
pivoting hinged trigger featuring an exceptionally crisp break and a short
travel to reset. The matte black polymer frame comes with four
interchangeable backstraps to customize grip fit and is designed with a
low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced control. The
fully-ambidextrous controls are shaped for easy access without snagging on
holsters or clothing. The contoured frame-mounted manual safety is ideally
placed for positive operation by either thumb. The FNS-40 offers a
hammer-forged stainless steel barrel. The slide features front and rear
cocking serrations and is topped with three-dot fixed combat sights with a
Deep-V rear sight that allows for better visibility of the front sight for
faster sight picture and target acquisition. The FN FNS also is equipped
with steel frame rails that can be easily replaced.
