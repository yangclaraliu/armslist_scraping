TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable operation and function."

Springfield XD Sub-Compact 9MM Handgun - LIKE NEW CONDITION

-100 Rounds put through gun
-Not a single problem/issue with the gun. Performed flawlessly.
-Comes with flush magazine and extended mag (both shown in pictures)

I purchased this gun 3-4 months ago and put 100 rds through it. Cleaned it and oiled the hell out of it after those rounds. Just picked up a different handgun that fits me better, and although I love this gun and don't mind owning more than one...baby is on the way and money can be better utilized. If you don't know much about the Springfield Subcompact's they're excellent guns, and are very accurate. I chose to buy it because review after review people gave it excellent feedback. It's big enough to take to the range, and small enough to conceal carry.

I don't want to sell the whole case because I am afraid someone will just try to make turn a profit.

The 500AB is the 500A Mossberg shotgun with some improvements...specifically a Walnut stock VS the various hardwood stocks found on the regular 500A model. My 500AB also has some etchings in the receiver metal ,as seen in 1 photo, that the 500A does not have ...and it has a 30"" barrel. (Every part on this 500AB is interchangeable with the regular 500A)
This is a fixed full choke 30"" barreled shotgun. Thirty inches is a long range shotgun. Perfect for Deer /Water Fowl...and well, anything. You get the 100 yard reach of a rifle, with the spread pattern of a shotgun. Full choke means it keeps it's shot pattern tight over a long distance, so you get killing/stopping power at rifle like distances. It shoots bird and buck shot and rifled slugs. It is chambered for 2&3/4"" and 3.00"" shells. I'll include a box of shells with it...I won't need them if I sell the shotgun. It functions flawlessly and it looks great. The walnut is beautiful. The bore is beautiful inside...slick as a whistle. It also has a metal safety switch, not a plastic one like the newer Mossbergs. It has a Tasco Red Dot scope, a good one, that enables quick sholdering and accurate firing of shotgun. For those folks who don't know what a Red Dot scope is: You turn the switch on and the red dot is displayed in the scope lens.....when you look thru the scope, wherever the dot is - that's where the bullet goes. If you move your head, the red-dot stays on the target your pointing at and you can still see the dot as you move your head around. It makes for very quick and accurate shooting. I love this shotgun, and the new owner will too. I need money, I have to sell it. Three hundred is as low as I'll go. A box of shells #8, go with it. Thanks."

Depends on you, but the 28 inch barrel is just a little to long and I have seen the serious damage a shorter length can do at 10 yards with 00 buckshot. This is a perfect ""Carry Weapon"" for those of us who define that as: throw it in the truck floorboard or behind the seat, leave it on a shelf in the garage, walk on it in the boat or stash it in the trunk, just for ""those special little moments when the the time is right"", as they say on some TV ad. 

I got this gun as a trade and really do not need because I already got one. My price is exactly what I gave for it. It's never been fired but has a minor scratch on barrel. Details: 12 ga, 3"" mag, 28"" barrel, modified choke, Synthetic Stock (Matte Black), Single shot with open breech. 

Model S121280BS / 12 gauge if you want to look up detais at Rossi.com ... their MSRP is $155.00. I am looking at 125 bucks in cash or trade and I am sticking to it. Gander Mt. has it for $129.00 plus $25.00 shipping plus tax making it around $160.00 or so meaning you can probably find one for about $150.00 total on sale."

.45 Colt, 7.5"" bbl, case hardened hammer, comes with box and bag, but no extra cylinder. 



Get one before they're gone, these revolvers are no longer made. Widely regarded as the best of the SAA clones, most folks say these are as good or better than the 3rd gen Colts.  

This one is a gently used gun, see pictures for wear on the left side of the hammer and the two small dings near the muzzle. There is also some very faint freckling in the case colors on the left side of the frame, too faint to show up in pictures. 

This would be an awesome gun for a Cowboy Action Shooter wanting to make a step up from an Uberti or a Ruger. Get a great gun without worrying about ruining the collectability of a NIB specimen.

Description: Up for auction is a factory new in box GSG Schmeisser. Caliber/Gauge: 22LR Color/Finish: Black Barrel length: 16.5 Magazine Capacity: 25RD sku#gergstg44 The GSG StG-44 uses a blowback action, and proved to be very reliable with high-velocity 22 LR ammunition. The charging handle is on the upper left side, and serves to manually lock open the bolt. Also, the magazine has a pin which protrudes from the top when empty, locking the bolt open after the last shot. The ejection port has a stamped steel dust cover, much like the original. The pistol grip and trigger are also of authentic design, as are the sights and the overall look and feel of the entire weapon. The rear sight is easily adjustable for a great latitude of elevation, and also has ample windage adjustment. The carbine has a sixteen and one-half inch barrel, with an overall length of thirty-seven and one-quarter inches. The GSG StG-44 comes packed in a wooden shipping crate that has a hinged lid and rope handles on each end, which adds to the classic flavor of this military style weapon. The carbine is supplied with one polymer magazine (25rd). NO TRADEs at this price!"
