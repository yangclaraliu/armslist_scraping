We're at the goal line. Let's send the emails and lob in phone calls to our legislators and get this done!

The North Carolina House of Representatives has placed HB 937 on the calendar for a vote on Tueday. This bill would allow restaurant carry, has provisions for firearms in locked vehicles on university and community college campuses, would allow carry in assemblies where admission is charged, and clarifies park carry definitions.

From Grass Roots North Carolina:

    Help Fight-off Weakening Amendments!

    On Wednesday, HB 937, “Amend Various Firearm Laws” which contains; restaurant carry, provisions for guns in locked vehicles on college campuses, carry in assemblies for which admission is charged, and a ""cleanup"" of parks carry language, passed from the House Judiciary A Subcommittee. It is now calendared for a vote on the House floor on Tuesday, April 30. Attacks by anti-gun leftists, narrowly fended off in the committee, will likely be tried again when the bill hits the floor.

    Anti-gun treachery you can expect

    Numerous anti-gun amendments were attempted in committee, principally by Reps. Deborah Ross (D-Wake, 0-star) and Darren Jackson (D-Wake , GRNC 0-star) . Although all anti-gun amendments failed in committee, they will try again when the bill hits the floor, so here they are:

    Protecting rapists instead of students: Both UNC lobbyist Andrew Moretz and NCSU police chief Jack Moorman testified to the committee in opposition to allowing concealed handgun permit-holders to keep guns on college campuses, but neglected mentioning the high rate of violent crime on those campuses. In fact, Moorman apparently prefers to protect rapists rather than students, since the morning after he testified against self-protection on campuses, a student was dragged into bushes and raped outside the ""Free Expression Tunnel."" Lest you assume Rep. Bob Steinburg (R-Camden, Chowan, Currituck, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrrell, ****) supports the bill, he introduced an amendment which would have undermined the deterrent effect of guns on campus by requiring guns be kept in locked compartments within vehicles.

    ""Poison pill"" amendments to restaurant carry: Although at least 43 states have some type of restaurant carry (including laws recently passed in Georgia, Arizona, Tennessee, Virginia, and Ohio) Reps. Ross and Jackson remain committed to stopping you from protecting your family in restaurants. If they can't remove it entirely, they will use ""poison pill"" amendments to induce the NC Restaurant & Lodging Assoc., which is currently neutral on the bill, to oppose it.

    In committee, Jackson first tried to require restaurants to post signs saying they either allow or prohibit concealed carry, claiming this would ""allow restaurants to choose"" while actually denying restaurant owners the choice of simply not getting involved in the debate at all by posting nothing. When restaurant association representative Frank Gray stated his opposition, the amendment failed. Next, Jackson tried requiring servers to act as cops by asking patrons whether they were ""packing,"" and demanding permit-holders to qualify to law-enforcement marksmanship standards.

    ""Yellow Star"" Jackson: Reminiscent of Nazi's use of the yellow star inscribed with ""Jude,"" Jackson then introduced an amendment to brand permit-holders by requiring their status to be displayed on drivers' licenses, so that every time you have to present an ID, you would be ""outted."" This amendment also failed.

    Lies about concealed handgun permit-holders: North Carolinians ""Against Gun Violence"" director Gail Neely stood before the committee to slander permit-holders, citing long-since discredited claims from ""New York Times"" reporter Michael Luo that permit-holders are criminals. But most telling, Neely perjured herself to the committee by regurgitating a study which she claimed dealt with concealed handgun permit-holders, despite the fact that GRNC President Paul Valone had two weeks prior produced a copy of the study for her (and the audience of an ACLU forum) demonstrating that her claims were clearly false.

    Remind legislators: Not only restaurant patrons are disarmed under current law, but also employees. In February, a Charlotte-area Red Lobster employee was shot during an armed robbery, adding yet another to the long list of restaurant victims like Danielle Watson, the Flying Biscuit Cafe manager brutally stabbed to death and left behind a dumpster.

    IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED!

    THANK LEADERSHIP & REMIND THEM YOU WILL ACCEPT NO WEAKENING AMENDMENTS: Call AND email Speaker Thom Tillis (R-Mecklenburg, ****) at REDACTED REDACTED and House Majority Whip Ruth Samuelson (R-Mecklenburg, ****) at REDACTED and REDACTED.

    DELIVER THIS MESSAGE

    Suggested Subject: ""Pass HB 937, “Amend Various Firearm Laws” WITHOUT amendments!""

    Dear Representative:

    I strongly urge you to support House Bill 937, ""Amend Various Firearms Laws"" by passing the bill without weakening amendments. Provisions for concealed handgun permit-holders to carry in restaurants are by no means untested. Among the forty-three states with some type of restaurant carry, in the last five years, it has passed in Georgia, Arizona, Tennessee, Virginia, and Ohio. In the twelve months after Virginia passed restaurant carry, violent crime in restaurants dropped by 5.2%. Moreover, the NC Restaurant & Lodging Association does not oppose the bill (although it does oppose ""poison pill"" amendments proposed by Representatives Darren Jackson and Deborah Ross.)

    With respect to the limited measure for firearms in locked motor vehicles on college campuses, I am stunned by the hypocrisy of UNC and NCSU officials who testified against the measure in the House Judiciary A Subcommittee...just hours before yet another NCSU student was raped outside the NCSU ""Free Expression Tunnel."" To deter violent sociopaths, it is time to deliver a message that campuses will no longer be ""victim disarmament zones.""

    I will be monitoring your actions via Grass Roots North Carolina legislative alerts, and rest assured I will hold legislators accountable for their votes.

    Respectfully,"

Have a carbine, pistol in the same caliber, with plenty of ammo to use. Makes a perfect home defense setup and only 1 caliber to try to find. Before I get the hater mail for them being Hi-Points, I'll break down the prices. $550 for the Carbine, $300 for the pistol, and $350 for the ammo. I know I didn't pay that much for them and inflation sucks, but SKS's used to go for $89 each and AK's went for $300 tops, and 5.56/.223 used to be under .25 cents per rd. So by those prices, the inflation on Hi-Points are well below the average of the other over priced guns and ammo. The reason for this rant is to curb the socialist freaks out there that just because the prices are not where they think they should be, then I am a horrible person and should automatically sell to them for what I paid 5 years ago. Sorry I don't fit your socialist model, everything is not about you... I have not had any of the usual problems that Hi-Points are always rumored to have. These go bang when you pull the trigger. I would like to sell them together, but might be willing to separate for the right offer. Will not sell the ammo separate. Not really interested in trades at the moment, need the cash. I can take additional pics if requested. Thanks for looking."

""The Target Grey stainless Ruger GP100 was one of our most popular double action special make up revolvers.

The GP100 has been the workhorse in Ruger's revolver line for years. When they started putting the Target Grey finish on some of their other stainless guns, several of the Lipsey's employees commented on how good it would look on a GP100. The Target Grey finish was applied by taking the stainless parts and putting them in a tumbler. This gave the stainless that darker almost titianium look. The guns came out very nice and now that Ruger doesn't do that finish anymore, it will be a great addition to any collection. ""

You can tell it's a 3rd Generation because of the barrel NOT having a flash hider.

It is in great shape with NONE of the problems you hear about in earlier Cetme's. The cocking tube is 100% straight with good cocking handle gap, creating a very smooth cocking motion. It also does NOT have a ground bolt. I can e-mail you a picture, if you would like to see it.

It has recently refinished wood parts that look and feel very nice. It has a Port Buffer on it, meaning not only does your brass not go flying 30+ Feet (Common with all HK Clones), but will also keep it from getting mangled upon ejection, so you can reload the brass.

You would be hard pressed to find a better shooting Cetme. Put 2 in center bullseye at 100 yards using the iron sights when I was at the range 2 weeks ago.

I have alot of extra parts including stocks, hand gaurds, pistol grips, and a Carry Handle that I am including in the deal.
Comes with 3 20-Round HK Aluminum Mags, 1 20-Round Steel Cetme mag, and 1 5-Round Steel mag.

I have 175 rounds if brass cased 7.62x51 ammo that goes with it.
Also comes with a Primary Arms 30mm Red Dot sight with a high cantilever mount. The high mount allows you to add a magnifier to the red dot.

I would rather trade for other firearms that I would like, but would consider selling for $1100 for everything!

E-mail me your offer, and I will get back to you! I respond to EVERY offer.

This scope kit is specifically designed to fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

Leave the power set on 2x or 3x in the field and you’re ready for close-in, fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For long shots at smaller targets, turn the power ring up to the full 6X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is a great combination of a lightweight mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.

A Hi-Point 9mm C-9 semi-auto pistol w/8 rd mag (model 916). And to wrap it all up, 500 rds of 124 gr FMJ 9mm ammo. Both the Carbine and the Pistol are rated for +P ammo. Wouldn't it be nice to have a carbine and pistol in the same caliber, with plenty of ammo to use. Makes a perfect home defense setup and only one caliber to try to find. Before I get more of the hater mail for them being Hi-Points, I'll break down the prices. $550 for the Carbine, $250 for the pistol, and $300 for the ammo. I know I didn't pay that much for them and inflation sucks, but SKS's used to go for $89 each (now $600-$700) and AK's went for $300 (now $1200-$1500), and 5.56/.223 used to be under .25 cents per rd (now $0.80-$1.00). So by those prices, the inflation on Hi-Points are well below the average of the other over priced guns and ammo. The reason for this rant is to curb the socialist freaks out there that just because the prices are not where they think they should be, then I am a horrible person and should automatically sell to them for what I paid 5 years ago. Sorry I don't fit your socialist model, everything is not about you... I have not had any of the usual problems that Hi-Points are always rumored to have. These go bang when you pull the trigger. I would like to sell them together, but will sell the carbine for $550 and the pistol for $250. Will not sell the ammo separate. Not really interested in trades at the moment, need the cash. I can take additional pics if requested. Thanks for looking."

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9 right-handed twist. Shipped complete with 30-round magazine, a safety and operations manual, and a carrying sling.

It is classified M-15 A2 by the company because it is the civilian version of the infamous M-16 A2 service rifle still used frequently today by our armed forces. This is a great civilian AR which I have great regard for. Brand new at store, for this model 1200 stock. Like many other AR's out there now, you cannot order this specific rifle online because they are out of stock till Lord knows when. Unless the store already had it in stock.

This rifle has rail mounts on the carrying handle for optics and also in the front for bipods, grips, etc... As shown. Also a three stage adjustable buttstock brand new just installed. Only rounds fired were to properly break in, per owner operating manual, and sighting in. Less than 150 rounds!  Comes w 3 steel 30 round mags and 1 20 round mag. One detachable ambidextrous rear sling attachment w bungee sling, and original paperwork. Also original butt stock, carrying case, and recoil spring.  

Any other mags, grips, red dot scopes, can be bought separately or acquired with a certain trade at cutthroat price.

If you want to email me with an attitude or have a tough guy complex about what I am asking then I would strongly consider moving on to the next weapon and not emailing me your woes. I am a retired Marine not some punk or felon who cannot legally own these weapons. Be smart, be an adult.

I purchased this Ruger model so I was starting with the best AR platform available.  Since then, all I have had time to do was to install an upgraded Magpul MOE grip.  My work travel has been brutal, and it is only looking to get busier as I go into summer.  I will not have time to work on this until late fall or winter, so I am selling this rifle now and will get a new on when I have time.  

The rifle comes with everything as new, including: (3) Magpul 30 round magazines, warranty paperwork, manual, lock, soft sided carry case, and Ruger rail covers.  As mentioned above, it also includes the upgraded Magpul MOE grip with storage compartment for extra rounds or batteries.  

The gun has never been shot and has only been out of the same to install the grip, take pictures, and drool over a couple of times.  

I have half a dozen Smith & Wesson and DPMS ARs that are toys, this was (will be) my high quality home defense and hunting AR.  

Let me know if you have any questions.  I have a number of other pictures that I can send, but the files are to large to load more than one or two pictures on Armslist.

The smallest back strap is integrated in the Glock MBS frame reducing the
trigger distance of the standard size frame by approximately .08 in. The
medium back strap adds approximately .08 in. - equaling the size of a
standard frame - and the large back strap increases trigger distance by a
total of approximately .16 in. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is
reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to
switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional
parts. Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual
recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces
the felt recoil while simultaneously increasing the life span of the
assembly. Additionally, the Gen4 has a Rough Textured Frame (RTF) surface
designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as
the interchangeable back straps.

The rifle is great, shot one mag in one outing that's it a couple months ago.
I already have 4 other rifles in this caliber and just want to diversify my collection.
It takes standard AR-15 magazines and came with 2 10 round mags that sit in the stock.
in all actuality it was mor acurrate than my AR-15 I believe that is due to the longer range of sight between the sights.
You could if you get a 5RD mag go hunting with it.  It has a rail on top for optics.  Would make a better bugout bag gun than a AR-7 due to the fact you could take bigger game than just squirrels and rabbits"

We either have people trying to sell a used gun for a new or higher price, or people wanting to buy a quality gun for significantly less than its fair market value. 

Sellers:  Your guns are not made of gold!  And don't forget that the pending gun legislation was shot down several weeks ago.  Stop trying to sell Glocks and such for outrageous prices!!  And just because you installed some custom parts on your budget 1911 does not make it worth any more than a new one at Academy Sports.  If you're researching completed Gunbroker auctions to see what a particular type of firearm is selling for, you cannot take into account inflated prices during the recent buying frenzy.  That frenzy is gone.  You missed the boat on the high dollars if you didn't sell your gun in January or February. 

Buyers:  Stop placing ads trying to buy a quality pistol for $150-200.  Go to your local pawn shop and buy a crap Hi-Point or something if that's all you want to spend.  Nobody is going to sell you a good S&W, Ruger, Sig, etc for that amount of money.

We need to meet in the middle and start selling and buying firearms for a current fair market value, not some unrealistic figure.  It's ok to negotiate, but when most people see a whacked-out price, they just keep browsing and think that the seller/buyer is unrealistic and would be a waste of time to deal with."

It comes with the 3 factory chokes, white/orange front sight, white mid-bead, and I a pre-fit Kick-EEZ pad. Shotgun comes in the original hard red Winchester take down case with papers. I bought the gun to try sporting clays with my friends and I have shot around 1,000 shells through it. I just am a semi-automatic kind of guy I suppose, so I have switched back to that style now. No scratches anywhere when I overlooked it thoroughly, gun is in excellent shape! Bores of barrels and chambers are clean and ejectors are also. Before I decided to sell this shotgun I sent it to Browning to have them look over it completely so the next owner will be as happy as I was with it. Contact with any question please.

This barrel is dated 1-52 and remains in very good shape. The bore is bright and free of corrosion. The TE measures just about 5.4 and the ME measures just about 1.2...indications that the rifle has been used, but properly maintained"

L3 EOTech G33 3x Magnifier 

Color: Black  

The new G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting. 

This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights. G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing. 
•Magnifcation Fixed: 3.25X 
•Eye Relief: 2.2 in 
•Field of View: 7.3 degrees 
•Length: 3.9 in 
•Temperature: -40 degrees to 160 degrees F

Crucible: CPM S35VN: 

CPM S35VN is a martensitic stainless steel designed to offer improved toughness over CPM S30V. It is also easier to machine and polish than CPM S30V. Its chemistry has been rebalanced so that it forms some niobium carbides along with vanadium and chromium carbides. Substituting niobium carbides for some of the vanadium carbides makes CPM S35VN about 15-20% tougher than CPM S30V without any loss of wear resistance. CPM S35VN’s improved toughness gives it better resistance to edge chipping. Because both vanadium and niobium carbides are harder and more effective than chromium carbides in providing wear resistance, the CPM stainless blade steels offer improved edge retention over conventional high chromium steels such as 440C and D2. The transverse toughness of the CPM grades is four or more times that of 440C and 154CM. The CPM process produces very homogeneous, high quality steel characterized by superior dimensional stability, grindability, and toughness compared to steels produced by conventional melting practices."
