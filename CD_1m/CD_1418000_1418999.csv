The Firefield Riflescope with Red Laser is equipped with a Green/Red Illuminated Mil Dot reticle that is used for range estimation to help find the distance between the shooter and the target. Precision multi-coated optics are the distinguishing feature of the Firefield Tactical Riflescope line and offers the clearest view in both bright and low light situations. Featuring a built in 5mW red laser, the Firefield Riflescope, is used for quick target acquisition in rapid changing environments, so it hits the target every time with precision accuracy. The lowest magnification setting at 2.5x can be used for scanning, while offering a much broader field of view, while the highest settings in the magnification range are more than adequate for mid to long-range shots.

Basic supply and demand though. Shipments are delayed until 2014 for cases and there is no sign of let-up in demand. 

Look at Cheaper than Dirt and all the stores online selling what they have for $0.50/round and up and you blame this guy for sharing his stash? I have only a certain limit, dependent on the market, that I am willing to sell for. I stocked up ahead yet due to shooting a lot  I sold off all the crap I didn't want so I could get needed stuff for SHTF. If I pay an arm and a leg on GunBroker for a bulk of ammo then sell the rest on here at least others get ammo and you have to figure in shipping and time spend searching/bidding like mad and the standing in line/gas for money orders or ripped for PayPal. 

Honestly anyone can make a ton more on GunBroker but it is more work. You have to make up for gas way the F out to FedEx on Manitou or UPS on Central as they are the only places to ship ORM-D and deal with standing in line with rude customer service and box everything up, etc. and all the time you spend doing it. Non-payers suck too.

Basically everyone is hurting. I've personally sold ammo at or just above what I have paid, especially to repeat buyers. So suck it up, it is the new norm. Saw less than 10 boxes of .22 at the gunshow...they can charge whatever they want. If you need it bad enough you'll pay.

I worked logistics for a Special Operations unit and unboxed brand new M4A1s from the factory and this is as close as you can get to what SOCOM units receive from Colt.  Now with that being said, I did purchase a brand new Yankee Hill Machine front gas block with flip down front sights and installed it on this rifle.  I have the box and all factory paperwork to include the original front sight post.  This rifle comes with one 30rnd Colt aluminum magazine (not a clip), Matech BUIS, manual, ambi-selector lever, and four Knights Armament rail protectors already installed on the Knights Armament M4 RAS. This rifle is a safe investment as it is sure to be a collectable in the future.  The price is not negotiable at all.

360,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1418360,For Sale:  Century Arms Sterling Sporter by Wise Lite Arms (w/ 5 mags),"Tulsa/Owasso, Tulsa, Oklahoma",$ 800,"Listed On: Monday, April 8, 2013",Rifles,Century International Arms                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"If you're having a hard time finding a Kel-Tec Sub2000, Marlin Camp9 or other 9mm carbine, take a look at this nice little gun.  It's a Sterling Sporter that was sold by Century Arms International.  Made in the U.S.A. by Wise Lite Arms out of Boyd, TX.  

It shoots regular 9mm and has a folding collapsable stock.  The recoil is so minimal, it's like shooting a 22lr.  It is based off of the British Sterling sub machine gun that has a rich history of fighting bad guys all over the world.  Wise Lite modifies the bolts for semi-auto and lengthens the gun so that it is fully legal.  With not much effort at all, one could turn this thing into a great little SBR.

The gun is practically brand new.  I have fired less than 100 rounds total through it on a couple of ocassions.  It's a fun little gun.

The gun comes with 5 (yes 5) 34-round magazines.  These are not always the easiest to find and they go for $40+ on the online broker sites.  Speaking of magazines, these just might be the best magazines you will ever come across.  They have a follower that has built in rollers to aid in loading.  The 34th round loads as easy as the first round.  And they are incredibly easy to disassemble and clean.

It also comes with a spare firing pin that I bought directly from Wise Lite, just in case I ever needed it.

If you're a Star Wars fan and you think the gun looks familiar, you're not crazy.  This gun is the basis for the guns used by the Storm Troopers."

If you're looking for the highest quality and most durable Lower Parts Kit on the market with all of the upgrades, look no further. The Spike’s Tactical Enhanced LPK was designed for the end user who demands the most longevity possible out of the parts in their rifles. The core of the Spike’s Enhanced LPK is the ST Battle Trigger which is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron to give the Battle Trigger a very smooth and crisp trigger pull that breaks at around 5 lbs and gets even smoother the more you shoot it. 

The Battle Trigger is held in place via KNS Gen II Mod II Anti-Rotation pins which keep the hammer and trigger pins from walking out (a problem in some 9mm ARs and full auto M4/M16s) and keeps the pin holes from enlarging and “egg-holing” after years and years of use. And we’ve also included an Ambidextrous Safety Selector, our ST Billet Trigger guard with set screw, and our Ergo grip featuring our Spike’s Spider logo. 

The Spike’s Enhanced LPK also features a Mil-Spec bolt catch, mag catch, and mag catch button. As well as utilizing Mil-Spec detents, plungers, pins, and springs.

Design

The 11-48 is a long-recoil operated semi-automatic shotgun based on the Remington Model 11. Shells are stored in a tubular magazine under the barrel. When a chambered shell is fired, the barrel and bolt recoiling together (for a distance greater than the shell length) re-cock the hammer, eject the spent shell, and feed another shell from the magazine into the action.
The 11-48 differs from the Model 11 in the shape of its machined steel receiver and the use of cheaper stamped steel internal parts. The new easily removable aluminum trigger housing was to be featured on its successors, the 1100 and the 11-87.
Like the Model 11, the gun operated by way of two return springs. The first, located in the buttstock, serves as the resistance to the bolt. The second spring, located over the magazine tube, serves as the barrel recoil spring, allowing the barrel to recoil several inches into the receiver. The 11-48 differs from the Model 11 in the friction ring placed at the forward end of the barrel recoil spring. The Model 11 had a brass friction ring with one blunt end and one beveled end. The ring fit into a corresponding cut in the barrel underlug. For heavy loads, the ring was turned with the beveled end facing the lug. For lighter loads, the blunt end was turned to face the lug. The 11-48 features a similar friction ring system but is modified to be self-adjusting so as to work with all loads.
[edit]Sportsman '48

The Sportsman '48 is a variation introduced to comply with various US hunting laws. It came with a crimped magazine tube that allowed it to be loaded with only 2 shells in the magazine. One additional round placed in the chamber brought its total capacity to three shells. It came in 12, 16, and 20 gauge variations."

This firearm is built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle.  This makes this one of the most accurate AK's you can buy.  Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. Vepr in 5.45x39 caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 16” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.

SUPRISINGLY SLIM. One of the most anticipated handguns to come along in a long time is the new Springfield XDs, single-stack .45ACP pistol. Why all the excitement? Simple. The Springfield XDs is THE quentissential single-stack, ultra- compact concealed carry .45 that shooters have been waiting for. There are a great many 9mm and .40S&W ultra-compacts on the market today, but the Springfield XDs .45ACP is in a league of its own. With so many Texans getting concealed carry licenses, there is a huge demand for small, concealable handguns that can stop an attacker.

The short barrel—while making the gun easy to carry—will be criticized by some as “sacrificing velocity.” The .45 however, does its work by mass and diameter, not by speed. What may be lost in terms of velocity in a shorter barrel will be more than made up by the .45's greater stopping power.

Even though the manufacturers specs will give you a small glimpse into its overall dimensions, you really have to hold a Springfield XDs to appreciate how compact and slick it is. Springfield built the XDs around a five-round single-stack magazine and the resulting frame is amazingly easy to wrap your hand around. It has interchangeable backstraps and the result is to change the pitch in your hand, not make it bigger and/or bulkier. The compact grip of the Springfield XDs also makes concealed carry easier, as the shorter frame is less likely to print under your shirt or jacket. Perhaps the greatest feature of the XDs, and the one that sets it apart from other compact .45's like the Glock 36, is its manual, 1911 style grip safety.

The Springfield XDs weighs in at only 21.5 oz, and that's light for such a powerful micro pistol chambered in .45ACP. Part of the lightness comes from the polymer frame. The XDs frame has aggressive checkering for a secure grip. The barrel is only 3.3"" long - about as small as you can get and still have a gun work reliably in .45 caliber. Overall height of the gun is only 4.4"", with an overall length of 6.3"", and the width is only 1"" - we're talking EXTREMELY concealable.

You might expect a small .45 handgun like the Springfield XDs to be hard to control, yet recoil is suprisingly modest for this micro compact powerhouse. In addition, the XDs will feed a wide range of .45 loads and is accurate to boot. While the Springfield XDs is supplied with two- 5 round magazines, there is an option to purchase an extended magazine that holds 7 rounds. The advantage to such an extended magazine becomes apparent during concealed carry inside the waistband. The extended magazine converts the Springfield XDs into a full grip that is comfortable for even big hands. In addition, the extended mag comes with slide on bottoms to match the two different interchangeable backstrap profiles.

For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles."""

What you are looking at is a nearly complete full size uzi. It only needs a few more parts to make it into a complete gun. It has never been shot before, I have only put it all together with the bolt in it and cocked it a few times to check clearance.

Everything included:

- Complete welded Nodak Spud full size uzi receiver. Needs no additional welding or fabrication, just a paint job.

- McKay Enterprises / Nodak Spud full size uzi carbine / semi automatic bolt, striker and recoil spring assembly with a buffer block and spare recoil spring. Also included is the little firing pin safety and spring. 

- D&D Sales 16"" barrel

- ARS marked lower. The hard to find lower! This needs to have the selector switch stop plate welded in place still. It has some very tiny handling marks but if you are repainting the gun anyways, you should probably paint this to match the receiver.

- 2 top covers, both previously SMG top covers but the ratchets have been removed for use on a semi auto gun.

- 2 folding stocks, complete.

- 2 sets of front handguards, MINT. Not some scratched up, used german takeoffs, these are what came on Action Arms guns and they are the best ones I could find.

- Receiver pins

- Disconnector stop

- Trigger assembly

- Lower receiver frame pin

- Grip safety and spring

- Selector switch and button

- Magazine catch and spring

- Complete front sight assembly

- Complete rear sight assembly and leaf spring

- Top cover catch and spring

- Model A front sight tool

- Sling



The things that you would need to complete this are: an extractor and retaining pin, lower grips and screws, barrel nut, sear, sear spring and a trigger spring.



Shipping will be $30 to anywhere in the US EXCEPT BAN STATES. I will not sell to ban states so dont even ask. Item needs to be shipped to an FFL since the receiver is a firearm.

From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S.

The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own.

What sets it apart from the 92FS is:

A. Distinctive military style markings: on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols.

B. Unique M9-prefixed serial number: (M9-xxxxxx) sets  this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols.

C. “Dot-and-Post” sight system: clones that of the M9.

I don't want to be stuck with it.  I make no profit off of it.   I have two boxes of unused ammo at $30.00 per box. That's two boxes of 20 rounds each for a total of $60.00. I don't need the ammo once the rifle is sold and if anyone at all buys my rifle, they are surely going to buy ammo for it. They may as well buy mine at cost.
My Marlin has been shot a few times, but is as new as new gets. Looks and functions perfect. It's beautiful. It has a gold trigger. It has a see-through Marlin scope mount, so that the iron sites remain visible if you choose to mount a scope...
I'll include the perfect scope and rings, with the rifle, if you want them (you can see that scope in the picture)...it's a 2-6x zoom  28mm, it will cost an extra $50.00  This 28mm scope design is just perfect for this lever action rifle, it's the only scope that looks ""right"" in my opinion...not too bulky but still big enough; and the 6x zoom is right on the money for the 30-30 round
You don't have to buy the scope....I'll take it off and keep it...actually I'll install it on one of the new Henry .22 rifles that I just bought my wife. But if you want it, I'll sell it to you because it's perfect for that Marlin. 
I just bought my wife two Henry rifles...one Golden boy and one standard .22, and also a Heritage Rough Rider 22lr/22mag Cowboy Revolver.  I've spent a lot of money on target/plinker firearms so I have to sell something to offset that cost. The Marlin Deer rifle, though beautiful, is something I just won't use often, I shoot paper targets more than anything else...so it's the one that has to go.
Mine is as good as new in the box and you can't beat the price of $340.00 for one this nice. You gotta buy ammo anyway, so buy mine at cost and get the very good deal on the rifle
$400.00 firm takes mine with the ammo, I'm not intending to reduce that price. $450.00 with the scope, the scope is totally your option."
