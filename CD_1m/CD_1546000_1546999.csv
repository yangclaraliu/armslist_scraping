This gun was owned by a family member who was a LEO. This gun was his backup and was carried on his ankle for over a year. It wasnt fired as much as it was carried, but it was indeed carried and it shows holster wear on the right side only. It's not terrible but if you're wanting a show gun this is not it! This gun is for carrying and shooting and its a fine shooter! The aluminum frame and stainless slide provide very little recoil, even less since I have added a new recoil spring (less than 50 rounds ago). This gun just recently came back from Smith and Wesson from having it's ejector (was chipped) replaced as well as the extractor just for the heck of it. That's the luxury of having a 3rd generation Smith is a free warranty to have any work done on it. They even pay for shipping at no cost to you! And you are only out 2-3 weeks if that. This particular repair took 11 days to get back. 

This gun comes with 3 magazines (12 rd) 1 of which is brand new, never loaded, the other two I replaced the springs (at the same time I did the recoil spring). I kept the old springs just in case I'd ever need them. It also has a Hogue full grip added to it, I kept the original grips as well. It also comes with a Galco Ankle holster, OEM box and Manual.

2 boxes of 9mm Magtech ammo (100 rds total) are included in the price as well as a Plano Carrying Case (smaller than the Smith OEM one for easy transportation). 

These are getting harder and harder to find (not impossible), Many LEOs still carry this as their side are in New York City, and its a super reliable, accurate gun. This is an excellent carrier for personal protection. I am selling because I have a 9mm that carry and I am used to it, although this gun is fun as hell to shoot as it's sooo accurate I have to stick with what I'm used to as I dont need four 9mms

Emails with phone numbers will be given 1st priority.  It has been transfered into my name so I require a MN DL and a PTP/PTC to purchase. Thank you!"

Hi I have an AR15 for sale. There is not a scratch on this gun. ONLY 100 rounds were shot through it to break in the barrel. I spent the whole day at the range cleaning the gun after every shot fired in order to break it in like the manufacterers recommend. The gun was also sighted in and hits nice groups all in the black at 50 yards. Very accurate at 100 yards too. This gun is all high quality top name brand parts. It was built from a Spikes stripped lower, and had an Armalite M15A4 upper bought complete. The lower parts kit is a Rock River Arms as well as the buffer tube assembly. There were no cheap ""unknown name"" parts put on this gun. It has a Magpul CTR stock, hogue grip, MaTech Military rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation(this is what the military uses, a very good rear sight)

I'm asking 1300 O.B.O.

The ergonomical styling makes this pistol comfortable to hold for individuals with small to medium sized hands. Features quick , easy, breakdown with simple cleaning and lubrication proceedures. This pistol comes with two back strap safety clips, safety lock, 2 magazines; 1 medium 6 round and one Large 7 (7 round magazine pictured in gun) round and original instructional booklet all in the original foam padded, black hard plastic locking case.

If so flag, flag, flag. It takes several flags to meet the threshold so do your due diligence. It's the only way to send the message and make it a pain in their ass to post here. They've ruined the spirit of Armslist. Don't you pathetic trolls have day jobs? Do you really take comfort in capitalizing on what our tyrannical govt has cast us into? Don't give me the usual bullshit story of supply and demand either. It's predatory and has to stop. Fortunately I have all the ammo I need, (for the near future anyway) and would never patronize such assholes but I feel bad for those that got caught short. So all that being said, why don't you profiteers quit standing outside the gun stores waiting to buy up all the ammo so you can turn your greedy little profit and let this shit die down so everybody can again get what they need at reasonable prices."

408 Cheytac. The Holy Grail of rifle cartridges, especially when being shot by the VR1 rifles. Quick follow up shots and easy impact reading from the low recoil of the VR1 Rifles is one of the key advantages of stepping down to a 408 Cheytac cartridge from the much bigger 416 Barrett or 50 BMG rifles. Not to mention VR1 rifles only weigh 18 lb. which means you can actually take it some where. It is the cartridge that I designed the VR1 rifles to shoot, all other calibers that we offer just happen to fit in the VR1 Rifles.Rocky Mountain Bullets has developed real 420 gn. RBBT bullets for the 408 Cheytac, it certainly has taken the 408 Cheytac to a new level in performance. With the new bullets shooters are able to achieve long periods of sustained fire before accuracy deteriorates due to fouling, compared to shooting solid monolithics.Its a nice rifiles and you will very much like it."

I am only going to list this for a couple more weeks if that then i am going to start working on doing some more work to it. So if your looking for a fast ride then bring on the trades. No im not taking 4 grand, 3 grand 2 grand. I will negotiate a little if you have a gun i want or alot of 9mm and or .45acp ammo to toss in. Please dont think your 9mm is worth gold. For 9mm only looking for FMJ unless you have alot of Led for a real price. For trade value on ammo (9mm new ill do 40 per hundred unless you decide greed is not your game, .45 value .50$ a round.) I will take reloads to but not for new price!! Only reloads in .45 i rather have is Semi wad cutters-200-230 grain.

OK LONG STORY SHORT>>THIS is not a show car, PROJECT< Paint Sucks, Inside and Out needs TLC< Car is not beefed up for the Power! If you are looking for a pretty car keep looking and dont expect a show winner. IT IS A PROJECT, IT IS STREET LEGAL, IT DRIVES and it HAULS A$$ and it will but you sideways 6 ways from Sunday at the snap of the throttle.

10 bot rear with 3:90 gears, Eaton Posi (very few miles on it) Weld Draglights (3 1/2) fronts 15x8 rears.  468 big block Chevy, hyd cam, Roller rockers, Forged Pistons etc, Built th350, 4200 stahl. Fast Fast Fast. This is a nasty pump gas motor. The car does not hook, Tranny is not slipping the tires are spinning. Dont believe me then stick your head out the window while running sideways down the street if that is not convincing enough. Mechanically perfect. I just wouldn't stick a set of slicks on it and take it to the track unless you want to pick a ring gear off the track. Like i said...Alot of power and its a project (car was not built for the power).

Comes with 2 spare hoods, Rear bumper (not installed) some heater and interior parts, set of 3:73 gears and some other stuff. NO JOY RIDES< When you own it you can drive it!

Really only looking for trades: 80s short bed Chevy, Guns= AR .308, Tac Bolt guns, Optics, 1911s, M&Ps, Revolvers (not interested in Taurus or cheap guns/Only wanting quality firearms) SCAR, ACR Bull Pups, accessories.  If you have a pistol or rifle that i really want i may value at little more then actual value. Any other gun that isnt a Must Have on my list then actual value of guns (I dont gouger prices) ammo any thing gun/range related. Will do partial trades and cash. Over 8 grand in the drive trane. You can easly add more power with some bolt ons and electronics. I just dont have the time. Im listing for way less then the money in the car so dont low ball me. If your a low baller go build your own! CLear title in hand!

And that is saying it nicely.

I have created an 18 round tube feed loader for tube fed rifles such as Marlin 60, Henry lever action, Winchester 9422, Browning BL22 and Marlin 39A, as well as other tube fed rifles. These tubes are clear for extra safety and to assure that all rounds are inserted into the tube in the same direction. Both end caps are removable but snug. This allows you to put them in either direction and just pull off the appropriate cap to load the round, the cartridge end first into the tube. I am also working on a 10 rounder and a 15 rounder, but even if you have those rifles such as Browning SA22 or 14 or 15 round Marlin 60's, this one still works fine, just fill with the appropriate number of rounds for your particular rifle. I will mark the tube for 10, 14 and 15 rounds to get it started. Sold in a set of 3 tubes. This is also great for the shooter that has kids shooting with them as you can assign one or more tubes per child so they are responsible for filling their own tubes and keeping up with them and again, being clear, you can double check their work before loading into the rifle tube.

I will consider shipping within the lower 48 states for $6.00.
