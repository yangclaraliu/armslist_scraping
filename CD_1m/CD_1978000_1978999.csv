These are high quality 80% lowers made from 7075 t6 aircraft grade aluminium with fully broached magazine wells for perfect dropping al ALL magazines. They are made to 100% military specifications and will work with any Mil Spec Jig although I recommend the ones made for these lowers cause they work very well and come with all of the drill bits need to complete the job as well as detailed instructions. They come with a bead-blasted raw aluminium finish that looks very good as-is or is ready for paint. These are the ONLY 80% receivers on the market that have been given permission by the ATF to have the rear pocket area that the rear take-down inserts into already milled out for you. One of the most troublesome areas to drill out and its already done for you. Now you don't have to worry about the rear take-down pin detent bore being ruined as it is all perfectly milled to spec.

LOCATED in MARION County (South end of town) not far from the Southland Mall (US 23, ST RT 98 & ST RT 529).
You won't find this brand at Lowes or Home Depot. Napoleon is the best made insert in the business.
This is made to slide into your open fireplace and convert it to a wood burning stove. This goes thru less wood and puts out a lot more heat than an open fireplace. Has built in thermostat and electric blowers to extract the heat from your stove. Most stoves do not come with blowers except as options and Napoleon is the only one I know of with a thermostat which is nice cause it shuts the fans off before the house gets too hot.
Comes with the firebrick (removed when pulling it from the home) removed to make it lighter. This stove weighs about 400+ Lbs with all the brick installed..
Great to have heat this winter and a way to cook if the power goes out.
Price $1200.00 cash or swap for gun(s).  Willing to trade up or down.  Interested in S&W revolvers, Sig P226 P938, Glock 9mm, Weatherby, Browning, Remington 700, Varmint Calibers, 308, 300 Win Mag, 300 Weatherby, what have you got?

These are high quality 80% lowers made from 7075 t6 aircraft grade aluminium with fully broached magazine wells for perfect dropping al ALL magazines. They are made to 100% military specifications and will work with any Mil Spec Jig although I recommend the ones made for these lowers cause they work very well and come with all of the drill bits need to complete the job as well as detailed instructions. They come with a bead-blasted raw aluminium finish that looks very good as-is or is ready for paint. These are the ONLY 80% receivers on the market that have been given permission by the ATF to have the rear pocket area that the rear take-down inserts into already milled out for you. One of the most troublesome areas to drill out and its already done for you. Now you don't have to worry about the rear take-down pin detent bore being ruined as it is all perfectly milled to spec.

These are high quality 80% lowers made from 7075 t6 aircraft grade aluminium with fully broached magazine wells for perfect dropping al ALL magazines. They are made to 100% military specifications and will work with any Mil Spec Jig although I recommend the ones made for these lowers cause they work very well and come with all of the drill bits need to complete the job as well as detailed instructions. They come with a bead-blasted raw aluminium finish that looks very good as-is or is ready for paint. These are the ONLY 80% receivers on the market that have been given permission by the ATF to have the rear pocket area that the rear take-down inserts into already milled out for you. One of the most troublesome areas to drill out and its already done for you.

I finally bought that rifle last week and subsequently took it to the range 3 times, using different ammo each time. 
As clean as the Auto Match is, this rifle does not like the nose of the cartridge and sometimes hangs up on the feed ramp.
It cycles the cheaper and dirtier Federal Champion 22LR better. It even eats the dirty Remington Golden bullets without much of a problem.
Every semi-auto I fired Auto Match in previously cycled  flawlessly. This ammo is made for semi-autos and has a pretty clean burning powder. It cycles great in my 22 pistol and my marlin 60, but this new one cycles better with the cheaper ammo.
I have a full case of the Auto match, and would like to trade some or all of it for Federal Champion 36 grain copper plated 22LR or Winchester M-22.I'd trade round for round of these. I'd even consider trading some of it for Remington Golden bullets if they were the ones that say NEW AND IMPROVED on the box, but it would have to be one box of auto match for two 225 round boxes of the Remington, because I'll have to spend  more money in cleaning supplies if I shoot that and extra time cleaning.
I am open to reasonable offers as long as it's not ""aguila"" or anything like that. If you need or want some Auto Match 22LR and have some of the cheaper Federal Champion 22LR or something similar to trade, let me know. I am open to reasonable trades. The key word is REASONABLE.
I would consider selling the Federal Auto Match outright too, but it would have to be $35.00 a box simply because it would cost that or more to replace it, plus I'll have to spend the next 6 months trying to find the other ammo that cycles in this rifle."

This Garand has been restored by me, to damn near 100% correct. All you would need to have this thing fully restored is the stock with a DAS (DoD Acceptance Stamp) which will hit the wallet a little bit, but not too bad considering it will make this Garand a lot more valuable. Anyways, the Garand that I am selling will come with a MRT sling dated for 1955 (original issue sling, not original to the rifle, but an actual USGI sling. These MRT slings run around $40.), a cleaning kit that runs well over $48 with the grease pot, rods, and oiler bottle. Basically, I've got some money wrapped up in this thing. My brother in-law's dad refinished the stock so it looks a little nicer that it came from the CMP. If you'd rather it be ""less shiny"" you can easily sand her down or buy a stock set from Boyd's.

-Rifle is a CMP rifle and WILL come with the CMP certificate.
-Rifle from the CMP gauged at ME 1+/TE 2+
-Rifle Barrel is ORIGINAL to the receiver.
-ALL parts are CORRECT for this rifle year AND are ALL Springfield parts.

The rifle you will be buying (if you choose to) is the one on the bottom in each picture.

This same rifle in the condition it is in with the parts it has got has been seen fetching over $1,400 on the CMP forums, so my ""cash price"" is somewhat firm at $1,200."

I would love a FDE or OD green, but people seem to forget that FDE and OD Glocks DO NOT(!!!!!!!!!!) retail for more then black ones so unless you're famous and will sign something stating you owned this FDE or OD gun, don't expect a bunch extra, so if you expect an additional $100 or more just cause of color, forget it. Tell me what you have, what comes with, any mods done and most importantly PRICE. Don't need to exchange emails for 2 weeks just to find out you want way more then a new one costs in store. I consider myself to be relatively knowledgable on guns, especially Glocks. I will, upon inspection, field strip your glock and and check a few things. Even if you claim it to be brand new I'll still check. Do you trust me? Of course not, I'm a stranger, and that's a 2 lane highway."

If you would like to enter the world of gun ownership, but don't know where to start, I can help. My Firearms 101 course was created for beginners and novices.

For those who desire a CCW permit, I offer that course every other weekend. I consider it to be the best, most comprehensive NV CCW course offered in Northern Nevada.  I even offer a free-sit in (audit) CCW course for those who just want to learn about their 2nd Amendment rights, as well as the laws and statutes in Nevada relating to the justifiable use of deadly force. It's a real eye-opener!

For those who already have a CCW permit, but need to renew it, I offer the NV CCW Renewal Course every other weekend.

For those who are proficient in handguns, but want to expand their skills beyond the basics, I have a super course called Firearms 202.  You regular shooters will love this course!

Lastly, I provide firearms training for professional armed guards who are employed in Nevada. 

Let me know what your training goals are – we probably have a class for you.

I would consider other Colts but don't have any interest in heavy barrels, visibly used rifles, or any other brand of AR.

I also would like to buy a Smith&Wesson M&P15-22 with a threaded barrel. I don't want a 15-22 without a threaded barrel.

I also am interested in buying a new (or almost new) Kahr PM9 and a Beretta 92F.

So just tell me what you need for any of these guns that you own and we can work out a deal.

The E2 in 9mm is a very wonderful gun.  It has factory Sig Night sights and comes with the factory installed SRT (short reset trigger.)  The E2 comes with 3 15 round magazines all Sig originals, and the original Sig box.  Pistol is very accurate and wonderful to shoot.

I am only looking to trade for a Sig Sauer P229 in .40 S&W.  Your pistol must have Sig Night sights, and the SRT is desired as well but not a deal breaker if it doesn't have it.  I am not looking for the SAO, DAO, or the DAK versions of the P229, I want the SA/DA version.  

I will also consider a Glock 23 plus cash (to make up the difference in price).  I would like a Glock 23 with night sights but standard sights are acceptable.  Along with a trade for a Glock 23 I can also add a Crossbreed holster and a Triple K Shoulder holster that fit the P229.

I am also willing to trade some ammunition.

All trades will be in the Colorado Springs to Castle Rock area, I will not travel all the way across the state to make a trade.  Must be legaly able to own a firearm, I will require to see your CO DL/CCW in order to trade.  If you have any comments or questions or would like to see any other pictures please let me know."

I have for sale 2 new/never used stainless steel parkerizing tanks with lids and ½” drain valves. I bought these thinking I was going to learn how to parkerize guns but never got around to it so these have just been sitting collecting dust. Also included with this is 1 gallon of Zinc Phosphate Parkerizing Solution and 1 gallon of Post Treatment Solution, both new and unopened. Each gallon of chemical is concentrated and gets mixed with 4 gallons of water for 5 total gallons of each, which is the capacity of each tank. 

I paid right around $450 shipped to the door for the pair of tanks/lids plus around $125 shipped to the door for the chemicals. I have around $575 wrapped up in this but I will sell everything as a set for $400 cash or $450 trade value. Located in Dublin and you must be willing to meet in the Dublin area for the sale.

Not interested in bows, crossbows, or black powder.

Here is the description of the tanks from the manufacturer:

6""x6""x40"", pure 304 Stainless Steel. Tank, cover, and Stainless Steel ball valve are included. 

We are proud to offer the very best Parkerizing Tanks in the industry. They are cut and formed out of pure 304 stainless steel. Handles are formed right into the ends. All edges of these tanks are hemmed, so there are no exposed sharp edges. Feel free to handle these tank with your bare hands! 

The tanks are TIG welded using supreme skill and elaborate tooling. The outside of the welds are treated and polished to reveal the beauty of the stainless steel and show the excellence of the weld. We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied."

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

2008 Tomberlin Emerge E-4 LSV (Low Speed Vehicle)/ Electric Car. It is black in color and only has 1085 miles. It was just serviced at Palmetto Custom Carts in Mt. Pleasant, an authorized Tomberlin Dealer.  All batteries tested at 100% with regards to state of health and charge, with the exception of one, which tested at 97% (I have printout of test results).  They are all re-conditioned Trojan batteries, with 4 being 2011, and 4 being 2009.  The vehicle has a custom full enclosure with matching seat covers (cost approx. 1k).

This vehicle can be tagged and registered through DMV as a LSV, having met all of the guidelines of the DOT. This would allow you to operate the vehicle anywhere there is a 35mph speed limit or under. It can also be registered as a golf cart, which would allow operation on streets 25mph or less within a certain distance of your registered home. This vehicle will literally pay for itself over time, as it will save you in gas expenses ( See SC Laws pertaining to LSV's/ Electric Cars/ Golf Carts). Below documentation was taken from Tomberlin's Website. For inquiries or to set up an appointment, please call 8four3-44two-20one9. Thank you.


The E-Merge E-4 is an aggressively styled, four passenger, street-legal, electric car that can charge overnight on a standard 110 volt outlet and have a range in excess of 30 miles. It is targeted to individuals in local neighborhoods and communities for running errands, commuting and general recreation. Its powerplant will generate almost 11 kilowatts making it capable of a top speed of 25 mph and giving it the ability to aggressively climb hills. The Tomberlin E-Merge™ has 4 wheel braking, seat belts, tip-over-bar, lights, and is street legal.

Brand new with tags, just received them in the mail today. Ordered 2, one for me and my wife. One is OD green and the other one is Black. They are really nice but we changed our minds when they were already being mailed to us and was too late to cancel. We decided to get something a bit smaller (like the 5.11 covrt backpacks). It would be a hassle to try and ship them back to return them, plus we'd have to pay to restock them because there is nothing wrong with them we just changed our minds. If you don't know about these back packs please look them up they are one of the best you can get. Will sell for $140 each FIRM OR will trade for 2 NEW 5.11 covrt 18 backpacks plus a little cash on your end..otherwise just cash only no other trades please. Please don't e-mail me and ask if I will take lower than $140, these are brand new with tags and we are already taking a price cut because we changed our minds so our loss is your gain, thank you.

I am selling a complete concealed carry package which includes:

    Crimson Trace Laser
    Old Faithful IWB Kydex and Leather holster fitted for the pistol with the laser
    Pierce grip installed + extra Pierce Grip
    Nylon pocket holster
    All boxes, manuals, and paperwork for everything


The Pistol:

    This Kahr CM9 pistol has had less than 100 rounds put through it and is in excellent condition. It was thoroughly cleaned after its two visits to the range. The original box and paperwork is included. It has a single 6 round magazine which give the pistol a 7 round capacity. I have installed a Pearce grip to give your pinky a place to rest. I include the original base of the magazine as well as an additional Pearce grip.



The Laser:

    Installed is an LG-437 laser sight which provides an instinctive front-activation point that engages with your natural firing grip. Simply hold the weapon normally and the Laserguard activates, placing a bright red dot where the gun is aimed. Seamlessly mounted to the trigger guard, this instinctive solution is critical to personal defense, and an excellent way to outfit your premium quality Kahr Arms concealed carry weapon. All the original box, paperwork, and tools are included.

The Holsters:

    This gun fits in your pocket making it perfect for summer wear, and a simple nylon holster is provided for that. Additionally this package contains an Old Faithful leather and Kydex holster which has been shaped for the pistol and the laser. This is a waste band concealed holster made of very high quality material, and I have found these to be one of the most comfortable holsters available.


I am asking $600 for all of this, but will consider interesting trades.

 I will accept credit card payments for a 3% transaction fee (the fee I am charge). I am not a dealer  this is a private sale. I am located in the Galleria area of North Dallas. Must be willing to sign a bill of sale or show a CHL."

Lots of people have negative opinions of the WASR (Perhaps you've heard of the acronym: What A Shitty Rifle) but I can assure you that the problems that the original 10-round WASR-10s have been fixed by the WASR-10/63.
There are no functional issues and the front sights have only the slightest cant which I have not found to affect accuracy. (Note that I handpicked this rifle from a local store, I did not order online.)

I hate selling this rifle, I bought it not too long ago but I'm having some financial issues and I just can't justify having it, so no trades, cash only.
