Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series.

THE DURABLE SUPPRESSOR

With its construction of ultra high performance and tough Stainless Steel, the Spectre II allows weapon fire to go virtually unnoticed. It is not only super tough, but also one of the quietest 22 suppressor known to man. With the Spectre II, users will also enjoy its multi-caliber versatility.

CLICK TOGETHER ASSEMBLY (CTA) BAFFLE STACK

The Spectre II has a unique CTA baffle design for easy disassembly and is user serviceable, which is very important for any .22 lr silencer. Because the .22 lr round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue .22 silencers must be able to be disassembled for cleaning and regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22 lr silencers on the market. The Spectre II has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily."

Trying to pay my way through college and unfortunately that means selling some of my guns...

I have only taken this gun to the range twice and put about 50 rds. through it each time. I took it to Cabelas and they appraised it at 90% but I wasn't happy with what they would give me for it.

It includes all original items, box, manual, shell casing, carry case... I will also include my DeSantis Nemesis pocket holster. This thing is great to carry in your back pocket or center console I would really like to hang onto it.

I am asking $350+shipping. I see them going for about $100 more than that in a lot of cases on gunbroker and armslist.

242,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1278242,For Sale:  Silencerco Osprey .45.  Black in color!,"Fern Creek, Louisville, Kentucky",$ 750,"Listed On: Thursday, January 23, 2014",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"With the modern combat handgun in mind, Silencerco set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. Silencerco went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP.


The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length."

Yugoslavian M92 parts kit and a no dak spud receiver to make this impressive firearm.

Please note, this gun is used but in immaculate condition. This gun has had 60 rounds through it since Red Jacket built it. 

One of the things that makes this firearm so incredibly unique is the fact that the original Yugoslavian military issue barrel was utilized. The United States Department of Defense no longer allows the import of functioning barrels to be included with parts kits imported into the U.S. Barrels made in the U.S. are offered and often included with parts kits like these - the trouble is that the U.S. made barrels pale in comparison to a military-issue quality barrel.

Since the factory barrel was used, the previous owner had Red Jacket pin their inert silencer onto the muzzle of the firearm, thus making it NFA compliant. Due to that, this gun transfers to a regular FFL and no $200 tax stamp is needed as it is not considered an SBR (short barrel rifle). The inert silencer does not actually silence the sound. It is a dummy silencer. It's purpose is to extend the barrel, and it looks really cool.

This rifle has 1 magazine that comes with it. I am asking $3,000 or best offer. I am on the fence about selling this gun, and not in a hurry to do so."

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Cleaning kit, sling, and 1 magazine are standard.
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 6.95 lb - ideal for tactical use.

It is from the 3rd production run of CAI, so it has NONE of the problems you hear about with the earlier Cetme's. You can tell it's a 3rd Gen from the straight barrel without threading or a flash hider. The bolt is not ground, cocks as smooth as butter, and fires very smoothly.

It is in great shape. Has a few spots of ware, but nothing abnormal.
Has recently refinished wood furniture on it, stained in a dark red mahogany color. Also, inside, it has a rubber recoil buffer in it, making it about the tamest .308 recoil out there. Has a rail on it so scope mounting is possible.

Comes with ALOT of extras:
~Original Cetme black furniture, recoil assembly, and pistol grip. (Top of stock has a crack in it. Can be repaired, just don't know how.)
~G3 Olive Stock with recoil assembly (Has crack on the bottom, but can be repaired), 2 Olive hand gaurds (One is stock, the other one has the vent holes drilled out), Olive Pistol grip.
~G3 Black Stock, Black hand guard (with holes drilled out) (The tropical green ones have been painted black)
~New, never installed Carry Handle
~3 Aluminum 20 Round HK G3 Mags
~1 Steel 20-Round Cetme Mag
~1 RARE Steel 5-Round Cetme Mag 

G3 and Cetme surplus parts are drying up, so having the black, tropical, and olive parts is a plus. (Yes the stocks have small cracks, but can easily be repaired. I never messed with them, because they came with the rifle, and I wanted the wood parts on it.) Just consider them extras included in the deal!

I would sell outright in cash for $1100!  I am in no hurry, and do not have to sell.  You;d be hard pressed to find another Cetme that runs as well as this one does!"

The other has ""ALLAHU EKBER"" carved on the side of the upper handguard.

There is a lot of variance in the price of firearms these days, particularly in the AR styles.  So given this is an AR-22, and based on one of the greatest guns every made, the Ruger 10/22,  I will let the market dictate what it sells for.  Rifle has never been fired and comes with a Leapers 30mm red/green tactical dot scope. I also bought an AR style case for it to hold extra magazines.  This gun comes with one BX-25 Magazine.

The Samozaryadnaya Vintovka Tokareva (SVT-40) was designed by Soviet Arms Designer Fedor Tokarev. It was manufactured between 1941 and 1945. The SVT-40 is an improved and simplified rifle design over the SVT-38. 
During WWII SVT-40 rifles were highly prized captures by both German and Finnish troops. Many pictures in books of German troops on the eastern front carrying the SVT-40. 
The biggest issue with the SVT 40 is the ejection of the spent casing due to improper gas cartridge adjustment and improper powder loads. DO NOT use any loads over 150 grain as this will destroy the gas chamber. Overall condition is rated as fair to good for an old surplus military rifle that will never be imported again into the USA. 10 magazine is an aftermarket so not all original, all other numbers match. Wood stock has 2 cracks/splits at rear top and at mag well. Gun has some surface rust spots. I would grade gun as fair to good condition. Still has blueing on metal parts. Additional pictures could be emailed to serious buyers only!! If must be shipped, I will only ship to an FFL Licensed Holder Dealer Only!! Great for shooting , collecting or the one that got away! Serious Inquiries Only Please!!! These will never be imported again so no B.S., will just place back into the safe where the value is only going up still.

The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 M150 Rifle Combat Optic Scope provides fast target acquisition and superb optical clarity. This scope in the Trijicon ACOG series needs no tools for windage and elevation adjustments.

These revolutionary Trijicon riflescopes, originally designed for the military, are now offered in a lightweight compact design. The Trijicon 4x32 ACOG Army M150 Rifle Scope is the smaller, lighter weight, and more compact version of the full sized Trijicon ACOG rifle scope. Even with its reduced size, the ACOG scope by Trijicon delivers the same precision any-light aiming capabilities: the same accuracy and the same tough, dependable performance as the original ACOG rifle scope by Trijicon. At less than 6 ounces, the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 M-150 Waterproof Rifle Combat Optic Sight is perfect for fast-moving tactical teams operating in close quarters or for speed-oriented competition venues.

Heres some info on the detector 
Minelab Explorer SE Pro

Since it was founded some 20 years ago, Minelab Electronics has continually set the standard for in-field metal detector performance at some of the most difficult sites around the world. Today, treasure hunters equipped with a Minelab Explorer or E-Trac and some basic tools are recovering thousands of collectible coins, valuable pieces of jewelry and rare artifacts spanning the centuries on a regular basis.



This fourth generation Explorer surpasses anything you’ve seen for depth, sensitivity and superior discrimination!

Whats new about the Explorer SE PRO Metal Detector?

Minelabs Newest Explorer SE Professional 11 inch DD Search coil:

Improvements in performance:

- Re-designed to pickup the smaller targets better and Deeper
- Better Separation of Targets over the previous coils
- Detectors sensitivity can be operated at a higher level with less noise and interference

With the Explorer SE Professional you can now discriminate targets in the digital screen using the dual coordinate ferrous and conductivity digital display, giving you over 1000 pre-programmed target signatures. Explorer SE PRO’s dual coordinate digital display is the most advanced target ID system on the market today. Not only will you be able to predict the type of coin underneath the coil, you might also be able to guess the coin’s date!

The Full Band Spectrum (FBS) circuit automatically transmits multiple frequencies simultaneously. The increased frequency range means that the signal received from the detector coil is analyzed from a wide range of responses. This allows the Explorer SE Professional to analyze more target information so that the Target Identification (ID) is more accurate.

Ground balancing is automatic with Minelab’s advanced digital filtering. Whatever field conditions you encounter, from dry clay to wet black sand or rich loam, Minelab will find what you’re looking for. Minelab’s unique FBS technology means deep, sensitive, accurate detecting.

What I have is a completely ready to go shooters package. The rifle is a norinco Mak 90 ak47. I'm gonna put a value around 2k for the whole rig (hard case not included)

Understand that if you put a $600(Pre panic) value in the base rifle I have $1,128.00 (I just added up invoices). That being said if you have a quality ar-15 I am looking for a close to straight trade (I am negotiable).

So no your bushmaster, dpms, delton etc is not what I am looking for in a straight trade. And if you have a PSA it will need extras. Pre panic or post panic values won't matter both rifles have gone up in value. My rifle is worth a 1k before the panic, stock psa is 800 so know that before you offer. 

The rifle is outfitted with the following parts, 

Ar 15 6 position stock adapter 
Magpul Moe stock 
Hogue pistol grip 
Krebs custom safety selector 
Krebs custom peep sight 
Solar tactical magwel adapter (makes for very fast and way mag changes) 
Midwest industries quadrail milled for micro red dot 
Magpul angled for grip 
And spikes tactical Dynacomp 

8- 30rd mags 
1- 5 rnd mag 
1600 rds of 7.62x39 

This is the smoothest, and softest shooting ak I have ever ran. Runs 100% and is in good condition. If you look up these parts you will see everything is of the best quality. It will come with all the original furniture pictured, nothing permenent was done, everything can be take off to revert it back to its original state. 

I don't need to get rid of this I just want to see what's out there trades are listed below.

Please don't offer bolt guns, any of the ruger mini series unless its a new style mini 14, or any shotguns unless its a straight trade for a keltec ksg.

Street legal with title Enduro (must have electric start) 

Springfield m1 varient with ammo or cash depending on the model 

Smith an Wesson revolvers 

Quality FAL (no backyard builds)

Any H&K rifles or subgun style pistols 

High end long range optic with atleast 1k cash 

Pair of colt pythons in excellent or better condition 

High end 18"" barreled ar-15 with cash mags and or ammo
