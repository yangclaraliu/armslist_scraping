I love this cue but I have a new cue I primarily use so I no longer need this one. This cue will not disappoint and you have to see it to appreciate it; pictures just don't do it justice. This cue sells new for $520.00 and I am taking a loss asking only $300.00 or best offer.

*Why would anyone need tracers, since they’re not as accurate?
-Put one as second- or third-to-last round in a mag to let you know you’re almost out.  I do this.
-W/ full mag or one half full of tracers: psychology! Seeing rounds flying around rather than just hearing them has quite a demoralizing effect on an opponent.  This is why I keep one mag full of tracers among the nine I carry.
-They light stuff on fire.  Not good for the range, but really nice in a firefight.
-They’re just cool as hell to shoot when you can."

It is an improvement over Stainless, Hard Chrome, Color Case Hardening and many, many other traditional finishes. It is a Salt Bath Nitride finish which is hundreds of times thicker than black oxide coatings and the Melonite will still be there after the black finish has worn off. After bathing in almost 1,000 degree salt bath the finish is left with a thich corrosion resistant very hard surface.

I buy my ammo as I travel back and forth across the state. Stop in at jays and buy rounds for the guns I got. I didn't hoard but I do enjoy buying and shooting. I didn't realize how much I have so it doesn't make sense for me to continue stopping in to pick something up. I enjoy doing it so need to make it make sense. If you know jays you know they cost more. 100 value pack costs 53.99 plus tax. So .57 is exactly what I paid for the ammo. actually like .57229 but .57 works.  I suppose I would accept cash if your taking them all... and I would continue my enjoyment stopping in and picking up something I use. My intent is maybe work out a trade. All of my ammo is 230gr fmj. I did pick up a couple boxes of blazer aluminum to see how it cycled through my pistol. I still have 1 box of 50 aluminum... but the rest are brass.

I also have 200 rounds of 7.62 nato (308)  I would let them go for 17 bucks per 20. Fmj and all brass. Exactly what I paid after taxes. Again... more interested in a trade than the money

All of my ammo is stored in a climate control safe.

1. Model 10-10. Has the box, paperwork, and original wax paper. Rare 4"" Heavy Barrel. This has hardly been used or fired. Has some wear and pitting from being stored. Nothing terrible but it isn't a collector piece at this point. $275

2. S&W .38 Snubnose - This is unmarked as far as model, which should make it a pre model 10. Built like a tank, it has been carried a lot and shows it. It has real vintage stag grips and a wonderful trigger. $225

2. S&W .38 Snubnose - Another unmarked model. Original grips. Typical vintage Smith trigger that breaks beautifully. This looks to have been stored in a holster as it has the small pitting all over the exterior. I had wiped it down well, but it could be cleaned up more if desired. $200

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

I'm selling a Glock 26 Gen 3. I've owned it a few years and am just looking for something different. I have taken care of it and have realistically put around 1200-1500 rounds through it over the past few years. 

I had my local gun store install Trijicon H3 night sights, but I did NOT keep the original sights. I also have installed a Ghost 3.5lb Trigger Connector, but I still have the original connector (unlike the sights).

I also have a brand new, never worn CrossBreed IWB holster, model: SuperTuck Deluxe. It is right handed, in Horsehide (not cowhide), and the regular cut (not combat cut). 

I have two standard mags for the Glock, one with the pinky-extension, and also the mag loader, which I never use. 

I am willing to meet anywhere from Calhoun to Canton, Smyrna, Marietta, Kennesaw, Roswell, Sandy Springs, and everywhere in between. 

I would prefer to have a local gun store (FFL) perform a transfer of the Glock to you so it clears my name from the serial number. I will cover the fee for the transfer if you are willing to meet me at the store to complete the paperwork. I just don't want to deal with any potential phone calls from Mr. Policeman at 2:00am in 5 years saying they found a handgun at a double homicide in downtown and the serial is registered in my name. Regardless of how ridiculous it sounds, I want the peace of mind. I will be more than happy to work out the details where the buyer and I are both satisfied with the sale. Thank you.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

 Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

 The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
 The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another.

770,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1767770,For Sale:  Standard Pressure Short Barrel Low Flash Heavy .38 Special Ammo - 125gr.

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

This load is flash suppressed, so firing it in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings where we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20E utilizes a Jacketed Hollow Point 125 gr. Jacketed hollow nose bullet. This bullet is designed to expand at low speeds and has no problem opening up at considerably less velocity than our advertised 900 fps, from two inch barrels. Penetration in human tissue is roughly 12 inches."

The previous owner told me that it is less than a year old, and is a Gander Mountain special edition (compact frame, full size slide- A.K.A. a long slide compact). 

The p250 is the first and only modular handgun system, which means that you can purchase a full size or sub compact frame (~$45), and the whole trigger assembly (with serial number) drops right in. You can also purchase different slides, (various lengths and calibers) from Sig, and almost all are interchangeable. The pistol is DAO, and has night sights installed. It also comes with a 15rd mag, a padded box, lock, and user manual.

P. Sauer & Sohn, then based in Suhl, Germany. The ""H"" in the model number denotes ""hammerless""—the pistol uses an internal hammer. Marked as 7.65 cal. It was produced between 1939–45. The model 38H was used by German armed forces such as the Luftwaffe, as well as police forces in numbers nearly equal to the Walther PPK. THIS PISTOL HAS THE German Wehrmacht MARKS (MILITARY) !The Sauer 38H was produced for military, police, and the commercial market. Wehrmacht stamped.  I believe it to be the third variation according to the serial number. It is a nice piece of NAZI history from WW2. It is a used pistol that is around 74 years old.

It is perfect for teaching a young boy or girl how to fire & also get them comfortable working with firearms.  Because it breaks down into two pieces and is not bulky it would also be very convenient for camping or hiking.  Both barrels connect very simply & quickly. (No Tools Required) This also makes cleaning the barrels an easy task. You only have to press a lever and the barrel slides right out so you can change it to the other one.
