Hello, 
     I have a Brand New Ruger 10/22 Semi-Automatic Reaper Camo Rifle for sale. This is the Factory Detailed Ruger Reaper Camo High Quality 10/22 with scope. This rifle was only taken out of it's box for pictures. These rifles are hard to find and will be illegal to sell in New York after April 15, 2013 because of the 10 round detachable magazine. The 10 round magazines can only be purchased until April 15th. Private sales after March 15 will have to produce a N.I.C.S background check before the sale. They are 'OUT OF STOCK' in all the stores. Gander Mountain said they are not even on back order, they are nonexistent. Dicks will not even sell them. If you meet me in Geneseo, NY or Dansville, NY and have cash I will sell the rifle, magazines and ammo for $499.00. If I meet you in the Rochester area, Batavia, Perry, Bath, or Canandaigua please add $20.00. That's my lowest price. 

               Thank you very much, Kirk

I am selling this like new Winchester Model 94 30-30 Deer Rifle ( I believe it's called a Wrangler).  I can not say how many rounds have been fired through this rifle but it is possible that number is zero.  It has near perfect Birch Wood stocks.  It comes with a rifle case that is also from 1967 and has the look of tooled leather of the 60's.  The only thing that I can see wrong with the rifle is there must have been a Saddle Ring installed because there is a threaded hole where one would normally be.  I do not have the ring but they are available new.  The barrel bore is perfect and the magazine tube is spotless and operates freely.  The rifle is cleaned, oiled and ready to shoot.  There is ZERO rust on the rifle.  I am asking $500 or best reasonable cash offer.  I would listen to any interesting firearm trade offers, especially a .223 bolt action heavy barrel varmint rifle.  Email me with you contact info and/or trade offer and I'll get back to you.  Low-Ball offers and rude people will be ignored."

Simple in design, ZiP™ is a new Modular Weapons System, delivering amazing features with performance and upgradeability. With a near unlimited service life - you will experience The Future of Fun™ and a great day at the range. Camping, hiking, exploring the world -  ZiP™ adapts to any mission.
ZiP™ delivers a long sought after vision of “X-box” gamers and advanced weapon enthusiasts not possible until now. A futuristic weapons system where the unique arrangement of the principal components enables overall compactness and results in a new form factor. Multiple platform enhancements including the ZiPPIC™ Rail, ZiPNite™ Rail -or- the ZiPSBR™ Rail allow attachment of ZiP™ to your AR. (Approved ATF Form 1 Permit Required.) This makes ZiP™ The Future of Fun™ while delivering the compelling new “ZiP-Action” at an incredible value.

ZiP™ has a new and efficient form factor which makes possible the new ZiP-Action™ and 5 safeties, including a traditional cross-bolt trigger safety, a new modern sear safety improved by the development of a new linear trigger, and no winding trigger bar (also eliminating any dependency on the tiny coil spring in the rear of those dated striker designs) and lastly, a striker block which remains closed for nearly all of the trigger travel — opposite of all modern striker guns — making ZiP™ one of the most advanced platforms ever offered.

These improvements will have significant benefits for future ZiP™ family weapons design and delivering unmatched value to consumers.

Exceptionally affordable and with more features and functionality than any weapon ever delivered to date. The ZiP™.22 L.R. brings a whole new meaning to the term gun of the future.
ZiP™ delivers a long sought after vision of “X-box” gamers and advanced weapon enthusiasts not possible until now. A futuristic weapons system where the unique arrangement of the principal components enables overall compactness and results in a new form factor. Multiple platform enhancements including the ZiPPIC™ Rail, ZiPNite™ Rail -or- the ZiPSBR™ Rail allow attachment of ZiP™ to your AR. (Approved ATF Form 1 Permit Required.) This makes ZiP™ The Future of Fun™ while delivering the compelling new “ZiP-Action” at an incredible value.
ZiP™ has a new and efficient form factor which makes possible the new ZiP-Action™ and 5 safeties, including a traditional cross-bolt trigger safety, a new modern sear safety improved by the development of a new linear trigger, and no winding trigger bar (also eliminating any dependency on the tiny coil spring in the rear of those dated striker designs) and lastly, a striker block which remains closed for nearly all of the trigger travel — opposite of all modern striker guns — making ZiP™ one of the most advanced platforms ever offered.
These improvements will have significant benefits for future ZiP™ family weapons design and delivering unmatched value to consumers.

Exceptionally affordable and with more features and functionality than any weapon ever delivered to date. The ZiP™.22 L.R. brings a whole new meaning to the term gun of the future.
ZiP™ delivers a long sought after vision of “X-box” gamers and advanced weapon enthusiasts not possible until now. A futuristic weapons system where the unique arrangement of the principal components enables overall compactness and results in a new form factor. Multiple platform enhancements including the ZiPPIC™ Rail, ZiPNite™ Rail -or- the ZiPSBR™ Rail allow attachment of ZiP™ to your AR. (Approved ATF Form 1 Permit Required.) This makes ZiP™ The Future of Fun™ while delivering the compelling new “ZiP-Action” at an incredible value.
ZiP™ has a new and efficient form factor which makes possible the new ZiP-Action™ and 5 safeties, including a traditional cross-bolt trigger safety, a new modern sear safety improved by the development of a new linear trigger, and no winding trigger bar (also eliminating any dependency on the tiny coil spring in the rear of those dated striker designs) and lastly, a striker block which remains closed for nearly all of the trigger travel — opposite of all modern striker guns — making ZiP™ one of the most advanced platforms ever offered.
These improvements will have significant benefits for future ZiP™ family weapons design and delivering unmatched value to consumers.

This is not your DPMS or Carbon-15 AR15. The fit and finish of this gun is incridble and the accuracy and dependablity is proven. Offical AR15 of the DEA and many other law enforcement agencies. Must have ID and or CHL. No expenses have been saved making this AR15 my own. I am the original owner purchasing it new with around 500 Rounds down the barrel. Very accurate and comfortable gun to shoot, this is the perfect mid-range AR15 with QUALITY add-on's.

Yugoslavian AK-47 variant Model M70AB2 with underfolding/underfolder stock and polymer furniture chambered in 7.62x39mm. It comes with 2 Master Molder (aka Thermold) Military/LE Only-marked (see photo) 48 round magazines and 1 Tapco Intrafuse Polymer 30 round magazine.

The AK is marked ZASTAVA-KRAGUJEVAC YUGOSLAVIA on the rear sight block (see photo). This rifle is built using the RPK style trunion that is very heavy duty. A characteristic of this trunion is that you can see bulges on the side of the receiver and it is the strongest one you can use. The bolt carrier group is polished and not the cheaply painted ones. The barrel is excellent with no pitting and strong rifling.

The receiver is made by DC Industries and sold by Century Arms, Inc as the M70AB2. Both companies names are stamped into the receiver along with the model, serial number and caliber (7.62x39mm). This is one of the best and most robust US-made stamped receivers right up there with Nodak-Spud. The steel used in this receiver is 1.6mm thick, whereas most US made receivers are usually 1mm and if you're lucky you will find some that are 1.5mm thick.

Additionally, this package includes 3 high capacity magazines. 2 Master Molder 48 round magazines made of a strong polymer. These magazines were made exclusively for the Canadian military by Master Molder of Wilson, NC (also known as Thermold later on). These magazines are very strong and practically indestructible. I use them in all of my AK variants with no problems or FTF, etc. I am also including a Tapco Intrafuse 30 rd polymer magazine. These are very popular and have been around a long time. They are a strong polymer and use a steel floorplate. All of these magazines are Made in the USA and count as 922r compliant parts. The rifle comes with the Century Arms factory black polymer handguards and contoured finger groove pistol grip. The folding stock operates very smoothly and is very tight. Does not wiggle/rattle/wobble at all. I am also including a NEW surplus Black Nylon Web Sling with leather frogs.

If you are an AK or SOVIET/USSR era COLLECTOR or HISTORY BUFF you are going to love this part

I am also including a set of original issue Yugoslavian furniture that was recovered from the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990's (Serbia-Bosnia Conflicts, etc.), often mislabeled as the (modern) Balkan Wars. These are very cool and unique as they have what is called ""TRENCH ART"" on them. Basically, when the soldiers weren't fighting or were holed up in a trench, etc. the soldiers would carve family names, initials, crests, designs and various expressive lettering and emblems onto their wood furniture and plastic pistol grip to personalize their issued rifle. The furniture also shows signs of use from combat and could probably tell some great stories if it talked.(see photos for more detail)

The action is very smooth and recoil is almost non existent, the trigger is smooth but a bit heavy.  To remedy the heavy trigger I had a gunsmith polish the plastic trigger and surround it is much better now, while the gun was there he also polished the feed ramp, bench cleaned, and Teflon coated.  He said the gun was in very good condition and looks like it hasn't been fired that much, the rifling is very sharp, and there were no signs of rust or corrosion of any kind.  I put a Magpul AFG (angled fore grip) on it to enhance the ergonomics, this does NOT make it a class 3 weapon according to the ATF and can be easily removed if desired.  There are many accessories you can get for these including a scope mount for long range work, and a automatic magazine loader, loads 50 rds in 10-15 seconds. The reason I am selling is to fund an AR build that I am now doing.  I would probably get more on gun broker but figured I'd try here first. I am open to trades  for trade in prices as well.

The action is very smooth and recoil is almost non existent, the trigger is smooth but a bit heavy.  To remedy the heavy trigger I had a gunsmith polish the plastic trigger and surround and Teflon coat the entire assembly it is much better now, while the gun was there he also polished the feed ramp, bench cleaned, and Teflon coated.  He said the gun was in very good condition and looks like it hasn't been fired that much, the rifling is very sharp, and there were no signs of rust or corrosion of any kind.  I put a Magpul AFG (angled fore grip) on it to enhance the ergonomics, this does NOT make it a class 3 weapon according to the ATF and can be easily removed if desired.  There are many accessories you can get for these including a scope mount for long range work, and a automatic magazine loader, loads 50 rds in 10-15 seconds. The reason I am selling is to fund an AR build that I am now doing.  I would probably get more on gun broker but figured I'd try here first.  I saw one at a gun store today for 1400! Plus these extras!   I am open to trades for trade in prices as well.

It is in pristine condition with no scratches.  We bought this new for my wife and she used it to take her concealed carry class.  It has had less than 200 rounds fired through it.  We also put the hogue rubber grips on it.  I was very supprised on how accurate this little thing is.  It is a shooter for sure.  It has a 3.5"" barrel and 3 dot sights.  To my knowledge S&W is no longer making the alloy frame guns and these are becoming harder to get.
