 I have a Kahr PM9 I bought last month for 800 Plus Tax. Come with the NEW Disantis Black leather concealed carry hoster. Its cool as hell but a tad to small for me. I thought I wanted a pocket pistol for summer but, I have fat hands and it feels weird, even with the extender. Anyways, have put 100 rounds through it on one range trip. Kahr says 200 round break in period but I didn't get any failures to feed. Nice gun, very solid, You can tell the quality is night and day compared to the cw series, even though those guns are fine. I also went on a durracoating frenzie and did all the bottoms of my polymer pistols, turned out great but if you don't like OD green, get some laquerthinner or move on to the next post LOL. Thanks :) 600 
Will trade for:

Controlled Expansion XTP™ bullets are famous for their ability to expand reliably across a wide range of velocities. The XTP bullet was specially built to withstand incredible velocities, and still deliver controlled expansion and weight retention.

This rifle is a carbon copy of what is in use in Russia today, a top of the line AK. I've decided to move in a different direction, and as such, want it to go to a good home. I have six magazines (30 rounders) in addition to the factory five rounder. Paper work is with it including the test target. It's in mint condition, save for the safety selector line that all AK pattern rifles will get. I'm not trying to profit from the inflated prices due to this panic. If you look on gunbroker for similar rifles, they are 100 more new, but come with one mag, the five rounder or a single 30 rounder. Included is 120 rounds of ammunition, as well. 

This IS a Russian AK, own the legend. The only trades I will consider are 1,000 rounds of brass cased 5.56 and $700, or an Arsenal in 5,45. I'm not in dire need to sell the thing, so I'll be hard pressed to budge on the price. CHL holders get priority, no felons, must be face to face close to Columbus, and at least 18 years old.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

The cat's meow. A Smith & Wesson Post War Transitional Kit Gun. 22LR 4"" Barrel. 5 screw. Very Rare Smith & Wesson. All numbers match. 99% original finish. Has slight cylinder ring and ever so light blueing loss on right side of muzzle. Other than that this gun is Mint. Perfect bore and cylinders, no scratches or handling marks. Grips are perfect and all screw heads are perfect. Transitional Smiths have that non-luster dull blueing finish to them. Has the over-size cylinder release button. If you are a serious collector you know how often this gun comes out on the market. NEVER. Don't let this one get away. I try to describe it thouroughly so there are no questions, serious inquiries only if you must. Serial Number 577245 Sorry no box. Transitional Smith & Wessons have a distinct blueing on the barrel and cylinder, and a different distinct blueing on the frame, and yet another distinct blueing on the cylinder release button. These are suptle differences in the blueing."

Up for sale is an awesome Smith & Wesson SW99. Striker fire pistol, superior to glock 19 in my opinion here's why. Front Cocking Serrations, Optional Double action first trigger pull, decocker, Cocked indicator, over sized trigger guard for gloved hands, EXTREMELY ERGONOMIC, also has raised 3 dot sights not hoakie glock sights DOUBLE STRIKE CAPABILITY. Glock has none of these options. This is a walther design. However, S&W offers a life time warranty, Walther does not. If you like the PPQ or PPX you will like this pistol.

Only 2500 of these were made before the company was forced to cease production in 1982 due to the gun being too easily converted to full auto. Of those 2500, some were legally converted to FA and registered before a 1986 deadline, some were illegally converted and subsequently confiscated and destroyed, and some were confiscated with missing serial numbers (due to the ease of removing the number from the plastic receiver) and destroyed. This puts the number of remaining KG-9s at less than 2500. A definite collectors item!

These are great rifles, and I really would love to keep them, but I never shoot them and I could use the money towards other hobbies at the moment.

I only have one picture to share, I don't have any close ups of the condition. I don't have the time to set everything up to get good close ups, feel free to stop by and check these out in person. I'd prefer not to ship anyways. I don't think you'll be disappointed with how these look, feel and operate.

1) Remington 511-P: shoots short, long & long rifle. Overall it is in excellent condition. Bluing looks fantastic, no rust at all. Bore is shiny, rifling strong. Stock has some light scratches from use, but no cracks, major dents/scratches or anything of that sort. Includes both peep sight apertures, and a 5 round box magazine. [B]$280[/B]

2) Remington 34: also shoots S, L & LR cartridges. Also in excellent condition. Bluing is a little worse on this one, but still no rust. The bottom of the mag tube has a fair amount of bluing worn off, but the rest of the gun looks good. The stock is CHERRY on this one. Looks great, and I couldn't find any defects in it. This is a great shooting rifle, it handles well for it's size and it's a freakin' laser, even with bulk ammo. Also, the feed mechanism is really cool and fun to just see operate. Bore is shiny and rifling strong. [B]$320[/B]

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.

721,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1726721,For Sale:  NEW IN BOX SPRINGFIELD XDM 9MM,"Donald, Oregon, United States",$ 750,"Listed On: Thursday, June 6, 2013",Handguns,Springfield                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"So What's New??

Personalization - Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. The XD(M) gives you more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case....(M)ould-Tru Backstraps......(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System......(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case......With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.  A triple-position Picatinney rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position.  Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.

Innovations - The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M).  From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be....(M)aximum Reach Magazine Release......(M)inimal Error Disassembly......(M)ega Capacity Magazine......The modified contour of the new XD(M) grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.  Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during assembly, we've made the process easier and faster.

Technology - Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M) to a whole new level in precision.  With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches specification and precision engineering like Springfield Armory®....(M)elonite®......(M)atch Grade Barrel......(M)inimal Reset Trigger......Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance.  The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.  Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.  The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Design - Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level....(M)odel Contour Frame.......(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations......(M)ega-Lock Texture......The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.  Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.  The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function.  The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

From Leupold:
The Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sight Matte 3.5 MOA Dot ushers in the next generation of illuminated reflex sights with progressive technology that speeds target acquisition and keeps shooters of all skill levels focused andimage right on the mark. The DeltaPoint Reflex Sight by Leupold can be used with nearly any firearm, from handguns to shotguns to AR-style rifles. The Reflex Sight 's applications range from plinking to hunting to competitive shooting, as well as home defense, law enforcement and military. The Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sight 's compact size allows mounting of the sight in conjunction with a primary riflescope for use when adjusting fire from distant to short-range targets, or dealing with changing environments in a single tactical encounter.

Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sights Matte 3.5MOA come in a kit which includes numerous mounting options, saving the additional expense of purchasing separate mounts that may cost hundreds of dollars more. A special plate system aligns the mount with the gun, ensuring a good fit. Each kit has plates for 10 of the most popular handgun applications, with compatibility for up to 40 different handgun models. There is also a cross-slot mount for easy coupling with Picatinny Weaver-style rails and bases.

Key features that make Leupold Delta Point Reflex Sight a truly unique high-performance shooting optic include an innovative aspheric lens, motion activation, auto-brightness sensor, locking elevation and windage adjustment system, and an ultralight rugged magnesium housing. Exclusive to this Leupold Reflex Sight are two screws that lock in windage and elevation adjustments, preventing the reticle from wandering under heavy recoil or extended shooting periods. A generous 120-MOA of adjustment range for both windage and elevation makes zero easy to change and maintain, allowing the shooter to dial in the target with precise accuracy. Adjustment markings are ¼-inch MOA with an adjustment tool included with the sight.

With these features of the Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sight Matte 3.5 MOA Dot, Leupold has launched a next-generation optic that is extremely versatile, intuitive and rugged, while providing the ease and precise accuracy of a red dot sight.

From Surefire:
The SureFire X400 Weapon Light w/ Laser Sight is part of the finest series of handgun weaponlights in the world.Period. These gun lights combine functionality, versatility, adaptability, and durability intoimage a tiny, tough package that turns your pistol into a formidable weapon that rules the night. The Surefire X400 Flashlight features an electronically regulated, recoil-immune LED that generates 170 lumen of blinding white light and continues producing enough output to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision for nearly two and a half hours on a set of Surefire batteries. But these weaponlights aren't just about blinding bad guys. The versatile beam of the Surefire X-400 Gun Light is perfect for both close-quarter and longer-range engagements, with a tight hot spot that reaches far into the night. But it also provides enough surround beam to accommodate peripheral vision and avoid any sudden surprises, the cause of many accidental shootings.

With the addition of a cleanly integrated red laser sight below its LED, the Surefire X400 Rifle Light adds one more level of functionality. Its laser sight has a 5-milliwatt power output at 635 nanometers wavelength, making it nearly twice as visible to the human eye as any competitor's, so it is easier to track at longer distances. And because the sighting adjustment uses Nylok screws, which don't back out or easily loosen from the effects of recoil, the Surefire X400 Weapon Light rarely needs to be re-zeroed-even after extended use. Throw in details like a tempered Pyrex window; a hard-anodized aerospace-grade aluminum body; O-ring seals and gaskets for waterproofing; and ergonomic, ambidextrous switching (remote switching options also available), and it's easy to see why these lights are showing up on so many well-dressed weapons. Not just handguns, either - Surefire X400 weaponlights fit both Universal and Picatinny rails, so feel free to mount one on your Picatinny rail-equipped long gun, too. And with multiple SureFire adapter mounts available, which let you attach these Surefire weaponlights to many rail-less handguns, is there any reason your favorite pistol isn't equipped with a Surefire X400 Light? We thought not.

If you are unfamiliar with the 22TCM round it is a essentially a short .223 casing with a 40gr bullet. (See pictures 22TCM on the left, 9MM on the Right)

This pistol with the 22TCM has muzzle velocity of over 2100FPS and delivers quite punch. You Tube 22TCM and you'll see for yourself.

The pistol is a traditional full metal 1911 design. It has a fully adjustable rear sight for elevation and windage. It comes with two barrels and two recoil springs one in 22TCM and one 9MM. It has all the factory bookets, test shells, sight adjustment tool, 9MM Extractor, and 17 Round magazine. It is all packaged in the factory plasic case.

I have shot 200 rounds of 22TCM and the 9MM barrel has never been shot and is still sealed in the factory plastic.

The pistol with come with 100 Rounds of Armscor 22TCM and 25 Rounds of COP 9MM. All are JHP rounds.

The pistol has been cleaned and oiled all three times I have gone shooting at Lock and Load. It has never seen a holster and has no marks or inperfections.

This pistol is a blast too shoot, its sends a huge fireball down range and has a very distinct (loud) sound, but hardley any recoil. It is a really fun gun and get attention any time you are at the range. Lock and Load always has ammo for it because the owner has this pistol as a demo gun on his wall. So there is no worry about ammo supply in the area.

While it would be a lot of fun for our marketing department to sell the Camp 10 as the ultimate zombie-whacking tool, the truth is, it actually has a lot of other uses that you just might find to be of a more immediate nature than zombie defense. Not that we’re ignoring to the coming Zombiepocalypse, mind you. We just think that the Camp 10 makes a pretty awesome camp knife and that it does a great job of whacking campsite or other outdoor chores down to size in very short order.

From clearing brush to making kindling, the Camp 10 is the ideal outdoor and survival tool. Cut, chop, slash, hack, split, scrape—just about any task you ask of it, the Camp 10 can handle. The full-tang Camp 10 is made of carbon tool steel for toughness and wear resistance. A basic black powdercoat protects the steel and makes maintenance easier.

You’ll like the secure, contoured grip of the Camp 10, too. The handle has a built-in hand guard and is drilled in both front and rear so you can attach a lanyard either place—or both—for carrying versatility. Of course, if a zombie does get up close and personal with you, then yeah, you’ll be pretty glad to have a Camp 10 in hand, too.
