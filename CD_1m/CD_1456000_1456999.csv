Also included are (2) 25rd magazines, (2) 10rd magazines, a Magpul angled fore grip, an adjustable vertical grip, rail covers, an adjustable bipod and a single point bungee sling. It's  a great economic gun to shoot since .22lr are cheap and becoming easier to come by again so my goal is to trade for or as close to an AK as possible. I know AKs are more valuable by a little bit so I'd like to trade for a used one or new one if someone wants to do that. AK value is becoming more reasonable again since the scare prices are coming to a close with failed assault bans so please don't try to offer for my gun plus an outrageous amount of cash over the top. I like my gun and the only reason I'd like to trade is because I still have plenty of 7.62 rounds that I'd rather shoot with an AK than sell off.

Well balanced with a slightly longer or equal barrel length of most in the Makarov family.  Designed after the Walther PPK (The famous James Bond handgun) with some improvements.  Side button magazine release.  Comes with two magazines, in its original box as shown.  The images are of the actual unit. 

What I really like is the fit in the hand.  It is double acting, which is perfect for CC or home protection.  It is a point and shoot gun with all of the most popular safety features.  It weighs only 21 oz. vs. the PPK which weighs 23.5 oz. and again, feels more balanced and conforms to the hand.

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 20"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports rifle contour and length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of HBar contour (.750 under the front sight base) The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights."

Thermold Magazines started in the 1960's as a molded plastics injection manufacturer that served the automotive industry. It's founder, William Howard, was well known in his hometown of Wilson, N.C. as an innovative thinker who held many patents. Mr. Howard was also a big game hunter for whom making firearms more reliable was both a passion and a necessity.

Using a nylon resin called Zytel, developed by DuPont after World War II to replace metal in large-scale manufacturing, Thermold began producing weapons magazines that resisted heat and corrosion, and functioned with extreme reliability. Thermold magazines rapidly became the product of choice among military personnel, law enforcement officers and sport shooters around the world.

From Vigilance Rifles:
408 Cheytac. The Holy Grail of rifle cartridges, especially when being shot by the VR1 rifles. Quick follow up shots and easy impact 

reading from the low recoil of the VR1 Rifles is one of the key advantages of stepping down to a 408 Cheytac cartridge from the much 

bigger 416 Barrett or 50 BMG rifles. Not to mention VR1 rifles only weigh 18 lb. which means you can actually take it some where. It is 

the cartridge that I designed the VR1 rifles to shoot, all other calibers that we offer just happen to fit in the VR1 Rifles.

Rocky Mountain Bullets has developed real 420 gn. RBBT bullets for the 408 Cheytac, it certainly has taken the 408 Cheytac to a new 

level in performance. With the new bullets shooters are able to achieve long periods of sustained fire before accuracy deteriorates due 

to fouling, compared to shooting solid monolithics.

Distinctive from all others the VR1 is the only Semi-Auto Autoloader on the market chambered in the 408 Cheytac or 505 Gibbs. It is also 

available in 338 Lapua. The 408 Cheytac cartridge is a highbred, with confirmed kills out to 1 mile from trained hands. The VR1 holds 

five cartridges in 408 Cheytac - 505 Gibbs and 338 Lapua. The 338 Lapua is NATO and ammo is in military armaments, RAUFUS-AP-API 

are available, the cartridge proves well out to 1500 yards. VR1 shoots 1 MOA accuracy with 338 Lapua or 408 Cheytac in trained hands. 

The VR1 is not your typical M16 type conversion sniper rifle. We take great pride in the fact we completely manufacture it from the 

ground up. Our true 2-stage trigger with oil-lite bearings for a consistent reliable trigger pull. There are four sizes of bi pods and a 

mono pod available for different shooting requirements they change out in seconds. Our sling is attached to the internal frame of the 

rifle so an accidental dropping of the rifle due to sling pull is eliminated. The sling design also enables it to double as a turnacate. The 

Mill-Spec scope rail is mounted with (TORX-FHCS) this precision aligns the scope with the barrel eliminating bullet shift at different 

distances. Our safety is ambidextrous push type ( Fail Proof) with easy visual identification. We use a rotary screw bolt system that 

screws the bolt shut; this feature virtually eliminates the required force for opening and shutting the bolt. This is one of the key 

reasons that we are the only manufacturer able to make the 408 Cheytac cartridges shoot flawlessly in a Semi-Auto Autoloader. Rotary 

lock rifles usually use a spring loaded ejector, which can cause jams with high rate fire, the VR1 uses a Rotary screw bolt and fixed 

ejector for sure ejection and no jams. It is unusual to find a large caliber Semi-Auto Autoloader rifle that shoots as accurately and 

reliably as the VR1.

BENEFITS - A Long-range PRECISION SNIPER RIFLE (PSR) with quick follow up shots due to low recoil of Semi-Auto operation and Auto 

loading. Quick detachable magazines for instant load selection and increased firepower. Robust sturdy design that easily assembles 

and breaks down with no tools in under a minute with no loss of bullet impact. Easily concealable, no assembly being longer than 33 

inches. Variable caliber interchangeable barrels. A gas forward design allowing for longer periods before cleaning due to gases not 

entering the receiver area. Our list is long and all the innovations in this new rifle certainly cannot be described on a concise white 

paper. The technology and engineering in this rifle are instantly noticeable.

Features:
Designed and developed to be light and mobile and inspired by several of the finest autoloading rifles in the world, we have taken the 

best features and incorporated them into a larger than life autoloading rifle.

Chambered in four exciting large calibers, the 338 Lapua, 375 Cheytac, 408 Cheytac and 505 Gibbs. The 338 Lapua for NATO, 375 and 

408 Cheytac for long range engagement and the legendary 505 Gibbs made famous by Earnest Hemingway for unbeatable knockdown 

Power.

With five shots in the quick detachable magazine you’re sure to have plenty of firepower for the largest or most dangerous game.

Reliability of the VR1 is due to the gas port being optimally located to the chamber. The gases are cleaner and hotter up front and result 

in more reliable cycling and less fowling, the best autoloading rifles in the world use this system.

Our upper receiver is made from 17-4 PH Stainless Steel and certified Heat Treatment for high-pressure operation with such large 

calibers. The upper receiver-barrel locks securely into a lightweight hard-anodized lower receiver. The rifle uses a three-lugged rotary 

screw bolt for sure lockup, and a fixed ejector for high rate fire.

Using a 11/4 Bull Barrel for extreme accuracy and incorporating a proven Titanium Muzzle Brake for taming the Beast, makes the VR1 

easy to shoot in any of our four calibers. The VR1 Rifles come standard with our exclusive M1A style Glass Filled Nylon Stocks for all 

weather conditions and come standard with Coyote M1A CHEEKPAD. Optionally High Comb Stocks machined from (RUTPLY) premium 

wood are available in several colors.

Our exclusive Pendulum Two Stage Trigger (PTST) at the heart of the gun supplies crisp reliable trigger pull. First stage is 2-½ lb and 

second stage releases at 3-½ lb respectively, the predictability of the trigger improves shooter accuracy and confidence. Incorporated 

within the trigger system is a heavy engagement (FAIL PROOF) traditional push safety.

From Vigilance Rifles:
408 Cheytac. The Holy Grail of rifle cartridges, especially when being shot by the VR1 rifles. Quick follow up shots and easy impact 

reading from the low recoil of the VR1 Rifles is one of the key advantages of stepping down to a 408 Cheytac cartridge from the much 

bigger 416 Barrett or 50 BMG rifles. Not to mention VR1 rifles only weigh 18 lb. which means you can actually take it some where. It is 

the cartridge that I designed the VR1 rifles to shoot, all other calibers that we offer just happen to fit in the VR1 Rifles.

Rocky Mountain Bullets has developed real 420 gn. RBBT bullets for the 408 Cheytac, it certainly has taken the 408 Cheytac to a new 

level in performance. With the new bullets shooters are able to achieve long periods of sustained fire before accuracy deteriorates due 

to fouling, compared to shooting solid monolithics.

Distinctive from all others the VR1 is the only Semi-Auto Autoloader on the market chambered in the 408 Cheytac or 505 Gibbs. It is also 

available in 338 Lapua. The 408 Cheytac cartridge is a highbred, with confirmed kills out to 1 mile from trained hands. The VR1 holds 

five cartridges in 408 Cheytac - 505 Gibbs and 338 Lapua. The 338 Lapua is NATO and ammo is in military armaments, RAUFUS-AP-API 

are available, the cartridge proves well out to 1500 yards. VR1 shoots 1 MOA accuracy with 338 Lapua or 408 Cheytac in trained hands. 

The VR1 is not your typical M16 type conversion sniper rifle. We take great pride in the fact we completely manufacture it from the 

ground up. Our true 2-stage trigger with oil-lite bearings for a consistent reliable trigger pull. There are four sizes of bi pods and a 

mono pod available for different shooting requirements they change out in seconds. Our sling is attached to the internal frame of the 

rifle so an accidental dropping of the rifle due to sling pull is eliminated. The sling design also enables it to double as a turnacate. The 

Mill-Spec scope rail is mounted with (TORX-FHCS) this precision aligns the scope with the barrel eliminating bullet shift at different 

distances. Our safety is ambidextrous push type ( Fail Proof) with easy visual identification. We use a rotary screw bolt system that 

screws the bolt shut; this feature virtually eliminates the required force for opening and shutting the bolt. This is one of the key 

reasons that we are the only manufacturer able to make the 408 Cheytac cartridges shoot flawlessly in a Semi-Auto Autoloader. Rotary 

lock rifles usually use a spring loaded ejector, which can cause jams with high rate fire, the VR1 uses a Rotary screw bolt and fixed 

ejector for sure ejection and no jams. It is unusual to find a large caliber Semi-Auto Autoloader rifle that shoots as accurately and 

reliably as the VR1.

BENEFITS - A Long-range PRECISION SNIPER RIFLE (PSR) with quick follow up shots due to low recoil of Semi-Auto operation and Auto 

loading. Quick detachable magazines for instant load selection and increased firepower. Robust sturdy design that easily assembles 

and breaks down with no tools in under a minute with no loss of bullet impact. Easily concealable, no assembly being longer than 33 

inches. Variable caliber interchangeable barrels. A gas forward design allowing for longer periods before cleaning due to gases not 

entering the receiver area. Our list is long and all the innovations in this new rifle certainly cannot be described on a concise white 

paper. The technology and engineering in this rifle are instantly noticeable.

Features:
Designed and developed to be light and mobile and inspired by several of the finest autoloading rifles in the world, we have taken the 

best features and incorporated them into a larger than life autoloading rifle.

Chambered in four exciting large calibers, the 338 Lapua, 375 Cheytac, 408 Cheytac and 505 Gibbs. The 338 Lapua for NATO, 375 and 

408 Cheytac for long range engagement and the legendary 505 Gibbs made famous by Earnest Hemingway for unbeatable knockdown 

Power.

With five shots in the quick detachable magazine you’re sure to have plenty of firepower for the largest or most dangerous game.

Reliability of the VR1 is due to the gas port being optimally located to the chamber. The gases are cleaner and hotter up front and result 

in more reliable cycling and less fowling, the best autoloading rifles in the world use this system.

Our upper receiver is made from 17-4 PH Stainless Steel and certified Heat Treatment for high-pressure operation with such large 

calibers. The upper receiver-barrel locks securely into a lightweight hard-anodized lower receiver. The rifle uses a three-lugged rotary 

screw bolt for sure lockup, and a fixed ejector for high rate fire.

Using a 11/4 Bull Barrel for extreme accuracy and incorporating a proven Titanium Muzzle Brake for taming the Beast, makes the VR1 

easy to shoot in any of our four calibers. The VR1 Rifles come standard with our exclusive M1A style Glass Filled Nylon Stocks for all 

weather conditions and come standard with Coyote M1A CHEEKPAD. Optionally High Comb Stocks machined from (RUTPLY) premium 

wood are available in several colors.

Our exclusive Pendulum Two Stage Trigger (PTST) at the heart of the gun supplies crisp reliable trigger pull. First stage is 2-½ lb and 

second stage releases at 3-½ lb respectively, the predictability of the trigger improves shooter accuracy and confidence. Incorporated 

within the trigger system is a heavy engagement (FAIL PROOF) traditional push safety.


Shipping/handling for this rifle will be $75 due to size and weight. Insurance will be added, unless you request it not to be, and will cost 

1.75% of the price of the gun to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price in this auction reflects a 5% discount

therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the 

shipment, California orders on firearms will be charged an additional $25 transfer fee. If wiring funds there will be a $25 charge."

From Vigilance Rifles:
408 Cheytac. The Holy Grail of rifle cartridges, especially when being shot by the VR1 rifles. Quick follow up shots and easy impact 

reading from the low recoil of the VR1 Rifles is one of the key advantages of stepping down to a 408 Cheytac cartridge from the much 

bigger 416 Barrett or 50 BMG rifles. Not to mention VR1 rifles only weigh 18 lb. which means you can actually take it some where. It is 

the cartridge that I designed the VR1 rifles to shoot, all other calibers that we offer just happen to fit in the VR1 Rifles.

Rocky Mountain Bullets has developed real 420 gn. RBBT bullets for the 408 Cheytac, it certainly has taken the 408 Cheytac to a new 

level in performance. With the new bullets shooters are able to achieve long periods of sustained fire before accuracy deteriorates due 

to fouling, compared to shooting solid monolithics.

Distinctive from all others the VR1 is the only Semi-Auto Autoloader on the market chambered in the 408 Cheytac or 505 Gibbs. It is also 

available in 338 Lapua. The 408 Cheytac cartridge is a highbred, with confirmed kills out to 1 mile from trained hands. The VR1 holds 

five cartridges in 408 Cheytac - 505 Gibbs and 338 Lapua. The 338 Lapua is NATO and ammo is in military armaments, RAUFUS-AP-API 

are available, the cartridge proves well out to 1500 yards. VR1 shoots 1 MOA accuracy with 338 Lapua or 408 Cheytac in trained hands. 

The VR1 is not your typical M16 type conversion sniper rifle. We take great pride in the fact we completely manufacture it from the 

ground up. Our true 2-stage trigger with oil-lite bearings for a consistent reliable trigger pull. There are four sizes of bi pods and a 

mono pod available for different shooting requirements they change out in seconds. Our sling is attached to the internal frame of the 

rifle so an accidental dropping of the rifle due to sling pull is eliminated. The sling design also enables it to double as a turnacate. The 

Mill-Spec scope rail is mounted with (TORX-FHCS) this precision aligns the scope with the barrel eliminating bullet shift at different 

distances. Our safety is ambidextrous push type ( Fail Proof) with easy visual identification. We use a rotary screw bolt system that 

screws the bolt shut; this feature virtually eliminates the required force for opening and shutting the bolt. This is one of the key 

reasons that we are the only manufacturer able to make the 408 Cheytac cartridges shoot flawlessly in a Semi-Auto Autoloader. Rotary 

lock rifles usually use a spring loaded ejector, which can cause jams with high rate fire, the VR1 uses a Rotary screw bolt and fixed 

ejector for sure ejection and no jams. It is unusual to find a large caliber Semi-Auto Autoloader rifle that shoots as accurately and 

reliably as the VR1.

BENEFITS - A Long-range PRECISION SNIPER RIFLE (PSR) with quick follow up shots due to low recoil of Semi-Auto operation and Auto 

loading. Quick detachable magazines for instant load selection and increased firepower. Robust sturdy design that easily assembles 

and breaks down with no tools in under a minute with no loss of bullet impact. Easily concealable, no assembly being longer than 33 

inches. Variable caliber interchangeable barrels. A gas forward design allowing for longer periods before cleaning due to gases not 

entering the receiver area. Our list is long and all the innovations in this new rifle certainly cannot be described on a concise white 

paper. The technology and engineering in this rifle are instantly noticeable.

Features:
Designed and developed to be light and mobile and inspired by several of the finest autoloading rifles in the world, we have taken the 

best features and incorporated them into a larger than life autoloading rifle.

Chambered in four exciting large calibers, the 338 Lapua, 375 Cheytac, 408 Cheytac and 505 Gibbs. The 338 Lapua for NATO, 375 and 

408 Cheytac for long range engagement and the legendary 505 Gibbs made famous by Earnest Hemingway for unbeatable knockdown 

Power.

With five shots in the quick detachable magazine you’re sure to have plenty of firepower for the largest or most dangerous game.

Reliability of the VR1 is due to the gas port being optimally located to the chamber. The gases are cleaner and hotter up front and result 

in more reliable cycling and less fowling, the best autoloading rifles in the world use this system.

Our upper receiver is made from 17-4 PH Stainless Steel and certified Heat Treatment for high-pressure operation with such large 

calibers. The upper receiver-barrel locks securely into a lightweight hard-anodized lower receiver. The rifle uses a three-lugged rotary 

screw bolt for sure lockup, and a fixed ejector for high rate fire.

Using a 11/4 Bull Barrel for extreme accuracy and incorporating a proven Titanium Muzzle Brake for taming the Beast, makes the VR1 

easy to shoot in any of our four calibers. The VR1 Rifles come standard with our exclusive M1A style Glass Filled Nylon Stocks for all 

weather conditions and come standard with Coyote M1A CHEEKPAD. Optionally High Comb Stocks machined from (RUTPLY) premium 

wood are available in several colors.

Our exclusive Pendulum Two Stage Trigger (PTST) at the heart of the gun supplies crisp reliable trigger pull. First stage is 2-½ lb and 

second stage releases at 3-½ lb respectively, the predictability of the trigger improves shooter accuracy and confidence. Incorporated 

within the trigger system is a heavy engagement (FAIL PROOF) traditional push safety.


Shipping/handling for this rifle will be $75 due to size and weight. Insurance will be added, unless you request it not to be, and will cost 

1.75% of the price of the gun to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price in this auction reflects a 5% discount

This gun has 26 inch barrels which are both skeet chokes. Along with the gun, you will also receive a leather bound hard shell Browning case. The case alone was $200 when purchased.

I recently had this gun appraised by my gun smith and I have the paper work to go along with the purchase of this shotgun. The condition of this gun is 85% and the value of this gun is $1,100. The appraisal value is for market value, not insurance value. If it were to be appraised for insurance purposes the value of this gun would exceed over $1,800 due to the price of a new 20 gauge over under made with this type of craftsmanship and quality.

Please Email me with any questions if you are interested in purchasing this gun.

Thank You,

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

From Vigilance Rifles:
408 Cheytac. The Holy Grail of rifle cartridges, especially when being shot by the VR1 rifles. Quick follow up shots and easy impact 

reading from the low recoil of the VR1 Rifles is one of the key advantages of stepping down to a 408 Cheytac cartridge from the much 

bigger 416 Barrett or 50 BMG rifles. Not to mention VR1 rifles only weigh 18 lb. which means you can actually take it some where. It is 

the cartridge that I designed the VR1 rifles to shoot, all other calibers that we offer just happen to fit in the VR1 Rifles.

Rocky Mountain Bullets has developed real 420 gn. RBBT bullets for the 408 Cheytac, it certainly has taken the 408 Cheytac to a new 

level in performance. With the new bullets shooters are able to achieve long periods of sustained fire before accuracy deteriorates due 

to fouling, compared to shooting solid monolithics.

Distinctive from all others the VR1 is the only Semi-Auto Autoloader on the market chambered in the 408 Cheytac or 505 Gibbs. It is also 

available in 338 Lapua. The 408 Cheytac cartridge is a highbred, with confirmed kills out to 1 mile from trained hands. The VR1 holds 

five cartridges in 408 Cheytac - 505 Gibbs and 338 Lapua. The 338 Lapua is NATO and ammo is in military armaments, RAUFUS-AP-API 

are available, the cartridge proves well out to 1500 yards. VR1 shoots 1 MOA accuracy with 338 Lapua or 408 Cheytac in trained hands. 

The VR1 is not your typical M16 type conversion sniper rifle. We take great pride in the fact we completely manufacture it from the 

ground up. Our true 2-stage trigger with oil-lite bearings for a consistent reliable trigger pull. There are four sizes of bi pods and a 

mono pod available for different shooting requirements they change out in seconds. Our sling is attached to the internal frame of the 

rifle so an accidental dropping of the rifle due to sling pull is eliminated. The sling design also enables it to double as a turnacate. The 

Mill-Spec scope rail is mounted with (TORX-FHCS) this precision aligns the scope with the barrel eliminating bullet shift at different 

distances. Our safety is ambidextrous push type ( Fail Proof) with easy visual identification. We use a rotary screw bolt system that 

screws the bolt shut; this feature virtually eliminates the required force for opening and shutting the bolt. This is one of the key 

reasons that we are the only manufacturer able to make the 408 Cheytac cartridges shoot flawlessly in a Semi-Auto Autoloader. Rotary 

lock rifles usually use a spring loaded ejector, which can cause jams with high rate fire, the VR1 uses a Rotary screw bolt and fixed 

ejector for sure ejection and no jams. It is unusual to find a large caliber Semi-Auto Autoloader rifle that shoots as accurately and 

reliably as the VR1.

BENEFITS - A Long-range PRECISION SNIPER RIFLE (PSR) with quick follow up shots due to low recoil of Semi-Auto operation and Auto 

loading. Quick detachable magazines for instant load selection and increased firepower. Robust sturdy design that easily assembles 

and breaks down with no tools in under a minute with no loss of bullet impact. Easily concealable, no assembly being longer than 33 

inches. Variable caliber interchangeable barrels. A gas forward design allowing for longer periods before cleaning due to gases not 

entering the receiver area. Our list is long and all the innovations in this new rifle certainly cannot be described on a concise white 

paper. The technology and engineering in this rifle are instantly noticeable.

Features:
Designed and developed to be light and mobile and inspired by several of the finest autoloading rifles in the world, we have taken the 

best features and incorporated them into a larger than life autoloading rifle.

Chambered in four exciting large calibers, the 338 Lapua, 375 Cheytac, 408 Cheytac and 505 Gibbs. The 338 Lapua for NATO, 375 and 

408 Cheytac for long range engagement and the legendary 505 Gibbs made famous by Earnest Hemingway for unbeatable knockdown 

Power.

With five shots in the quick detachable magazine you’re sure to have plenty of firepower for the largest or most dangerous game.

Reliability of the VR1 is due to the gas port being optimally located to the chamber. The gases are cleaner and hotter up front and result 

in more reliable cycling and less fowling, the best autoloading rifles in the world use this system.

Our upper receiver is made from 17-4 PH Stainless Steel and certified Heat Treatment for high-pressure operation with such large 

calibers. The upper receiver-barrel locks securely into a lightweight hard-anodized lower receiver. The rifle uses a three-lugged rotary 

screw bolt for sure lockup, and a fixed ejector for high rate fire.

Using a 11/4 Bull Barrel for extreme accuracy and incorporating a proven Titanium Muzzle Brake for taming the Beast, makes the VR1 

easy to shoot in any of our four calibers. The VR1 Rifles come standard with our exclusive M1A style Glass Filled Nylon Stocks for all 

weather conditions and come standard with Coyote M1A CHEEKPAD. Optionally High Comb Stocks machined from (RUTPLY) premium 

wood are available in several colors.

Our exclusive Pendulum Two Stage Trigger (PTST) at the heart of the gun supplies crisp reliable trigger pull. First stage is 2-½ lb and 

second stage releases at 3-½ lb respectively, the predictability of the trigger improves shooter accuracy and confidence. Incorporated 

within the trigger system is a heavy engagement (FAIL PROOF) traditional push safety.


Shipping/handling for this rifle will be $75 due to size and weight. Insurance will be added, unless you request it not to be, and will cost 

1.75% of the price of the gun to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price in this auction reflects a 5% discount 

for certified funds that is not given if you pay with a credit card. The value of all merchandise traded will be treated like certified funds; 

therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the 

shipment, California orders on firearms will be charged an additional $25 transfer fee. If wiring funds there will be a $25 charge."

Well balanced with a slightly longer or equal barrel length of most in the Makarov family.  Designed after the Walther PPK (The famous James Bond handgun) with some improvements.  Side button magazine release.  Comes with two magazines, in its original box as shown.  The images are of the actual unit. 

What I really like is the fit in the hand.  It is double acting, which is perfect for CC or home protection.  It is a point and shoot gun with all of the most popular safety features.  It weighs only 21 oz. vs. the PPK which weighs 23.5 oz. and again, feels more balanced and conforms to the hand."

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation

Interarms, long ago, imported a number of these hard to find classics. To identify these carbines as ""theirs"", they scrubbed the year of manufacture commonly found on the breech and roll marked ""Interarms G33/50"".

The barrel is 18 inches long making this ideal for those of you who brush hunt deer, etc. Add maneuverability to the legendary accuracy of the 6.5 x 55 cartridge and what's not to like.

The action rests in a sporterized Mauser stock as you can see from the photos. The receiver has NOT been drilled or tapped, it's in its as original condition. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds and this is one caliber that hasn't gone through the roof in terms of ammunition prices.

The action, bolt, shroud, and safety are all matching numbers. I've fired this rifle, it's accurate as all get out even with the iron sights and fun to shoot.

I've got some taxes to pay and, if you have any familiarity with Swedish Mausers you'll see that the price is quite attractive as stated. Not interested in any trades at this time.

Cash is king. I live in the NW burbs of Milwaukee and will drive up to 30 minutes if you're a serious buyer. Drop me an email with any questions and we'll go from there. I have additional photos if you're interested."

 CTAC Holster
$80.00
Additional cost depends on options selected


Ideal for Hot/Humid Climates
Slim Profile
Adjustable Ride Depth
Behind-the-hip (4:00 position)


The CTAC is one of the most concealable solutions to inside the waistband (IWB) carry. The holster body is made of a hard thermoplastic called Kydex. The Kydex retains its shape even with the pistol unholstered. This allows for smooth draws and easy one-handed re-holstering of the firearm. This model is most popular in hot/humid climates due to the material being impervious to sweat or solvents.

How It Works
The CTAC has two clips, one on each side of the firearm. These clips help distribute the weight of a loaded pistol and stabilize the holster.  The low mounting point of the clip allows a shirt to be tucked in over the holster and firearm for complete concealment. By repositioning the clip heights, the cant and ride depth can be set to user preference. Each clip is attached to a leather strut that flexes to better fit your body frame.

Benefits of a Full-Kydex Holster
Our holsters are made to fit a specific model, not a generic assortment. This means your firearm will have the highest quality fit possible. The Kydex is polished to a smooth finish for minimal wear on the pistol. This material does not absorb sweat or solvents, making it popular for outdoor carry or humid climates. 

Available Clips

This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. 

The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. 

The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness

It was used in some older guns and seems to be the same as the S&W Russian.  I had an old .44 Bulldog revolver which used this ammo but have sold it.  Check to see whether it is appropriate for your weapon.  These cases are headstamped as .44 S&W Special but, because they are shorter than .44 special, they may have been cut down from longer cases to make this shorter version.  Be sure to check to see if an old weapon is safe and can fire these loads.  Some really old .44 S&W or .44 American revolvers used black powder cartridges and would not be safe with these smokeless loads.

I installed it but never used it. I have since went with something else and no longer need this one. It's listed for the Mossberg 930 but I don't see why it wouldn't fit in any 12 gauge magazine tube since all 12 gauge is the same size. 

From GG&G's website:

Mossberg 930 Shotgun Shooters want the best for their shotguns. The standard Mossberg 930 follower does not offer the upgraded features tactical shooters are looking for. It is one of the first 930 shotgun components to be upgraded. The GG&G Mossberg 930 Follower for Mossberg 12 ga. shotguns is an enhanced follower manufactured with the Mossberg Shotgun Shooter in mind.
 - Installs just like the factory 930 follower. No modification to the shotgun required.
 - The GG&G Mossberg Follower is manufactured from stainless steel for corrosion and wear resistance. The stainless steel body provides smooth operation and resists galling and contaminants imbedding into the body of the follower. These are the two major contributors to aftermarket followers malfunctioning.
 - The high visibility red insert is aluminum and is manufactured so that you cannot only quickly see that the magazine tube is empty, but in low light conditions, feel the difference between the face of the follower and the rear of a shotgun shell.
 - The follower is manufactured with a deep spring pocket to better control spring movement.
