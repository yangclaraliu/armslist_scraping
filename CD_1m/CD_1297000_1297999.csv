It comes with one original metal 30 rd magazine. bayonet lug and threaded barrel as well. the M70AB2 underfolding stock rifles use 1.5mm heavy duty RPK style receivers, along with heavier 'buldged' front trunnions.

The receiver is stainless, not stamped sheet metal. 

To be honest it does need a little work. The scope rail is screwed to the top of the receiver, it really needs a claw mount to be more secure imo. The barrel is full floating,so the handguard mount has been modified and the triple/front sight removed. I think a PSG90 forearm would look much nicer. The trigger has a custom ""shoe"" and it also has an added in adjustment screw for adjusting trigger travel. To be honest, the trigger still isn't the best, but is better than most CETME triggers.

I have an old 20 round mag that I never used and some 5 round mags. A couple of the mags work, but the others need some work I think...or try different mags maybe. Mags can be hit and miss in a CETME.

I'll also include 400 rounds of 7.62x51 in sealed packages, plus whatever used brass I have. I also have a bunch of Blanks if interested. I converted a bunch for the use in low pressure rounds for plinking and they worked great.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/19/feinstein-assault-weapons-ban-reid-senate-bill/2000119/

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday he hopes have a bill to address gun violence on the Senate floor soon after the Easter break, but confirmed that measure will not include the assault weapons ban. 

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told reporters Tuesday she is disappointed that her assault weapons ban will not be part of a larger bill, but acknowledged it will likely make it easier to pass gun-related legislation through the Senate. 

Feinstein said Reid told her Monday afternoon that the ban on certain types of military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines would not be part of package of bills that would make up the Senate legislation. 

Reid, D-Nev., said Feinstein's measure simply did not have the support necessary to clear the floor and could not pass the 60-vote threshold needed in order to be considered by the full Senate.

""Right now, her amendment, using the most optimistic numbers, has less than 40 votes. That's not 60,"" he told reporters. ""I have to get something on the floor so we can have votes on that issue and the other issues.""

The Senate Judiciary Committee passed three other measures, in addition to the assault weapons ban, over the past two weeks that are expected to be considered in some form on the Senate floor. 

These measures include bills to strengthen federal penalties for trafficking and straw purchases, improve school safety and require background checks for nearly every firearm purchase. 

Feinstein's ban will be voted on as an amendment to the larger package. 

""Obviously, I'm disappointed, because if was in the package, it would take 60 votes to get it out. You know, the enemies on this are very powerful. I've known that all my life,"" she said. As an amendment, it will require a majority of Senators to vote to add it to the bill.

Feinstein reintroduced the ban in January as a response to the mass shooting of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school Dec. 14 in Newtown, Conn.

While acknowledging her own bill would face an uphill climb as an amendment, she held out hope that a proposal by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., to ban high-capacity magazines could be voted on as a separate amendment to the bill. 

Even if the full Senate legislation does get through, Feinstein said, the fight is far from over. 

""Then we face the wonderful House of Representatives,"" she said in a sarcastic reference to the Republican-controlled chamber.

It was unclear when the full package of bills will be released, but they are expected to be voted on as early as April. 

The path in the House remains even murkier. 

Asked Tuesday about the progress on the gun issue in the House, Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said, ""There's nothing new on that front right now.""

""We are hard at work looking at enforcement of current gun-control laws, but we are really focused on immigration right now,"" he said"

This is a very nice older model with beautiful wood stocks and nice bluing. It's in very good condition. It's a smooth-bore shotgun that I believe is 24 inches long, bead front sight. Very nice older piece that is built like a tank. 

Included is:
10 rounds of Winchester 3/4oz rifled slugs
30 rounds of bird shot.

With the gun market as it is (not trying to gouge) and it being off season, I'm expecting to get a decent trade. I'm not trading for junk. I'd like to stay in the Murfreesboro area for the trade. Must be 18, a Tennessee resident, and not a felon.

-------------------------------

This is basically what the shotgun looks like except my trigger guard is blued. The second photo is also similar except mine has nicer wood stocks and no sling mounts."

Looking to trade for a good handgun, but definitely open to offers.. pretty flexible, so feel free to shoot me an email.. Worst I can say is no thanks.

Also not trying to get the moon for it, but I will sell it for the right price.. 
I don't really want to sell it at all, I love this thing.. but I was planning on building an NFA (National Firearms Act, not New Frontier :D) upper and just can't afford it right 
now.
(The lower is mint, there's a shadow cast from a tree in the picture, and the spots around the trigger pins are where I got a little over-zealous with the lube a few minutes ago)

I have a lot of money into this but I'm OK with trading down a little (or up). Thanks"

107 Series Models

The evolutionary successor to the 106 series. This series had the frame redesigned to eliminate the plugging of the spring hole produced with the old tooling. The earliest 107 series pistols were marked ""MODEL 107 / MILITARY"" and the serial number on the right side of the frame.  About 1972, the ""MODEL 107"" and ""MILITARY"" markings on the frame weres deleted and then later the word ""MILITARY"" reappeared near the end of the end of the traditional serial number series. The ""MILITARY"" marking is absent from the guns with the ML prefixed serial numbers.. There is no premium associated with these variations. These markings changers were not a change in design series, only a change in markings. The serial numbers of later guns produced after mid 1975 utilized a new serial numbering system. The Military models utilized a""ML"" prefix on the serial number. Early production utilized the red bottomed magazines. Later guns had a blued steel bottom. The 107 series was produced from 1968 until 1981. Production at Hamden, CT 1968 to 1976. At East Hartford 1976 to 1982. Guns with serial numbers above ML 25,000 are manufactured in East Hartford. Guns before ML 29,xxx were made by the Leisure Group and guns made after ML 29,xxx were made by High Standard Inc. The serial number ranges are best estimates as of the revision date. Valued at $695 low end fair condition to $895 high end super clean.  Add $200 premium for guns with boxes and accessories if factory records verify Model Number.

Being a Taurus, you also get a Lifetime product Replacement and Support should your Gun ever need repairs during its lifetime, unlike most other gun manufacturers, a big plus. 
I really liked the 24/7 Taurus for all of those features but feel more confident having a Quick Flip External Manual Safety I can use, and built in gun lock is flawless when in the safe, for peace of mind.  Both the slide stop and super easy take down levers make for easy checking and cleaning care of your weapon.  Use the Taurus 24/7 Millennium Pro as a Tactical and or Range Gun.   All around, at this price, this gun spells Value and Safety in a Quality Weapon that similar guns rarely come close to matching at this price.  This Gun is almost new with less than 100 rds thru it, purchased to qualify for the CCW License.  
This package includes the standard manufacturers plastic Gun carry case and all that comes with a new gun, (including the cleaning rod, L-wrench external key locks, the standard 1 one 15rd Magazine) plus I am adding an Extra new Taurus factory 15 rd. Magazine (you get 2 factory magazines).  Also included with this package, a well fitting EWB Fobus paddle Holster to get you started wearing at the range.  (This Fobus Holster holds gun nice and snug and is more than range worthy).  
Personally, I like Taurus because they make Solid products and offer Value and the 24/7 Pro puts Taurus over the Top.  It feels strong and comfortable in the hand. The 24/7 has Won Awards for Design and Quality per Gun Magazines and it shows in this Full Size Semi -Automatic Tactical, Range and Self Defense Gun.

If you want ammo to return to normal prices within a matter of weeks all you have to do is this..... STOP BUYING!  Don't buy/order from retail distributors and don't buy from a single person on here or gunbroker.  Plain and simple, don't buy at all for at least a month.
 This is why this will work.  Anyone who knows economics knows this... supply and demand!  When supply is low = price is high!  When demand is high = price is high!  When supply is high, based on demand it can equal either high or low.  When Demand is low = price is low!!!  That is the most plain and simple way i can put it.
  The price is so ridiculous right now because of the 2 major factors making it so.  High demand and low supply.
  Just hold off for a little while, let the manufacturers catch up, and let these damn price gougers eat crap.
  Please share this and post this throughout any social network you can!  Get this message out! Post it in other cities, on facebook, on forums, etc!

Now that the AWB was tossed away, things will return to normal but it is up to US, THE CONSUMERS, to let it do so!  Again please please please share this all over.

Some dude's write up (not mine)  ---- Want to be a better pistol shot? Most shooters do, yet surprisingly few of us shoot nearly as well as we're capable of. That's a pity, because pistol shooting is really a simple process. There are only four critical steps to sending bullet after bullet through the X-ring. They are: 1) Correctly align the sights. 2) Shift the focus to the front sight. 3) Depress the trigger without disturbing that alignment. 4) Keep the pistol aligned until the bullet exits the barrel. We all know this, but the difficulty arises in executing the process perfectly time after time. What's the secret to improving our game? Practice of course. But not just sending a lot of bullets down range. What we need are short daily sessions of very methodical and careful practice. The very best way to achieve that is at home with an accurate, quiet, inexpensive-to-shoot air pistol. For our uses we don't require a pricey Olympic-grade instrument. but we do need a pistol that shoots extremely well, with adjustable sights and a good trigger, And that describes Gamo's Compact Target Pistol. Made in Spain, the Gamo Compact has every feature we need for improving our shooting. Sights consist of a partridge front and a unique rear sight adjustable for windage, elevation and, interestingly, an adjustable sighting notch width. Sight radius is a generous 9.25 inches. The trigger is also adjustable--loosen the setscrew and rotate the trigger on its pivot to reduce trigger reach or improve comfort. The manual states the trigger may also be adjusted for length of ""first pull"" (take-up?), but I could discern no change regardless of adjustment. No problem, the quality of trigger pull is just fine and my sample breaks at slightly less than 2.5 pounds. The hand-filling target stocks are of European walnut, stippled for a sure grip and with an adjustable heel shelf. The 8-inch barrel is of steel and rifled for .177 pellets. Operation couldn't be simpler. Press the release button below' the rear sight and the top portion of the pistol pivots up and forward. Insert your pellet directly into the barrel then close the action. Cocking effort is light, the report is mild, and the recoil-less discharge produces roughly 400 fps. That, by the way, is more than adequate for pest elimination, and my Compact has rendered several invading rats ""hors de combat."" Accuracy is good, really good. From across the room if you don't string your shot holes together it's your own darn fault. A favorite exercise is to shoot at a blank piece of paper. The first hole becomes the target and the goal is to cut that hole with five more. This is pretty easy from ""braced recliner"" position and a bit tougher off hand. It's good practice and good fun.

It was sold to me as new primed Lapua brand brass and some once-fired brass.
Each Lapua container has 50 rounds of brass each
There are 5 containers in the Lapua case.
There are 249 (1 round short of a full case) total pieces of brass and 169 of the 249 are primed.  I have no way to verify if it is really new primed brass and only once fired brass, but that's how I purchased it so buyer will take same risk I took and I am happy with my purchase.  Please look on ebay and see how much just the empty boxes go for.  Also, keep in mind that this is not Prvi Partizan or Hornaday.  Lapua is as good as it gets.  Will charge actual shipping to your location UPS Ground if you are unable to pick up locally.  Unprimed on Midway USA today is $2.58 per piece.  $2.80 on Sinclair/Brownells.  I'll sell a case of this mixed primed/unprimed (less 1 round) for $650 shipped to continental US or $600 local pickup. If you just want some once-fired Lapua brass I have 80 I can sell in a zip lock bag for $1.25/round.  Will consider trades so let me know what you have.

 If you want ammo to return to normal prices within a matter of weeks all you have to do is this..... STOP BUYING! Don't buy/order from retail distributors and don't buy from a single person on here or gunbroker. Plain and simple, don't buy at all for at least a month.
 This is why this will work. Anyone who knows economics knows this... supply and demand! When supply is low = price is high! When demand is high = price is high! When supply is high, based on demand it can equal either high or low. When Demand is low = price is low!!! That is the most plain and simple way i can put it.
 The price is so ridiculous right now because of the 2 major factors making it so. High demand and low supply.

      Auction is for 250 Rounds of 30-06 belted ammunition in one new style 30 cal ammo can. Each  can has one 250 round web belt of .30-06 ammo for 1917 and 1919 machine guns. Ammunition is brass case and K 53 head stamp.   There is some purple on the cases (a light adhesive to hold them in the belt, not any corrosion).  The cloth belts alone have quite a bit of value and are in excellent shape. The ammo was originally purchased from the CMP and has been stored in a cool dry basement room in a sealed can since purchase.  You should be able to see some of the purple in the last picture, it is almost flush with the surface and will not affect chambering of the ammo.
TWO cans of ammo is available, each can is 250 rds and $125 per can.  Face to Face local sales only.

If I dont reply, your trade was not worth my effort. 

I have a 10/22 Magnum, that is correct, a 10/22 MAGNUM.  This rifle is not perfect, has some discolloration on the wood stock, and some minor pitting on the reciever.  All in all I would have to put it at 85-90%.  Has 4 OEM ten round mags included and 975 rounds of CCI MaxiMags.  If you have an interest in this rifle please do your research and dont waste either of our time.  For instance I have nearly $350 in the ammo, $25 each for the mags so that alone is $450. 

I purchased this rifle some time back for a sweet .17HMR semi, but have fallen in love with my remington 597 in 17HMR, which suites my needs.  

As you should already know this rifle is capable of becoming a .17HMR with only a barrel swap. 

The value of this collectable highly sought after rifle is not inflated with this gun scare crap, so dont inflate your $6-800 NIB AR-15's you just bought from Wal-Mart."

The word Sesquicentennial means 150th anniversary I believe. The gun appears to be unfired in its 44 years of existance. The gun  does show a few cosmetic blemishes, with a pink coloration on one side of the handle and a scratch on the other side. Other than that is is in great condition. I got this gun on a trade and it just is not my style but definitely has lots of meaning. It also has the no. 2 engraved in 2 different places and I am not sure but it may mean that it was number 2 out of the 3001. It has the 1819 Alabama Sesquicentennial 1969 engraved on the barrel and on the front of the nice hard case alson with the Alabama Flag. It is a super nice gun and do not miss out on this chance if it is your type of gun. I am not sure what to ask for the gun so shoot me reasonable offers. Thanks.REDACTED.Brian"

All 80 rounds look to be the same quality as any Russian surplus or commercial ammo; such as Wolf or Tula. The issue I have is the steel casings are slightly larger and my gun is tight chambered so they don't go in. It's an issue with almost all Remington 760s. From what I researched its uncommonly snug so most other guns should be fine.
