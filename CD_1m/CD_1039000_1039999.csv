As far as AK clones are concerned, the MAK-90 is known for being top-tier.  Its chrome-lined barrel, double hook trigger, thick receiver and solid factory build all contribute to its great reputation.

This particular model has been converted from its original sporter form.  I'm not in a rush to sell this gun.  If/when I do sell it, it would include everything in the photos:

Scope mount, BSA scope (4-12x20), quad rail, Tapco foregrip, Tapco 6 position stock, pistol grip, sling, soft green case, 30 round ak mag (gun accepts all ak magazines).

As you can see in the photos, the front sight pin was knocked out.  I can only assume the previous owner didn't know how to properly remove it while trying to install a pin-on compensator.  It's a cosmetic flaw that could be fixed easily however please be aware that it exists before asking to buy.

This goes without saying, but buyers/traders must be willing to present Wisconsin ID and sign bill of sale."

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. 
Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. 
The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. 
The 60-round magazine is slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length and fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines."

Along with the FN-style stock and receiver outline, the MK22 has many of the same features as the rifle that inspired it. The receiver is an all-metal construction, with a Picatinny-style rail system on all receiver surfaces. This includes a barrel placement for attaching FN sights. The mussle of the precision match, 16-inch barrel is cut with a 1:28 thread to accept various muzzle breaks and flash hiders.
 The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. 
Comes with 22-round magazine. The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. 
The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the gun. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage. Tan finish.

The Randall Model 1 Fighter was one of the first models produced in the Randall Shop in Orlando. A Model 1, made by Bo Randall, served as the prototype for the Springfield Randall that was manufactured by Northampton Cutlery Company near Springfield, Massachusetts in 1943 and 1944.

Since World War II, Randall knives have been the best-known handmade knives in the world and are still made in the family owned shop in Orlando in much the same way Bo made knives in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The business has been run by Bo's son Gary since 1970, and Gary's son Jason has been in the shop for the past several years.

The wait for a knife from the Randall shop has consistently been one or more years. In the past couple of years (2007-2009) that wait has increased to nearly five years.  For anyone wanting to order directly from Randall the price will be lower but the wait will be extremely long."

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube).

The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward

DETAILS

Special ultra light profile hammer forged upper.

Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system.   The Special ultra lightweight profile barrel  has a conventional .750"" gas block diameter, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  The weight of the barrel splits the difference between our light profile and our pencil barrel.    Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring T-marks, and M4 cuts, these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA.

Each upper is assembled to order with US-made parts, and test fired to check gas function.  Does not include bolt carrier group or charging handle.

BCG, charging handle, and lower not included. This is for the upper only. Picture attached to lower is for reference only. Upper only test fired by manufacturer."

900,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1039900,For Sale:  Thompson Center Renegade 54 cal Left Hand,"Mt Vernon, Burlington, Sedro-Woolley Area, Washington, United States",$ 300,"Listed On: Sunday, February 10, 2013",Muzzle,Thompson Center                                                                                ,54 Black Powder,no type,no type,"Hello! I have up for sale a very nice .54 Cal. Left Hand Thompson Center Renegade. The Stock in wonderful condition. Nice color & very clean. Not many (or any that I can see) marks from storage at all. This rifle was only fired a couple of times on one occasion, then cleaned and placed in storage. There are no dents and no wear that I can see. The gun was never taken in the woods to hunt with. This stock is the high-end version, with nice adjustable double triggers, case hardened left-handed lock and hammer, steel butt plate and very ornate iron trigger guards. The set trigger has a nice clean break at only a pound or two with no creep. The only blemish that I see is a small burn spot on the right side of the stock where a piece of burning powder apparently landed. It's about the size of a pin head, and not noticeable without your reading glasses on! The Barrel is also in great condition. It's a 1"" octagon about 27"" long. Nice color & clean, with a Excellent bore. Not many marks from storage. Again, this rifle was only fired a couple of times then cleaned and placed in storage. Unfortunately, not enough oil was left on the outside of the barrel in one small spot, so there are light blemishes in the bluing on the right side of barrel,a few inch area located about in the middle (Please see the pictures). There is no rust or heavy pitting, just the blemish. I'm sure a little cold blue or touch-up would help, but I'll leave that to the winning bidder! The bore was oiled and looks great, as does the rest of the barrel. Even with this I would still consider the finish to be 95% or better. It is unfortunate that it is in a visible location, but I think it looks better in person that in the pictures (in my opinion). Other than the blemish mentioned above, there are not dents, scratches or damage that I can find. The ramrod is an ""unbreakable"" type, with brass ends. It has a bullet puller screw located under the cleaning jag. These Thompson Centers are hard to find, let alone in this condition, being left handed and in .54 Cal. They are made in USA with superior craftsmanship that shows over the Spanish and Italian manufacturers. 
 I have many more pictures of the rifle, including more close-ups, that I can e-mail interested parties.   Please don't hesitate to ask.
 Thanks for looking!"
