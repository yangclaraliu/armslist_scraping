RFB

RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation.  The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle."

 Another thing I find appealing is that it also accepts the Smith and Wesson M659 (Or M59) magazines as well as it's own mags. So if you own a S&W 9mm pistol, chances are good that the mags will fit in the Camp 9.. this is attractive to people that don't like carrying pistol magazines AND rifle mags AND two different kinds of ammo...

The Marlin Camp 9 comes with a hooded front site and has a co-polymer lower receiver that saves you weight and money. 
Breakdown of this rifle is very simple.. it'll remind you a lot of the Ruger 10/22 in how it comes apart. 
This is a nice gun, would not be selling it but I have two of them.

NONE of the ammo is World War II vintage. Some of the headstamps include HXP, FN, SL, and TW. It is all ammo I bought through the DCM/CMP several years ago. I’ve fired some of it myself along with friends. Clips are reusable multiple times. The clips are original GI and haven’t been laying on the ground in the weather. There are SA (Springfield Armory), and several BR-W number marks, some I can’t read. No mix and matching of clips or ammo so that everything is one of a kind. Buy it all and you can have it perfect.

Don’t take what I’m about to say personally. I will deliver the ammo in a plastic bag still loaded in their clips. However, there is no stripping all the rounds out of the clips to go over every round just so someone can decide a round doesn’t have enough shine to it and drive off leaving me to have to reload them all over. I receive payment first, then you can do whatever you want with it. It has been stored in sealed ammo cans between uses for years, doesn’t look brand new, might have a tarnish mark on it from something, but it SHOOTS. 

Any loaded clip is $10 each with a minimum purchase of 5 to make it worth my time to meet buyers in a safe, neutral site.

I have 4 clips loaded with LC (Lake City) ammo varying years. Not selling individually. All 4 together are $48. Obviously five minimum does not apply if only this lot of 4 is purchased.

That is cash money price for all of the ammo, and I am also willing to do trades for any or all of it, give me a offer and I might be able to swing a deal with you. All I ask is that you value your stuff at a fair price like I have, No price gouging BS. Not really picky on trades either so tell me what you got!! I would like to stay in the springfield/ozark/nixa area, and if you are only buying 1 box I would really like to stay in the ozark or nixa area. Just email or text/call at 417-413-850seven and I will get with asap. If you email or text, specifically state what exactly it is that you want so I can deal with you in a more efficient manner. Thanks and god bless!"

strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a

the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

Intended for the most demanding sportsman or marksman, the revolutionary ATN 4x12 Super Wide Angle Telescopic Sight gives the widest field of view available for a magnified Scope.
 One of the most desired parameters for a Telescopic Sight is the apparent field of view (Magnification X FOV in degrees) for fast Target Acquisition and tracking of moving targets. Taking the AFV concept further than other Scope manufacturers, typical specs (3.5x7=24.5) or (3.5x8=28), the 
ATN 4x12 SWAT Scope 
 has an AFV of 4x12=48(!).
 The ATN 4x12 SWAT also has an abundance of features like an illuminated reticle with 12 settings to match any light conditions without overwhelming your natural low-light vision (reticle is visible when not illuminated i.e. no batteries required).

ATN 4x12 SWAT Device 
 is perfect for all shooting situations.

These are rarely found in good physical condition.  This gun is completely original and still fully functional.  Of course I don't go shooting it, it's an amtique collector piece and is respectfully retired!  However the timing is good, springs are still strong, fins on the cylinder are in great shape, etc.. As you can see, the nickle plating on the cylinder is mostly gone but for maybe 20%. The rest of the gun retains I'd say around 90% of the nickel finish and definitely shows it’s age but is obviously all original and exceptionaly good condition for for this piece. Overall this is a great piece for the collection. The grips are in great shape as well. I tried to get some good pictures here and of course I'll try to answer any questions you have. Being an antique, this does not require an FFL.
I hate to part with this but I'm in the market for another gun I can take to the range and use regularly.  I'll consider anything worthy of shooting at targets on a sunny afternoon. Hand gun, rifle, shotgun?  I'm no stranger to the barter system and I'll work any combination of gun, ammo and cash to arive at a fair deal.  Thanks."

This Krag is one of the hard to find Norwegian Stomperud models in 6.5x55 Caliber. These rifles were MFG 1946-1951 and this is one out of 1572 pieces that Kongsberg made. They were assembled from different types of parts and rifles given to Kongsberg. They were called ""Bastard-Krag"" or ""Stomperud"" Krag. These are a part of the Norwegian Krag history, and this a great sample out of these. Low number of them, so a bit rare to find complete. These were civilian rifles with bayonet lugs to be sold to the public. The Stomperud Krag had the barrel shortened by 15 cm to 61.3 cm and the front of the stock was cut sum 18 cm shorter. This rifle is about the same length as a K98. These rifles are rather scarce with less than 1600 manufactured. The condition of this gun is very good. The serial number on the receiver is #85XXX and the date is stamped 1909. The receiver number revealed that in April 1940 it was an original m1894 Krag, stationarized at the IR3 (Infantry Regiment number 3). IR3 fought against the Germans for a few days, and this Krag can be one that were out in action and perhaps got some damage, so that it later were refurbished as a Stomperud? This is only speculation, but could be the history of the Receiver. The rifle is in very good shape with strong rifling and a clean bore. The only things that make this an excellent rifle rather than perfect is that is my grandfather varnished the stock back in the 60's and my dad wrote Norway on it about an inch long with an electric pencil in the mid 70's. ARMSLIST would only allow 3 pictures. I will email more pictures upon request

One just sold on Gun Broker for $3526. I would put it up auction but, I’m looking for a quick sale. Only $2,350 or Best Offer.

S/N 894330 - Stamped on the butt and under the barrel
""United States Property"" stamped on the top
""pat Feb 08,06, Sept 14,09, Dec 29,14"" stamped on the barrel

She is a pretty rough looking old girl, but may still have some life left in her.  Or it may just be a conversation piece due to it's age.  Either way, I thought that it was a cool old gun, given the history that my neighbor shared with me.  Functionally, the cylinder locks up tight and cycles through properly, but I have not fired this gun myself to attest to its functionality.

This shotgun has a 20 inch barrel. The stock has been chopped to a pistol grip. It has been professionally done and custom carved to fit right into your hand. If you have ever done one you know it's challenging and time consuming. A picatinny rail has been fit and mounted on the foregrip. Because this shotgun is so small you can mount a front grip or possibly a flashlight for home defense. The wood furniture is in perfect condition, recently refinished. The finish on the metal is in great condition with minor wear.

996,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1571996,For Sale:  Hansen imported 7.62x39 Yugo non corrosive brass case in sealed bag,"Southern Maryland, Maryland, United States",$ 75,"Listed On: Sunday, May 5, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Offered is 100 rds of my Yugoslavian made 7.62x39 Non Corrosive brass cased FMJ ammo imported by Hansen a few years ago, it is still in its original factory sealed polymer bag, packaged in 5 individual labeled boxes of 20 rds each. The primer is sealed with a red lacquer and I think also where the bullet joins the case, but I remember for sure that the primer is lacquer sealed. Hansen imported only the best ammo and this is some of it. When I bought this ammo I was looking for the best 7.62x39 available to shoot thru my Poly Tech AK47 and I fired it all up with excellent results but I guess I stashed this Poly pack of 100 rds and forgot about it. I was going thru my gun safe last night looking for items I never use as I prepare to retire and move and I came across this ammo, I had forgotten about it, so here it is. This ammo is perfect for your Bug Out Bag as it is already sealed in a heavy duty polymer bag, non corrosive, and labeled. I am willing to meet buyer half way in distance for a FTF cash carry deal. Price is firm, not interested in trades or counter offers. thanks, pls email with any questions."
