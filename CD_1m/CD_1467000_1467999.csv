The TAN model is a special edition with slide in ""tan"" color and standard blue frame. The original M1911 was a single- action, semiautomatic pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

The Interdynamic KG9 pistol was made in Miami Florida for a short time in the 1981-82 timeframe by Interdynamic of America, Inc. ATF decided in January 1982 that the gun was too easy to convert into a machine gun, and therefore decided that an unmodified open bolt semi-auto KG-9 was a machine gun. ATF exempted unmodified semi-auto KG-9 pistols made before this ruling from the scope of the ruling, so there are so-called grandfathered KG-9 pistols available in the USA. The KG-9 was based on a Swedish designed machine pistol, the MP-9. After the ATF ruling the gun was redesigned into a closed bolt, striker fired pistol, the Interdynamic KG-99, which was sold in the 1982-83 timeframe. After that Interdynamic went out of buisness.

The original gun the cheap tec-9 was made to copy. Rare! Less than 1000 made! Look it up. Look up prices too. This is the short (meaning shorter barrel & no heat guard.)

The Olive Drab model is a special edition with slide in ""Olive Drab"" color and standard blue frame. The original M1911 was a single- action, semiautomatic pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

PTR-91 rifles are U.S. manufactured HK-91 Heckler & Koch rifles. PTR stands for Precision Target Rifle. The PTR 91 was developed with actual tooling from an H&K licensed G3 arms plant. The G3 is the full automatic version of the HK-91. PTR-91 rifles retain all major design features of the well-engineered German H&K G3 roller-delayed blowback design. This design is found in everything from the world famous H&K MP5 submachine gun, to belt-fed general purpose machine guns like the HK21, and even highly accurate semi-auto sniper rifles such as the H&K PSG-1 and MSG-90. The roller-delayed blowback design is superior in durability and reliability to the gas-operation of other popular rifles such as the AR-15, M1A, and AK-47. 

Two decades ago on July 7, 1989, President Bush banned Americans from owning any new H&K 91 rifles. As a result, H&K was forced to cease production of the HK91.

Thanks to the efforts of JLD Enterprises and PTR-91, Inc., in bringing H&K tooling to the U.S. for manufacture, the infringement upon owning these arms was effectively bypassed, allowing Americans to buy HK-91 rifles again!

In 2006, PTR-91, Inc. of Farmington Connecticut purchased JLD Enterprises and is now the current manufacturer of the PTR 91 rifles. Over the past few years, further improvements and refinements have resulted in the PTR 91 being recognized as better than even the original HK 91 rifles. One such improvement is that PTR 91 rifles come with .75” diameter Match grade 4 groove barrels with a 1:12” right twist.

The BDS Tactical Enhanced Padded CQB Single Point Sling is a fully adjustable Rifle sling to be worn tight against the body.

There is a 20"" section with 1.5"" foam padding sewn into the sling body for added comfort with heavier weapons systems.  The side release buckles are placed at the front of the sling where the sling meets the snap hook and where the bungee meets the sling body providing a quick detachment from the firearm for ditching and storage.  The Enhanced Padded CQB sling comes standard with an HK Style Clip and elastic cover for silencing and IR signature reduction.

Keep it simple with the SLC Strap™!

Galco has simplified the basic tactical sling design for those who don’t always wear hard body armor or tactical vests. The Simple Lanyard and Carrying (SLC) Strap offers quick and simple attachment to virtually any rifle fitted with sling swivels, and two carry positions.

The first position is a conventional and comfortable two-point carrying position, allowing muzzle-up or muzzle-down rifle carry over the shoulder or across the back. In the second position – for tactical use – the SLC Strap operates much like a single-point sling, positioning the rifle at the front of the body in a safe but easily-accessed muzzle-down position. An HK-style snap hook allows quick and effortless transition between the two carry methods.

If in the current environment you find one for less, you're probably buying from a burglar or a crack addict. Have fun with that.

I have a Brand New CGR,Inc  [ Custom Gun Rails Inc ]   Hundred Dollar Bill Rail Cover, Large Laser Engraved Aluminum (LEA)


Our small Laser Engraved Aluminum (LEA) rail covers are made of high strength, abrasion and solvent resistant thermoplastic bonded with a hardcoat anodized, laser engraved aluminum insert. The anodization process prevents the image from chipping, cracking or peeling.

They are secured on your rail using two side tension screws that apply pressure to two locking tabs (we throw in an allen wrench with every order). There is absolutely no metal to metal contact. This prevents heat transference and prevents damage to the rail. The small LEA’s measure 1 3/8"" x 2 3/4"" (35mm x 70mm) and weigh about 17 grams (that’s about as much as three nickels). Proudly made in the U.S.A.

The patent pending snap on/slide on clamp allows you to easily place your CGR rail guard anywhere there is space available without having to remove position sensitive accessories.All CGR products have been designed for placement flexibility, minimum obstruction and unparalleled durability. They fit on any mil-spec 1913 rails, including paintball and airsoft guns. No CGR products exceed 1/4"" height above the top of your rail preventing interfering with other accessories.

CGR’s relentless passion for perfection ensures that all of our products meet the absolute highest of standards. Practically, tactically and aesthetically there is simply no comparison. Not only are CGR products a great way to identify your gun from others, it is also a fun way to express yourself without permanently altering your weapon. Our Patent Pending “Snap and Set” rail clamping technology affords the user maximum placement flexibility, thereby not committing your CGR product to a particular weapon or position.

Our products have been deployed with Special Ops and conventional units all over the world and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. CGR products are the weapons customization industry standard for everyone from the serious weapons enthusiast and operator to the occasional shooter.

Asking $20

Price is FIRM and must be in CASH

The Glock 34 starts as Glock's competition model with a long slide, improved trigger, extended mag release, a lightening cut out on top of the slide to improve cycling speed and overall balance, and improved accuracy over other Glock models. The Glock 34 feeds from standard Glock 17 magazines holding 17 rounds of 9mm. My Glock 34 setup takes things much farther in terms of features and custom modifications. First off this pistol will come with two separate barrels. First being the standard Glock 34 barrel. The second being an extended Storm Lake match barrel with 6 ports to prevent muzzle flip, reduce recoil, and improve accuracy and keeps the gun right on target with almost zero vertical movement. This barrel is outstanding and greatly improves over the stock barrel. It has 4 ports where the cut out is in the slide and two where the barrel extends out of the front. I installed a LPA adjustable rear sight. Revers JP extended magazine release. JP competition mag well. The frame is custom stippled for an improved grip in all weather conditions and also creates a very unique custom look that you won't see anywhere else. All together I have a good amount of money in this setup. Glock 34 $700 Storm Lake Barrel $205 LPA rear sight $65 
JP Magwell $72 JP mag release $26 Custom Stippling $100 All together that adds up to $1168 total. I am definitely losing money on this, but I want to use the money to build a new rifle. I am not interested in trades and I am firm on the price. Serious inquiries only as this is an excellent one of a kind piece. Txt REDACTED to purchase. Thanks for looking and safe shooting!"

ADDITIONAL INFO:


Design details 
[ edit ] Operating mechanism 
The FNC is a selective fire weapon that uses a gas-driven piston operating system (with a long-stroke piston) and a rotary bolt locking mechanism equipped with two locking lugs that engage corresponding recesses in the barrel extension. The bolt is rotated and unlocked by the interaction of the bolt's cam pin with a camming guide contained in the bolt carrier. Overall, the mechanism strongly resembles the Kalas hnikov , but adapted to more advanced design and production methods. [2]

[ edit ] Features 




A German soldier aims an FN FNC during a Belgian/German weapons qualification at Ramstein Air Base , Germany, 2009. 


The spring extractor is located inside the bolt head, the ejector is fixed and riveted to the inside of the receiver housing. The FNC uses a 2-position gas valve, a hammer-type firing mechanism and a trigger with a fire selector switch that is simultaneously the manual safety, securing the weapon from accidental firing. The selector lever is located on the left side of the receiver and has 4 settings: ""S"" - weapon safe, ""1"" - single fire mode, ""3"" - 3-round burst, ""A"" - continuous (automatic) fire.

The FNC's barrel features a flash suppressor that is also used to launch rifle grenades (only the standard rifle model has this capability). The gas block contains a gas valve setting that is used to isolate the gas system, providing an increased volume of propellant required to fire a rifle grenade. The sheet-metal gas valve switch when pulled upright, acts as a V-notch sight used for aiming the rifle grenades . The piston head and extension, as well as the gas port block, barrel bore and chamber, are hard-chrome plated to minimize the effects of propellant fouling.

The rifle feeds from 30-round steel magazines that are interchangeable with magazines from the American M 16 rifle ( STANAG 4179 system). [3] After the last round is fired, the bolt will remain closed as there is no provision for an automatic bolt hold open. However, the bolt handle can be manually worked to hold the bolt back. FNC magazines will function in M-16/AR-15 type rifles but the follower will not hold the bolt open on the last round unless they have been replaced by an M-16 type follower. [4]

The plastic-coated, lightweight alloy skeleton stock folds to the right side of the receiver. A fixed synthetic ( p olyamide ) fixed buttstock is also available.

[ edit ] Sights 
The rifle has a flip-type L-shaped windage-adjustable rear sight with two apertures with settings for 250 and 400 m, while the front sight post is adjustable for elevation. Optics such as the Hensoldt 4X telescopic sight can be attached with the use of a receiver-mounted adapter."

History on the 351 SL.
The .351 Winchester Self-Loading (also called .351SL or .351WSL) is an American rifle cartridge.
Winchester introduced the .351SL in the Winchester Model 1907 self-loading rifle as a replacement for the Winchester Model 1905 and the .35SL. The .351SL proved popular with police and security forces as the only chambering available in the model 1907, and was used by France in both World Wars.[1] An experimental Thompson submachine gun was also made to fire .351SL in 1919, but was never produced commercially.[2]
The .351SL is considered inadequate by modern firearm experts as a deer round, but is generally suitable for mountain lion, coyote, or similar medium-sized game, while being over-powerful and insufficiently accurate for varmints. It has had some popularity in the jungle, where its lack of long-range power or accuracy are less important.[1] When first introduced however, many found the .351SL to be a good deer cartridge at ranges under 200 yards, at least in comparison to the many low-pressure cartridges of the black powder era.(from Wikipedia.com)"

The Interdynamic KG9 pistol was made in Miami Florida for a short time in the 1981-82 timeframe by Interdynamic of America, Inc. ATF decided in January 1982 that the gun was too easy to convert into a machine gun, and therefore decided that an unmodified open bolt semi-auto KG-9 was a machine gun. ATF exempted unmodified semi-auto KG-9 pistols made before this ruling from the scope of the ruling, so there are so-called grandfathered KG-9 pistols available in the USA. The KG-9 was based on a Swedish designed machine pistol, the MP-9. After the ATF ruling the gun was redesigned into a closed bolt, striker fired pistol, the Interdynamic KG-99, which was sold in the 1982-83 timeframe. After that Interdynamic went out of buisness.

The original gun the cheap tec-9 was made to copy. Rare! Less than 1000 made! Look it up.

NO CLASS 3 Needed! (legal to own pre-ban)

The Interdynamic KG9 pistol was made in Miami Florida for a short time in the 1981-82 timeframe by Interdynamic of America, Inc. ATF decided in January 1982 that the gun was too easy to convert into a machine gun, and therefore decided that an unmodified open bolt semi-auto KG-9 was a machine gun. ATF exempted unmodified semi-auto KG-9 pistols made before this ruling from the scope of the ruling, so there are so-called grandfathered KG-9 pistols available in the USA. The KG-9 was based on a Swedish designed machine pistol, the MP-9. After the ATF ruling the gun was redesigned into a closed bolt, striker fired pistol, the Interdynamic KG-99, which was sold in the 1982-83 timeframe. After that Interdynamic went out of buisness.

The original gun the cheap tec-9 was made to copy. Rare! Less than 1000 made! Look it up.
