This rifle is in excellent shape mechanically and the function is flawless.. The stock had a few rubs, marks and dings, so I sprayed it with a very light coat of automotive black finish. It turned out looking new, but you can still see the marks, they're just all black now. I did no refinishing on the metal. It was cleaned and wiped with an oily rag. That's all.

I have owned it for 4-5 years now.  It's believed to be from the 1960s as there is no serial number.  Gun was last fired maybe a month ago.   

Shoots fine, but the pin that locks the forestock to the barrel is worn from years of use.  Sometimes when firing the forestock comes loose.  Could probably be repaired by a gunsmith, but I have never bothered.  You can shoot it all day like it is (what I have done for 4+ years), I just want to disclose all issues with it.  Everything else is cosmetic...scratches and general wear that would be expected on a 40-50 year old gun.

Included with the gun is a large Allen rifle case with some normal wear and tear, as well as 10 Remington shells to get you started.  Good low maintenance, reliable shotgun for a beginner or someone who needs a beater gun.  With a little restoration it could be very nice, and it's ready to shoot as is.

This pistol is beautiful, and would make a great competition gun or just an awesome hand-cannon to take to the range. This weapon is currently on sale below MSRP for a limited time. Some features of this gun, as per STI's website:

A 6″ Tactical pistol in 10mm, STI International’s patented 2011 technology gives the STI “Perfect 10″ more fire power advantage than 1911 tactical pistols. Combining this advantage with less felt recoil and other popular 2011 features, the STI “Perfect 10″ is a superior pistol for all tactical applications.

Built on the patented modular steel frame with polymer grip (the essential patented design element for high capacity) the STI “Perfect 10″ delivers the added benefit of high capacity magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip. The STI “Perfect 10″ is well suited for multiple applications; ranging from police and SWAT teams requiring a firearm with a light rail and high capacity, to the individual demanding a high performance pistol with special features for personal protection. The tactical rail milled into the dust cover of the frame accepts all industry standard light mounts.

The STI “Perfect 10″ has front and rear cocking serrations, STI dovetail front sight, and STI adjustable rear sight. The STI “Perfect 10″ comes standard with features such as an STI stainless steel fully supported, ramped bull barrel, an STI two piece guide rod system, an STI aluminum magwell, an STI hi-ride grip safety, and STI ambi thumb safeties.

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement of conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. Using the HK- proprietary gas piston system found on the HK416 and G36, the MR556A1 does not introduce propellant gases and carbon fouling back into the rifle's interior, making it the most reliable of any AR-type firearm.

The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. This handguard system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR rifles. The HK rail system can be installed and removed without tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR566A1 will be produced in the USA from both American and German-made components.

Additionally, subassemblies like the MR556A1's upper receiver will be fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this manufacturing process, producing a long life barrel that provides superior performance with minimal degradation of accuracy and muzzle velocity after prolonged use.

(2) If you live in a State other than Texas I cannot ship the gun to you if you are unlicensed.  If you are not a resident of Texas I will be glad to ship out-of-State to the FFL of your choice.

The gas block is the railed type which allows for mounting of flip up sights or going without any for a better view with a scope. The upper is a T marked flat top. The lower comes in ambidextrous form. Meaning the safety is on both sides of the firearm, as well is the bolt release, and magazine release. That makes this firearm left or right hand compatible. It includes a 6 position buttstock. This rifle uses Magpul mags which are some of the best in the business and are not only easier to find but are cheaper also. This a super nice firearm from one of the top tier gun manufacturers in the country. Also included is a gun case to protect the rifle, manual, warranty, and 1 20rd magpul magazine.

Complete Kit $200 

The system is designed to use a low-profile gas block, and allows your AR15 to be broken down into three major components, for quick barrel changes, as well as covert concealment (DISCREET CARRY), or storage. A 16-inch barreled AR15, with a collapsible stock, red dot sight, and two 30 rd. mags. can be carried in a standard briefcase. Full assembly and loading to firing condition can be accomplished in less than 30 seconds, with ease. This conversion replaces the existing barrel nut and fore end. Kit includes: QC (Quick Change) Barrel nut and lock plate, a 12-inch free float fore-end, fore-end lock ring, all made from 6061 T6 Aircraft aluminum, and black anodized.  Multiple barrel systems require an additional Lock Plate for each barrel, which must be purchased separately. All this is accomplished for a third of the cost of similar systems.  Normal change out of an AR15 barrel requires several specialized tools, a vise, and about 30-45 minutes to accomplish. This system requires a one-time replacement of the original barrel nut with the QC barrel nut, and then barrel change out is done with hands only in less than 30 seconds. Gunsmith installation is recommended for initial conversion, however, most anyone with basic mechanical skills, and the proper tools can accomplish the task in less than an hour. 

Once conversion is completed, deployment is simple: 

1. Open the briefcase, and remove the barrel and receiver unit. 

2. Open the bolt, and insert the barrel into the upper receiver. While holding the barrel into the upper receiver, release the bolt. 

3. Remove the fore-end tube from the briefcase and slide it over the barrel and screw tightly onto the barrel nut. 

4. Extend the stock, chamber a cartridge, and your AR is ready for action. 

Lifetime Guarantee on the modification kit - not the briefcase   

** Includes AR15CCK quick change barrel kit and covert briefcase pictured....FIREARM IS NOT INCLUDED !!

I have a lightly used AR pistol for sale. has about 300 rounds through it, runs like a sewing machine. custom built, professionally tuned. build list is as follows:

Doublestar zombie slayer milled lower
cmmg lower parts kit
yhm upper reciever
SAA 7.5'' barrel
Kies adjustable gas block
YHM zombie annihilator flash hider
UTG 4'' free float quad rail

Magpul BAD lever

Spikes ST-T3 buffer

1 no window Pmag
2 30-45 Round thermold mags
custom samsonite briefcase with foam cutouts to fit pistol, 3mags, extra buffer, and 30 rounds loose ammo
Custom made leather OWB holster

This is one of the nicest ar pistols you will see, and best handling i have ever seen. With the stiffer spring, heavy buffer, and adjustable gas system, you can shoot this thing one handed and follow up only an inch high at 25 yards. let alone the fact that you can have a 5.56 gun, 3 loaded mags, and 30 extra rounds in an inconspicuous breifcase. I will also throw in a free survival sling that i make, which can be found here: http://www.armslist.com/posts/1146717/tulsa-oklahoma-tactical-gear-for-sale--paracord-survival-slings---rifle-slings-straps

Had my time with it, time for someone else to appreciate this fine Browning product.

Some finish wear, but overall very good condition.  Magazine disconnect removed (included), C&S single sided safety lever fitted (original included).  This is a shooter and not a safe queen.

One original magazine, Two new Mecgar 15 round magazines, Three KRD 15 round magazines (two of which work fine).

No box or papers, will ship in pistol carrier.  Gun will arrive clean, lubed and ready to shoot (if you have 9MM ammo).

$ 950.00 plus shipping.  USPS MO, Certified funds.  Not really looking for trades, but high end rifle optics are always interesting.  Thanks, but no low ball offers.  It doesn't have to go anywhere.

8 boxes/20 per box/.44 caliber Special/200 grain plus 1 box with 10 rounds remaining.

I am selling these boxes because I actually have too much ammunition and desire to keep less at home.  I bought these boxes only about 2 months ago so they are fresh.  Great accuracy, extremely low recoil out of my Henry Big Boy, overall no problems at all.

You may research for yourself the price.  You will not find them anywhere locally, I purchased them out of state.  Bud's Gunshop Online has the best prices of anyone and they are $30.00 a box.  I would like a fast sale so I will sell all 8 cases plus the partial for far less than true value.  Actual value: $255.00 plus shipping costs, my sale price to you: $180.00 for a savings of over $75.00.  Huge discount for fast sale.

I've got an excellent condition Vortex StrikeFire Red/Green Dot for sale. I'd like to do some slightly longer range shooting and want something different. This came on my PSA StrikeFire Upper that I got for Christmas this year. I've used it for 2 range trips (about 200 rounds total) and it functions flawlessly. It's a nice optic for the money, but I'm switching over to a scope with some longer range capabilities. The StrikeFire is in excellent condition with the 2x extender, caps, riser, instruction book, battery and cleaning cloth. I don't have the box as it came mounted to the upper. Images are of the actual optic for sale. I have excellent feedback on FredMiranda.com where I have sold thousands of dollars worth of photographic equipment (I can provide a feedback link to verify this) and on eBay under seller ID heymatthew (over 300 positive feedbacks). 

I'm asking $125 or best offer and I'll ship anywhere in the US. 







It probably goes without saying, but the AR in the images is NOT included in the sale price.

I also have 5 brand new PMAGs for sale that I never opened. These are the windowless type and are in absolutely brand new, unopened condition. I'm asking $75 shipped for the whole bundle or best offer. I do not ship to ban states.

I'm located in Sumter, SC and am willing to meet locally (I'll go 30 minutes in any direction) for a face-to-face sale.

Like the Kalashnikov rifle variants, it is a rotating bolt, gas-operated gun that feeds from a box magazine. All Saiga-12 configurations are recognizable as Kalashnikov-pattern guns by the large lever-safety on the right side of the receiver, the optic mounting rail on the left side of the receiver and the large top-mounted dust cover held in place by the rear of the recoil spring assembly.

The Saiga-12 is manufactured by the arms division of Izhmash, in Russia. It was previously imported into the US by European American Armories, although their agreement expired in 2005 and Izhmash then began exporting through the Russian-American Armory Company. The current export import partner is Wolf Performance Arms.[1] Izhmash also manufactures Saiga 20s and Saiga 410s in 20-gauge and .410 bore, as well as the Saiga semi-automatic hunting rifles in a number of centerfire calibers.

The PMAG 30 AR/M4 Window GEN M2 MOE is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.
In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.
The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately.

I've got an excellent condition Vortex StrikeFire Red/Green Dot for sale. I'd like to do some slightly longer range shooting and want something different. This came on my PSA StrikeFire Upper that I got for Christmas this year. I've used it for 2 range trips (about 200 rounds total) and it functions flawlessly. It's a nice optic for the money, but I'm switching over to a scope with some longer range capabilities. The StrikeFire is in excellent condition with the 2x extender, caps, riser, instruction book, battery and cleaning cloth. I don't have the box as it came mounted to the upper. Images are of the actual optic for sale. I have excellent feedback on FredMiranda.com where I have sold thousands of dollars worth of photographic equipment (I can provide a feedback link to verify this) and on eBay under seller ID heymatthew (over 300 positive feedbacks). 

I'm asking $125 or best offer and I'll ship anywhere in the US. 







It probably goes without saying, but the AR in the images is NOT included in the sale price.

I also have 5 brand new PMAGs for sale that I never opened. These are the windowless type and are in absolutely brand new, unopened condition. I'm asking $75 shipped for the whole bundle or best offer. 

I'm located in Sumter, SC and am willing to meet locally (I'll go 30 minutes in any direction) for a face-to-face sale.

Thanks,

This gun is super accurate easy to shoot and super fast.
I am including 450 rounds of ammo but will sell ammo separate if someone wants it.
I will ship but at your expense on shipping. These are super hard to find this is not the the 4.5 or the compact. This is the most accurate pistol makes but I have heard some of the new xds models are close. 

I would be willing to trade a lesser gun plus cash. I will listen to any offer but if yours is silly I will probably not respond. If your not looking for a high end pistol this is probably not for you.

It comes with original box, 2 taurus mags and 2 mec-gar mags, new and original grips and the Taurus lifetime warranty.. This gun has been 100% reliable, and I've enjoyed it, it's just too big (not heavy) for me to carry on my smaller frame. With the aluminum frame, this pistol weighs loaded what a steel frame 1911 weighs empty. There's some wear from carrying and the dummy scratch on the side from taking it apart to clean.

And did I mention it is OD GREEN!  These aren't easy to find! 

This pistol is the oddball in my collection. I bought it brand new, installed the CGW Kit4, acquired the extra magazines, and only fired a handful of rounds through it.  It's been sitting in the safe since.  Like I said, it's better than a new gun with the upgrades!

The whole package is $800.00 firm, please don't offer less.  A ready to go package deal, no need to search and buy the extras one would normally get after purchasing a gun.  The holster was made by me, not perfect but try and find one on a store shelf right now.

Prefer face-to-face transaction in Missoula and will throw in a box of ammo, but will consider shipping FFL to FFL for an additional $40."
