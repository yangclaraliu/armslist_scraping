unfortunately it doesn't have a warranty left, but I can assure you it will never let you down, as I have never had any issues. As a side bar what sets this tractor apart from the GT 1554 is that it is shaft driven, the proof being the vertical engine and hump in between the seat and steering wheel rather than a horizontal engine on the GT 1554 and most other cheap tractors which means they are belt driven. Additionally this tractor has a cast iron transmission rather than the conventional cheap aluminum one on the GT 1554. These advantages mean less maintenance, less problems, stronger pulling capacity and a better built tractor, 1200 , obo like to trade bang bank ar 15 sks , 45 auto , what you got to trade? email me , all i can do is said no thank you ,"

I bought this gun new at KY Gun Co recently and it was a package called 'Daniel Defense DMP'. I am keeping several of the accesories that were included and selling the gun. I did shoot it for the first time this morning and so as of now it has 40 rounds through it. It shots wonderfully. I already have a Daniel Defense or I would keep. 

The benefit of this gun over a standard DDM4 V7 is that this one has a factory 18"" barrel verses the standard 16"". 

The buyer will receive the following: DDM4LE (DDM4 V7 w/ 18"" barrel), Magpul MOE stock, Magpul Gen2 MBUS backup sights, New in plastic Magpul 'no window' magazine, Daniel Defense front quick attach for sling, paperwork that was included from factory and all will come in the Daniel Defense hard case.

Like new in box, put maybe 50-75 rounds through it, cleaned once a week meticulously even if not shot. It's a great pistol, I bought it because I always wanted a 1911 since I was a kid, but its a bit of a pain to carry, and its just not practical for me. 

for 600 you get the case, the gun and its stock magazine. I also have two after market magazines ones a kimber and the others a mec-gar, the gun does not seem to like the mec gar mag as it fails to eject sometimes when used, you can have both maybe you can get it to work. Also have an IWB holster with a metal belt strap, and a chest x-type holster (jacket holster)

These magazines will fit ALL Glock 9mm model handguns (17, 19, 26, ect...), and are nothing less than a BLAST to shoot.  I mean talk about NEVER having to worry about ""falling short"" on ammo while in home/family defense use (if you cannot get the job done with 32 rounds of 9mm, might I suggest you look into perhaps a 12 gauge pump shotgun) ;-)

Back on topic...these magazines perform FLAWLESSLY.  I have ran Blazer, PMC, American Eagle, Fiocci, RELOADS, and NEVER experienced a single FTF while running through my last Glock 19 GEN 3.  Price breakdown is as follows:

x2 Korean HI-CAP 32 Round Mag's:  $65 each
1 Glock (factory) HI-CAP 32 Round Mag: $80 each

Seriously you CANNOT tell the difference whether you are running the Korean or the Glock magazine as they PERFORM THE SAME (same goes for build quality also).  The Glock mag is simply priced slightly higher due to the higher premium I had to pay when I got lucky at the Tucson gun show last summer (before the madness ensued).  These magazines are in high demand at the present moment, I regret getting rid of these, but it is what it is, thanks."

One of the 13 round aftermarket mags does not drop freely when released, it just barely hangs up and can be pulled out or slightly tap on the grip with you hand and it falls.  This will most likely go away with some use.  All mags fit flush.  Lots more pics available upon request, simply give text message number and what you want to see.

For SR-22 Rifle, Charger Pistol, or 77/22 Rifle

I WILL INCLUDE A 100 round box of CCI Mini-mags .22lr ammo, very high-quality, and very accurate. With how rare these mags AND the ammo is this is a good deal. 

These are NEW never been used Ruger BX-25x2's. [NOTE: These are NOT two separate magazines! These are actually molded together, so while they can be disassembled like the other bx-25 mags, they CANNOT be taken apart from each other. Each side can take 25 rounds for 50 rounds total.] I have one I have kept personally and I have put 300 rounds through it without a single hiccup, and still going strong. Due to them being actually molded together they are THINNER than two separate bx-25's taped/glued together.

For those who are unfamiliar with the product, this is the info that Ruger has on its website: 
""Ruger came up with an innovative design to couple two magazines together. Once the first 25rds. are used, all you have to do is flip the mag over. As reliable as the standard BX-1 10-round Ruger rotary magazine. Stainless steel feed lips are designed to present cartridges into the action at a 30 degree angle for better feed reliability. Stainless steel, constant force spring provides feed consistency round after round. Anti-tilt follower is injection molded from a high lubricity polyacetal for consistent reliability. BX-25 X2 magazines will work with any factory original Ruger 10/22 Rifle, SR-22 Rifle, 22 Charger Pistol and 77/22 Rifle. The BX-25 will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition and requires no lubrication. If it becomes necessary to clean the magazine, loosen the screws on the right and left side of the magazine with a 3/32’’ hex tool.""

Here i have a brand new Kel-Tec 12 gauge shotgun KSG. This is Kel-Tecs first shotgun on the market. This is similar to the Kel-Tec RFB rifle in size, shape and design but the KSG ejects the shells downward instead of forward. This cool firearm weighs only 6.9 lbs and is as compact as legally possible. The overall measurement of this shotgun is 26.1"", 7"" high and has a 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. The internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 3"" 12 gauge rounds, so a total of 6 shells per tube.

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in and a basic sling is included in the box. The soft rubber butt pad helps tame the recoil on this impressive shotgun.

This KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Glock 23 gen 3 in excellent cond has crimson trace grip activated laser, tritium sights and easy detachable flashlight that is blindingly bright..which is the idea. Comes with everything it did new, 2 13 round mags, case, papers...This gun with laser, light, and tritium sights is one of my favorites and just feeling what is out there. There is really nothing more you can add to a handgun to be prepared for someone to try and break into your home and protect your loved ones. I am not a huge Glock guy but am big on the fact that they never fail to fire as this one never has through 300 rounds or so.

Next is a like new M&P compact that has 24 rounds down the pipe. I found after buying and comparing that it is pretty much the same size as the Glock and does not really make sense to have two of the same size...I would prefer to trade this as it is factory stock and the glock has 400 dollars in upgrades and serves as a perfect nightstand gun. The M&P is a awesome carry gun and also comes of course as it did new with two 12 round mags and case/papers."

TESTIMONIALS:

“There is a difference between carrying a gun and carrying a gun responsibly! The right to bear arms is a right to bear them as a trustworthy and upstanding citizen. These days, proper training is crucial for that right to continue. Jake’s class is the best course to begin your ongoing education to exercise your right to bear arms responsibly. I thoroughly enjoyed his class. The class was fun, interesting, informative and professional. Jake’s professional demeanor and style helped me accentuate my previous learning. It spawned in me a desire to be more responsible, safe and trustworthy as I bear arms. I have used guns all my life and have always tried to follow strict safety procedures. Jake’s course builds on what I have learned, but took me further. I came to understand the gravity and responsibility of carrying a firearm. Jake clearly explained the current laws regarding legal use and individual responsibility in carrying a firearm. This course is a must for everyone, even if one does not have an interest in carrying a concealed firearm.”

”I have been a US Marine Corps Instructor, and taught Martial Arts for 13 years. I have trained thousands of people in my 32 year career as a peace officer. Jake is as good of an instructor and teacher as you will find. He is accurate and experienced in the subject matter. He is well organized and thorough in his presentation. His best quality is that he cares about people and makes great effort to make sure you get the information you need. I have attended his CFP class and qualified firearms with him. He knows what he is teaching. I have worked with him for several months now and find him to be a person of the highest integrity. I highly recommend him to you.”

I am selling mine for $500 because it doesn't have the original stock. The D model uses the same stock as a regular SKS,  just sometimes it had a filler piece in front of the mag well and the mag well is widened to fit the AK mags. 

The D models prefer Chinese AK mags and the gun comes with 1 Chinese mag. Also comes with the bayonet (not pictured) as well as the pin that holds the bayonet on. Also comes with a receiver scope mount and a Leapers 4x scope. The stock it is in is an ATI Dragunov stock and I'm aware it sucks, but again, that's why I'm listing this for $500 and not $800.

I am not haggling on the price nor am I willing to drive a ridiculous distance to meet you. If this doesn't sell I'll just throw it in a $90 Tapco stock and bump it up to $900. No trades, no shipping."

995,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1604995,For Sale/Trade:  Leupold VX-R Patrol 1.25-4x20mm,"Fayetteville, Fayetteville, North Carolina",$ 550,"Listed On: Sunday, May 12, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a brand new Leupold VX-R Patrol optic for sale. This optic has never been mounted or fired. I recently bought it and decided I wanted to go with something different instead. But it is a great optic!! Just not what I thought I was interested in. Its less than two weeks old. I'm asking $550/OBO. This is easily a $725 optic on the Leupold website. I'm asking the price i have listed due to the fact it does not come with mounting rings but those are easily found at any gun store or even online. It's brand new, still in the box with all the paperwork and a fresh battery. The center of the optic lights up like a red dot but still gives you FireDot reticle as well. I have pics upon request. Text me @ 2five3-8six1-sixfour9zero.

Also keep in mind....I AM LOCATED IN WASHINGTON STATE BUT MY FATHER IS A TROOPER IN FAYETTEVILLE. HE WOULD BE MY MIDDLE MAN FOR A FACE TO FACE MEETING IF YOU DECIDE TO BUY OR TRADE FOR THE SCOPE. I WILL PAY TO HAVE IT SENT TO HIM BEFORE YOU PAY FOR IT. YOU WILL PAY HIM AT THE TIME OF MEETING IF YOU DECIDE YOU BUY/TRADE.
