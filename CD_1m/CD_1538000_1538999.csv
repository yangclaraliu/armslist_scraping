Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

Rifle is like BRAND NEW with great looking wood grain, graded at 95% or better. Remington, Model 700LH (Left Handed), 30.06, walnut stock with fine cut checkering. Top of the Line Weaver scope, great optics for long distances and original leather strap. The strap is still stiff and new. This gun was not mass produced like they are today. It has the older style trigger and much better overall quality. My Dad went to the range when it was new to set the scope then it was never used again. It was then put into a case, cleaned and maintained well over the years. In absolutely PERFECT MINT condition. Per Remington this is a $1200 rifle. Offers entertained.  

I have several more photos of this rifle, if needed, just ask.

From the Remington website about this rifle:
The Model 700 BDL has been the hunter's favorite for 40 years because its strong, smooth action, consistent accuracy, and classic beauty make it an unequaled value. Its high-gloss American walnut stock is enhanced by a distinctive black fore-end cap, Monte Carlo comb with raised cheekpiece, and generous skipline cut checkering. Metalwork has our rich, deep bluing for beauty and protection. The Model 700 BDL features a hinged magazine floorplate, sling swivel studs, hooded ramp front sight, and adjustable rear sight.

Key Features:
Receiver machined from solid-steel bar stock resulting in uniformity and strength 
Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement 
Recessed bolt face locks up inside the counter-bored breech of the barrel which is surrounded by the receiver, forming “three rings-of-steel” enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength 
Integral extractor is set in a groove inside the rim of the bolt face, uniformly supporting the cartridge head 
X-Mark Pro™ Trigger – featuring super-tight tolerances and mirror-like surface finishes, it breaks like glass and is adjustable for trigger pull weight"

I am looking to part with them for fair prices. I do not have to sell them, but would not mind freeing up some space to begin setting up a reloading operation.

M1 Garand rifle. Caliber .30; Is not USGI, made from mostly Italian M1 parts (Pietro Beretta, Breda) as well as a few SA parts. Muzzle has some wear, but still good rifling. Had to replace the gas tube with one that was within specs. Have run approx 150 rounds of Danish M2 ball through it with no issues at all. No binding in the op rod. Asking $700, $760 with Mount and scope. I built this rifle (with the help of a friend to install the barrel) out of a stripped receiver and obtained everything for it through parts kits and gun shops. Shoots good for a mixmaster.

Various Mosin Nagants. I have 8 Mosins, 6 M91/30's, 1 all matching 1953 Hungarian M44, 1 Finn-matched 1942 Sako M39 (shoots ~1"" 100yds, it is more accurate than I am that's for sure). My 91/30's are 3 Tulas (1931, 1940, 1944, the 44 is a barreled action with all parts, no stock) and 3 Izhevsks (1940-scout scoped, 1943-refurbished, 1943, original, unissued all matching). Prices given upon request.

1918 MkIII* ShtLE Enfield. This rifle is basically a sporter or restoration project waiting to happen. When I got this rifle, some hillbilly had done a piss poor job of sporterizing the stock. I got this rifle because the barrel and sights were not touched and wanted to bring it back to its military configuration, but never got to it unfortunately. Caliber .303 British. No import mark. Asking $85.

Swiss K31, 7,5x55 (GP11), a nice 1941 mfg K31 rifle made by SIG, went through rearsenal and is in a beech wood stock. All numbers match, including stock. Has a troop tag under the butt plate, and I do have a letter from the Swiss soldier it was issued to as well as a picture of him with his anti-tank gun crew. Rifle shows typical dings on stock due to rough drilling, but the stock looks better than many I have seen. Bluing is also a lil thin in several areas due to pretty typical heavy cleaning Swiss soldiers did. Asking $375

Henry US Survival Rifle .22lr. Not MilSurp, I know. Black stock, comes with box and manual, less than 20 rounds through it, comes with extra 3rd magazine. Asking $270

Have many others. Ask if you'd like something else I have and I can give you a list. Also pics available upon request."

A totally recoil-less, spring piston airgun seemed little more than a dream before the recent appearance of the Model 54. In order to realize this goal the engineers spent years experimenting with different systems until they created this mechanical marvel. Simple but durable, the 54 uses a floating action riding on rails to achieve a totally recoiless system that stands up to the pounding of our 1100 fps system. Not only does this arrangement prevent transmission of felt recoil to the shooter, it also permits the rifle to excel in the accuracy department. When the rifle is fired, the action moves back lightly within the stock, absorbing the recoil, and permitting the pellet to exit the barrel before any of the spring vibration affects its travel. This system dramatically improves the accuracy potential of this magnum air rifle, making it a first class choice for either long range pest control or the precise demands of field target shooting. This side lever cocking magnum rifle's other features include adjustable trigger, adjustable rear sight, scope rail, Monte Carlo stock with cheek piece and checkering, and an automatic safety."

2 boxes 30-06 Red Tracer ammo by Talon Mfg. - $60 for both.

2 boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser FMJ bullet & 2 boxes of 6.5 Swedish wood bullet ammo. The wood bullet ammo was considered to be ""blank"" ammunition when used with a special  adapter that shredded the wood bullet. However be extremely careful if firing without adapter because wood bullet can be very dangerous at close range. $50 for all four boxes. All of the 6.5 Swedish ammo above is non-corrosive.

5 boxes WWII era 8x56R ammo. This ammo was made in 1938, and is the correct ammo for the M95 Steyr ""straight pull"" carbines & long rifles. The ammo is in amazing condition given it's age and each box and every individual round bears the date of manufacture, and the proof mark  ""War Eagle"". The vast majority of this ammo will fire reliably and I shot many boxes through a M95 carbine I used to have. Recoil is quite heavy though in the carbine. This ammo is a ""super collectible"" piece of WWII history. Price is $20 a box or $80 for all five. Each box contains 10 rounds packed on 2 blued steel M95 stripper clips which sell for $5+ each on Gunbroker & Ebay today.

From Remington's website:  

The Model 700 ADL Varmint in Mossy Oak Brush camo with 4-12x40mm scope is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700 action; the most solid, dependable and trusted action in existence.

Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to the most popular high-velocity varmint calibers.  Plus, the ergonomically designed synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation.  The Mossy Oak Brush camo stock will remain hidden from sharp predator eyes, and the included 4-12x40mm scope ensures you will spot distant targets before they spot you.  The Model 700 ADL Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight"

Only took to the range one time and after the first 10 rounds shot 1""-2"" groups at 7 yards consistently through the duration of my trip (fired about 60-70 rounds and as always cleaned, oiled, and checked immediately following). The trigger breaks nicely, kicks considerably less than expected for it's size being that it is a .40, and is an all-around a joy to shoot and comfortable to carry at that. SO, if it's such a great gun then why am I selling it? Well my first choice in a CCW was the Springfield XDS and a good deal decided to show it's face after I sprung for this little guy. Even then it was hard to decide to let this one go. Anyway, with that being the case, I am now just trying to sell my shield to finance the XDS. Will ship to FFL, or local cash with bill of sale.

This holster uses belt loops at the front and rear to pull your handgun tight against your body for better concealment. The angle this holster positions your handgun allows faster drawing with full combat grip, more comfortable wearing, and much safer use.
A regular Small of the Back (SOB) holster places your gun over the base of the spine. A fall or hard blow with your gun in that position could cause serious spinal cord injury. Our holster is engineered for kidney carry to avoid that danger.
Made of waterproof foam for a comfortable carry and to protect gun from moisture. Lined on both sides with rugged Cordura® nylon for durability and a smooth, fast draw. Webbing inside the holster protects your gun’s sights and keeps holster partially open for easier re-holstering. Great for use while driving. Comes with an adjustable thumb break to keep gun secure. Fits belts up to 1½” wide. Available for right or left hand draw. Black. Made in the USA."

We either have people trying to sell a used gun for a new or higher price, or people wanting to buy a quality gun for significantly less than its fair market value.  

Sellers:  Your guns are not made of gold!  And don't forget that the pending gun legislation was shot down several weeks ago.  Stop trying to sell Glocks and such for outrageous prices!!  And just because you installed some custom parts on your budget 1911 does not make it worth any more than a new one at Academy Sports.  If you're researching completed Gunbroker auctions to see what a particular type of firearm is selling for, you cannot take into account inflated prices during the recent buying frenzy.  That frenzy is gone.  You missed the boat on the high dollars if you didn't sell your gun in January or February.  

Buyers:  Stop placing ads trying to buy a quality pistol for $150-200.  Go to your local pawn shop and buy a crap Hi-Point or something if that's all you want to spend.  Nobody is going to sell you a good S&W, Ruger, Sig, etc for that amount of money.

We need to meet in the middle and start selling and buying firearms for a current fair market value, not some unrealistic figure.  It's ok to negotiate, but when most people see a whacked-out price, they just keep browsing and think that the seller/buyer is unrealistic and would be a waste of time to deal with."

Came into a 3rd gen Glock 27 today, very nice gun, and not opposed to keeping it, but currently it is my only .40, and I have several 9mm's, so would keep my ammo situation simpler to trade for a Glock 26 in 9mm.

It appears to be in very good shape and well cared for, no holster wear, internals look great, standard sights, one magazine with a Pierce extension on it. Now includes 20 rounds of Hornady Critical Duty 175 grn hollowpoints. Looking to trade straight across for a similar condition 3rd Gen Glock 26 in 9mm only. Can add cash or any of the items listed here - http://www.northwestfirearms.com/part-accessory-classifieds/109065-whole-bunch-holsters-stocks-grips-other-gun-stuff.html - for a gun with night sights or extra mags or ammo.

I have for sale a WW2 Mauser 24/47 This was purchased about 10 years ago and was dubbed a Balkan war sniper by the import company they were sold around 2002-2003 as imported. Some came with bases and even scopes but mine was purchased as just the gun with the holes already drilled into the reciever as was done by the army who fielded it as a sniper. Once I received the gun I sent it off to a
Mauser guru who builds guns back to orginal WW2 sniper spec and he completely redid the rifle from top to bottom at the cost of $1200. He basically did about everything you can do to a rifle to make it more accurate from bedding the stock, to action job, to trigger job. He also tru cut the chamber for accuracy as well as trimming any wood that made contact with the barrel and trimmed the barrel bands so they no longer touched the barrel as well. He then topped it off with a vintage weaver scope that looks identical to the ww2 German scopes 
and added quick release rings for easy scope removal. The results are the rifle shoots half inch 100 yard groups all day long with off the shelf hunting ammo. This rifle is not only a 
nice example of a WW2 sniper it is also an amazingly accurate shooter that will out shoot 
most modern snipers. I have tons of money invested into this gun and it shows with not only 
performance but looks as well. Price is firm as I have well over $1200 invested in the gun 
alone. Will only consider trades for other firearms, 9mm ammo, 7.62x39 ammo, or .308 ammo.  E-mail, call, or text REDACTED."

Just $90 for the most professional, comprehensive class in Eastern North Carolina. Our veteran instructors are experienced professionals with real world criminal justice experience, not just someone feeding you substantive law. 

We use case-law examples to show the spirit of the law, how the laws have been interpreted, and how jurors may view a case. 

Sadly, the majority of law-abiding citizens who have been charged with a crime may not have been charged at all had they understood the laws. While acting in ""self-defense"" CCH Permit holders have been convicted because their actions were based on incorrect information pertaining to the laws. 

Don`t take chances. Insist on learning the laws from the best.

Long story short while removing the Striker Retaining Pin i used the wrong sized bit and the bit broke off inside the hole. I tried to push the pin out the other side and the same thing happened. So basically the hole that holds the pin in jammed up. I am frustrated and have given up on it. If you know how to do this and get that pin free go for it. I have a new firing pin and Striker Retaining Pins that im throwing in. Besides that the only other issue is it needs to be refinished. So basically im selling the XD which needs repair, new parts, 4 mags, and im throwing in a box of federal 50 rds, and 13 defensive rounds.

Smooth double action only and they're consistent.  I used to carry a 357 until I found the 250.   I'd rather hit where I want than be loud."

It holds Double Stack 1911 which holds 10 round per magazine and its smaller then most other subcompacts out there especially for a .45 just a little thicker.
 Its extremely rare all by itself. Originally they were $400 to $500 back then there were sitll being made.  I have had some modifications to it so its in good shape its been carried so its got a little bit of wear from that but other then that its in perfect shape and has a low round count probably less then 50 round i'd say, it's just sat in the safe.

blowback system with a safe and time-proven double/single action. The
durable 15-round steel magazine is drop-free when the magazine button is
depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion
resistance, and feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect
the rifling. The open slide design virtually eliminates jamming and stove
piping and allows the chamber to be loaded one cartridge at a time. The
attached disassembly latch simplifies field stripping. The user may retract
the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a
table, door, etc. The external hammer design provides the energy to the
firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light
primer, and provides immediate indication of cocked/uncocked status. Even
if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will
not strike the primer. Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame
made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy. Bruniton
non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear-resistant
finish. This model was made in the USA."

I am original owner and have only put 24 rounds through this shotgun.

This is a perfect ""Zombie Apocalypse"" firearm to have, 12 gauge is a very common round sold at just about all sporting goods stores. Most people in theory would be hoarding handgun and AR / AK ammo giving you the edge on availability. Besides how readily available the ammunition is, this shotgun is Inertia Driven meaning the kenetic energy from the round cycles the action (also reducing recoil slightly) - More on the Inertia Driven system below.

The ghost ring sights on this shotgun are some of the best sights I have used (I have carried guns in my profession for many years and have served as a weapons and tactics training instructor) they make for quick target acquisition and are very accurate.

The Benelli M2 is a 12 gauge Semi Automatic Inertia Driven Shotgun. Inertia Driven action uses the recoil energy to cycle the action. This eliminates all the problems associated with gas-operated systems, such as the necessity of frequent cleaning and the tendency gas-operated systems have for malfunctioning during adverse weather conditions. This is the definition of reliability. 

This gun holds 5+1 rounds

This Benelli M2 also comes with Chokes IC, M, F and wrench. No box or manual to go with this sale.
