3,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1044003,For Trade:  Norinco SKS trade for handgun,"Zanesville, Ohio, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, February 21, 2013",Rifles,Norinco,no type,no type,no type,"Norinco SKS manufactured at arsenal 6602 with all matching numbers. This rifle is new un-fired, it just had the cosmoline cleaned off and oil applied. Bore is new so it is pristine and shiny. It is a late manufactured SKS with a spike bayonet. This rifle DOES have a threaded barrel and milled receiver, so it is not like the later cheaper pinned barrel versions. Chrome lined barrel shines like a mirror.

I got this rifle right after Sandy Hook and recently picked up another rifle, so I am looking to part with this rifle for a handgun.

Cash price is $500. It's what I have in it, not looking to profit just looking for handgun.

For those unfamiliar with the 5.7 round it is awesome. No recoil very light high pressure 223 cousin. Designed for the military to carry a bunch of ammo without adding a bunch of weight. Got a bad nickname early on for all the armor piercing rounds that came out originally. Fun gun to shoot and exotic not the everyday 223 everyone has. Bullets come thru the bottom, can use mag or let them fall naturally out of the way. Here's more... AR57 LEM 16” complete upper, 5.7x28 mm So hard to get, so very awesome. The new and updated LEM (Law Enforcement/Military) GEN 2 model of the AR-57 (lighter, extended optic rail, low-profile ambidextrous charging handle, extended magazine release). Based on the FN PS90 (P90), this innovative design utilizes the 50 and 30-round magazines from the P90, firing the hot 5.7 x 28 mm cartridge (the round also used in the Five-Seven pistol by FNH). Empty brass drops straight down out of the magazine well. Pull the spring and follower out of an AR mag and lock it into the lower, you have a removable brass catcher. The upper is machined from one solid block of aluminum, fluted barrel, custom muzzle device.

Only thing stopping this from being 100% dead mint is a small blemish in the cerakote on the middle of the right side of the grip. I was wearing a tungsten carbide ring for a few shots and it marked it a bit. Nothing big or noticeable at all, but making sure i disclose everything. Included the best picture i could get of it.

I would prefer for the rifle to have the original stock, but a sporter stock is okay as long as it has the original iron sights. I have ammo (7.62x39) I could also trade and the seller must be willing to meet in the Seattle or Eastside area. I prefer a non-import marked rifle, but import marks are okay as long as all the eagles are present. Not interested in Yugo, Czech etc... or other variants..."

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. 

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.

OPEN TO OFFERS, BUT PLEASE DO NOT OFFER LOW CASH BECAUSE U HAVE CASH TODAY
Steyr Pro Hunter in 308. Awesome rifle with incredibly smooth stainless steel barrel and bolt assembly. Free Floating/Spiral-Fluted barrel.....looks wicked smooth.  Has the ""Steyr Safe Bolt System"" and a 3 pt fire/safety system on it.  Very easy and safe gun to shoot.  My son can easily take it through the cycle of operations.  About 100 rounds through it and you can cover the holes with a quarter at 150 yards. I shoot Federal 150 gr and Black Hills 168 gr through it.  I have Leupold mounting rings that I can leave on or take off at your request.  Amazing rifle, but I am looking to downgrade for other purposes. One 4 round magazine included.  I have a Nikon Monarch 3x9x40 BDC but prefer to sell slick and use the scope on her replacement.  Rings come with but for right price I might throw in the Nikon BDC.  I really don't want to sell but my ""wants"" are seemingly getting the best of me.  Please do not offer lower offers as this is a high end rifle.  I can make due with keeping her so I will not sell unless the deal is acceptable.

These are hard to come by as the people who have them tend to hold on and pass down to others.  I will prob regret selling but I just don't need or use this type of rifle as I should.  Comes with Generic Plastic Case and sling too.

willing to ship but prefer a face to face.  Limited travel possible but only for serious offers."

From RGuns:

Complete with charging handle and bolt carrier group. Features a air gauged, MP tested, 16"" 4150 Steel Chrome-Moly Barrel w/ 1:9"" Rifling and a true 5.56mm military chamber.

The custom machined match barrels used in RGUNS rifles and uppers are made from 4150 chrome-moly vanadium steel manufactured in the USA. Each 5.56 NATO/.223 barrel is properly head spaced with an M4 feed ramp extension installed.

Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and muzzle threaded 1/2-28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion when the barrel heats up, and hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life.

Each barrel has an eleven degree crown, polished chamber and lapped bore, as well as a pulled-button rifling, producing a superbly accurate bore diameter with uniform rate of twist. Fluted models feature unique fluting designs to improve rigidity and aid in barrel cooling.
