From the extensive research I've done since owning this masterpiece I've been able to ascertain its a Danzig Model 1898 Sporting Rifle and here is the history I've been able to find out behind the rifle: These guns were produced In 1919 only by the Danzig factory In Germany after the treaty of versallies left the Danzig factory without a military contract so they were forced to produce firearms for the civilian market to try and stay financially viable. These rifles were overly expensive and not easily attained by the common person therefore only an estimated 1500-1800 of these rifles were ever produced. Adding to the rariety is the fact they were never imported into the US so the only ones stateside were the ones brought back as war trophies. This gun exhibits old world craftsmanship with deluxe wood, fine checkering, a scnabel forend, raised cheek piece, raised forend, and double set triggers. A rifle like this today would cost in excess of $5000 with the amount of work and fine craftmanship put into it. According to my research this is the lowest known serial number stateside at serial number 626. This rifle is in near perfect condition retaining 90-95% of its high polish blue finish and partial case color on bolt and receiver area. Bore is perfect with no pitting. This is all topped off by and original DR. Gerard 3 post 4 power scope with quick detach high turret mount that is in great condition as well. I've shot this firearm and it still exhibits excellant accuracy almost 100 years after being manufactured. Here is your chance to own an extremely rare early sniping rifle. The only other examples I have seen sell sold at auction for $2800 and $3000 respectively so price is firm. Will consider RESONABLE cash offers.

Thureon Defense is a small company out of New Holstein, Wisconsin that makes unique, custom ordered rifles.  This highly accurate tactical .45 acp carbine comes with Seven (7) - 25-round magazines (Glock style magazines), removable iron sites (if you want to use a scope), Command Arms tactical rear stock with adjustable cheek weld riser & various compartments.  Also includes a black tactical carrying case (see photos).

RIFLE INFO: Thureon Defense rifles featured solid machine milled receivers and forearm assemblies.  The only plastic is on the rear adjustable stock.

FEATURES:

1.  .45 ACP Caliber carbine with solid machine-milled Receiver and front quad-rail forearm assembly.  Barrel features a custom flash suppressor.
2.  Comes with seven (7) - 25-round Glock Magazines (3rd party).  Also uses regular Glock magazines (for the Model 21).
3.  AR removable tactical iron sites (front and rear).
4.  Command Arms Rear Stock with adjustable Cheek Weld Riser and various compartments.
5.  Tactical Carrying Case.

REASON FOR SELLING:  Am cutting back on my collection.  I'm a retired Marine who collected hard to find firearm items.  But am not shooting much anymore, so I'm reluctantly selling off lots of what I have.  I also have a much more expensive KRISS .45 acp model on another listing.

PRICE:  $1250 Cash (no trades or checks please).  NOTE - this was a custom ordered gun - not one you find in any stores.  Because it is assembled per order, I originally paid $1375 for it (and that came with just one Glock 13-rd magazine).  The purchase of the additional 7 magazines was obviously extra.

BEST METHOD OF CONTACT:  Call me direct on my mobile, which is REDACTED anytime between 9 AM and 10 PM daily EST.  I reside in Fuquay Varina, NC, which is 30 minutes south of Raleigh off of HW 401S.

I bought this on a whim that this would be my duty gun for if and when I pass my Seattle Police Department exams. However, reconsidering the actual ergonomics of this 1911 in relation to my body size.... I'm a short guy and less than 170 lbs with small hands and this gun is just huge! If I had this on my hip, I'd be walking toward the right all day! So I've decided to let this impulse purchase go.

This is an all brand new gun and has never ever been fired, all I've done to it was:
- Cleaned out the packing grease and lubed it up with Hoppes
- Dry fired with snaps caps
- tested out the weight of a full magazine

I hope to get somewhere around $1300 out of this,
I paid $1493 after taxes and FFL fee, but I just want somewhere close to what I paid for back.

Advantages of Sa vz. 58 over AK47 rifles (cited from Richard Rich Chris)
- All vz. 58 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK47s utilize stamped sheet metal receivers and are not as rigid as the vz.58 receiver.
- Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK47.
- The bolt of the vz. 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired – the shooter immediately knows the firearm is empty and allows for quicker reloads.
- The vz. 58 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
- The vz. 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
- The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the vz. 58. Unlike the AK safety, the vz. 58 safety can be operated by just a forefinger with the hand remaining on the pistol grip.
- vz.58 has no need for an ejection port dust cover as the receiver is completely enclosed. A cover (on the safety lever) must be used on the AK47 to prevent debris from entering the receiver through the reciprocating charging handle slot.
- The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the vz. 58.
- The vz. 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
- The alloy magazine of the vz. 58 is half the weight of the steel AK47 magazine.
- The vz. 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.

(like a draco ) After some research on it, it seems to be somewhat rare. Measures about 19 inches from end to end. Ive replaced the original steel mag with a 30 rd tapco polymer smooth side mag (i find it fits better and is overall better in the gun). Very hard to find item here. This is one of the best AK pistols you can buy (dont take my word for it..google it and read what everybody says about them).

These are widely thought of to be some of the best AK pistols. Solid build. Were built by a small company in Texas i believe, so they didnt make too many of them. 

NOTE: Not looking to deflate the value of this and inflate the value of your trade. no ""we'll value your ak pistol at 500 and my M10 at 1100"" in trades. Im looking to do a straight up trade. If your price is post-panic inflated, mine should be too. If its pre-panic price, mine will be too. 2 way street when it comes to trades. Rather than be lowballed, id just hang onto it and pay cash for another AK. Im just trying to be fair and reasonable, so all i ask is that you do the same.

Advantages of Sa vz. 58 over AK47 rifles (cited from Richard Rich Chris)
- All vz. 58 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK47s utilize stamped sheet metal receivers and are not as rigid as the vz.58 receiver.
- Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK47.
- The bolt of the vz. 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired – the shooter immediately knows the firearm is empty and allows for quicker reloads.
- The vz. 58 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
- The vz. 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
- The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the vz. 58. Unlike the AK safety, the vz. 58 safety can be operated by just a forefinger with the hand remaining on the pistol grip.
- vz.58 has no need for an ejection port dust cover as the receiver is completely enclosed. A cover (on the safety lever) must be used on the AK47 to prevent debris from entering the receiver through the reciprocating charging handle slot.
- The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the vz. 58.
- The vz. 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
- The alloy magazine of the vz. 58 is half the weight of the steel AK47 magazine.
- The vz. 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.

Don't overpay price gougers, vampires, hoarders, and price criminals without visiting this site first.  You'll be glad you did. Here's a small exert from the site:

ARMSLIST and all other gun marketplaces are community run for the most part. As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

These price criminals only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but let's face it, do we really need 100 round drums or is that more of a want? Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back under the 1000s where they all belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The regularity will only return if we make it.

AR-15: $600-$1300 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)
AK-47: $400-$900
SKS:$300-$500
SCAR 16/17: $2000/$2800
AR-10: $1000-1500
Glock: $400-600
10/22: $229
ACR: $2000
1911: $600-1100
9mm ammo: $0.25/round is on the higher end
223/5.56: $0.35/round
.308/7.62 NATO: maybe up to $1/round (on high side)
.22: $0.05/round is high

This is a like-new example of the XD40 service model with a 4"" barrel with one additional magazine, for a total of three (12 round capacities). The only wear is where you'd expect it, on the barrel and the inside of the slide. I created custom granulate grips that cover the side panels for additional traction (similar to what you'd see from Talon, and easily removed). I have also replaced the stock trigger with a Powder River Precision drop-in trigger kit that reduced the trigger from 5.75 pounds to 4 pounds, eliminated the over travel, and improved the reset. I'm including the original trigger and associated parts with the sale. This will also come with the original box, manual, and gun lock.

I bought it new, and have only put 700 rounds through it. All the ammo I used was brass -- no steel cased stuff. I am particular about my firearms, and ensure they're clean and treated with care and quality products.

I will accept cash or cashiers checks, and consider trades.

The Model 27 was built on Smith & Wesson's carbon steel, large N-frame, and was available at various times with 31/2"", 4"", 5"", 6"" or 83/8"" barrel lengths and had adjustable sights.
History

When first introduced by Smith & Wesson in 1935 it was known as the Registered Magnum. The model was essentially a custom order revolver. Barrel lengths could be had in quarter-inch increments from 3.5"" to 8.75"" in length. In addition to the different lengths of barrels available there were different grips, front sights, triggers, hammers, and finishes available. Each Registered Magnum came with a certificate of authenticity. Even though it was introduced in the middle of the Great Depression and was extremely expensive, Smith & Wesson found itself backlogged with orders for the four years that it produced the Registered Magnum. The Kansas City Police Department issued the Registered Magnum to its officers, and many other law enforcement officers across the United States carried the Registered Magnum. In 1939 Smith & Wesson stopped producing the Registered Magnum. It was replaced with the .357 Magnum. The .357 Magnum was available with barrel lengths of 3.5"", 5"", 6.5"" and 8.75"". It has been reported that these were the most popular barrel lengths for the Registered Magnum. Essentially the .357 Magnum was still the Registered Magnum, but standardized for ease of production and economy. The Smith & Wesson Model 28 ""Highway Patrolman"" was introduced as a lower cost version of the Model 27 in 1954, stripped of some of the features of the Model 27, such as polishing.

It was noted for its durability and reliability. The 31/2"" barrel length was extremely popular with FBI agents from the 1940s through the 1960s. Skeeter Skelton considered the Model 27 with a 5"" barrel as the best all around handgun. General George Patton carried an ivory handled Registered Magnum with a 31/2 inch barrel (along with his ivory handled Colt Peacemaker); Patton called the Model 27 his ""killing gun."""

The wood and metal are excellent. I got the gun from a friend of mine who bought it new. After I got it I carried it to Hook Boutin (if you don't know who he is Google him, he is one if not the best in the country on these rifles) and told him to do whatever needed to be done, I wanted a shooter. Hook completely stripped the rifle and did all of his accurizing/reliabilty tricks and zeroed the rifle in. It also comes with a Vortex flash hider with a National Match sight on it also. The reason for the extra sight is because the height of the other sight would only allow you to adjust out to 500-600 yards. Now there is enough adjustment in the sights to reach out to 1000 yards. The gun is a sub-MOA shooter. I've shot it with factory ammo and some of Hook's reloads (I have about 5-10 left that I'll throw in).

The only ding with this rifle is one of the trigger guard ""ears"" is broken, but i did JB weld it back on there, so it is on there pretty good and in no way affects the rifle, just not pretty to look at, but you cant see it because the Stark grip, with its built in trigger guard, i have on there covers it up nicely (see pictures). So with over $400 worth of accessories ( And i actually paid more for them, the prices listed above are just an average of what they're going for online) and 450 rounds of ammo,that is hard to find right now and super expensive ( $1.00+ per round), i find this to be a great deal. I will also include an extra Black-Magpul MOE grip and all the original parts that came with the rifle. if you need any more pics or info just let me know price firm at 1500.00. please contact mike @ REDACTED YOU WILL NEED VALID NEW MEXICO ID AND LEGALLY ABLE TO OWN A FIREARM.

Mag..  Per the Winchester website this Model 70 was manufactured in 1950.  The overall condition is 85% with awesome blueing, bright bore with good riflings, and only a few very minor nicks in the wood.  This rifle is over 60 years old and looks like it was manufactured recently.  I cant say enough about how nice it is.

NOTE: After some further research, I feel that this rifle has been rebarreled sometime in the past to the 300 Win. Mag...The rebarrel utilized a factory Winchester Sporter Classic barrel....Winchester did not start manufacturing the Winchester 70 in 300 Win Mag until 1963..That being said I must say they did a great job on the rebarrel.   It is also equipped with a Leupold 3x9 scope with flip up covers and a nice leather sling.  For the right deal I will throw in some ammo ( 200 rds. 168 gr. Sierra BTHP MATCH and 40 rds. 150 gr. CoreLoK).

All laws apply and you will be required to show me a CO DL or CO CCW.  No exceptions.  Serious inquires only,  low baller will not be responded to so dont waste my time or yours.  I know what this rifle is worth.  Trades are welcome. Cash offers considered.

I'm looking to trade my BNIB, unfired, Gen 3 Glock 22. Basically, if it's Gen 4 and isn't a compact or sub-compact, I would like to hear from you.

The reason I want to trade is because of an injury to my right hand that is forcing me to learn to shoot left-handed. Because the Gen 4 pistols have reversible magazine releases and the Gen 3 ones do not, I would like to trade. I realize that the Gen 4 pistols are worth a little more than the Gen 3s, so if you have a Gen 4 that is lightly used, I'm OK going straight across (no cash on either end). Also, since some of the Gen 4 pistols come with 3 mags, if you trade me a gun in .40, you can just keep one of the extra mags so you still have 3 mags. I figure this will keep things fair.

If you have a Gen 4 pistol and don't care about the reversible mag release, I'd really appreciate it if you contacted me so we can work something out.

Thanks,
