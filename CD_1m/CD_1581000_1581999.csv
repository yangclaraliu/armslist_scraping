It also comes with a case of 62gr 5.56 XM855
Bushmaster XM-15 E2S Rifle. 16"" Heavy barrel 5.56 with 1 in 9 twist, Collapsible stock, Harris bipod, Original hard case, Original 30rd metal magazine with BFI logo on end plate, ten (10) brand NEW Brownells 30rd metal magazines, Removable carrying handle and 986 Lake City Bulk Ammo 62gr 5.56 rounds.

Original buyer bought the rifle, took it to the range and fired less than half a magazine through it. Took it home and put it away for a few years. I received it last week after a thorough inspection including a function check and found the condition to be LIKE NEW with wear marks consistent with minimal use (see photos and I am a Certified Colt Armorer). Original buyer bought the rifle and a case of Lake City 5.56 XM855 together and only fired a few rounds from the case. I counted all the rounds and it adds up to 986 putting the round count at 14 (approximate). Add to all this ten (10) brand new Brownells metal 30 round magazines still in the original plastic. This is a sweet deal. Yes the photos only show five Brownells magazines but the deal is for ten (10) Brownells magazines.

For more photos or questions email me and I will try to get back to you as fast as I can.

Buyer is responsible for the rules and regulations for their area. Check with your FFL to make sure you can own this rifle. Will only ship to an FFL! Still working out the details on shipping but UPS will be the carrier due to the ammunition. Buyer pays shipping.

Payment: I only accept USPS Money Orders"

The FN FNS-9 & 40 is the latest handgun innovation by FN Herstal.

The FNS pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism together with an optional manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety.

Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate.

Fast and Accurate Shooting
The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.

The FNS has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.

The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy.

Maximized Safety Systems
In addition to the manual safety, the FNS features Four Major Safeties:

Trigger Safety
Firing Pin Safety
Drop Safety
Out-of-Battery Safety

1. Trigger Safety

The two-piece trigger prevents the weapon from firing without a presure on the trigger.
The rear of lower trigger piece catches on the frame if the mechanism is moved without pulling the trigger.

2. Firing Pin Safety

The firing pin safety prevents the stricker from passing.
The firing pin safety is lifted out the way when the trigger is pulled.

 3. Drop Safety

Part of the fire control housing prevents the sear from rotating down to release the stricker unless the trigger is pulled.

 4. Out-of-Battery Safety

When the slide is not fully forwards the sear cannot release the stricker even if the trigger is pulled.

Enhanced Ergonomics
The FNS pistol comes standard with a large number of ergonomic features such as:
- Ultra nonslip checkered grips for better prehension
- Front serrations for easy press check
- Three interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt to the pistol to the shooter's hand size.

Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18” barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace.

The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13” length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4” – 14.5” LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine.

Five locking positions on the extension provide a length of pull adjustment from 10½"" to 14"", and a 1"" range of vertical adjustment helps you set the correct stock height for a solid cheekweld. Two, detachable, full-length storage compartments provide additional cheek support; each waterproof compartment holds up to 3 AA or 4 CR-123 batteries. Another, permanent storage compartment on the left side of the buttstock holds two more AA batteries or other small items. The aggressive surface texturing and hand-filling contours of the pistol grip ensure positive weapon control. Storage recess in the grip can hold more batteries or other small items; flexible rubber cap seals out dirt and moisture. The receiver extension tube has a waterproof compartment that is ideal for a field cleaning kit. Sockets on each side of the stock adapter accept the included quick-detach, push-button swivel for an ambidextrous 1¼"" single-point sling.

It has been handled but never mounted and is in mint condition with all original paper work. This is a great deal for some one looking for a upper end scope. Pictures available upon request.

Here are some specs.

Key Features

* Zeiss Conquest Scope
    Zeiss Conquest riflescopes are designed to meet the needs of North American hunters with an excellent price to performance ratio. They feature fully multicoated optics waterproof construction and 1/4 MOA precision adjustments. 

* Hunting Turrets
    Low profile hunting turrets with 1/4 MOA clicks and turret caps 

* 3-12x Magnification
    A bump up in power from the 2.5-10x the 3-12x magnification range brings you in closer to more distant targets easily. Smaller targets become more magnified and responsible target acquisition can be executed with authority. At the low end of the zoom range a brighter sight picture is visible and sight acquisition on moving targets becomes possible. 

* Parallax Correction
    Parallax correction is factory preset at 100 yards (91.4m) 

* Fully Multicoated Optics
    Proprietary MC coatings ensure the best possible view under all lighting conditions 

* Recoil Proof
    Engineered and proven to withstand & readily manage the most punishing recoil of big bore African safari rifles. 

* Waterproof and Fog Proof
    30mm Center tube is machined from a single piece of rugged aluminum alloy that is o-ring sealed and nitrogen purged 

* #8 Reticle in First Focal Plane
    The #8 reticle features four heavy posts and fine cross hairs. This configuration stands out well against dense brush and heavy cover. The four posts lead your eye to the center of the sight picture while the cross hairs establish your exact point of aim without obscuring the field of view.
    First focal plane positioning of the reticle maintains its subtension across the magnification range. This enables accurate distance ranging and hold-over calculation. 



Magnification Range: 3x - 12x
Eye Relief: 2.3""
Scope Turret Adjustment: .25 moa
Scope Objective Diameter: 56
Scope Tube Size / Mount: 30 mm

I have 10 of these mags currently in stock.  You can check them out on our website here:

If you are local you can pick them up in person.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

Designed with the hunter in mind, these sights are the lightest red dot sights tough enough to bear the Aimpoint name. Small enough to be used anywhere that you cold put iron sights, these sights can be used on any type of firearm or archery equipment.

Its weight--84 g without mount and 105 g with mount
Ideal for rifles, shotguns, handguns or archery equipment. 
Integral Weaver-style base allows easy attachment.

It will also hold similar carbines with a collapsible stock, a folding stock rifle, or any other weapon that is under 35 inches in overall length. This 36-inch Voodoo Tactical brand padded rifle carrying case will help protect your rifle from the hard knocks of transportation, whether in your vehicle or in the field. It can also be used if you break down your gun or to carry different uppers. WWW.PHOENIXTACTICAL.COM

Inside are two sets of adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case that has foam only on two sizes or the flimsy egg-crate foam of some hard-shell cases. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement. 

Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories. 

This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six standard size magazines and the center pouch is even larger. 

This Voodoo Tactical gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear."

261,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1581261,For Sale:  TAPCO HANDGUARD W/RAILS FOR AR-15 (FDE),"NEWARK/HEATH, Ohio, United States",$ 40,"Listed On: Monday, February 17, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"WWW.PHOENIXTACTICALONLINE.COM:
Nobody wants to lug around a heavy rifle, it’s as simple as that.  So what if we told you that you could effectively cut down the weight of your current aluminum handguard to 50% of its present weight?  When you install an INTRAFUSE® AR Carbine Handguard that is exactly what you will be doing.  We’ve created it out of a light weight but high strength composite that offers both weight reduction and durability. We have also done something you can't do with an aluminum handguard, over 300 rounds in full auto and our handguard is cool enough to be hand held!  But that’s not all this handguard brings to the table.  Customization is a key component to the INTRAFUSE® line and this handguard is no different.  Molded into it are four Picatinny rails (located at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 positions) with the side and bottom rails having removable covers so you can decide which ones you want to use and which ones you want to keep hidden.  If you’re in the market for a light weight handguard that is built around the idea of “customization,” there is no better fit than the INTRAFUSE® AR Carbine Handguard."

The Fatboy Lightweight offers a double-stack magazine that holds either a 10 or 12 round capacity, in 45ACP. With its low profile rear sights and military style slide-stop and safety lock, the Fatboy Lightweight is the complete package in an officer's size 1911 model."

According to the Ruger handbook, a rare and collectable combination of sights, and caliber.
It does have some wear from the previous owner, but is still in about 98% quality. Only scratches in the wood are just in the finish. Blue-ing is beautiful.

I have the Ruger custom scope rings, if you prefer taking your game at a distance, leather sling, recoil absorber, hard case, and a 9 round sleeve, for quick follow up shots. Though I doubt you'd need one, while firing one of the 19 500gr, 5,000+ft/lbs rounds that I have.

The round puts out over 4/3 as much power as the 7mm Magnum, and is good for any game that walks this Earth. 
For hunting, you can take any game you please, as long as you have the permit.
 For home defense, it is a heavy gun, to absorb the recoil, but single shot weapons are 4 inches shorter than respective lever or bolt guns, due to not needing the action, making it shorter than an 870 shotgun. And the .458 round can shatter an elephant skull. I'm sure that it can make short work of any armor any intruder will wear.
Worried about zombies? I'm sure this will make chunky salsa out of a line of them.
Plinking? Honestly, no. At $100+ for a box of 20, you better be rich if you plan on taking this to the range every weekend. But if you reload? From what I've read, .45 ""Long"" Colt rounds will work, allowing you to shoot for much cheaper, if you're not worried about Dangerous Game.

Single action sucks? A skilled operator can use this rig just as fast as a bolt action rifle.
Also, if you see a man taking a single shot rifle out of the case, and on a hunt, it says something about him. The silence of any onlookers tells you that they know you're both a more skilled hunter, and a better marksman than any of them."

I then installed most of a premium Wyndham Weaponry Lower Parts Kit ( except for the parts that can;t be installed until you select you stock/tube to install).  the hammer, trigger, etc are all marked with a ""WW"" ton indicate manufacturer.

These receivers began their life as a blem set i purchased directly from Aero.  They had minor exterior machining imperfections, but mostly uneven coloring in the anodizing.  I did not want to breach the integrity of the anodized finish, so i thoroughly degreased, rinsed, and properly coated them with Alumahyde 2, then cured them for 7 days at 150 degrees.  Some surface machining imperfections may still be visible under the coating.
Alumahyde 2 is an epoxy based coating. It is extremely chemical, corrosion, and heat resistant. In my experience, it hold up very well to abrasions from wood and plastic objects or gear buckles. however, it is susceptible to damage from sharp metal objects or impact with concrete, just like the underlying anodizing.  The color is Coyote Tan, which is very close to, but about one shade darker than flat dark earth, but still a very nice match.
comes as pictured with most of the LPK installed, and will include the remainder of the lower parts kit that you'll install during installation of your buffer extension tube.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the miitary M4.  With the 4 position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 inches in length and weighs only 5.65 pounds.  It is ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.  Its unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components.  Its straight line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire.  The four position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes, while the cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions.  The law enforcement carbine has a flat top receiver which allows for removeable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories. This weapon comes with two 20 round magazines.Only serious buyer should contact me.  Furthermore I take cash, cashier check  money order. western union or money gram.

I just realized this past weekend that I have quite a bit more than I need. Therefore I have decided to see if anyone wants any of it for what I paid.  I have .223, .308win, .45auto, .38 Special and .357.  So for example, I have lots of boxes of Steel Cased Tula .223 and I am asking $6 per box.  The difference here is, I do not have a 3 box limit in place, so you can buy as many boxes as I have.  I am firm on at least getting what I paid.

IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, COMES WITH 1 X 9 ROUND MAG.

The A-100 is a recoil-operated, locked breech design with improved Browning-style linkless locking. The lock up is similar to the Browning High Power or CZ-75 with locking lugs on the top of the barrel which mate with lugs in the slide (not with a single lug in the ejection port like a SIG P22X.) The pistol's safety features include a manual decocking lever, firing pin block, and hammer safety.[1] The A-100 lacks a manual safety, but depends entirely on a deliberate pull of its trigger to fire it; in this way it is similar to the SIG P22X series of pistols. The double action trigger pull is relatively long and heavy, thereby precluding the need for a safety as the probability of an inadvertent discharge is low.

The A-100 resembles the SIG P228 and is similar in overall size and dimension, but differs in several respects, the most visible being the location of the take-down/disassembly lever on the right side of the frame (from the shooter's point of view) as compared to the SIG design, in which it is located on the left. The A-100 is also slightly heavier than the SIG, owing to its all-steel construction. Additionally, the A-100's chamber contour as visible when the slide is fully forward is rounded whereas the SIG design is squared. The configuration of the hammer is also different, with the A-100 having a rounded hammer provided with a lanyard hole and the SIG having a more conventional spur hammer. Magazines are not interchangeable between the A-100 and SIG pistols, however many holsters made for the SIG P229/228 fit the A-100 satisfactorily.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!
