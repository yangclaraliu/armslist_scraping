Sorry........,just shot Frosty out in the front yard with this. He wasn't doing anything wrong poor guy....,just mad 'cause I can't keep my new toy (I have to mention I was also thinking of some of the economic decisions being made for us by our wise officials. Just got this thing all decked out and had to pay or a truck repair. I digress....Frosty ain't doing so hot
anymore because this thing works AWESOME!!!
Comes with...............,
-Strikeforce Desert Tan Folding Stock
-40 round Tapco magazine
-Sun Optics receiver mounted see through SKS scope mount.
-Sightmark Holograph Sight with 4 reticle selection ($160 one, not one of the $40 economy ones)
-100 rounds of ammo
-The piece of mind that you can fight off the ""zombie invasion""when TSHTF
-The piece of mind that all the stores that I know of have plenty of cheap ammo for this IN STOCK
-A few stray ""Dremel"" marks where I modified the stock to accommodate the scope mount.
(not ugly-but then again, no one ever claimed an SKS was pretty to begin with)
-Shoots great! (did I mention Frosty?)
-The nice warm feeling of knowing that this isn't in the hands of a pinko commie anymore and is now owned by a PATRIOT that'll use it for whatever he feels he/she must because the 2nd Amendment says it's your RIGHT!

If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750 (If you want the ""Holo-sight"") If you want to save yourself $100 and have your own sight you can have it for $650. If you don't like it....you're free to write ""hate emails"" from yer mommy's basement because THIS IS AMERICA!!! I can then delete them while I laugh!

Seriously....,if you want this, email me stating your intention to buy, a number that I can call or text, and be prepared to show a valid form of ID and sign a Bill of Sale, because I'm ONLY SELLING to a LEGAL, law-abiding CITIZEN! Thanks for playing....,and next time......get out and vote because this crap is getting ridiculous!"

Gold Dot bullets were designed to meet stringent law enforcement standards for dependability and performance. They features Uni-Cor technology which firmly bonds the core to the jacket and virtually eliminates bullet failures. The hollow point is created after the jacket is built. This helps produce maximum expansion and weigh retention while improving bullet feeding. A great personal defense bullet. This is not loaded ammunition.

This gun was more of a want than a need for me, so it needs to go before I spend more money on another gun. Its just been sitting lately and someone else can enjoy it.

Gun came with night sights already on it from Sig. When I got it I put the new grips on it, added the waist band clip (so you don't need an actual holster), and shot about 75 rounds through it at the range. It's a small and accurate gun. Quite a wrist-snapper.

The package includes: the gun, standard magazine, extended magazine (with pinkie grip), 2 holsters (one OWB and one wallet holster), belt clip, original Sig Sauer case, and new box of 50 rounds PMC Bronze FMJ ammo, plus the hollow points that are loaded in the magazines.

Text me if interested @ REDACTED I can meet up almost anywhere. MSRP is $693.00 on Sig's website, so my price is fair. I paid $550 without all the extras.

Sig 1911 Nightmare Fastback, 16 mags ran through it (128rounds). The Sig 226 is no longer available. Beretta 92A1 with Trijicon night sights, 4- 32 round Promags, 8-18 round Mecgars, as well as the original 17 round Beretta mag. I would love to have a kabillion rounds of .308 with the rifle if possible. I may have something else that you can't live without, so don't be afraid to let me know what you're looking for!

This particular rifle is in the hard to find BLACK finish. It comes with all the accessories and paperwork as shown in the pictures. This is a super-hot item in our current legal climate.

This configuration has the benefit of having similar feel, operation, and maintenance to the familiar AR15/M16/M4/MR556/HK416 variants of the standard US military service rifle, but is chambered in the much more effective 7.62 NATO round. It also has the benefit that it will accept most, if not all, of the wide variety of accessories that use Picatinny rail mounts. This rifle is, of course, semi-automatic only. (You have to tell some people) This rifle is superior, as are most SIG products, and will probably not be able to be re-stocked because of supplier backlog for a long time…probably longer than you have to get one before some anti-gun legislation prevents you from obtaining it! Now is not a time to wonder and wait, it is time to act!"

This grip feels like you are holding a 1911, it is truly amazing! He also added a beavertail to it which greatly reduces the opportunity for slide bite. on the front finger grooves and on the backstrap it has a rubber texture and on the sides of the grip is a lite stipling.

This beauty has less than 200 rounds down the pipe and is clean as a whistle. It comes with all the original paperwork, the case and 3 15 round magazines. The Generation 3s only came with two but I am adding a third.

Do you hunt? Shoot field target? Plink? Eliminate pesky garden varmints? This is the scope for you! What an incredible bargain. From the emerald coating on the lens to the illumination options, this scope really delivers the goods for any type of shooting discipline.

This UTG scope has an etched-glass reticle, which is superior to a wire reticle because it's etched by a laser and is much more precise. That lets you get even more accuracy from your gun. Another way that etched-glass reticles are superior to wire reticles is when they're illuminated. The etched ones show the illumination only on the reticle. It looks like the reticle is floating. Wire reticles often have a reflection of the illumination in the objective lens, which can be distracting when shooting.

I'm asking $1850 or best offer, for everything
even a year ago this rifle was nearly $1,000, and it comes with $1,000 in impossible to find accessories.. Won't be able to buy any of this new, possibly for the next year due to shortages and huge backlogs of orders. So prices will remain high on the used guns. My price is very fair considering, it's practically what I paid when the items were available.

I do not wish to sell parts and pieces of this, it is a complete package ready to go. Solid, 100% reliable accurate and functional."
