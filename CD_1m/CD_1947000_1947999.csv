This was my first handgun and has spent the greater part of the last 9 years in storage.  It has significant pitting on the slide and I wouldn't recommend buying unless you are handy with deep cleaning/refinishing.  It was a blued finish but I stripped it off to try and remove some of the rust pitting.  So while it looks like a stainless finish slide, it is simply stripped down to the bare metal and will need some type of refinishing to prevent further rust.  I tried to capture this in the pics the best I could.

While cosmetically it looks ugly, the gun runs great and has only about 200-300 rounds fired in its lifetime.  It includes the factory zipper pouch and a box of .32 ACP Federal Premium defense ammo.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

The model 39 was the first U.S. designed Double Action semi-automatic pistol marketed in the United States. The 39-2 is the improved second edition of this pistol design. Made from the 1970's to the early 1980's, this particular model was one of the last runs in either 1980 or 1981. Just looking at it though you would never guess this pistol is over 30 years old! The nickel finish is phenomenal! There are no real nicks or scratches on this gun, no pitting, no rust, no excessive wear, etc. There are some very minor surface scuffs visible in the photos which are to be expected from any reflective finish that has been handled and wiped down to clean. When polished up right this baby shines! 
It is apparent that the gun has a very low round count as the internals are barely worn and cleaner than most of my much newer guns. The gun has been upgraded with a VERY comfortable, ergonomic Pachmayr non-slip grip that fits the hand like a glove. One factory S&W 8rd magazine is included as well. The spring is still nice and tight, clean as a whistle. Some features are a magazine safety, external hammer, DA/SA trigger, manual decocker, and thumb safety. When the thumb lever is down, the gun is safe. If the hammer is back the lever can be pulled all the way down to safely decock the gun, physically blocking the hammer from the firing pin while lowering it.
Most important of all, she shoots like a dream! From the tight and smooth trigger squeeze to the minimal muzzle climb, the accuracy of this gun makes you feel like a pro putting rounds down range. I would never hesitate to arm myself with this 39-2 when in need.
These guns are seriously hard to come by in the nickel finish and without a doubt a valuable collectors' item. I would love to hang on to it myself just for sheer joy of owning this neat piece of history but I am a student paying for school who has a few too many toys. I need the money to pay for the fall semester.
I have seen these go on Gun Broker for $800+ so I feel like my asking price is fair for the condition of this gun. However, it is an asking price and I am open to other offers. Please don't hesitate to send them my way.
I do have more pictures available of different angles, the inside of the gun, etc. I am only allowed to upload 3 but you may contact me for more."

I also have an extra clip (has a little surface rust near the bottom of the clip) and set of rings (1"" Burris made for the 527). Comes with case (hard plastic with foam inside). I went to Bob Wards and they inspected the rifle and valued it at 93% (highest their book went for this rifle) which is valued at $425 (rifle alone, not including scope, extra mag, case, and rings). I then took it to my current preferred FFL dealer and he said I could sell it at $600 with everything.

It was purchased new on 12/08/12. It comes with 39 months left on the warranty so buy this tv with confidence. It is absolutlety awesome watching movies on it and playing games. Adult owned. I have the receipt that has the purchase price for the TV and the warranty information, this will come with it for you to use in case something goes wrong. The warranty is a full replacement one too, a great warranty. It comes with 6 pairs of 3D glasses. Avatar 3D, iRobot 3D, Nightmare Before Christmas 3D, And Alice in Wonderland 3D. I can package this TV back up in the box just like new, could probably even take it back to wal-mart really. The reciept shows I paid $722.00 for the TV and warranty (got in onsale too). It came with 2 pair of glasses for free but I have 4 extra glasses with it, $25 value. The movies cost as follows Avatar 3D was $29.99 +tax, Alice in Wonderland 3D was $29.99 + tax, Nightmare Before X-mas 3D was $39.99+ tax, iRobot 3D was $29.99 +tax. I want to get $600 out of this TV, I think its fair considering the 3 year warranty and all the extras that come with it. I live in a smoke free home in Leavenworth, KS. You can come play call of duty in 3D on this if you want or watch a 3D movie to try it out. If you have a PS3 it will play 3D movies. I like this tv better than the theatres, we just need money for bills, my work burnt down a couple months ago. Why I think $600 is fair- Total cost of tv and 3 year warranty was $722.00, 4 extras 3D glasses $25, and $130.00 worth of 3D movies. Thats a total of $877.00 so if I ask $600 thats a total savings of $277.00 for a TV with 39 months of warranty left and original packaging. Like I said feel free to call and come by and check this tv out. Once you see Avatar in 3D or play Black Ops 2 in 3D you will be in love with it. Below is a link to this tv in stores and the spec's on it. LG is my new favorite brand. The picture is great. 120 hrz too so picture quality is fast and unreal quality!! * Also this 3D tv has a feature that will let you turn anything into 3D. I watched all the KC Chiefs games in 3D last year. So cool watching Jamaal Charles run through your living room, lol! Dont miss saving nearly $300 and getting a good 3D tv under a full replacement warranty for the next 3 years. I will not take less than $600 for it so dont ask. Im already giving nealy $300 off total price. Can come to kansas or missouri, I actually live in both states.  This tv is in 100% perfect shape. Im not a scammer, come to my house and try before you buy. You will love this TV... Email me for my phone number or with any questions or if you want to see this beautiful unit. $600 very firm. You will be saving $277.00 already. Thanks


I will do a partial trade for cash and other man things. I will trade for any kind of gun or guns. Stand up arcade machines (jamma, etc), 3 wheelers, dirt bikes, fender electric guitars (no junk squire stuff). I need to at least get $300 cash for bills but would trade for the rest.

For Sale: Brand New In Box Larue Tactical PredatAR 16"" 5.56 Rifle. Includes everything pictured except TROY BUIS. 

$2650.00 + Shipping and Insurance. Ohio FFL to your FFL. 

The specs below are from Larue. Larue PredatAR 5.56 Overview The PredatAR 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle. 

 The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). The handguards on the PredatAR extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. 

 Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section. Comes with a 6-position Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. The lower assembly has the proven Geissele Two-Stage trigger. XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls. Facilitates reliable extraction through a wide range of temperature / chamber pressure extremes. XTRAXN™ extends extractor life, while having no effect on the firearm's accuracy. All this, and it dovetails well with the OBR's world-famous accuracy. 

 Caliber: 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Rifle Weight: 6.25 lb. (based on 16.1” barrel version, unloaded without optics) Barrel Length: 16.1“ Barrel Material: Stainless Steel, Blackened. Rifling Twist Rate: 1/8 Muzzle Thread Configuration: ½ x 28 * Barrel Life: 10,000 (approx) Gas System: Mid-Length Direct Impingement Trigger Group: Two-Stage Geissele trigger.

Hopefully someone will enjoy her. Not a single round has been shot out of it (except whatever test rounds FNH does at the factory). There's not a scratch on it. It's absolutely brand new.

It was owned by the Columbia county sheriff's office (CCSO) and has that written on the slide along with a cool sheriff star insignia. It has been well maintained and has all the updated parts , I suppose from the sheriffs office armorer . This gun doesn't show very much wear , just a tiny bit on the front of one side of the slide from being holstered but its not worn bad at all just slightly. I would estimate it maybe has 1000 rounds through it, most police guns are carried alot and only shot during yearly qualification. And as you may know 1000 rounds through a glock is nothing, not even broke in yet. These are in most people's eyes glocks finest guns due to the lack of the finger grooves and the use of cast parts vs the new MIM parts they are using currently that is causing all kinds of brass ejection problems etc. These are the guns that solidified glocks reputation and work like a well oiled sewing machine. I love the gun but have many glocks and just want something different. If it doesnt sell I will be perfectly happy keeping it. Thanks for looking and god bless."

The shotgun is equipped with a magazine guide (magwell) and an automatic last round bolt hold open device in order to help facilitate easy reloads and insertion of the magazine. It also has a self regulating gas system, which allows greater flexibility in the type of ammo used. The top cover features a Picatinny rail on top allowing various optical devices to be attached to aid in target aquisition. The top cover is also hinged to the rear sight block in order to provide the top-mounted Picatinny rail with the ability to hold zero. An adjustable rear notched sight and front sight post are also standard on the shotgun to assist in accurate firing when no optical device is affixed.

 Saiga 12 shotguns were designed by the world-renown Russian engineer Mikhail Kalashnikov, who was the mastermind behind the creation of legendary AK-47. These shotguns are developed on the base of the Kalashnikov assault rifle and overenginnered for reliability. Made with a minimal amount of moving parts and simple operating procedures, the design succeeds in providing an easy to use, highly reliable shooting platform. The Saiga-12 is designed for high reliability in harsh environments. The magazines can be filled with a mixture of 2 ¾” and 3” shells allowing for a variety of ammunition to be used. This shotgun is designed for professional and sport hunting and small and medium-sized game under various climactic conditions. The removable magazine allows for quick reloads in situations when it’s required, like competitive shooting or a crisis situation. Saiga-12 is therefore great for tactical and home defense. All Saiga-12 shotguns have a threaded barrel so you can add various chokes or muzzle brakes.

It has been carried for two months. Shows a little holster wear, but nothing major. About 200 - 300 rounds have been fired out of this little guy. There are some ""custom"" work done to it. The chassis and some internal parts have been polished to improve trigger pull. As you know, the trigger is double action. The polish job has made the trigger pull smoother, but I haven't felt a difference as far as weight goes. Also, Nano's do not have manual controls...therefore I have added a slide release (just a personal preference). The FDE frame has been modified to work with the slide release. The black and pink frames are stock but can be modded to work with the slide release. Also included is a spare, un-modded slide lock if you choose not to use the slide release. 

Package includes:
Nano w/ 2 6rd mags, box, docs, lock...
1 additional 6rd mag (3 total)
1 8 rd mag
2 Pearce Pinky Extensions (made for Kahr K9/40 but fits the Nano mags)
Black Frame
Pink Frame (for the ladies...or those confident guys)
Un-modded Slide Lock
Lasermax Laser
Trijicon Night Sights
Little Foxx Holster made to fit the Nano w/ Lasermax attached (super comfortable incase you've never tried one...highly recommended)

This is the ultimate Nano carry package with all the bells and whistles and then some. Not looking for any trades, just ""thinning the herd"". Selling for $650. I would like to see your GA driver's license and GA weapons carry license.

Yanmar motors are used on various MEP series military generators.
Beware of the made in China Yanmar clones. 
Very heavy duty. 
Weighs a bit over 300 pounds.
Very fuel efficient, .4 gals of fuel per hour at full load. Less fuel consumption with a lighter load. A gas generator with a similar load will burn nearly twice the fuel.
This is unit built to last. Parts if needed are readly available from numerous sources.

Can burn many fuels, home heating oil, off road diesel. I've never tried it, but bio diesel, filtered cooking oil and other fuels can be burned. 

Diesel is safer to store and has a longer shelf life than Gas.

The tanks are TIG welded using supreme skill and elaborate tooling. The outside of the welds are treated and polished to reveal the beauty of the stainless steel and show the excellence of the weld. We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied."

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

I have this Noveske that I've put to some use, but my wants have changed. It is a factory rifle, bought about two years ago. It is a 14.5"" pinned, with VLTOR MUR and Switchlock. They're not making 14.5"" builds currently. It has 3,649 rounds through it by my best estimate (one class - the rest was static range, and I usually round that number up) but there is still lots of life left in this barrel with the double chrome lining. I'm not anal about cleaning it but I do usually wipe it down after shooting and I run it wet with Militec-1. I have babied it so its in pretty damn good shape. All rounds fired have been Federal 193, with 90 of those suppressed, or about 500 PPU 75 gr match. There are some marks on the bolt catch where a BAD Lever was installed but I'm pretty sure that's about it.

The rifle cost $2,500 brand new and still has lots of life left. It is in good to great shape. Let me know if you're interested and feel free to make an offer but keep in mind this was my first firearm and is a bit sentimental, therefore I won't accept just anything for it.

Trades - Really not looking for any trades for this, except maybe a quality AK. Rifle Dynamics would be awesome but Arsenal with some mods, accessories, or cash could work too. I'd be open to the 7.62 platform but 5.45 would be ideal. Let me know what you have and I'll think on it."

This German made brute is an absolute BEAST! These highly sought after pistols have been a mainstay of the Special Operations community for years for the simple reason that HK works, and works well. This one is the prefered variant #1, meaning that the slide lever acts as a de-cocker and a safety. You can carry this ""cocked & locked"" in 1911 fashion, or uncocked as a double action. This gun is outfitted with a 6"" stainless steel National Match Grade barrel, that mitigates muzzle rise down to next to nothing. It has a HK competition recoil spring, making the racking of the slide feel like hot butter on teflon. It is easier to rack than EVERY 9mm I own. One of the most significant features of the USP is the mechanical recoil reduction system. One of the most significant features of the USP is the mechanical recoil reduction system. This system is incorporated into the recoil spring assembly, and consists of a captive coil spring around the guide rod. These two features in concert, make this gun feel more like a 40 S&W, even with 45 +P loads. It has the HK short reset combat trigger, that allows for a higher cyclic rate, without being dangerously light like a competition trigger. Included with the gun are 3) 12 round factory, and 1) 22 round aftermarket magazines, a black leather pancake style belt holster. She has HK installed night sights, that are dimming, but still work like a charm. The frame rails, exterior of the chamber and feed ramps have all been polished to a mirror shine. This was my personal sidearm on a security detail in N. Africa, and she served me well, not once giving me a click when I wanted a bang (regardless of ammo), and supremely accurate and manageable. She has some minor scratches on the proprietary ""Hostile Environment"" nitride finish, but nothing down to the bare metal. Overall, I'd put the finish in the 80-85% category. The bore is bright and shiney, with great rifling, and the gun functions flawlessly. This isn't a civilian toy, but rather a professional's tool."

I would say the wood overall is in good condition except for a gouge right under the end mental barrel strap. The bore looks like it has some lead deposit but the rifleing can still be seen. The bottom of the rifle where the brass plate is shows 32 although faint but still readable. It still has the dust cover, it slides like it was designed to do but it is not tight, it comes off easily. Because the rifle is historical I don't want to try tightening the dust cover only to make it worse. A couple screws SLOTS on the barrel strap have been beat up by a careless cowbiy  because I seriously doubt he had gunsmith screwdrivers. .The mechanics seem to work okay, I would not be afraid to fire it.

Wood & Blue.

The Marlin Model 70P, also known as the Marlin Papoose, is a .22 Long Rifle semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Marlin Firearms. 
The rifle is notable for its portability; it is less than 21 inches (530 mm) in length when disassembled and weighs 3.25 pounds. 
Disassembly requires loosening a barrel retention nut. It is designed as a hiker and camper utility rifle, and appeals to the same market as the AR-7. The Model 70P is based on the earlier Marlin Model 70 (currently listed as Model 795) that has a fixed barrel. 
Its semi-automatic action originated with the Marlin Model 60. 

The rifle has an open rear sight and ramp front sight. The receiver has an integral .22 tip-off scope mounting rail. 

Pics - ""borrowed"" from the web - will updated will actual pics of firearms as soon as possible

Very low round count, just sits in the safe.

From the Manufacturer:
The P220® Carry Elite Stainless is an 8+1 capacity carry-sized pistol with a full-size frame. Chambered in .45ACP, the P220 Carry Elite Stainless features the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The new SRT was designed by SIG SAUER® to deliver the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset 60% shorter than the standard DA/SA. This short reset provides for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting making it ideal for competitive shooting. With its enhanced ergonomic features of a beavertail grip, front strap checkering and front cocking serrations, the P220 Carry Elite is an excellent choice as a big bore carry pistol. Its beavertail grip allows the shooter to obtain his or her grip quickly and with confidence even under stress. Each P220 Carry Elite Stainless comes equipped with SIGLITE® Night Sights and the all-stainless construction provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long."
