She is in excellent condition with an extremely low round count, less than 150. I have never had the opportunity to run the rifle hard, it has been zeroed and shot with success at 100 yards. 
The mil-spec trigger is crisp and consistent. I have added a 3x9 scope with red/green illuminated reticle, a carbine quad rail, and a Knight's Armament vertical fore grip.  The AR-15 has been meticulously maintained and it shows. It has always been well lubricated and lived in a padded rifle case. The rifle has never had a malfunction. As you can see, the gas key has been properly staked, the gas rings are tight, and the BCG itself looks fantastic. 

The AR-15 includes the following features: 
-Made in the USA by Smith and Wesson. 
-True 5.56 Nato chamber, not .223 as seen on less expensive examples. 
-Upper includes the Forward Assist, also absent on less expensive AR-15s. 
-3x9 Red/Green illuminated reticle. 
-Carbine length aluminum quad rail. 
-Used Knight's Armament Vertical Fore grip
-Properly staked BCG. 
-8 rail covers
-Two 30 Rd Magazines. 
-One 20 Rd box of Brass cased ammunition. 

If you have been shopping for a quality AR-15, you can tell I am not gouging at this price; the two magazines alone should raise my asking price significantly and Bolt Carrier Groups are still over $300. 

 I am hoping to sell as soon as possible. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you would like to make an offer. Not interested in trades at this time. I am located in Harrogate but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance Wednesday or Thursday evening.

Before you pay $1500 for a DMPS, Bushmaster, S&W Sporter or a plastic Windham Arms AR please consider this is a Sig and it is a piston system. It's worth a lot more.

I love this thing but its my only gun in 40 and with the way things are going I'd like to consolidate. I was supposed to give this to my brother a while back but bought him a snubby instead.

Gun comes with 4 mags, box, and around 200 rds of ammo. Some target some SD. Gun has about 1k rds through her and is in great condition. Accurate as hell!!!

I'm valuing the gun at 400 and the extra mags/ammo at another 100---500 total.  I'm pretty sure that's fair with no raping. 

If you have something worth clearly more than my gun I can also make up the difference in 7.62 NATO, 7.62, 9mm or cash.

Transfer to be done at MSP (Rockville preferred but not required) I will not be driving to OC or Garrett County, just an FYI.

Trades include:
Star model B in good condition + cash
p38 + cash (No Nazi marks please....shooters only)
Nice snubby 38 (depending on model +/- cash)
Wheel guns in general (decent wheel guns)
VZ58 (cash on my end)
Any 9mm pistol that isn't a POS will be entertained.
Well heck Anything 9mm will be entertained (2 include pistol carbines)
Some pocket pistols not in 9mm will be entertained


WHAT I DON'T WANT:
Your 700 dollar AR Lower
Your 200 rds of 7.62 for 900 bucks
Anything you try to price inflate 
Nothing accessory related.
No shotguns at this time
Oh lastly no glocks. I can get them cheap BNIB and don't want to insult you.

The FN ammo is new factory fresh. From my FN distributor - the EARLIEST civilians will see the next batch of ammo is May/June - and that if if you can get some. Military and LE are taking it all. The 5.56 is Lake City surplus. 

I have determined the following prices based on GB (leading online auction site) auction prices. My prices are below the average closing price. This ammo will be for sale locally for 3-4 days, and if not gone, will sell on GB for these prices. Search for these rounds and watch what a few auctions go for or look at the buy it now prices.

I am in the Plainfield/Naperville area. FTF is preferable. Illinois sales will only be to a FOID holder. I will ship this ammo - buyer pays actual UPS and ORM-D costs to ship. Will only ship to legal states.

450,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1107450,For Sale:  Stop Senate Bill 5737,"Washington, Washington, United States","$ 10,000,000","Listed On: Tuesday, February 19, 2013",Rifles,Colt                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a bill to ban what our representatives in Olympia consider ""assault weapons"". Originally, the wording  of Senate Bill 5737 included an annual inspection at your home: 

“In order to continue to possess an assault weapon that was legally possessed on the effective date of this section, the person possessing shall ... safely and securely store the assault weapon. The sheriff of the county may, no more than once per year, conduct an inspection to ensure compliance with this subsection.”

http://www.thehighroad.org/showthread.php?t=703933

Meaning the police would have the right to come in to your home an inspect your assault rifle to make sure you were complying with their law.

However, it seems the offending paragraph has been removed and the bill now seeks to completely outlaw simultaneous possession of semiautomatic rifle (even a pump action rifle!), pistols and shotguns ""capable of accepting a detachable magazine"" AND ""any magazine capable of use with that firearm that contains more than ten rounds of ammunition"" at the same time.

Read paragraph (2) and decide for yourself:

""NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 9.41 RCW
 to read as follows:

(1) No person in this state shall manufacture, possess, purchase,
 sell, or otherwise transfer any assault weapon, or any assault weapon
conversion kit, except as authorized by subsection (3) of this section.
Any assault weapon or assault weapon conversion kit the manufacture,
possession, purchase, sale, or other transfer of which is prohibited
under this section is a public nuisance.
(2) No person in this state shall possess or have under his or her
control at one time both of the following:
(a) A semiautomatic or pump-action rifle, semiautomatic pistol, or
shotgun capable of accepting a detachable magazine; and
 (b) Any magazine capable of use with that firearm that contains
more than ten rounds of ammunition.
(3) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to any of the
following:
(a) The possession of an unloaded assault weapon for the purpose of
permanently relinquishing it to a law enforcement agency in this state. (SB 5737 p. 6)

Apparently, this combination of a semiautomatic (or pump action) firearm (rifle, pistol or shotgun) and a magazine of more than 10 rounds constitutes an ""assault rifle"", and is therefore bad.

Also, while the bill says it is OK to carry what they apparently consider ""assault weapons"" to and from a ""licensed, lawfully operated shooting range"" or target shooting event, it makes no mention of carrying and using such rifles and pistols during a hunting trip. By default, that seems to be illegal.

One of the more prominent ones is the steyr aug. This is the msar remake of that same classic weapon. It shoots 5.56 rounds just as accurate as any AR15 except it has more maneuverability, and less weight because the barrel and whole assembly is pushed back into the butt of the gun. This shortens the gun while keeping the barrel length, power, and accuracy. You can hit something 400 yards away no problem while still carrying it around corners not worrying about bumping it on everything. Awesome design. Shoots as good, if not better than styr, and it comes with a scope and a led light/laser combo on the side rail. I will take trades or cash offers. Don't ask me how much, or ask what i want to trade for. Make offers! I prefer things unique."

I have numerous other magazines that I know are pre-ban because I bought them before 1994. Why am I not offering them for sale? They are not date stamped and the DA in your local NY jurisdiction is not going to take my word for it, that's why. Don't prove your mags are pre-ban (or wind up proving they aren't) with a $50,000 legal bill to beat a class D felony for possessing illegal ""Large capacity ammunition feeding devices"".

New York state law:

 TITLE P--OFFENSES AGAINST PUBLIC SAFETY
ARTICLE 265 --FIREARMS AND OTHER DANGEROUS WEAPONS 23

provides the following definition:

""23. Large capacity ammunition feeding device"" means a magazine, belt, drum, feed strip, or similar device, manufactured after September thirteenth, nineteen hundred ninety-four, that has a capacity of, or that can be readily restored or converted to accept, more than ten rounds of ammunition; provided, however, that such term does not include an attached tubular device designed to accept, and capable of operating only with, .22 caliber rimfire ammunition.""Section 265.02 Criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree

Section 265.02 of the same chapter states:

""
 A person is guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree when:

(1) Such person commits the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree as defined in subdivision one, two, three or five of section 265.01, and has been previously convicted of any crime; or

(2) Such person possesses any explosive or incendiary bomb, bombshell, firearm silencer, machine-gun or any other firearm or weapon simulating a machine-gun and which is adaptable for such use; or

(3) Such person knowingly possesses a machine-gun, firearm, rifle or shotgun which has been defaced for the purpose of concealment or prevention of the detection of a crime or misrepresenting the identity of such machine-gun, firearm, rifle or shotgun; or

(4) Such person possesses any loaded firearm. Such possession shall not, except as provided in subdivision one or seven, constitute a violation of this section if such possession takes place in such person's home or place of business; or

(5) (i) Such person possesses three or more firearms; or (ii) such person possesses a firearm and has been previously convicted of a felony or a class A misdemeanor defined in this chapter within the five years immediately preceding the commission of the offense and such possession did not take place in the person's home or place of business; or

(6) Such person knowingly possesses any disguised gun; or

(7) Such person possesses an assault weapon; or

(8) Such person possesses a large capacity ammunition feeding device.

Criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree is a class D felony.

""

Note the fact that magazines manufactured before 9/13/1994 are not ""Large capacity ammunition feeding devices"" under the current law, and yes, that's right, a magazine made after 9/13/1994 is a ""weapon"" and possession is a felony. Don't blame me I'm not the drooling idiot that comes up with this stuff. Look to your legislature for that and we can all look to congress.

Finish on 9 of them is factory grey and shows the sort of wear normal for a 20+ year old magazine. One has been refinished with a black paint. I don't know what, I bought it that way and it does not effect function.

Only form of payment accepted is money order. Nothing else. Item(s) ship free when payment clears. I have a long standing well rated ebay account through which I can be contacted to verify that I am legitimate and ship what I sell. Items will be considered sold pending funds when tracking number is provided for payment and tracking number has been verified to my satisfaction that payment is on the way. Inquire by email. Price is $125.00 each or $1000.00 for all. Free shipping with free insurance. Yes, they are expensive. I will be using the money to buy vastly overpriced and hard to find magazines of my own ahead of the possible national ban, and possibly some vastly overpriced $1 a round .308 ammunition since my plan to get into reloading has been thwarted by the fact that every reloading press in the USA is sold out, so if it makes you feel any better I'm getting screwed by the politicians too. But hey, they are safe behind their sub machine gun toting security details so I guess that's the main thing  for them. 

No Sales to NYC or other locales where prohibited by law."

Still has the decock mechanism on top, the orange dot hammer in the back, super comfortable grip, and the double action trigger as the P99. The only difference is the slide is no longer polymer but stainless steel. It kicks a lot less than the P99 being that it's weighted better and not entirely polymer, so much better control, and it is still very accurate along with the power of a 40s&w.
