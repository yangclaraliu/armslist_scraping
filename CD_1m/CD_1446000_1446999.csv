I have owned this pistol since it was new, and have only used it for hunting. It has seen very little range time apart from sighting in prior to the opener. I would conservatively say, I have less than 200 rounds thru it, and that is probably a bit high. I carried it for a few seasons, and managed to take two deer with the gun, before switching to a TC contender for my pistol hunting.  I looked it over and can only find one little mark on the backstrap were I must have bumped into something while holstered, it's small. The gun has since been kept in my safe until today for the pictures. Selling because I just don't shoot it anymore, and plan on putting the money to use elsewhere.. Email me if you have questions. NO TRADES!"

Ultramax ammunition represents serious quality for serious shooters. Since 1986 Ultramax has provided top of the line ammunition with a reputation for accuracy, round after round at an unequaled value. All Ultramax ammunition is loaded to SAAMI specs and a visual inspection is performed on every loaded cartridge before it leaves the building.

All Ultramax remanufactured ammunition goes through a 10-Step Quality Assurance System. Once fired brass is inspected for flaws and is washed to clear the primer pockets and flash holes from any debris. Ultramax sizes each piece of brass to the same SAAMI specs as new brass. Remanufactured ammunition is often loaded with mixed head stamped brass. This ammunition is non-corrosive in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

Key features include: Adjustable shoulder straps and RWO side adjustable straps with quick release buckles.
Accepts standard 10"" x 12"" armor (included).

Plate Details
Brand New, Level III Armor Plates ! Both plates are CURVED! These plates are cut from 1/4"" Certified Level III Mil-Spec MIL-A46100 Armor Plate.  Yes....this is the exact same material that our Military purchases to armor tanks, personnel carriers and Humvees! 
One 10x12 plate will have a Left Hand Comfort Cut and one 10x12 plate will have a Right Hand Comfort Cut. This way, you can set your plate carrier up for either RH or LH use by either putting the RH plate in front, and the LH plate in the back (which will put the Comfort Cut of the back plate on the RH side!) or the LH plate in front and the RH plate in back, putting both Comfort Cuts on the LH side.  Both plates have had all edges and corners rounded so they don't cut away at your plate carrier, and both plates have been Powdercoated to prevent rust and corrosion.

These are Stand-Alone plates cut from Certified Level III Mil-Spec MIL-A46100 Armor Plate!....which has been tested to Military Specs and been proven on the battlefield, over and over.

This is NOT AR500.

This is the best of the best armor plate that you can buy.  Each and every sheet of material is Brinell tested at 2 corners to assure quality and hardness and comes with the certificates pictured.  You will not find another set of armor plates on Ebay with all of these features!   And after you purchase them, you won't have to spend an afternoon cleaning, sanding, grinding and de-greasing them and purchasing paint and finding a place and a way to get them painted!

As you can see from the photo, the plate was tested against 5.56 62gr JHP @ 35yrds, 5.56 Steel-core ""Penetrator"" rounds @ 35yrds, 5.56 55gr FMJ @35yrds, .223 55gr JHP @35yrds and 12ga 1.25oz Mangum slug @ 15yrds. These plates are multi-hit capable (as you can see from the test plate!).  As you can see from the DOD test sheet in the photos above, the Department of the Army Ballistic Test Certificate shows the test results of this material with ""CAL30APM2"" projectiles (a .30 cal/7.62 caliber Armor Piercing bullet) with the velocity listed and ""pass"" test result.  Yes, this stuff is the real deal!  They are cut on a CNC Plasma Water Table to keep the plate cool during cutting. As you can see from the test plate, it has been hit with a 5.56 round right at the very bottom edge of the plate, confiriming that the strength of the plate's edge has not been compromised.  You are not going to get any closer to the edge of the plate than this!! 

The 10x12 plates each weigh in at 7.59 lbs."

The Trijicon ACOG ECOS is the ultimate sight for both Close Quarter battle (CQB) situations and longer distance shooting where accuracy and pinpoint bullet placement are required. Trijicon is the first to market with its unique dark earth brown color, a definite factor to concealment- directly contributing to the safety of the operator, who is often in harm’s way. This dual-sighting system gives the shooter a distinct tactical advantage with the option of either the Trijicon ACOG or the RMR Sight. With the quick target acquisition of the RMR Sight or the precise aiming capabilities provided by the magnified 4 power Trijicon ACOG- the shooter has the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand- truly the best of both worlds. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the ECOS also features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.

This is a Ruger Mini 14 chambered in .223. It is in excellent condition and has only had 300 rounds through it with no problems. It is a great gun, but have decided to go a different route and it needs to go. The Mini 14 currently has an aftermarket Blued Butler Creek Folding Stock, but also comes with the Original Wood Stock. It comes with the original 5 round magazine and a 30 round magazine. It comes with a new Master Lock, sling, and 100 rounds of Wolf .223 Rem 55GR Copper Hollow Point Steel Case Non-Corrosive Boxer Primed Ammo. I also have some Brand New Ruger Sight/Scope Rings that I will add in as well as another 30 round magazine if the full price is paid.
