ammo - Open bulk ammo available for $0.08 a round, I have to know PRIOR to the sale. Basically the left over 525 box I shot with the 75c.

It's made in Russia, a country with a long history of ammunition production.
This ammo has a non-reloadable steel case with a polymer coating. The primary reason for the coating is to keep the steel case from rusting over time. It also helps with feeding and extraction, because it reduces friction. As an added bonus, it's non-toxic. The bullet is a bimetal jacket over a lead core, meaning that the jacket is made up of compressed layers of copper and mild steel. It's not hard enough to harm the steel of your rifle's barrel, which is much harder. Plus, this is the same type of jacket used by the Russian military for the ammunition they use. However, it will attract a magnet, so you should check with your local range to see if they allow this ammunition.
At the range, the Polyformance ammo functioned perfectly in AKs and SKSs. It was decently accurate and also loaded to a consistent and pretty high velocity. You're not buying this because you want to get the best ammo you possibly can, you're looking for the best ammo for a low price, and that's what you get with Wolf Polyformance."

The trigger pull is remarkable, and absolutely everything has been hand tuned by the factory. I shoots incredibly well, is absolutely reliable and is very clean. All flaws you can see in the pictures and are only from being holstered. It is all original...with great markings and the screws have never been turned! It comes with the original box, manuals, “Colt” sight adjustment screwdriver, etc. What you see in the pictures is exactly what you get. This is truly a one of a kind revolver and is absolutely the best of the best. Just FYI… In 1979, as a young man, I worked at Stanley Andrews Sports Outfitters in San Diego in the Gun Department. At that time Stanley Andrews Sports Outfitters was THE Premier sporting goods store and included absolutely everything from firearms to fly fishing to snow and water skis to mountaineering…you name it. I ordered this revolver from Pacific International in Sacramento who at that time was THE premier Colt distributor in California and who seemed to get all the “goodies” coming out of Colts. As you can see in the pictures, the outer brown box has a “Pacific International” shipping label to Stanley Andrews warehouse. The orange label shows the revolver being shipped from the Stanley Andrews warehouse to “Store #1” which was our downtown flagship store where I worked at 840 “B” Street. This isn’t just a Colt Python. It is a truly one of a kind item that you will probably never see offered again with a real history. I have never seen another Python like this offered at any price"

Colorado Freedom Shoot
Join us in making a statement and come enjoy the Colorado Freedom Shoot being hosted at one of Colorado’s largest Public Shooting Ranges:  
        Pawnee Sportsmen’s Center:  40914 County Rd. 71, Briggsdale, CO. 80611

This may be the last of high capacity competitions in the State of Colorado where good law abiding citizens get to enjoy the freedoms afforded us in the United States of America before High Capacity Magazine laws take effect 1st of July.  Some Colorado politicians have forsaken our nation’s values, sold themselves to out-of-state interests, and caved to party agenda while ignoring the good people of Colorado, sending jobs, revenues, and manufacturers to other states.  An arbitrary number of rounds to be held in a magazine was plucked out of the air in a feel good measure “to do something” while ignoring real solutions to public safety for you & I and all other Colorado Residents.  Make this last stand with fellow men & women and come “Get Some” at the Colorado Freedom Shoot.

From my gun log book:  ""17NOV2012, 0930, SP&G Indoor Range.  All rounds fired at 25 yards, no optics. 100 rounds of Tulammo 55 grain FMJ plus 20 rounds of Bear 62 grain HP (all steel and mixed in mags) fired, four magazines of 30, two five point man targets, two mags at each target first 30 at center of mass and second 30 at the head. Magazine 1, round 1. The shot was so smooth that I thought there was a failure to eject. I removed the mag and racked the bolt, out came a full round.  Loaded the round back in and continued to fire.  Brought the target back after the first 30 and all rounds were in the 5 point center circle.  Sent the target back down and sent 30 to the head.  29 in the 5 point area and one miss, firing as fast as I could pull the trigger.  Second target:  Mag 1, 30 as fast as I could shoot at the center of mass.  Mag 2, 30 as fast as could shoot at the head.  All 60 rounds in the 5 point area!  Tighter groups than the first 60!  No muzzle flash, minimal recoil, fast target acquisition, and NO misfires or failures of any sort.  Cleaned gun; disassembly, cleaning, and assembly very easy."

Only had one 20rd box of ammo shot through it. No wear marks or scratches on it. Practically brand new.



The GLOCK 30 in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing in a .45 caliber pistol. With all of these advantages, especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30 is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the US.



The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.



GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.



This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case.

Cylinder lock-ups are tight, and the perfect timing of the actions make for handguns that put shots where you want them. Machined barrels are microthreaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red-dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. Proudly made in the USA, all Heritage revolvers combine quality with affordability.

Specifications include:

 Available in a full-length 5” barreled version and a 4” carry model, the Fastback’s smooth grip lines won’t 
 protrude against cover garments or push into the ribs when carried concealed. 

 The all-stainless-steel Fastback frame has been reengineered from the ground up to reduce its grip 
 signature, while still maintaining the same feel and control of the original 1911 platform. 
 Initial offerings include the 1911 Fastback Nightmare, using natural stainless controls, grip screws and 
 barrel bushing against the deep black of the durable Nitron® finish. The look is finished off with Hogue® 
double diamond black G-10 grips and low-profile SIGLITE® Night Sights. 

 Unchanged 1911 features include the match-grade sear, barrel and trigger components for which SIG 
 SAUER 1911s are known. A skeletonized hammer and trigger with an overtravel adjustment screw are 
 also left in natural stainless. 

This is a cash only sale and I will ship at the buyer's expense. I prefer face to face with another PA resident, however, I will ship out of state. Buyer is responsible to know local laws.

Let's talk. Let me know what you have.


Due to a couple of unhappy and rude people, I feel compelled to address a couple of questions.

tl/dr - Some of these rifles suck because of shoddy building, not because of parts defects or quality.

There is a lot of bad information regarding the quality of the rifle, usually from people who had the misfortune of owning a not so good build. 

The truth, as is typical of the Internet, lies somewhere in the middle between the Manufacturer's claims and the unhappy claims of the unsatisfied.

The Cetme came before the HK G3, designed by a German. The original, or Model A, had a cast steel receiver, that was quickly replaced for a stamped steel one, to cut costs. 3 years later the Model B was produced, with modifications to the recoil and trigger groups. 
The Model B is what the HK G3 is based on, the primary differences being a shorter bolt, changes to the bolt locking mechanism and a stamped, aluminum (yes, aluminum) alloy receiver. You buy an original HK from Germany and you get a stamped aluminum receiver.
The Model B was superseded by the Model C, with further changes to the bolt, flash suppressor and trigger group and replacement of the wood grip with a composite one. The vast majority of Cetme parts kits are Model C. The last model, the Model D, saw improvements to the feed mechanism and changes that were more manufacturing efficient.
So, other than a the early Model A, the Cetme, and the G3, have never had Cast receivers. And aluminum is acceptable receiver material, as almost all the pressures on the rifle are in the barrel.
The Hesse receivers get a lot of criticism. Century used Hesse receivers for their G3 and Cetme builds, for the first 2-3 years of production, before switching over to their own receiver. Though some are built with Hesse aluminum receivers, the vast majority are steel.

The quality of the Hesse receivers is actually better than the Century ones. Hesse primary failing being in finishing, not in specification. 

And most of the problems with the Century builds relate to the actual build manufacturing, for both the Hesse and Century receivers. 

A critical component of the build is the so-call head spacing issue. The rifle design incorporates a trunion, which is press fitted in to the receiver end. The trunion holds the barrel, also press fitted, to the end of the receiver. Proper Head spacing is achieved by both proper alignment and placement of the trunion in the receiver and proper placement of the barrel in the trunion.
The specifications for head space on the G3 and Cetme are actually quite wide, considering, with better performance, the closer you are to the center of that tolerance range. 
And since head spacing determines where the bolt (and the cartridge) end up in relation the chamber, bad head spacing can effect every aspect of the rifle's firing cycle from stripping and feeding a cartridge, to casing extraction and ejection.

The manufacturing process requires the trunion be fitted correctly and then welded to the receiver. The barrel is then inserted and spaced for proper head gap, then it is locked in place by a lock pin. This is a very simple process for the original manufacturers, who have machines designed to perform exactly these tasks on this particular design. 
It is a tedious and labor consuming task for a builder, without this automation.

Which brings us to the build issues. Century cut costs and time in builds by inserting and pinning the barrels in to the trunion and then press fitting both barrel and trunion together, in to the receiver. While faster, it doesn't ensure appropriate and consistent headspacing for every rifle. Nor does it protect the integrity of the receiver

Add to this, that Century has also, when encountering inventory shortages, substituted Model B components within a Model C kit and had also been known to grind down the longer Cetme bolt to fix some seating and locking problems.

It becomes easy to see why some builds are voracious little tack drivers that eat whatever you feed them and others can't fire 3 rounds without a problem."
