This gun is very customize-able. It has a 20 in barrel to help with accuracy and helps the barrel not get hot as fast so you can use it for a longer period of time. With this gun some of the cool features you could get upgraded are: you can replace the stock to get an adjustable one, you could take of the iron sights and get a nice red dot or a scope,change out the trigger and trigger guard for a better feel, get a new grip. Personally i would change the grip and stock on it so i could get a btter more comfortable feel. The armalite AR-15 is a great gun with the ability to be upgraded to your specifications or just be left how it isw and you will be getting a reliable and accurate firearm.

I got this in a trade recently with a rifle, it's like new, comes with the case/warranty card, thumbscrew mount and hex key mount. My astimagtism makes red dots seem like they're fuzzy, so I'm looking to sell or trade this.  This model has the dual dot reticle as pictured,  


From Eotech's site:
XPS2

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.

■Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
■Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space 
■Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
■Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours
■The XPS2 is not Night Vision compatible, for Night Vision compatibility see the XPS3 sights.

According to my research it was one of the LAST M1 Garands made during WW2 production made sometimes between August and September of 1945. Its a CMP rifle and the condition is OUTSTANDING. The barrel measures LESS THAN ZERO on my CMP gauge so it's essentially NEW. Basically it was probably rebarreled for Korea and NEVER used. Rifle was a CMP Service Grade.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

280,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1890280,For Sale:  Ammo at NORMAL prices.,"Downtown, Northern Lower Peninsula, Michigan",$ 10,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 17, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"First, start flagging these gougers on here as a scam because that is what they are.

If you are trying to find ammo at normal prices, it is not that hard.  I have been having the best luck for ammo at Walmart.  In the past week I have used the following method to buy 3,000 rounds of .22lr for $140.  First, call you local Walmart and find out  what time they are usually putting out their trucks.  Go to ammo-can.net  (site has been running really slow the last week) about two hours before that time and search by state and caliber for what you are looking for, check the box that says ""include out of stock items"". Scroll through the list until you find the store you want to check and click on ""force check"".  This will check inventory for that store for all calibers.  It will show in stock about 2 hours before they put it on the shelf.  You may have to get there early and wait in line.  You may also want to ask your local store if they usually have a line waiting and what time people get there to wait.  My local store in Traverse City gets their trucks around 4pm and the stock goes on the shelves around 6pm.  Ammo-can.net will show in stock for my store between 4-5.  I have been able to get more ammo than I need doing this and haven't paid over retail yet.  If you look at most of the ammo on here, it is from Walmart, this is what these scammers are doing and reselling to you at a 100% profit.

Also, freedommunitions.com has most calibers in stock(no .22lr).  Go to their website and click on the link ""in stock now"" on the left.  Earlier they had 9, 40, 45, 38, 380, 223 etc.

Gunbot.net is another useful tool.  They have been showing .22lr available from 7 cents per round on up today.  Still not the best deal but better than armslist.com gougers."

Selling a WASR-3 Romanian AK chambered in 5.56x45 (also shoots .223).  Has about 100 rounds through it, and it functions and shoots great.  Has the typical handling marks of a WASR, so the finish isn’t pretty, but is serviceable.  Internals are all clean, solid, and look great.  Front sight cant is hardly worth mentioning, as it’s difficult to notice.  This is a great shooter for an AK.

It has an ATI Strikeforce rear adjustable folding stock and grip, a UTI tactical fore-end with covers, two 30 round metal magazines, and an uninstalled pin-on NcStar muzzle brake.  Also including a Bulldog soft sided case.

Looking to sell altogether for $750 OBO.  Will entertain all realistic offers.  Would prefer to sell for cash, but willing to trade for something(s) interesting (will take cash and/or ammo to even the trade if necessary).  Wouldn’t mind a nice Ruger .22LR semi-auto pistol, M&P 45, or a nice rifle.  Let me know what you have and we may work something out.

Willing to travel a reasonable distance to meet.  Will not ship.  Must have valid PA driver’s license/state ID, be 18+, and sign bill of sale.  LTCF preferred.  If you’d prefer to go through an FFL, buyer will be responsible for the transfer fee.

I am seeking to trade this scope for other firearms or cash. Listed below is the manufactures specifications of the scope:

Designed to exceed the performance requirements of even the most experienced hunters and shooters, the Conquest MC Riflescope (Hunting Turrets and Z-Plex Reticle, 4.5-14X50) from Carl Zeiss is a high-end, top quality optics-driven riflescope that's loaded with features to ensure quick and precise sighting in. The robust design of the anodized, one-piece tubular body in enables the Conquest riflescope to withstand rigorous use in a variety of terrains. And the advanced Z-Plex Reticle technology allows for maximum adjustment accuracy based on independent windage and elevation adjustment capabilities. 
Combining advanced technology with rigged durability and accuracy, the Conquest MC Riflescope features Zeiss' proprietary MC anti-reflective lens coating. This advanced coating technology dramatically enhances light transmission by limiting the amount of stray light that occurs as a result of light striking an air-to-glass and delivering more available light to the user's eye. When combined with a matte black finish on interior surfaces, this results in an image that is rich in contrast and color fidelity. The nitrogen-filled lenses are sealed with O-rings and designed to meet specific waterproof specifications which guarantee that the scope will not fog or leak, even in inclement weather.

You've been asking for a couple +P 45 AUTO RIM loads for a long time, so by popular demand, here they are. Both loads are using high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated a flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the equivalent of +P+ 45 ACP ammo or as it is also known, 45 Super. These are very stout loads, but will not harm modern 45 ACP revolvers, nor will these loads harm any post war 45 ACP revolvers. Feel free to safely shoot these loads in any post war 45 ACP revolver that is in normal good operating condition.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch Mt. Gun gives speeds almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 and 6.5 inch barrels. This is NOT a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel. Also, we are aware that the 1937 manufactured model 1917 we used as a test gun, (see below velocity chart) is not post war.

Item # 32A - 255gr. hard cast flat nose bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 1031 FPS
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 945 FPS
S&W model 1917 (1937 Production) 5.5 inch bbl = 1043 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 1070 FPS

Item # 32A - was designed for deep penetration with no bullet expansion.

471,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1890471,For Sale:  SureFire SOCOM762-MINI Suppressor (Silencer) **instock**,"Lawndale, North Carolina, United States","$ 1,399","Listed On: Tuesday, August 20, 2013",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Specifications
Caliber 7.62 mm (.308 caliber) 
Length 6.2 inches 
Weight 17.0 ounces 
Diameter 1.5 inches 

Description
SOCOM762-MINI
The SureFire SOCOM762-MINI Fast-Attach® suppressor is optimized for use with 7.62x39 and 7.62x35 caliber rifles and will also adequately suppress 7.62x51 NATO caliber rifles with a barrel length of 16 inches or longer. It features the same revolutionary suppressor technology as the SureFire SOCOM762-RC, the most advanced suppressor ever made, which was recently selected by US Special Operations Command as first among all competitors in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor evaluation in history. 

Just over 6 inches in overall length, the SOCOM762-MINI is 2.2 inches shorter and 2.5 ounces lighter than the SOCOM762-RC. It includes advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. The patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvement in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a true technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree. 

A new indexing system means this suppressor mounts to a SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous models and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area. 

Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM762-MINI produces minimal, consistent shift in point of impact compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles. 

The SOCOM762-MINI is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach® lock ring and Cerakote™ ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color. 

All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm—see Parts and Accessories on this page. 

SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction™ (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use. 

All SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots. 

NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brake/suppressor adapters, and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous generation SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders. 


Features 
•Patented Fast-Attach®design provides rock-solid attachment and easy removal in seconds
•Optimized for 7.62 x 39 and 7.62 x 35 rifles, will also significantly reduce signature on 7.62x51 NATO rifles with barrel lengths of 16” or longer
•Same revolutionary suppressor technology as SureFire’s SOCOM762-RC, winner of US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) extensive and rigorous suppressor trials
•Provides effective attenuation of sound and dust signatures
•Minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with unsuppressed weapon regardless of number of attach-detach cycles
•Compact and lightweight for minimum overall weapon length and minimum impact on handling characteristics
•Advanced core design to reduce back pressure, cyclic rate, and gas blowback
•Patent-pending front-plate design and proprietary gas-flow improvements virtually eliminate first-round flash
•Integrated blast shield increases durability
•Constructed of advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and stainless steel
•Redundant-welded subcomponents eliminate parts loosening

Tanfoglio pistols are manufactured by Fratelli Tanfoglio SpA. company, Italy. Basically, Force and Force 99 models are polymer frame versions of the Tanfoglio T95 Combat models, that, in turn, are clones of the famous CZ-75 design. The Force model was introduced in 1997, while the Force 99 model appeared two years later, in 1999.

Tanfoglio Force and Force 99 pistols are similar in design except for the new, redesigned frame of the Force 99. Both pistols are blowback operated, locked breech semi-auto pistols, that use browning hi-power style linkless system. Both models feature DA triggers with slide mounted safety / decock levers as well as internal firing pin block safety. New slide with slide-mounted safety/decocker lever (similar to T95 ) is available for Force 99 as a factory option. Both have fixed sights with three dots for increased visibility.

Tanfoglio polymer framed Force pistols are popular defensive and sporting firearms across the Europe. They also are imported into USA by EAA Corp. under the name ""Witness Polymer"" (Force) and ""Witness Polymer P"" (Force 99).

All other students will be required to pay the day of class, providing that there are spots available.

The lusterous blueing on the slide, barrel and other hard parts is nicely contrasted by the lovely walnut stocks with the carved S&W and Gunsite Raven logo's which is echoed in the Raven engraving on the receiver. The frame is made from Scandium. The sights are Novak low rise and make for a smooth, no snag draw from a holster (no front gold bead). The barrel is 4 1/4"" with a match grade barrel bushing. The trigger is adjustable. The gun comes in the factory lockable protective case with the original manual, barrel wrench, 2 S&W OEM ACT made, 8 round magazines and sealed packet containing the sample factory fired casing. 

I am the original owner and have fired this very accurate pistol less than 100 rounds of Federal and RP 45 ACP hardball. The earlier manufactured pistols like this one (SN FSP 0798) were completely hand fitted for maximum accuracy and reliability. The gun is in completely stock, unmodified condition since new. I will offer approximately 2 and 1/2 boxes of new RP (2 boxes of 50 rounds 230gr RN, approximately 1/2 box of Federal 230gr RN) to the buyer at my cost from about a year ago.

I play by the rules. For sale face to face only to bonafide Arkansas resident with proof of Ar residency, otherwise it has to go through (or sale to) an FFL. 

I also believe in describing an item accurately. Feel free to check my feedback on ebay (handle- achildofthesky )I am an individual (no sales tax!) and not a dealer or business and because of this, the gun is sold with out warranties of any type on my part and all sales are final. That said, if you have been looking for a truely nice example of these accurate and finely assembled and increasingly hard to find pistols you will not be dissapointed with this one. I have a couple of other high quality collectable guns I will be selling to help generate funds for a home purchase. 

Please note this offer expires on Friday evening as I am moving. Please, no ""tire kickers, Lookie Lou's or time wasters"", I am selling a exrtemely high quality,hand fitted handgun at a very attractive price. Not looking for trades unless you have a no lock S&W 340M&P 357 magnum scandium. You will NEVER see another one in this area. Don't miss out. Regret sucks!

This gun has been fired less than 3 boxes of ammo since new and still has that ""new gun"" feel to it with the action a nice snug feel to it. I do not have the original box for it. I can offer the buyer the option to purchase at my cost from a couple years ago, 2-3 boxes of ammo (Hornady leverevolution, Remington, perhaps others, Ihave to see what I have).

This is the increasingly difficult to find original, made only from 2002-2004 (made in limited numbers) Connecticut made JM 336Y Spikehorn with 16 1/4"" trapper length barrel and a 1 inch shorter length of pull stock that is perfect for smaller stature shooters but also makes it a fine choice for all that appreciate a handy handling, all around rifle. 

The lusterous blueing on the receiver, barrel and other hard parts is nicely contrasted by the lovely walnut stocks. The exceptionally nice smooth, pistol grip buttstock and fore end are made from genuine deep and rich walnut (not some mystery wood or laminate like the horrid REMLIN rifles currently on sale) in excellent condition and the rifle wears the OEM factory recoil pad. The receiver is factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts. I will offer a buyer the option of a quality scope mount installed in place of the WGRS peep sight should they so desire. 

The sights are a Williams WGRS in the rear (windage and elevation adjustable peep sight with screw in aperture) and the appropriate height Williams Fire Sight front sight and also the factory rear sight is in place which is adjustable for windage and elevation of course. This would make a truely great fast handling deer & bear rifle for the woods hunter and also a fine first rifle for young hunters. 

Please, no ""lookie lou's, tire kickers or time wasters"". If you are looking for a QUALITY Marlin 336Y here it is, If you want a cheaply built and poorly manufactured, gritty actioned atrociously fitted ""Remlin"" complete with crappy wood, then go to walmart and regret at your leisure...

About:
Diamond’s new IceMan FLX is the flagship in a six bow lineup. Of the six rigs, the IceMan is the only model to feature BowTech’s Center Pivot Technology and is one of two that use the new FLX Guard cable containment system. There are four, single-cam adult bows, one short draw bow and a youth model. The group features a wide range of axle-to-axle lengths, grip styles and limb angles. Other notable IceMan FLX features include a rotating module for easy draw-length adjustments, quiet InVelvet finish, stainless steel stabilizer-mounting insert and a String Stop.

FLX Tech
The 2010 IceMan FLX gets the last part of its name from the company’s new cable containment technology. Diamond’s FLX Guard uses a small, limb-like piece of material to attach a set of rollers to the riser. The material is like a bow limb in that it flexes during the draw cycle and shot. There is even a small limb pocket type fixture seated into a shallow cutout in the riser lined with a material that serves as the pivot point for the mini limb component, which we will call the FLX Limb for discussion purposes. The FLX Limb flexes toward the centerline of the bow during the draw cycle and then springs back into position and out of the way of the arrow when the string is released. Reaching back toward the shooter from where it is attached to the outside of the sight window, the FLX Limb curves inward toward the centerline of the bow. At the end closest to the shooter there is a fixture and set of two rollers attached with two small screws. When the FLX Guard moves toward the centerline of the bow, torque and tension applied to the cables is much reduced compared to a typical roller guard system. Rollers, of course, also reduce friction compared to a rod and slide cable guard. Lower friction, torque and tension results in an increase in the bow’s overall efficiency.

This rifle is absolutely incredible. I've shot about 100 rounds through it with zero malfunctions. I've treated it like a baby, doing full cleanings after every 20 rounds. I made this rifle a tact driver. Shoots Sub MOA at 100 yrds. I will include the original stock in the purchase, as well as a high quality hard rifle case. This rifle is about as tactical and cool as they come. I have put in about $1500 into this gun over the past summer. Its just a year old. No rust or dings at all. The rifle is a bit heavy, making it an ideal bench rest shooter. I will also include 40 rounds of Winchester white box ammo, and about 10 rounds of Horandy Match Grade ammo. I am willing to negotiate somewhat on the price, and am willing to accept trades. Thank you."

The PMAG 10 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower for reliable feeding, and an easy to disassemble flared floorplate to aid extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit.

Factory Fresh! New in box!

As mentioned in title, we have this rifle in ODGreen or Patriot Brown. These will go fast so hurry!

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour  16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications.

New for 2012, we are offering the 16” R.E.P.R. with a spiral fluted barrel. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

Comes with everything that the factory provided. Too many 9mm's and never got around to shooting this particular gun. The M&P 9c is a little larger than my 9mm M&P Shield and is a little thinner and more concealable than a G26 or my G19.

This gun has the thumb safety and does not have the magazine dis-connect. Thumb safety is a real plus when you are inserting a loaded gun into a inner waist band holster. Insert it with safety on, and then take the safety off.

S&W provides a lifetime warranty on all of their pistols.

You can do your own professional trigger job very easily without buying any additional parts; by following a step by step video on the internet for the M&P pistols. I did the trigger job on my other two M&P pistols, and they came out fantastic. 



Sell outright for $575 or trade for comparable M&P 40 or Glock 23 Gen4.
