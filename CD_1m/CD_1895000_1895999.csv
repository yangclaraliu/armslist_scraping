The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

It is a 3rd Gen gun and comes with 2 mags that carry 15 rounds each.

I am the second owner, and I have only put 80 rounds through it. The previous owner barely shot it; I know this because when I went to clean it for the first time it still had some of the copper grease in it that Glock packs their guns with from the factory.

The only negative thing I could say about it is that the slide catch shows some wear. This is from holster wear from the previous owner carrying it.

This is your chance to get a semi-auto handgun that shoots the powerful 10mm round. The 10mm round has ballistics that trend between 357 and 41 mag. However, it shoots smooth like you'd expect from a Glock.

If you are interested my cash price is $540 OBO. I am interested in trades as well. Some guns I'd be interested in trading for, or partial trades for are: S&W 686, 44 mag revolver, AK74, GSG-522, or a Glock 35.

Feel free to make an offer or trade offer, at worst all I can say is no! Please no criminals. Must be willing to sign a bill of sale with your drivers license. CCW preferred, but not necessary.

This gun is idea when you need the firepower of a long gun but need something light weight and very compact. It can be carried/concealed in just about anything and deployed instantly. Using readily available Glock 17 mags, this carbine makes for an ideal self-defense gun that can be taken just about anywhere with ease.

The SUB-2000 has a greatly extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. This is an excellent choice for a vehicle gun, backpack gun, or anytime you might need something more than a handgun but do not have a lot of room and need something light and compact.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB 2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled without tools for cleaning or inspection.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

305,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1895305,For Sale:  in roseburg  black & decker storm station as new in box,"green, Oregon, United States",$ 50,"Listed On: Friday, October 4, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"When storm emergencies hit, it's good to have electricity, light, and a radio. It's even better to have all those things together in one place and easy to find when the lights go out. Black & Decker gives you all the emergency essentials in one handy StormStation.

How it Works
This portable unit is equipped with a weather radio, power inverter, and detachable flashlight. When the power goes out, the StormStation's ""Find Me"" light automatically turns on. Use its 25-watt inverter to power small, essential appliances, like a clock or a cordless phone to keep lines of communication open. Or charge your cell phone via the 12-volt recharging port.

Tune in news on the unit's radio.
Tune in news on the unit's radio.Listen to the built-in radio to stay informed about civil and natural emergencies--it tunes in AM, FM, TV1, TV2, and weather frequencies. Or remove the flashlight to help see in your darkened home.

All of these features run off the StormStation's 12-volt rechargeable battery. To be prepared for a power outage, keep the StormStation plugged in to an electrical outlet for a full charge."
306,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1895306,For Sale:  UNFIRED: FABRIQUE NATIONALE / FN FNC 5.56mm Rifle,"North STL County, St. Louis, Missouri","$ 3,500","Listed On: Saturday, September 14, 2013",Rifles,FN Herstal S.A.                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Here's a real find! A previously owned but unfired, nearly new FN FNC semi-auto rifle.  Manufactured by FN Herstal of Belgium, the FNC (Fabrique Nationale Carbine) is a 5.56mm assault style rifle adopted by the armed forces of Belgian, Sweden, (as the AK5) and Indonesia.

The FNC is a sound design which accumulated best features from other famous designs, such as AK-47, and Colt/Armalite M16. The FNC operates with a gas piston very much like an AK except that the FNC has a gas setting for adverse conditions such as weak ammo or the gun being very dirty. The FNC also inherited features from the AR-15, like using the same magazines, making it a good, solid, all-around assault rifle. It's also the weapon that Al Pacino used in the bank heist scene in the movie ""Heat"".

Why Buy an FN FNC?
Besides being a remarkably rugged light rifle, the FNC also gives the owner an opening into the tremendously fun LEGAL machine gun hobby! 

In the world of fully automatic rifles here in the States, there is no question that the M16 reigns supreme. The downside is that an M16 these days on average will cost the buyer around $20,000 (which could put one heck of a dent in your mortgage). However, all hope is not lost for a buyer looking for a great 5.56mm rifle that you can rock and roll with at the range. This FN FNC is a great host for an entry level machine gun project that costs less than half of what you can buy an M16 for these days.

The approved, legal conversion is done via the installation of a BATF registered auto sear. One funny thing about the FNC sears is that there are in fact more registered auto sears in the USA than there are FNC Rifles! Anyways, you can buy this semi automatic FNC, and then buy a registered sear for about $3000, so for about $6500 you can have a legal ""fun switch"" on a great little rifle!

About this FN FNC:
Is the 18"" Paratrooper version with the factory folding stock. Gun South Inc. of Birmingham Al import. Comes with (1) 30rd AR-15 magazine.
This particular rifle was purchased many years ago by a gun collector, who claims he never shot it. I am the 2nd owner. I’ve only field stripped it for inspection and oiling, and it looks factory clean. I have never shot it either. The rifle is in 97% condition, and while not appearing to be fired, was moved around quite a bit, with some handling marks, mostly on the top of the receiver. So blow up these pictures and look closely. Look above the ""Nationale"" and along the top. 

The price listed represents the cost for a highly collectible rifle, and a nice host for one of the registered auto-sears if you have the desire to own a fully automatic weapon."

The rifle is model SA9804.
The Super Match M1A™ rifle embodies the most sophisticated development in Gas Gun™ technology. Capable of sub-MOA accuracy with the proper ammunition, the Super Match is built 
for the individual who demands the very best. A truly custom gun. Springfield’s latest proprietary  development for the Super Match is the rear lugged receiver. Additional extraordinary features 
include an ultra heavy air gauged national match barrel, custom oversized op-rod guide and maximum dimension match grade stocks available in American walnut and McMillan fiberglass.

Three modifications were made to the rifle: First the front sling swivel was replaced with an aftermarket part that has a sling swivel stud for the attachment of a Harris type bi-pod. Secondly, the shiny portion of the barrel between the gas system and the flash hider/suppressor was blackened to prevent reflection. Third, the bolt release was replaced with a Smith Enterprises bolt release, but the original is included in the package. Originally this weapon was purchased in California and came with a muzzle brake since flash hiders/suppressors are illegal in California. Once I moved out of California, this part was replaced with a M1A national match flash hider/suppressor. The original CA legal muzzle brake is included in the package.

The neat thing about this vest is that you can wear it under regular clothes and it does not protrude like lesser quality body armors or the heavier Level III and up armor. This is the same vest that is issued to LE everywhere for patrol use. The armor was manufactured in mid 07', but this vest has been sealed in the wrapper, stored in a dry closet, and was NEVER used so it is like new and has had zero deterioration from use or exposure to sunlight. These vests retail for $600 new, and im asking $175 for the vest. The size of the vest is regular which is a chest size 40. This is perfect for LE, security, or citizens who feel the need for better protection from carjackers or gangsta wannabes as what we have seen going on for a while now in the springfield area, more so recently. You can contact me via email or call/text at 417-413-85zero7. Thanks and hope to hear from you soon!!

P.S. I provided you a link as to see how effective level II body armor is, rest assured if you get shot with a raven .25 or hi point 9 millameata you are going to go home without a bleeder lol.

This is a very nice pistol especially for the cost. I have a fairly large collection of pistols and this easily compares in quality to any of my match-grade 1911s or my Customized XDM. The fit and finish is excellent and the accuracy is as good as you can expect from any match-grade pistol. The trigger pull is outstanding; the single stage pull breaks clean at 3.5 lbs with a short reset. It comes with the factory locking hard case, two 15 round magazines, cleaning kit and all paperwork. I installed a Wolff 20 lb recoil spring to handle the heavy 200 grain fmj target rounds, this makes for an extremely smooth-shooting pistol, especially with 180 grain hollow point rounds. I also have a box or two of ammo to go with it. I love this pistol, really I do, but I need to get rid of the majority of my possessions before I leave for USAF basic training. I have a lot of other items that I will be posting up soon. Contact me at REDACTED and I will be happy to provide more pictures or answer any questions you may have.

Cycles 2 3/4"" 00 buck with no problems. I have personally only put a couple dozen rounds through it. Has the full-length magazine tube. Good collector's piece. Turns heads at the range...

Note: as you can see from the picture this has the original lever safety, which was later recalled by Franchi for safety reasons (you can read more about that here http://spas12.com/spassafety.htm) This particular gun never had that replacement done, however - when I have shot the gun I have just used the trigger guard safety (the M14 style one,) which has worked fine for my purposes. I have never fooled with the lever style safety for the reasons noted above."

Rifle, musket, and carbine versions of the Model 1894 were produced.

The Model 1894 was a short action chambered for the combination rifle/pistol cartridges of the day. By 1934 the demand for rifles shooting pistol cartridges had shrunk to the vanishing point, and the old Model 1894 was discontinued.

The advent of powerful magnum revolver cartridges, first the .357 Magnum and later the .44 Magnum, renewed interest in the concept, and the folks at Marlin realized that there was once again money to be made selling rifles for pistol cartridges. Rather than design a new action, they wisely put their excellent Model 1894 back into production. The new rifles came with blued rather than color cased actions and were made of superior modern steel, but otherwise were similar to the original Model 1894.

As I write these words in 2003, there are four variations of the standard Model 1894 centerfire rifles. These are the 1894PG (.44 Rem. Mag./.44 Spec.), 1894FG (.41 Rem. Mag.), 1894SS (.44 Rem. Mag/.44 Spec.), and 1894C (.357 Mag./.38 Spec.).

All of these standard Model 1894's are made with solid top receivers (drilled and tapped for scope mounts) and forged, machined steel parts. All come with genuine black walnut stocks that feature fluted combs, cut checkering and Marlin's Mar-Shield stock finish.

The Model 1894SS is similar to the 1894PG, but features a stainless steel barreled action and a straight grip stock. It is 37.5"" long and weighs 6 pounds.

The 1894C is the carbine version, only available in .357 Magnum. It comes with blued steel metal parts, a straight grip stock, and an 18.5"" barrel with a carbine type barrel band rather than a fore-end cap.

In addition to the standard Model 1894 rifles and carbines there are also special ""Cowboy"" variations. These are designed, no surprises here, primarily for the sport of cowboy action shooting. All Cowboy models come with tapered octagon, rather than round, barrels.

The standard Model 1894 Cowboy calibers are .45 Colt (24"" barrel), .357 Mag./.38 Spec. (20"" barrel), and .44 Mag./.44 Spec. (20"" barrel). In the Magnum calibers and equipped with a low power scope these make perfectly adequate short range hunting rifles.

Perhaps the biggest advantage possessed by all of the Marlin 1894 lever action rifles is their solid top receivers, which allows a telescopic sight to be mounted low and overbore using a conventional one piece base on top of the receiver. Other desirable features of the 1894 rifles include fast repeat shot capability, ambidextrous operation, and the flat action without a bolt handle sticking out of the side makes them easy to carry.

The Marlin Model 1894 is a fine rifle, accurate and reliable. Its short action, designed for pistol cartridges form the beginning, makes it the best choice among the rifles so chambered today.

One is the stock 45 factory barrel and the other is a Storm Lake 10mm conversion barrel.  I installed a Glock 10mm extractor and it works fine with no problems.  I did not change the recoil spring.  No need.  I used Federal 10mm and Buffalo Bore ammo but only fired it in the 10mm conversion to make sure everything worked.  It did and does.  I probably fired 600 rounds of 45 through it.  I will include the 45 extractor and three magazines, two 10mm, one with an extended grip,  and one 45 and the Glock case with the usual stuff.  Except for the 10mm barrel the gun is stock.  The grip tape can be removed if you wish.  The only gun I might be will to trade would be a Glock 29 or 20.  FTF cash sale prefer a CCW holder or the information need to do a simple court search.  I will not sell to a felon."

969,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1895969,For Sale/Trade:  .58 Cal Civil War Musket converted to Remington Rolling Block. VERY RARE,"Matthews, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 700,"Listed On: Saturday, September 28, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I received this rifle from the Great Grandson of a Civil War veteran who served with the Confederacy (I also got a signed letter from the Great Grand son to this effect along with his Great Grand fathers name so he may be located by Civil War historians). 

The story that has been passed down is that his Great Grandfather carried this actual gun in the Civil War and still bears the carvings of the Confederate Company he served in""A"" Company, as well as a cross for his faith.From the patina of the metal, burn marks on the stock and the fact that every mark or stamp that was ever on this rifle is totally worn off attests to the fact that rifle served this family faithfully for a long time through very rough circumstances before it was retired to family heirloom status (Great Grandson.says he has shot it though).

Since the date for a standard Remington R.B. did not match the Civil War time frame exactly my initial thoughts were that this rifle was an early production Rolling Block but I later found that the 15 to 20,000 rolling blocks issued to Union troops during the Civil War time frame were of a split breech design which this rifle is not.

I was not ready to give up though because the previous owner was 110% sure this rifle was carried by his Great Grandfather in the Civil War so a local Remington collector, who was kind enough to assist with his considerable knowledge assisted and we explored the only other option which would explain this mystery. 

After the Civil War some soldiers who survived took their original .58 caliber muskets and had them professionally converted by Remington into the fast loading and desirable Remington Rolling Blocks. By doing it this way they still retained the muskets original .58 caliber barrel ,sights, forearm and stock! It also saved them money of course. So I was instructed to get bore measurements since this would be the only way to support the family claims all these years.

When I measured the breech it initially came out to .50 cal and my heart fell, BUT after my insistence that I believed the Great Grandson did not make this up the local collector asked me to look for a sleeve that Remington would have installed into the Civil War musket modifying it from the original .58 caliber down to the cartridge type .50-70 it currently is.

I looked and YES, there is a sleeve. I got out the digital calipers and the outside diameter of the sleeve on this rifle is in fact the .58 

In light of that information that would explain why the Great Grandfather was able to say this WAS the rifle he carried in the Civil War. While at that time it was not equipped with the Rolling Block mechanism everything else including his carvings of the stock identifying his company and the cross appear to be all correct making this a very rare rifle that saw duty in the Civil War and was professionally converted by Remington while still retaining the personalization and history of the Civil War soldier who carried it.

Even without this almost lost history a basic Remington Rolling Block is a valuable and heavy hitting rifle (were used later on as Buffalo Rifles and in many many battles and wars literally all over the world) and if you research our National Historic Firearms Museum in the United States the Remington Rolling block was the very first weapon to start what is now over 5000 classic firearms.

Upon his fathers death the previous gentleman inherited the rifle and his now deceased Pastor (prior to computers) who had an extensive weapons library researched the rifle for several weeks before getting back to him. Even at collector prices back then it was valued at between $800 and $1500. I have been told that this is obviously a low value number after so many years, but as they say it is worth what someone will pay for it and I will be reasonable to a serious collector.

The Great Grandson said they have fired this ""cannon"" and that it did very well but I have no .50 cal ammo and if I keep it I doubt I will ever fire it. I can tell you the action is very strong, tight and confident feeling and while the stock is a tad loose the rolling block mechanism operates as it was intended to over 130 years ago so if you were determined I am sure you could call it back into service once again or just admire it for the piece of American history it is.

That is where we currently are on researching the rifle until I visit another expert. I really have no interest for additional muskets trades at this time(thank you for the offers I have received on those) instead preferring some higher end modern weapons (or World War II weapons) or a reasonable cash offer.

Please read this. If you do have a reasonable trade send all of it's information along with pictures. If you have trouble sending pictures please send the written information on your trade and let me know you are having problems with sending things and we can figure that out.

Also since I am not an expert and I value any information or even corrections as I work towards getting this to a qualified collector who can display it properly and enjoy it for years to come."

987,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1895987,For Sale:  16 x 16 outfitter tent,"Arkansas, Colorado, United States",$ 300,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 24, 2013",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"16 x 16 expandable military tent with no frame. These tents are brand new unopened. They are heavy duty the crate weighs 250 pounds. They don't have a frame but I've found a way to make one out of conduit and a frame kit from outfitter supply for about $250. And the tents are designed to connect and make bigger tents in 16' increments, so you could put two together an have a 16' x 32'. They would make an awesome outfitter tent for an extended stay outdoors.
