8,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1641008,For Sale:  Limited Edition Spikes Tactical Upper w Nickel Boron BCG,"West Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 800,"Listed On: Friday, May 24, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand new complete Spikes Tactical upper assembly that will drop right onto any AR15 lower in 5.45X39 (which is arguably a better round than .223, with the same ballistics and it is MUCH cheaper). Same caliber as the AK74 and 1080 round sealed cans of Russian surplus are still only about $180, so about $.16 per round. This caliber is by far the cheapest military spec'ed ammo available on the planet, and at that price you can afford to buy several cans and stack them deep, they come sealed airtight and will last forever. Upper is factory built from Spikes with a top quality $375 Lothar Walther barrel. Also, the entire upper has the ultimate in corrosion resistant finishes. It is Melonite treated inside and out including even the flash hider and front sight / gas block, and comes complete with a new complete $275 Spikes Tactical NiB (Nickel Boron) treated all milspec BCG. As a bonus, the carrier is exactly the same as a 5.56 carrier, so you can also use this Nickel Boron carrier in your regular .223/5.56 AR15 upper just by swapping your standard 5.56 bolt into it. It will save you a fortune in ammo and 5.45x39 is an awesome round. This upper was a limited production run that was designed and built specifically to chew through cheap surplus ammo, and it is a steal for the price when you consider the complete anti-corrosion finish package, a $375 high end LW barrel, a $275 Spikes NiB BCG, and the HUGE savings in the price of ammo. 1080 rounds of 5.45 is over $400 CHEAPER than 1000 rounds of .223 or 5.56, so by the time you buy 2 of the 1080 round cans of ammo you have saved more than the entire price of the complete upper basically making it free. It is well worth the extra $100-$200 for this upper just for the Nickel Boron BCG alone. It is brand new still in the box and comes complete with Spikes Tactical's Lifetime Warranty.

I have a 1997 Passat GLX VR6 5 speed manual trans. Car has just over 115K miles. It has working AC and heat. Trans shifts great, no grinds and gear oil level was just checked. Has factory exhaust and cat converter. Sounds nice and quiet. I bought it for a daily but recently picked up another MK3 and want to sell this to buy more guns. It is a nice daily. Body is solid, no rot or rust anywhere. Sitting on the stock B4 bottlecap wheels with good tread on tires.

$1500

Trades considered would be AR15 stuff or MK2 16V or VR6 or MK3 VR6 cars

Just replaced:

New plug wires  5/14/13
New BKR5E NGK plugs  5/14/13
New drivers side window regulator
Didn't have speakers when I got it but I just installed 4 aftermarket 6.5"" speakers in doors

CEL codes:

Has a P1426 code for fuel tank evap system. Only code it is showing.


Things it needs:

Front left wheel making noise only when turning right so my guess is it needs a wheel bearing but there is no slop in the wheel. I have never looked at it to see. Sounds almost like a rock stuck in the rotor.

Needs a drivers seat. The one that is in it is pretty had as can be seen in the picture.

Needs a pass side front air bag.

Missing fog light lenses

Not a big deal but amber lens fell off of drivers corning light

Reds don't match 100% on drivers fender and door.

I have very detailed pics on request to a serious offer.
Someone along the way did replace the front sight with a white one, I do not have the original, or the box or manual for that matter.
I'm more of an AR guy than I am an AK guy.
I am going to be very specific about what I am looking for as far as trades. 
First off I expect your rifle to be new or like new, not one you've run through classes, bump fired, or otherwise abused. Let me add, if you've been running steel cased ammo through your high end AR, no need to PM me, I don't want it.

I can add mags, ammo, and/or cash depending on what you have.

I live in Indy, but I am willing to travel to make a trade, as long as you are.
I may require test firing your weapon, I will pay for range time, and bring quality brass cased ammo.
If you want to test fire mine, the same applies, except you will pay range fees and supply your own ammo.

IF THIS IS AD IS UP, THEN YES IT IS STILL AVAILABLE, I WILL NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS ASKING ME IT IT IS STILL AVAILABLE, TOO MANY SPAMMERS ON HERE THAT COLLECT EMAIL ADDRESSES.
This should go without saying, but you must be 18 years old, prefer to deal with someone older."

The reason I am selling it is because I am not really fond of the thinness of it. The thinness would make it a great carry piece, it's just not for me.  It will come with all the stuff from the factory, the Apex Tactical Hard Sear already installed as well as the original sear, and a Desantis Nemesis pocket holster.

Honestly, I find the SKS detatchable mags to be a bit of a joke. You usually need 3 hands to take them off, and put them on. Hence the stripper clips. I find that it's easier just to treat the 30 round mag as an extended box magazine, and reload it in the weapon. Unless you have the time to reload more.
And they're pretty awkward to carry in any combat load. So I think they're great for the range, but not for any combat, or any training drills."

This is Clays Smokeless Powder.  Not International Clays or Universal Clays.  It's excellent for reloading .38 special, .45 ACP, and 44 special.  Many people also use it for 9mm, and there are a lot of load data out there for that caliber too.  Fast, super clean, and uses very little powder (comparatively) per round, which means you can load more rounds.  I just have too much of the stuff.  $30 per jar.

I picked this gun up from my FFL dealer on 05/09/2013 exactly 9 days ago. I brought it home and field stripped it and lubbed it up with Frog Lube (the best!). This is the newer version of Colt's Delta Elite 10mm Brand New in Box, Never fired! Not the model from the 1980's. The 10mm seems to be really making a comeback in popularity with ballistics more impressive than the 45ACP.

Comes with 2 mags and everything you would expect to receive as new or shown in the pictures below.

You know having one of these is on your bucket list, so get it now while you can still find them new since I believe Colt has also stopped making this newer version as well they are only going to get harder to find brand new!

Must have CPL or Purchase Permit...NO Exceptions!

Price is $1500 FIRM Now this is a pet peeve of mine. I put FIRM, yet still get people offering less. I will not respond to these offers at all!!!
Now, I did not just pull a random number out of head for a price. I found about 4 or 5 of the exact same model brand new over the last 2 months and monitored the auction price on gunauction.com. Some started a .01 with 30 bids usually ending at almost exactly $1500 and others with a starting price higher with a sale price again at almost or at $1500 and others simply put a flat rate for ""Buy it Now"" for $1500 and every single one sold. Almost every single one sold for almost exactly $1500 or very close so I know this is what I can get. It would cost me probably $20 for gunauction's sellers fees, but it would cost the buyer who almost always pays for the sellers FFL to handle the paperwork & ship it out which includes my FFL's fee and shipping which the price varies between $40 and $60 depending if you get insurance. Then you have to pay about $25 to $40 for your FFL to receive the gun and then if you use a credit card almost everyone charges 3% for that. So all these people paying the $1500 on gunauction after all fees are auctually paying $1600 or more. So that is how I got my price. No shipping and waiting and hoping it doesn't get damaged, you can fully inspect prior to your purchase, and you can take it home with you immediately. I know I could get a much faster sale to just list it, but I am just trying to help out my local fellow shooters.

I do not need to sell, but looking to get a different 10mm. Not really interested in any glocks. I am only considering a trade for something uncommon, such as a 10mm revolver, Kimber Eclipse, possible others. Other trades I might consider are: a newer model crossbow that shoots 350FPS or better, preferably a Barnett or Horton reverse limb...I really like the reverse limb styles, excellent condition Desert Eagle, High Quality Bolt Action Rifle.

My understanding of MD law is that there are two ways to legally transfer regulated firearms , thru a dealer or thru Md State Police.  Everyone is bemoaning how low MSP
background checks are taking.  60 + days is common.  
- Dealers will not release a purchased item until they receive a clear background check from MSP.  
- As two individuals, you apply at MSP for $10, wait the statute required 7 days, and can then pass the purchased firearm.  If the background comes back flawed, It's on 
the MSP to retrieve it.
Anyone having a different understanding is welcome to contact me."
