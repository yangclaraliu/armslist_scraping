God's Blessing or email address   REDACTED is the latest scam artist.  Ask a lot of questions, serial number, phone number, address. Suggest going through FFL dealer only.  He refuses to supply any of the information, he's a scammer, thief, lazy SOB that steals.  Last time- through work with the ATF and police department, it was a guy in Nigeria.  US has no jurisdiction to arrest him. He has you send the money to a friend in the US.  
If the address changes to send payment to - it's a scam.
if the guy speak or types in broken english -- it's a scam.
if he wants a western union payment - it's a scam.
if he wants to sell a $1200.00 shotgun for less that $900.00 - it's a scam.
May cost you $20.00 by going through an FFL to do a transfer but could save you the whole cost, of a big mistake!  He refuses to use an FFL - it's a scam."

Never installed in a gun. I bought it during the panic for $225 and I do not need it.

Product Information
 The AR-Stoner Enhanced Bolt Carrier Assembly features a fully staked gas key. The carrier body has a relief cut at the rear to allow for the installation of a carrier weight system (like the Tubb CWS). This cut eliminates the need to remove both takedown pins to slide the recievers together, the gun pivots on the front pin as normal.




Technical Information:

Available with two different coatings: 

Nickel Boron: Microscopic ""Nano Domes"" formed at the surface provide dry lubricity and affords hundreds of hours of salt water protection. Nickel Boron coating is easy to clean and resists fouling. 

Ceramic: Excellent heat resistance and provides for rapid cooling. Applied through a proprietary process that penetrates the substrate of the metal and CAN NOT be removed without removing a layer of the metal itself. The hotter it gets the slicker it gets-continues to resist fouling even during extended firing sessions."

83,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1849083,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE HEAVY 357 Mag - 125 gr. Barnes XPB @ 1650 fps - 20 Round Box,"azusa, California, United States",$ 32,"Listed On: Saturday, July 6, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For those needing/wanting a Lead-Free, HEAVY 357 Magnum load, generating full power plus, here it is.

Below are real world velocities taken from my personal real world stock guns. The established use of long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings is essentially misleading to the public who won’t be firing ammo from a laboratory test barrel in the real world, where it matters.

    2145 fps - Marlin mod 1894, 18 inch barrel
    1583 fps - S&W mod 27, 5 inch barrel
    1591 fps - S&W Mt. Gun, 4 inch barrel
    1507 fps - S&W mod 66, 3 inch barrel
    1448 fps - S&W mod 66, 2.5 inch barrel

You’ll notice that the newer S&W 4 inch Mt Gun gave higher velocities than the older 5 inch model 27 S&W and this is because of different internal barrel dynamics of the newer gun.

Due to the long-for-weight all copper bullet, we did not have the case capacity to use a bulky flash retarded powder and thus there is noticeable muzzle flash with this load, except when firing it from the rifle, which yielded little to no flash.

This load is the typical Barn-Burning, Turbo-Charged, Buffalo Bore type of HEAVY 357 mag. load and as such, should only be used in revolvers made of all steel. It should not be fired in light weight alloy framed or cylindered revolvers. Feel free to use it in ALL/ANY 357 mag. chambered rifles and all steel revolvers."

1942 PU sniper production was very low, so any PU dated that year is very difficult to find, this is because PU sniper production didn't start until late in that year and because of it being a transitional year from PE and PEM sniper production .

 This rifle is all stamped matching with the letter prefix's although the magazine floorplate has been lined out and renumbered to match.

This one is a wartime issue rifle and unlike many others this PU rifle may have a history behind it.

The scope is numbers matching to the rifles barrel shank.

Bore and crown are in good condition with no counter-bore.

 More pic.s are available to seriously interested parties.

 So if you looking for a good example of a WW2 PU sniper rifle that few people can say they own, this one may be for you.

I would like $700 for this very collectable and shootable rifle in a FTF sale in the Richmond tri-cities area.

Barely used -- 150 rnds thru this long gun.   AWESOME looking Rossi shotgun chambered in .410 Bore, takes 2 1/2 shells ---  5 + 1 capacity.  20 inch barrel

+  LOTS OF AMMUNITION TO GO WITH IT!!!  :)

Has been tuned by a Gunsmith and operates abosolutely flawlessly.  No FTF or FTE's whatsoever!!  Action is quite smooth for a gun in this price range.

Full Stainless steel + real Brazilean Hardwood.  Very cushy 1inch buttpad on the stock; recoil is nominal; but packs a punch on slugs.

Gun does not come with pictured spare 9 ammo sleeve.

Gun DOES come with a STOUT assortment of defensive and target ammo pictured  - IF my full asking price is achieved:

-- Fiocchi 150 rnds of #7.5 shot with 1/2oz lead - velocity 1250fps

-- BrennekeUSA ""Close Encounter"" rifled SLUGS -- 20 rnds of 1/5 ounce slug - velocity 1500fps  (this round tested to be equivalent to .357 MAGNUM in energy at 50yrds)

-- Winchester SuperX rifled SLUGS -- 10 rnds of 1/4 ounce slug - velocity 1400fps (also a nasty slug round for defensive or even hunting, etc)

-- Winchester PDX1 Defender -- 8 rnds of nasty projectile filled good stuff -- ""3 plated defense discs, 12 plated BB's"".   This stuff should tear up any intruder pretty good.

I am selling because my i got this piece for my wife to get comfortable with Lever Actions.  She loves it but we got same piece in a .44 magnum recently which is for SERIOUS business LOL.   She's outgrown the .410 now.

You can't find the Stainless version of this one for less than $510 anywhere -- and once you get it brand new usually it has to be sent out for de-burring and tuning to make it operate properly.  This is ALREADY done for this gun; reliable and shoots flawlessly.

I'll do the gun + all ammo listed for $439.00

This gun is the commercial version, and the 6th variant (there were six model variants?). The Ortgies pocket pistols were made (officially) from 1919 to 1924. This particular gun (according to the serial number) was made around 1922-23. The Orgies semi-automatic pistols were excellent, well made guns. The design was ahead of its time. This gun has the factory original 7rd magazine. Overall, this gun is in very good condition. Has all matching numbers (barrel, frame, slide). Bluing is in really good condition for its age (this gun is at least 90 years old). All original finish, not re-blued, or anything like that. Has factory wood grips. The grips has no cracks, splits, or damages. Has a few minor dents and dings. Barrel is in very good condition - has a few minor surface rust. Bore is in very good condition. Has a a few minor rust (the Germans or people back in the old days used highly corrosive ammo). Gun comes with 70 rounds of non-corrosive ammo (50 rounds of FMJ and 20 rounds of hollow points), and a brand new-reproduction firing pin. In addition, there's an old Ortgies owner's manual. It's really worn out, tattered, but all the pages are there (but not intact - it looks like as old as the gun itself). You must be at least 21 years old or older and have a valid Kentucky driver's license (or KY CCDW) to buy/trade this gun. Local (Kentucky) sale/trade only. No shipping. Just email me with any questions. Serious inquiries only please. Thanks for looking.

Gun comes with the following:

- 70 rounds of ammo (50rds of American Eagle FMJ and 20rds of Speer Gold Dot hollow  points) 
- Extra brand new reproduction firing pin (cost me $30)
- factory original owner's manual

-- Extras (ammo and extra firing pin) not pictured but included with the sale/trade --

 * $350 obo, or trade *

 -- Below is an excerpt from one of the Ortgies websites. It is not my own. I am just giving a credit to the author/creator of that particular website. You can do a google (or yahoo) search on this particular pistol on the internet. There are several Ortgies websites on line --

 "" The Ortgies pistol has a number of unusual design features. The most obvious is its grip safety which, once squeezed, stays in the “fire” position without further pressure of the hand on the grip. A button on the left side of the gun allows the grip safety to pop back out. Since the grip safety is powered by the striker spring, the safety can only be popped out, i.e., placed in the “safe” position, when the striker is cocked. Hence, if the safety is enabled, the gun is cocked. When the grip safety is enabled, the sear is prevented from moving downward and the tension on the striker spring is reduced. Pressing the safety- enabling button also allows the slide to be lifted off the frame rail for disassembly. The striker serves as the ejector. """

I recently changed out the plunger spring and both plungers, mainspring, mag release spring, and all frame pins with an Ed Brown rebuild kit. The trigger has been given a good going over, and breaks clean and smooth. The gun came to me without a front sight, and i have installed a new ramped front sight, but it was too tall, so i had it filed down to match the rear. The gun functions 100% with ball ammo. I have 2 colt magazines, 1 factory mag. The grips are VZ style, not sure what brand as they were on the gun when I got it. This was a project, and I do not have time or desire to finish the cosmetics of the gun. I have a drop in Wilson magwell and a barrel bushing compensator as well.

I have a new in box Colt LE6920 for sale.  It's the  ""2013"" configuration with the Magpul flip up rear site.  It came with one 30 round PMAG and I'll throw in 3 more.  Asking $1100 OBO.  Price looks to be around $1200 at local dealers if they have one in stock.  Add tax and three extra pmags and you're well over $1300, so I think my asking price is fair.

I backordered two of these during the craze last December, not knowing if either would ever show up.  I only need one, so here's the other.

It hasn't been fired, stripped or cleaned.  I haven't even cycled the action.

This is the original tritium dot sight for tactical ops and although it is older, it is still a good effective design and allows a clear view to use your iron sights if necessary. It was designed for the shooter to keep both eyes open day or night. I have used this sight for many years and found it to be a great quick acquisition sight in a smaller package than an Aimpoint or ACOG, but now that I have switched over to a flattop AR, I can not use this anymore. The tritium lamp has gone dim, but Trijicon handles their replacements for less than $50 bucks the last time I checked and the new Armson Company will offer the lamps also. This model will not fit on a flattop AR, so I no longer have a need for it. Pardon the quality of the pics, but you can see what we are talking about now. The Carbine is not included.

I also have a Burris TACT CQ illuminated reticle scope and 20 magazines (20 rounds each) along with the 5 rd magazine that comes with the rifle.  There is also a tactical pivoting and swiveling bipod and foregrip attached (not pictured). This rifle also includes the loaded coupon which allows you to purchase accessories from Springfield at a discount.  Absolutely incredible rifle.  It had never been fired so it is brand new with the original box.  100 rounds of .308 also available.

If you are very conservative with the value of this setup, consider $1500 for the rifle, $200 for the scope $30 for the grip and bipod, and $15 each for the magazines, that would put the price at $2030.  That's how I arrive at $2000 and clearly where I have valued the individual items is lower than market value individually, especially considering the rifle is new with the box.

Details:

This GG&G ACCUCAM Quick Detach Locking Lever is designed specifically for EOTech 511, 512, 551, & 552 Holographic Sights. The ACCUCAM assembly replaces the EOTech's socket head screw or thumb nut cross bolt quickly and easily with the included tools. Once installed, the EOTech sight can be mounted to, or removed from, your Picatinny or Weaver rail in seconds by rotating the ACCUCAM Lever.

Unlike many other attachment systems, the ACCUCAM does not add any height to the EOTech. This maintains the operator's ability to co-witness the host firearm's iron sights, and preserve the all important perfect cheek-weld. The repeatability of the ACCUCAM has been tested and proven to hold within 1/2 MOA, this creates a negligible change in point of impact for all but the most critical of situations.

The design of the ACCUCAM is ergonomic and virtually snag-free by virtue of its sleek rounded design. Operators wearing gloves will have no problems removing or installing their ACCUCAM enhanced EOTech.
    -Does not raise the height of the EOTech
    -Rounded design is ergonomic, & virtually snag-proof.
    -Applicable to EOTech 511, 512, 551, & 552 holosights
    (EOTech 553 has an integral ARMS throw-lever mount)
    -Compatible with Weaver & Mil-Std 1913 Picatinny rails
    -Stable, repeatable, & rugged quick detach system for your EOTech
    -Unique finger loop design is easily operated, even with a gloved hand
    -Milled from solid billet 4140 steel, with a Mil-Spec manganese phosphate finish

I'm selling a very good shooting Gen4 Glock 23 with factory installed Glock night sights, Glock installed extended slide stop, and Glock beavertailed backstraps.

I'm only selling because I've gotten a G27 for carry to replace this. It comes with everything you'd get from a new sale: box, lock, docs, fired casing, brush, speed laoder, 3 mags, gun, backstraps (L/M - standard and beavertail with pins).

The G23 and night sights are from Feb 2013. I've put ~300 rounds down the pipe. I've also cleaned and Froglubed it after every trip to the range. It's got no scrapes or scratches, and the finish is not the new matte finish that comes on the guns now.

It has had exactly 240rds down the pipe and and was cleaned after ever trip to the range. It will come with original case, paperwork, lock, the two extra back straps and three 15rd glock factory mags. Also trigger guard has been professionally undercut to allow you to get a higher grip purchase. I am only looking to trade for a few things that I will list below all other offers will be ignored and I'm not interested in cash. The only reason I want to trade is that I carry this regularly and now that it is summer the gen4 grip is rubbing me the wrong way literally. I'm not looking to add any cash the gen 4 is about $100 to $150 more that the gen 3 and its worth it for the reduced recoil due to the double recoil spring.
