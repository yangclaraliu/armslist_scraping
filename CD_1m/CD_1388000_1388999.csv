So now I'm just going to post a general ad listing the different firearms I'm interested in buying.  The following are handguns I would be interested in buying.  A GI model 1911 or possibly any other mid grade 1911 (nothing over $700), a Beretta 92fs/M9 (can get one for $650 new so don't try and sell me one for more than that), interested in most Sigs, any semi-auto that is all metal (non polymer frame), Glocks (especially the 17 or one chambered in .45acp), a .357mag revolver, any revolver chambered in anything above .38special.  Not interested in any .22s.  I'm not really too interested in Glocks but I'm coming around to the idea of picking one up but only if it's at a good price.  If I wanted to pay the price of a new gun I would just go to the shop and buy one, I'm posting on here to find one of these firearms at a good price!  If you want a transfer at a FFL I'm ok with that but only if it's on your dollar not mine.  Besides the handguns I listed I'm also looking to purchase any high-cap rifle but only one that is going for a good price.  Reach me with what you have and how much you want for it through email here on armslist or TEXT REDACTED.  I'm located in Valparaiso, IN and not willing to travel more than an hour and a half (possibly a little more for a great deal)   Thanks for viewing my ad and have a great day."

The Remington Golden Saber High Performance Jacket is designed for law enforcement and personal defense and successfully combines match-type accuracy, deep penetration, maximum expansion and near 100% weight retention. This handgun ammunition is built around the hollow-point bullet design and the spiral nose-cut feature permits mushrooming at lower velocity without sacrificing penetration or terminal performance. The High Performance Jacket is made entirely of cartridge brass, which releases energy over longer distances while mushrooming. The cases are nickel plated for reliable feed, function and extraction. Primer and mouth waterproofing are standard.

The Accu-Tac AR flash hider sports a three-pronged external profile and Wilson Combat's exclusive external accurizing flutes that improve muzzle harmonics over other blast dispersing brakes. These extensively tested features effectively dissipate flash and minimize muzzle signature but unlike many competitive AR muzzle devices, the Accu-Tac has no negative impact on accuracy. The rifle has a Midwest Industries freefloat quad rail with a Magpul angled fore grip. The rifle has a Moe buttstock, a Moe grip and comes with one 30 round P-Mag. The rifle has 2 different types of sights in which the first is a new EOTech, SU-231 PEQ and then the second is the 45 degree angled sights. This set up gives you the choice of using the EOTech or simply tilting the rifle just a bit and use the open sights depending on what type of shooting you are doing. Since the rifle arrived in a cardboard box, I put it in an Olympic Arms foam lined hard case to round out the set. This rifle would make an accurate shooter for range or pleasure shooting and would be a nice addition to any collection being a unique custom Reeder built AR-15 that is also coated in the color silver finish with the black contrasting parts to make for a very appealing rifle"

The gun is in good shape with some scuffs and a few scratches on the right hand side of the grip from carry and has a very small scuff on the right hand side of the slide, but overall gun is in good shape and has been fired very little since I got it (150 rounds exactly). Im not looking to sell or make money on this deal, I would trade the whole kit for a nice glock 19/23 with 2 factory ""Standard"" capacity magazines. Im adding in the glock 33 round mag to entice trades and to compensate from the wear on the gun, you truly are getting the better end of the deal as these mags are still hard to get and they are still selling for 50-75 bucks so you could potentially make money on this deal. I will not throw any money into the deal, this is a bargain in of itself for anybody willing to trade. Just email or call/text at REDACTED with offers.

Lots of people have a lot to say about Taurus, but this little revolver has been a flawless companion to me for DECADES without a hiccup. Based on the S&W 36 and made in a factory built by S&W for the Brazilian military, I've found this 85 to be better built and better shooting than many Smith 36s from the same period. And though I've never had to use it, the lifetime warranty follows the gun. Then why sell it? I probably shouldn't. Truth be told, I just don't use it any more. When carrying concealed (where legal, of course) it's usually a 442, LCP, or PM9. The stainless is nice for damp or salty environments, but I don't find myself in them too often and alloys and polymer ""don't rust neither"". It's too nice a gun for the tackle box and it's taking up space in the safe. 
Comes with original wooden stocks and Hogues.

$375 

Now, don't write to tell me you can get a new one for that. That may be true, but I don't think they are built as well and they've got those damn locks. Look on GunBroker for the older ones (S&W style cylinder latch and without that new lettering) and see what they have sold for. I believe I'm asking a fair price.

This rifle has never been loaded or fired, it is new in the original box and comes with the manufacturer's manual. It looks very much like the Winchester 1890 take down model, save that it has round barrel and made of stainless steel. The barrel length is 23 inches. This unique and delicately carved hand engraving pattern gives special appearance to the gun, and there is no similar detailed work on this model on the market. This is a real catch, the engraving pattern remains a sole production, it will not be repeated"

There is no need for bent bolt handle with this Mount.

FEATURES: Allows for mounting of Scout Scope or other long eye relief optics to Mosin Nagant models M38, M44 & T53's without the need to drill & tap receiver or make any permanent modifications to firearm.

The Mount is rigid steel construction with Black Oxide finish. 100% Lifetime Warranty!

FITS:

 Soviet M38 & M44  Chinese T53

SPECIFICATIONS: This Mount utilizes the barrel pin hole and the pivot pin hole in the rear sight block. The Mount will accommodate a front to back (horizontal, parallel to bore axis) pin center distance of 1.56"" (39.6mm) to 1.79"" (45.4mm) and allows for an up and down (vertical, perpendicular to bore axis) pin center distance of .18"" (4.6mm) to .41"" (10.3mm). The Mount is designed to fit over rear sight blocks that measure between .750"" (19.05mm) and .787"" (20.00mm) wide. The total weight including hardware is 5.4 oz. Please note that we have made every reasonable effort to ensure that our Mount will work with the vast majority of M38, M44 & T53's. If for any reason our Mount does not work with your specific M38, M44 or T53 it can be returned (undamaged) for a full refund.

$63.00 - FREE Domestic Shipping

FITMENT NOTES:

This mount will NOT work for a 9130! See Model 9130-SSM for a 9130.

The pin hole in the rear sight block is often located inconsistently as a result of the original manufacturing process. The pin hole, relative to the pivot pin, is frequently not parallel and may be out of alignment or skewed. The Mount can only accommodate so much of this misalignment. You should measure the center distances from barrel pin to pivot pin on both sides and check those with the dimensions listed in the SPECIFICATIONS to ensure that the mount will fit properly. A 3mm drill is provided and can be used to clean out and straighten (to some degree) without enlarging the barrel pin hole once the pin is removed. The barrel pin hole and pivot pin hole in the rear sight block are generally .118"" (3.0mm) in diameter and the supplied 3mm bolts have a nominal OD of .115"" (2.92mm). This tight fit along with the use of an appropriate liquid thread locker for the screws and nuts, as well as proper tightening of the same should result in no movement of the Mount during normal firing recoil.

TOOLS REQUIRED:

Safety glasses, heavy gloves, solid work surface or vise, hammer, flat blade screw driver, 7/32? (5.5mm) socket driver or wrench, hand drill, and liquid thread locker. A MAPP (Methyl Acetylene Propadience Propane) gas torch and heavy duty punch may be required to remove existing pins from the rear sight block if they are soldered in place. You can usually find these items at your local hardware or plumbers supply. The application of heat, if done properly, will not cause damage. Keep in mind that you only need to reach the melting point of the solder and that this same temperature was achieved during original construction without adverse effects. Procedure provided in supplied instructions.

NOTE:

As with ANY scope on ANY mount, should it receive an impact (dropped, hit, etc.) it should not be trusted to be accurate. Thus the SEE-THRU feature of our Mount. You can always still use the original iron or open sights if you feel the Mount has been compromised. Design subject to change without prior notice.

Caution! Improper installation or use may result in damage to property, severe injury, or loss of life. If for any reason this product does not function properly, discontinue use immediately. Always practice proper SAFETY & ensure an UNLOADED condition before beginning installation."

F.A. Mfg. Co. Hartford Ct. U.S.A."". The left sides of the barrels are marked ""Colt Single Action Army .45"". The left side of the frames are marked ""Pat. Sept. 19, 1871 / July 2. 72 Jan, 19, 75"". The underside of the frames and the left sides of the grip frames are marked with the serial number. Both guns have the Verified Proof mark and a ""0"" on the left sides of the trigger guards. Both guns are also beautifully hand engraved. Both grip frames, under the grips on the left side are marked with an ""MD"" brand / monogram which is likely the engraver. 

Barrel Length: 4 3/4"" 

Sights / Optics: These revolvers are mounted with fixed standard SAA sights. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are two piece Colt ""Eagle"" grips serial numbered to the guns. The checkering is sharp on both guns and there is only slight surface marking at the bottoms. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Blue / Case Color Hardened 

Finish Originality: Professionally applied after the engraving was cut. 

Bore Condition: The bores are sharp and purportedly unfired. There is possible evidence of test rounds, but the bores and the guns look unfired. The rifling is sharp. There is no pitting or erosion in the bore. 

Overall Condition: These revolvers retains about 99.9% of their metal finish. There is only the faintest of drag lines between 2 chambers on one pistol and 3 on the other. Otherwise, these guns have likely never been out of the boxes or the bags. The case colors are vivid and the blue is deep and brilliant. The Screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. Overall, these revolvers rate in about Excellent and LNIB condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions properly, though we did not want to cock them to confirm. These revolvers were not cocked while in our possession. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: Both guns come in their original boxes, with matching serial numbered end labels. The end labels confirm configuration and finish, but do not mention engraving. No paperwork is retained, but the original plastic bags for each gun are. 

Our Assessment: Here is a beautiful and truly sharp pair of consecutive serial numbered and engraved colt Single Action Army revolvers. These guns are as sharp as they are beautiful, and while we do not know the origin of the engraving, the work is definitely hand cut and of a factory-quality level. To order these from the factory would cost many thousands over what they will likely sell for here, and you will get no more gun for your money. 

CA Legal or CA Private Party Transferable: These Single Action Revolvers can be transferred in California and sold as a Private Party Transaction (PPT) at our Shop in Simi Valley."

Item Description:  I've got a beautiful Uberti 1873 Cattleman Revolver chambered in .45LC. I've spent many days pretending to be Clint Eastwood in Fistful of Dollars with this pistol. I purchased this pistol unfired from an ODT member. It was still wrapped in plastic, grease and had a tag zip tied to the trigger guard. So technically I'm the ""original owner"". In that case she's had exactly 200 rounds of Winchester White Box target ammo fired through her. It has the slightest holster wear from me playing Quickdraw McGraw and the base pin is a bit scratched up from removal.

As far as trades go, I'm open to almost anything. Looking specifically for a nice pair of Costa Corbina 580G or similar Costa glasses plus cash/other items.

The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

I bought the stock rifle new off my step dad who bought 4 of them and kept them locked up and never shot them.  But here is the list:
rifle.. 375
Archangel package.. 150
Flip up sights.. 100

 2 bx25 mags.. 70 
 Bolt buffer.. 10
 Sharp claw extractor.. 20
 Charging handle.. 15
 Extended mag relese.. 10
 Heavy duty spring pack.. 20
 Black rifle case.. 70

Not one scratch or ding anywhere and has fired abot 50 rounds.  So this rifle is almost brand new.  I wont take a lesser offer than what i paid for everythin.
