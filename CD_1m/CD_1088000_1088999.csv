Illinois: House Judiciary Committee to Hold Hearings on Gun Control Legislation 

Contact Committee Members Immediately and Attend These Hearings

On February 19 and 22, the Illinois House Judiciary Committee will hold hearings to discuss comprehensive gun control legislation.  We urge all Illinois residents to attend these hearings and urge legislators to oppose anti-gun legislation that does nothing more than penalize law-abiding gun owners by restricting the right to self-defense.  It is important that you plan to testify at these hearings and stand up for the Second Amendment in Illinois.  You can sign a witness slip to testify for either hearing date here.  The House Judiciary Committee may be limiting the amount of testimony they will hear, so it is important that you register your opinions with the online witness slip as soon as possible.

Dates, times and locations for both House Judiciary Committee hearings are listed below:

Tuesday, February 19th at 12:00 NOON

Room 114 Capitol Building in Springfield

Friday, February 22nd at 10:00 AM

Room N-600 Bilandic Building in Chicago

159,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1088159,For Sale:  Remington 740 with 10 round magazine- great condition,"Verona, Madison, Wisconsin",$ 400,"Listed On: Sunday, February 17, 2013",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,30-06 Springfield                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is a classic Remington 740 Woodsmaster chambered in 30-06.  

Refinished stock and refinished barrel.  Total scrub down of action and barrel making it clean and smooth as it should be.  This gun may have been owned by your grandpa, but looks like you are buying a vintage remake of something new out of the store.    7 ½ pounds, 22 inch barrel.

Sights:  Comes equipped with weaver style mount (not pictured) and the mounting screws.  This 740 is a very serviceable firearm though without a scope using the white metal bead front ramp and the step-adjustable semi-buckhorn rear.

What sets this 740 apart from all the others you see for sale on Gunbroker and on Armslist are two things 1) is the attention to refinishing the stock that was used.  The purchaser of this gun will have a one of a kind.  The flame maple you see was brought out through careful selection of oils and waxes.  The final finish that has been applied makes this a hunt-worthy gun that will stand up to the elements.  There is a hairline crack that has been there for years, and is not growing due to it being repaired long before my ownership.  Online people sell unfinished 740 stock blanks for over $225.  Anyone owning this gun has a great hunting rifle that you will be proud to have other’s see.  The great part of the finish that I chose for this, is it doesn’t give up its heritage old looking feel.  It just looks like something bought 50 years ago and stored well.

And number 2) this firearm comes equipped with the regular 4 round magazine as well as the 10 round magazine.  The ten round magazine is not bulky, fits well, and is a great addition to bring the extra firepower you want with you on a long hunt.  New 10 round magazines that fit the 740 run from 50-80 dollars.  It’s just fun to have a 10 round 30-06 too!  Great for hunting in those tight woods where you have minimal time to get off the second shot.  And great for those shots where you need to throw a lot of lead at a deer booking across a field.

Asking $400 or best offer.  Need to make room for my next restoration project.

Here is detailed description from manufacturer site:

The MK1 series, developed by Primary Weapons Systems, is a significant product improvement for the M4/M16-type carbines and rifles. Utilizing our proven long stroke piston system, the MK1 series greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon making it as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after. 

The MK1 series has been used in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has gained wide popularity with security personnel, law enforcement and civilians alike. 

The origins of the MK1 series began with the fascination in the simplicity and reliability of the AK47 combined with a deep-rooted appreciation for the ergonomics of the M4/M16 platform. Having a significant understanding of the deficiencies in the direct gas impingement operating system found on conventional M4/M16-style weapons, PWS developed the MK1 series with the professional in mind. 

Significant improvements have been made over both the direct gas impingement operating system and previous offerings of piston-driven operating systems. The product improvements made by PWS have addressed reliability and performance issues as well as reduced carrier tilt, cam pin wear and carrier bounce. In addition, we have one of the lightest systems on the market today! 

An innovative hand guard system utilizes a proprietary non-free float system that allows the end user or unit armorer to replace individual rails as needed without removing the barrel, barrel nut or even other rails. This system allows the user to attach numerous Picatinny rail-mounted devices such as sights, lights, and laser aiming devices. 

The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available.

The Marlin Model 70P, also known as the Marlin Papoose, is a .22 Long Rifle semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Marlin Firearms. The rifle is notable for its portability; it is less than 21 inches (530 mm) in length when disassembled and weighs 3.25 pounds. Disassembly requires loosening a barrel retention nut by hand or with a supplied tool. It is designed as a hiker and camper utility rifle, and appeals to the same market as the AR-7. The Model 70P is based on the earlier Marlin Model 70 (currently listed as Model 795) that has a fixed barrel and conventional stock. Its semi-automatic action originated with the Marlin Model 60. The Marlin Model 70PSS variant has a synthetic stock and stainless steel barrel.

The rifle has an open rear sight and ramp front sight with high visibility orange post surrounded by a cutaway hood. The receiver has an integral .22 tip-off scope mounting rail. Swivel studs for a carrying strap are embedded in the synthetic stock. Included Marlin accessories are a 7 round metal magazine, a tool for adjusting the barrel nut, and a padded nylon carrying case designed to float in water. Optional accessories from Marlin include 7 and 10 round metal magazines 10/22

This is one of the most mint conditioned, beautiful shotguns I have ever seen in my life, much less owned.  This 1966 Diana has been unfired and in a climate controlled safe for the past 30+ years.  Before 1980 this gun was RARELY shot at all and last year I only put (2) shells through her at the range to show off and to make sure she worked properly and she does!  Provenance on Browning letterhead states gun was made for and delivered on December 23, 1966 to Abercrombie & Fitch, Madison Avenue, New York, New York which makes her even more rare.(Browning document comes with gun)  One look, like me and you'll want this gun for your collection and even though the group of buyer for such a fine gun are small, this gun will NOT last long when someone realizes what they have found.  Signed by master engraver Gino Cargnel with serial # S24XX S6.  Pictures do not show just how gorgeous this gun is and with the purchase comes the original 1966 Browning case, also in excellent condition.  Please see pictures and I can send as many more as you need, but please NO low ball offers as I do not need to sell this gun.

""The CZ 40B began life a few years ago as a joint venture between Colt and CZ to help Colt get its foot back into the police firearms market, so the story goes. The gun is a dedicated built-from-the-ground-up .40 caliber - not an adaptation of a 9mm frame. They made it with an alloy frame, a double stack mimic of the 1911 grip frame style, and the Sig-style locking system. It's only commonality with the CZ 75/85 series pistols lies in the use of the CZ 75/85 double/single action trigger, the CZ 75/85 sear blocking safety, and the CZ 75B magazines. All else is brand spankin' new. The gun was first produced by CZ for Colt as the Z40 and had a newly-designed DAO trigger at that time.

Colt was not able to continue marketing the gun and had to back out of its end of the deal. So CZ replaced the trigger in what had been the Colt Z40, made some other changes, and began marketing the gun as the CZ 40B."""

Checked online in the ammo stores, they only sell this in 20 round boxes but even at the cheapest place I found online charged over 2 dollars more than I and you have to pay for  their shipping.I Looked at gun auction and they wanted 300.00 dollars for 440 rounds, and if ya want to buy 10 boxes from me its 200 dollars and I will give an extra box. So that would be 200 dollars for 440 rounds. The 223 ammo was alway just a bit higher than the AK ammo. Plus the online stores I beat by over 2 dollars a box that did not include the shipping. Thanks for looking. Oya, just dont say you want it really bad, ask me to wait a couple days so I wait then the other person never texts again. I will still do 200 rounds for 100 dollars as I know money is tight for alot of people , just if you want 400 rounds for 200 dollars will give an extra 40 rounds for nothing. And each box of 40 after that would be 15 dollars more as I think I have a couple more."

The problem: the mag well is cheap plastic and currently broken.

I’m soliciting help in fixing this thing, but my end goal is to sell. I purchased this rifle new, zeroed it and shot it some more (60 rounds total). I then attempted to insert a fresh magazine, and the magazine well broke off around the magazine release lever (see pictures). This was a few weeks ago, and after becoming frustrated calling & emailing Mossberg customer service, I’m seeing if:

a) someone can conjure up a new mag well (preferably steel or high quality polymer)
b) .....?

The quality of the plastic mag well truly sucks and has no business being on this rifle especially given the thinness around stress points. Otherwise I would have nothing but good things to say as it’s well built, lightweight and very accurate.

I also have a Nikon Monarch 2.5-10x42mm Nikoplex, Weaver scope rings, sling swivels and a Blackhawk 9""-13"" bi-pod. Have the boxes, paperwork, etc. for the rifle and scope.

It has the original Willy's stamp on the firewall under the hood. This jeep is in excellent condition, mechanically sound, runs and drives GREAT!! Absolutely nothing wrong with this jeep mechanically or cosmetically. I did a mechanical overhaul on this jeep so it has all of the new regular stuff it would need, brakes, brake lines, fuel lines, spark plugs, wires, distributor cap, alternator, solenoid, ect, ect. 4 wheel drive (must lock front wheels to engage 4 wheel drive), 3 speed, low and high gears, transfer case, can NOT get stuck in this thing!! It has the military tires so that the enemy can NOT tell which way you are going if they try to follow your tracks, wheels are left hand threads. The front windshield folds down. Jeep is is equipped with an ammo can as a glove box, cb radio with speaker, military police siren, blackout light. I have many miscellaneous extra parts to go with it. It has a gas can mount on the side and I have extra gas cans to go with it.

I can not guarantee that this jeep was in the Korean War but it was built at the end of the war, also the military cut it in half for shipping purposes and welded it back together. I also have roll bar, canvas top and doors for it (not shown in pictures). I did this jeep as a U.S. Army military police scenario, it is lots and lots of fun. I am in not hurry at all to sell it and am more interested in someone taking good care of this jeep as I have. If you are trying to make a profit off of me and this jeep than please don't waste my time. I want somebody to appreciate it as much as I have. When I got insurance on this jeep, they told me it was worth $8,000 in it's worst condition and $16,600 in it's best condition. I would guess that it falls somewhere in the middle but I have it insured for $8,000. Like I said, I am in no hurry at all to sell it so if you are interested please make me an offer. I am willing to do a cash sale or a trade and cash sale or just a straight trade if the price is right. E-mail me your offers, you never know you just might have something I can't live without. I live in Oklahoma so the jeep will need to be hauled back on a trailer."

It has the original Willy's stamp on the firewall under the hood. This jeep is in excellent condition, mechanically sound, runs and drives GREAT!! Absolutely nothing wrong with this jeep mechanically or cosmetically. I did a mechanical overhaul on this jeep so it has all of the new regular stuff it would need, brakes, brake lines, fuel lines, spark plugs, wires, distributor cap, alternator, solenoid, ect, ect. 4 wheel drive (must lock front wheels to engage 4 wheel drive), 3 speed, low and high gears, transfer case, can NOT get stuck in this thing!! It has the military tires so that the enemy can NOT tell which way you are going if they try to follow your tracks, wheels are left hand threads. The front windshield folds down. Jeep is is equipped with an ammo can as a glove box, cb radio with speaker, military police siren, blackout light. I have many miscellaneous extra parts to go with it. It has a gas can mount on the side and I have extra gas cans to go with it.

I can not guarantee that this jeep was in the Korean War but it was built at the end of the war, also the military cut it in half for shipping purposes and welded it back together. I also have roll bar, canvas top and doors for it (not shown in pictures). I did this jeep as a U.S. Army military police scenario, it is lots and lots of fun. I am in not hurry at all to sell it and am more interested in someone taking good care of this jeep as I have. If you are trying to make a profit off of me and this jeep than please don't waste my time. I want somebody to appreciate it as much as I have. When I got insurance on this jeep, they told me it was worth $8,000 in it's worst condition and $16,600 in it's best condition. I would guess that it falls somewhere in the middle but I have it insured for $8,000. Like I said, I am in no hurry at all to sell it so if you are interested please make me an offer. I am willing to do a cash sale or a trade and cash sale or just a straight trade if the price is right. E-mail me your offers, you never know you just might have something I can't live without. I live in Oklahoma so the jeep will need to be hauled back on a trailer."

I could not add the FTJ bio info as I discovered it was copyrighted. However,during the early 1900s Frank Tenney Johnson worked and sketched on a cattle ranch near Hayden, Colorado,attended an early Frontier Days celebration in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and ventured south to Navajo country. All of this influenced both his career and his personal life. It was possibly during this time that he obtained this Colt.) This gun is from the William Ruger Collection and was purchased from his grandson. It is reported to have belonged to Frank Tenney Johnson, a famous Western artist active at the same time as Russell and Remington. The .41 Colt, the holster and gun belt, and the display case are all from the Ruger Collection. Also included, is a framed authenticated print of a 1936 Frank Tenney Johnson painting, ""On the Range"", which was added at a later date. The gun is in excellent mechanical condition and fine cosmetic condition. Case hardening remains on the hammer and frame and the original blue has thinned except on the barrel next to the frame. All serial numbers match, except the loading gate which, as is normal, has an assembly number, and the grips fit well, but are worn. The holster has a tear at the muzzle end, probably from being drawn repeatedly. There are some ""dings"" on the barrel just forward of the "".41 Colt"", and I have no idea what may have caused them. It is apparent that Tenney did not leave this weapon in a closet. This weapon would be an outstanding acquisition for a collector who can display it properly. I cannot, and hence, am selling it to someone who can showcase it as it deserves. The gun was manufactured in 1899 and an FFL is required for shipment."

It has the original Willy's stamp on the firewall under the hood. This jeep is in excellent condition, mechanically sound, runs and drives GREAT!! Absolutely nothing wrong with this jeep mechanically or cosmetically. I did a mechanical overhaul on this jeep so it has all of the new regular stuff it would need, brakes, brake lines, fuel lines, spark plugs, wires, distributor cap, alternator, solenoid, ect, ect. 4 wheel drive (must lock front wheels to engage 4 wheel drive), 3 speed, low and high gears, transfer case, can NOT get stuck in this thing!! It has the military tires so that the enemy can NOT tell which way you are going if they try to follow your tracks, wheels are left hand threads. The front windshield folds down. Jeep is is equipped with an ammo can as a glove box, cb radio with speaker, military police siren, blackout light. I have many miscellaneous extra parts to go with it. It has a gas can mount on the side and I have extra gas cans to go with it.

I can not guarantee that this jeep was in the Korean War but it was built at the end of the war, also the military cut it in half for shipping purposes and welded it back together. I also have roll bar, canvas top and doors for it (not shown in pictures). I did this jeep as a U.S. Army military police scenario, it is lots and lots of fun. I am in not hurry at all to sell it and am more interested in someone taking good care of this jeep as I have. If you are trying to make a profit off of me and this jeep than please don't waste my time. I want somebody to appreciate it as much as I have. When I got insurance on this jeep, they told me it was worth $8,000 in it's worst condition and $16,600 in it's best condition. I would guess that it falls somewhere in the middle but I have it insured for $8,000. Like I said, I am in no hurry at all to sell it so if you are interested please make me an offer. I am willing to do a cash sale or a trade and cash sale or just a straight trade if the price is right. E-mail me your offers, you never know you just might have something I can't live without. I live in Oklahoma so the jeep will need to be hauled back on a trailer."

I do not know what it is worth or much about it - looks very Art Decco which means from the 1930s-1940s- I am guessing.  World War II era maybe??? I looked it up on the internet and got this:

The Le Français pistol by Manufrance was produced from 1913 till 1969, in a variety of calibres. It was mainly sold in France, primarily to the greater public but also to some officers of the French Army (during the Phony War), and to the French municipal police. In 1912, Etienne Mimard the Head of Manufrance (La Manufacture Française d'Armes et de Cycles de Saint Etienne) started development. Mr. Mimard obtained the patent for the first model (Modèle E) on August 6, 1913 with n° 472.505. Sales started in 1914 with the name ""Le Français"". 

as you can see the grips are some type of plexi- see through

It has the original Willy's stamp on the firewall under the hood. This jeep is in excellent condition, mechanically sound, runs and drives GREAT!! Absolutely nothing wrong with this jeep mechanically or cosmetically. I did a mechanical overhaul on this jeep so it has all of the new regular stuff it would need, brakes, brake lines, fuel lines, spark plugs, wires, distributor cap, alternator, solenoid, ect, ect. 4 wheel drive (must lock front wheels to engage 4 wheel drive), 3 speed, low and high gears, transfer case, can NOT get stuck in this thing!! It has the military tires so that the enemy can NOT tell which way you are going if they try to follow your tracks, wheels are left hand threads. The front windshield folds down. Jeep is is equipped with an ammo can as a glove box, cb radio with speaker, military police siren, blackout light. I have many miscellaneous extra parts to go with it. It has a gas can mount on the side and I have extra gas cans to go with it.

I can not guarantee that this jeep was in the Korean War but it was built at the end of the war, also the military cut it in half for shipping purposes and welded it back together. I also have roll bar, canvas top and doors for it (not shown in pictures). I did this jeep as a U.S. Army military police scenario, it is lots and lots of fun. I am in not hurry at all to sell it and am more interested in someone taking good care of this jeep as I have. If you are trying to make a profit off of me and this jeep than please don't waste my time. I want somebody to appreciate it as much as I have. When I got insurance on this jeep, they told me it was worth $8,000 in it's worst condition and $16,600 in it's best condition. I would guess that it falls somewhere in the middle but I have it insured for $8,000. Like I said, I am in no hurry at all to sell it so if you are interested please make me an offer. I am willing to do a cash sale or a trade and cash sale or just a straight trade if the price is right. E-mail me your offers, you never know you just might have something I can't live without. I live in Oklahoma so the jeep will need to be hauled back on a trailer."

This is a good shooter/ truck gun.
It is said that the 30-30 round has taken more deer in the U.S. than any other cartridge.
This gun has finish issues on the body and the tang shows bronzing due to hand oils.
Overall it is not that bad looking, providing you are not looking for a collector's piece.
This is a gun you can hunt with or keep in your truck and not feel bad about it.
A good price these days for a well known rifle.

It has the original Willy's stamp on the firewall under the hood. This jeep is in excellent condition, mechanically sound, runs and drives GREAT!! Absolutely nothing wrong with this jeep mechanically or cosmetically. I did a mechanical overhaul on this jeep so it has all of the new regular stuff it would need, brakes, brake lines, fuel lines, spark plugs, wires, distributor cap, alternator, solenoid, ect, ect. 4 wheel drive (must lock front wheels to engage 4 wheel drive), 3 speed, low and high gears, transfer case, can NOT get stuck in this thing!! It has the military tires so that the enemy can NOT tell which way you are going if they try to follow your tracks, wheels are left hand threads. The front windshield folds down. Jeep is is equipped with an ammo can as a glove box, cb radio with speaker, military police siren, blackout light. I have many miscellaneous extra parts to go with it. It has a gas can mount on the side and I have extra gas cans to go with it.

I can not guarantee that this jeep was in the Korean War but it was built at the end of the war, also the military cut it in half for shipping purposes and welded it back together. I also have roll bar, canvas top and doors for it (not shown in pictures). I did this jeep as a U.S. Army military police scenario, it is lots and lots of fun. I am in not hurry at all to sell it and am more interested in someone taking good care of this jeep as I have. If you are trying to make a profit off of me and this jeep than please don't waste my time. I want somebody to appreciate it as much as I have. When I got insurance on this jeep, they told me it was worth $8,000 in it's worst condition and $16,600 in it's best condition. I would guess that it falls somewhere in the middle but I have it insured for $8,000. Like I said, I am in no hurry at all to sell it so if you are interested please make me an offer. I am willing to do a cash sale or a trade and cash sale or just a straight trade if the price is right. E-mail me your offers, you never know you just might have something I can't live without."

These bolt carrier groups listed are a great deal. Why buy a complete upper that comes with one for 550 or 440, when you can pay almost the same price for a 120-150 dollar bcg. I have 7 currently, and will sell you whoever is dumb enough to pay these prices. There is no leglisation even proposed that's going to have any effect on these.

How about ammo? Also no pending or proposed legalization. This is the fastest ammo has been produced in recent history, and none of the components are becoming more expensive. I've found three sites that had TONS of ammo in stock for almost a full 24 hours. If you can't wait for 8 days for ammo to ship, or 3 months on a backorder if you want the really good deals 5.56 62 grain  for .22 cents a round by the case...)
