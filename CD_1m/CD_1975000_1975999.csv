It is top quality through and through. This Smith & Wesson's M&P 15PC-1 from the Performance Center is one of the top choice for any serious shooter, and very hard to find. This earlier model is superior than the current model on the receiver and stock. This S&W Performance Center M&P 15PC-1 has a 20‚Äù Stainless Steel barrel, Chromed Bolt Carrier, Two-Stage compitition trigger, Hard Coat black anodized finish from the factory.

 I use this rifle for hunting coyote sometimes, but mostly use it for varmit (Despite what Obama says about people using AR's for hunting), It has earned such nickname's as the ""Black Death"" and ""Nail Driver"" amongst my friends. The accuracy is second to none, it is almost boring to shoot because I can hold a dime size group at 100 yards all day with it. So unless you're using it to shoot 2-3"" targets at 150-200 yards it's boring at the range lol. 

 I am a U.S. Marine so needless to say the weapon has been well taken care of. It is in peak condition mechanically, but shows signs of use. As I said, I have not bought it to sit in a safe and collect dust, I bought it to be a deadly accurate weapon system, and that it is. If you're looking for a unfired weapon or a weapon to sit in a safe and collect dust then please move on because this is not what you're looking for. However, if you're looking for a field tested and true'd weapon, that has this U.S. Marine's approval; this is it. 

 Now to the price... When the weapon hit the market the MSRP was $2750 for the bare rifle. That means no optics and no bipod. 

 Add on's include:
 -Magpul PRS Stock $300 (if you can find one) 
 -UTG MilDot Scope with Red/Green lit reticle $150 (High dollar scopes are for scout snipers, and gear queers that hope it will make them shoot better. Yeah, I said it... If you doubt me, then put your money where your mouth is. I will out shoot you all day with this $150 scope vs. your $2000 glass that doesn't help your shot placement.)
 -Magpul Quarter Turn Iron Sights (For targets <50 yards) 
 -UTG Bipod, Tactical Charging Handle (less tactical, more practicle to get around the optics), and a Tactical Mag release (Again, Less tactical, more practical)

 I also have a ton of G.I. Mags and 5.56 Ammo that can be negotiated for. Please feel free to contact me with questions and/or offers."

Weapon features a 10 round magazine, single shot barrel load, and cherry wood pistol grip. This weapon fires .22 long rifle ammo. Has been fired exactly 2 times. Because of it's size, this weapon is EXCELLENT for personal protection, a back up weapon, concealed carry, first time gun owners, etc. I bought this weapon for my Mrs. about a year ago and she wants to upgrade to something a little bigger. This weapon is ideal for carry in a hand bag or a purse. It breaks down, super easy for a quick and thorough clean. Along with the sale of the weapon comes the holster which features an easy release Velcro retaining strap and a belt clip. A lot of ""big boys"" trash talk a .22 because of it's size, don't make the mistake of falling for ""mine is bigger then yours"" thinking. A .22 is just as powerful as 9mm or a .40, etc if the shooter knows where to hit. My price is firm as it is very fair. Not interested in trades. I'm not down to selling to anyone under 21, so if we meet and your age is questionable, I will ask to see your ID. I will draft up the bill of sale relinquishing me from all responsibility of actions, smart or stupid, taken with the weapon. Thanks for looking!"

Comes with bayonet, oil can, and tools with pouch. 

I purchase two 91-30's from Impact and opted to pay the extra to get them ""hand picked"".  Unfortunately when the guns arrived, the condition of the finish on one of the guns was really rough.  I decided to refinish the stock.  It turned out great, and is now a beautiful gun.  I took care to sand as little as possible. The markings on the stock are more visible now than before I refinished it.  The finish is 5 coats of poly.  This would be a great gun to sporterize.  The condition of the rest of the gun was great when I received it.  
It cost me $209 to buy the gun, have it shipped, and pay my local dealer the transfer fees.

It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Feel free to make me an offer!!!

The A.R.M.S. #39 A2 Plus Mount is engineered for the A1 and A2 carry handles on M16 rifles. This mount features a design that locks both into the carry handle as well as the handle front support. It utilizes dual A.R.M.S. self locking thumbnuts for easy adjustments. It offers a strong support for the dovetail platform that is extended over the hand guards in a similar fashion as the patended Swan Super Extended Sleeve. The A2 Plus mount comes with the A.R.M.S./Swan/aka Mil-Std. 1913 rail machined to match the top of the carry handle, similar to the A.R.M.S. #2 M16A1A2 Scope Mount. This mount also features dual mounting capabilities and maintains the enhanced iron and optic see-through function. This bi-level mounting capability offers multiple attachments combinations requiring no tools. A brush breaker at the front prevents branches and foreign objects from wedging between the hand guards and the suspended rail. This design offers perfect parallel alignment for optics and lasers while eliminating head and other vibrations that may be experienced in barrel mounting systems. NOTE: It does not fit on detachable handles."

Gun needs to be sold today.  I paid $1050 for the gun.  Make me a cash offer, but do not lowball me...I won't bother responding.  If you want the ammo too, we can figure out a number that will make both of us happy.

Thanks,

The unique LWRCI‚Ñ¢ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16‚Äù barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20‚Äù barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R‚Ñ¢ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.
The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

Here is a great review of the REPR by the wsell known Guns and Ammo Author Dick Metcalf.

The unique LWRCI‚Ñ¢ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16‚Äù barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20‚Äù barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R‚Ñ¢ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.
The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

These are very high quality Gen 1+ Night Vision monocular with resolution equal to a Gen 2 unit. They lack the microchannel plate (which is why they are not Gen 2) but they are a cut above the typical Gen 1 ""Ghost Hunter"" and other low cost optics. Probably the best entry-level night vision on the market.

This package includes everything needed to mount it to a helmet and go. Both front and back lenses have hand cut, anti-fog treated lexan shields to protect them from impacts, and the unit comes with a flip-cap daylight cover as well. 

This spark has been modified to work with a standard USGI J-arm or other arms that use the J-arm thread pitch. Includes J-arm and USGI Rhino Arm, as well as the original daylight cap and an Armasight pouch/carry case. The unit has less than 10 hours of use and is in excellent shape.

Its so nive because it enhances lessons the reciol with the nasty looking break, and made the AK47 more compact, and the forgrip, is also a nice addition. Ak47's were not made to be paper punching super accurate rifles. They were made to be assault rifles, effective 300 meters and inward, which is fine by me, since most firefights I were in were within 100 meters more or less. With the already low reciol of 7.62x39 ( low reciol in my opinion ) lessoned even more follow up shoots are much more accurate, and still has the punch of 7.62, meaning most cover now becomes concealment. The rifle comes with an Ultimax rail, which is set lower than most rails, allowing the shooter to co witness iron sights and most red dots. I have a cheaper Tasco reddot ill throw in, it may be inexpensive, but it holds its zero very well, its just a lil bulky imho. Also includes 5 mags 4 30 round and 1 20 round.

The pistol has holster wear on the Right side, however it's limited to the grip area only.   This USP functions flawlessly as you should expect from H&K. 


The Barrel is 99%- almost everything about this HK says it was not fired much.


I have 2 13 round magazines with extended floor plates for better grip. I replaced the magazine springs as well- so they are new. I have the H&K Box as well.


I would SELL as well- make a reasonable offer. This is not a distress sale, and don't need to sell it, just want to have something else.


I would TRADE for a Sig P226 40, or other Sigs in 45- full size.  I like H&K 45s, 1911s and other Quality pistols.  I am NOT interested in 9mm or Compact pistols. No Glocks please.  I would be open to any Quality firearm trade or trade + Cash. I do like WWI and WWII Rifles as well

All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency‚Äîeven after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

These pistols include a speed loader and ship in Glock branded padded hard cases.

-Stained solid wood stock and forearm; blade and ramp front sight; adjustable rear sight
-Lever-cocking, spring air action
-Shoots up to 350 feet per second; 650 shot capacity
-Recommended for ages 10 and older with adult supervision

The Red Ryder BB Gun is a lever-action, spring piston air gun with a smooth bore barrel, adjustable iron sights, and a gravity feed magazine with a 650 BB capacity. It differs from the standard Daisy lever action BB guns by the addition of an engraved stock, and a saddle ring with leather thong on the receiver. A youth model airgun, the BB gun produces velocities of about 280 feet per second (85 m/s), though on newer models it says it is capable of shooting at 350 feet per second (110 m/s) with standard steel BBs. This has been proven true, and newer models usually retain 375 ft/s (114 m/s) velocity. The effective range is fairly short, about 10 yards (9 m), after which the low velocity and inaccuracy of the smooth bore barrel makes hitting the target difficult. BB guns are shot competitively at distances of 5 yards (4.5 m), but the rudimentary open sights on the Red Ryder make it impractical for competition, and it is primarily a plinking airgun."

It is a Custom Novak. My requirements were that the Late Great Joe Bonar make the gun for me and he did.  It took about 1.5 years and It was built to the HRT spec of that time which required a 1.25"" group at 25 yards.  The gun started out as a stainless springfield at Joe Bonar's direction(what he prefered at the time).  I shipped him the gun and he built it to the FBI HRT spec.  Once finished he then shipped the gun to Metalife for their chrome bonding process.  After he got the gun back he did some more fitting and then sent it to Walter Birdsong for his Black T coating.  Which makes this gun impervious to the weather.  High quality buffalo horn grips finished it off.  Needless to say, just to build a gun like this today would be around $4k or more and to have a master like Joe Bonar do it would be even more.  Additionally the time and cost of the added finishes would increase it further.

New Para Ordnance Tactical Target Rifle. This is a great firearm. Comes new unfired from the factory with factory hard case and all factory paper work. Comes with one 30 round magazine. From the factory: The Para Ordnance Tactical Target Upper Assembly features the DIGS (Delayed Impingement Gas System) which makes it the Smallest, Big Rifle in the World. PARA's Tactical Target Rifle (TTR) is the safest shooing, cleanest running rifle because of the DIGS. This revolutionary operating system takes zero time to master and you can instantly start hitting laser-straight shots from any position and you get back on target faster than with any other rifle. DIGS virtually eliminates felt recoil making you the best shot you can be. The Tactical Target Rifle''s gas system not only improves target acquisition but it also keeps the chamber area cleaner. The gases that flow through the tube inside the op-rod are expelled through the Manifold Injector System‚Ñ¢ (MIS‚Ñ¢) in the bolt carrier making it the cleanest running autoloading rifle in the world. The Rapid Deployment Stock‚Ñ¢ (RDS‚Ñ¢) reduces the overall length of the Tactical Target Rifle by almost 10-inches when the stock is folded. The unique 5-position sliding stock means that whether you are 5-foot 4"" or 6-foot 4"" the Tactical Target Rifle will fit you.Caliber: 5.56 Nato Barrel: 16.5 inches Chrome Lined Twist: 1 in 9 inches Action: Semi-automatic Receiver: Flat topped with full length Picatinny Rail Magazines: 1 - 30-round Overall Length: Stock Open and Fully Extended - 36 inches Stock Open and telescoped in - 33 inches Stock Folded - 26.25 inches Weight: 7.6 pounds Additional Features: Field strips with no tools, Multiple sling mount points."

This sub-machine pistol is chambered in 7.62x25 and will be coming with 150rounds of its 7.62x25 ammo as well as two 35round mags included in this package also! This is a very rare gun that is not easily found nowadays due to its collectibility and rarity which makes this beautiful sub-machine pistol incredibly difficult to come across with all of the World War 2 firearm collectors. However if you're not interested in obtaining only for collection, this makes for a great home defense weapon or even just a great time at the range and is in great shape for future years of flawless functionality since it is VERY much LIKE NEW seeing as it has only EVER had 70rounds that have ever been fired through this gun! To a collector, this package is worth WELL over what I am asking for so my price is FIRM at $600 for the total package! So the first $600 in my hand will be getting this Polish Sub-Machine Gun Pistol PPS-43c, 150rounds of 7.62x25 ammo, and two 35round mags to go with it! 

THANKS FOR LOOKING!"
