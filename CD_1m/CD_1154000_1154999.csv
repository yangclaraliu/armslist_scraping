Built during the 1980's they earned a bad reputation due to a number of design changes and reliability issues that resulted from them.  This pistol has been extensively reworked to correct as many of the problems as is possible but it is still not what I would call a personal defense gun.  Biggest problem is its ejectorless design.  Like the Lorcin and Davis/Jennings autos it relies on the inertia of the slide to eject the spent round.  Not an ideal solution as it doesn't always work.  There were other problems too, such as the lack of a guide rod from the factory and a poor design of the trigger.  I have installed a custom made stainless full length guide rod and remanufactured the trigger.  These things have helped, but again this is a cheap pistol and it will always be a cheap pistol.  I'm selling it 'AS-IS' for parts or repair.   Not interested in going any lower on my price, but I might consider trades for other guns, gun parts.   Lowballers and tire kickers don't waste my time or yours.  Willing to meet face to face withing about a 20 mile radius of Carthage, MO.

46,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1154046,For Sale:  MOBILIZE! Make your voice heard at a local meeting with senators!,"Throughout  the state!, Colorado, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 27, 2013",Events,no type,no type,no type,no type,"As you know, House Bills 1224, 1226, 1228, and 1229, all of which would greatly restrict the rights of gun owners, will soon be heard by the Colorado State Senate. Our timetable for stopping these bills is getting shorter and shorter; they are going to be introduced in the senate over the next few days and heard in committee early next week.

Every one of these bills is completely absurd. I recently stated in a Denver Post article that House Bill 1229, which would require universal background checks for firearms transfers, would criminalize gun owners for loaning a gun to their nephew or close friend and could only be enforced through a statewide gun registry. Bills like HB 1229 can be summed up in three words: “Ridiculous. Unnecessary. Dangerous.” You can read the full-text of my article here: http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_22673810/gun-bill-dangerous-unnecessary

The Democrats have scheduled all of these bills to be heard by their respective committees on the same day at the same time. They will be heard at 1:30pm on Monday the 4th. I suspect that this is an effort to sneak these gun control measures past Colorado gun owners by making it difficult for concerned citizens and experts to testify. Don’t let them get away with this. Please make your voice heard by coming to the capitol on Monday. Be sure to come early to sign up to testify, as there will be a lot of witnesses.

Now more than ever it is crucial that you contact your state senator and ask them to vote “no” on all of these bills. If you’re not sure who your local legislators are, you can find out on this site by typing in your zip code: http://votesmart.org/. You can also find your legislators’ contact information at http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/csl.nsf/Directory?openFrameset for the House and http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/csl.nsf/DirectorySen?openframeset for the Senate. As always, in addition to succinctly voicing your opinions on the bills, it would be great to remind your legislators that you will be keeping their votes on these anti-gun bills in mind during the 2014 election.

As has become the norm for their party, senate Democrats are trying to avoid talking to gun owners by either not scheduling townhall meetings over the weekend or making information on those meetings hard to find. Below is some information on a few townhalls going on tonight and Saturday. I will send you more information on townhalls as it becomes available. Also, if any of you can bring a video camera to a townhall meeting, we’d love to capture it on film.

108,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1154108,For Sale:  Gun Control HELP,"Denver, Denver, Colorado","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, February 27, 2013",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19),no type,no type,"From Senator Greg Brophy,

As you know, House Bills 1224, 1226, 1228, and 1229, all of which would greatly restrict the rights of gun owners, will soon be heard by the Colorado State Senate. Our timetable for stopping these bills is getting shorter and shorter; they are going to be introduced in the senate over the next few days and heard in committee early next week.

Every one of these bills is completely absurd. I recently stated in a Denver Post article that House Bill 1229, which would require universal background checks for firearms transfers, would criminalize gun owners for loaning a gun to their nephew or close friend and could only be enforced through a statewide gun registry. Bills like HB 1229 can be summed up in three words: “Ridiculous. Unnecessary. Dangerous.” You can read the full-text of my article here: http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_22673810/gun-bill-dangerous-unnecessary

The Democrats have scheduled all of these bills to be heard by their respective committees on the same day at the same time. They will be heard at 1:30pm on Monday the 4th. I suspect that this is an effort to sneak these gun control measures past Colorado gun owners by making it difficult for concerned citizens and experts to testify. Don’t let them get away with this. Please make your voice heard by coming to the capitol on Monday. Be sure to come early to sign up to testify, as there will be a lot of witnesses.

Now more than ever it is crucial that you contact your state senator and ask them to vote “no” on all of these bills. If you’re not sure who your local legislators are, you can find out on this site by typing in your zip code: http://votesmart.org/. You can also find your legislators’ contact information at http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/csl.nsf/Directory?openFrameset for the House and http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/csl.nsf/DirectorySen?openframeset for the Senate. As always, in addition to succinctly voicing your opinions on the bills, it would be great to remind your legislators that you will be keeping their votes on these anti-gun bills in mind during the 2014 election.

As has become the norm for their party, senate Democrats are trying to avoid talking to gun owners by either not scheduling townhall meetings over the weekend or making information on those meetings hard to find. Below is some information on a few townhalls going on tonight and Saturday. I will send you more information on townhalls as it becomes available. Also, if any of you can bring a video camera to a townhall meeting, we’d love to capture it on film.

Please call your local city council or Republican Party or do a Google search to find additional town hall meetings going on in your area.

It’s crunch time. We really need let the Democrats know that their constituents oppose these bills. They need to listen to their constituents instead of Mayor Bloomberg and VP Biden.

Sincerely,
Senator Greg Brophy"

As you know, House Bills 1224, 1226, 1228, and 1229, all of which would greatly restrict the rights of gun owners, will soon be heard by the Colorado State Senate. Our timetable for stopping these bills is getting shorter and shorter; they are going to be introduced in the senate over the next few days and heard in committee early next week.

Every one of these bills is completely absurd. I recently stated in a Denver Post article that House Bill 1229, which would require universal background checks for firearms transfers, would criminalize gun owners for loaning a gun to their nephew or close friend and could only be enforced through a statewide gun registry. Bills like HB 1229 can be summed up in three words: “Ridiculous. Unnecessary. Dangerous.” You can read the full-text of my article here: http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_22673810/gun-bill-dangerous-unnecessary

The Democrats have scheduled all of these bills to be heard by their respective committees on the same day at the same time. They will be heard at 1:30pm on Monday the 4th. I suspect that this is an effort to sneak these gun control measures past Colorado gun owners by making it difficult for concerned citizens and experts to testify. Don’t let them get away with this. Please make your voice heard by coming to the capitol on Monday. Be sure to come early to sign up to testify, as there will be a lot of witnesses.

Now more than ever it is crucial that you contact your state senator and ask them to vote “no” on all of these bills. If you’re not sure who your local legislators are, you can find out on this site by typing in your zip code: http://votesmart.org/. You can also find your legislators’ contact information at http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/csl.nsf/Directory?openFrameset for the House and http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/csl.nsf/DirectorySen?openframeset for the Senate. As always, in addition to succinctly voicing your opinions on the bills, it would be great to remind your legislators that you will be keeping their votes on these anti-gun bills in mind during the 2014 election.

As has become the norm for their party, senate Democrats are trying to avoid talking to gun owners by either not scheduling townhall meetings over the weekend or making information on those meetings hard to find. Below is some information on a few townhalls going on tonight and Saturday. I will send you more information on townhalls as it becomes available. Also, if any of you can bring a video camera to a townhall meeting, we’d love to capture it on film."

These are not shooters (I have never shot them) but are collector grade. The first rifle is a 1898 Tula M91 - it was either Finnish Captured/purchased and bears the ""D"" for upgrade to Finnish D166 Cartridge - The sights have also been hashed and renumbered for this round. It is in a beautiful Finnish two piece  M91 Stock. Stock Condition is great, bluing condition is very worn but no rust. Just honest wear for being a 115 year old rifle. 
The second rifle is the best Condition M44 you will ever find - this like the M91 is non import marked as well - it is in a wartime stock with no sling estouchons which is correct for its production date of 1944. It is all matching and does not have any of the typical Ukranian rebulid marks. 
I can provide pictures for interested buyers - a true milsurp collector knows the worth of these - if you want a shooter I would steer you away from these.
Price is $400 each

With TriViz deer/turkey sights.
Ambidextrous. That is how many shooters describe the BPS. And it is true. But the advantages are more than just being a great shotgun for the left- OR right-handed shooter. The bottom ejection design and full, two-sided steel receiver combine for a level of durability and strength that is not common among pump action shotguns today. The design is totally balanced, with matching dual steel slide action bars -- one on each side -- that balance forces for very smooth pumping. Top tang safety is functional convenience to the max. The receiver forms a ""roof"" over the action-- there is no opening on either side for an ejection port, so a drenching rain won't drip into the action. When you shoot bottom ejection makes sure there are no empties flying to the side, across your line of sight,  to distract your aim. Those that shoot a BPS are a unique bunch . . . a bit more serious about their hunting guns than most? Yes!
Bottom Ejection and Loading
    Bottom ejection throws empty shells straight down, out of the line of sight, and makes the BPS the ultimate pump for right- or left-handed shooters. Bottom loading provides operating convenience.
Reliable Pump-Action
    The proven pump-action design of the BPS is sound and reliable. All components are durably constructed of solid steel and are housed inside a receiver machined from a solid block of forged steel. Rigid double slide bars are made from heat-treated steel and eliminate twisting and binding for faster, more efficient operation. The result is smooth operation in all conditions and the ability to stay on target while delivering rapid follow-up shots. A convenient serrated slide release is located at the rear of the trigger guard.
Safety
    The thumb-operated, top-tang safety on the BPS can be easily operated by right- and left-handed shooters alike, even with gloved fingers.
Magazine Capacity
    2 3/4"": Four in magazine, one in chamber. 3"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. 3 1/2"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. A three-shot magazine adapter plug is included.
Back-Bored Barrels
    12 gauge BPS shotguns feature Back-Bored Technology.
Choke Tubes
    12 and 20 gauge BPS shotguns include the interchangeable Invector-Plus™ choke tube system. 28 gauge and .410 bore BPS shotguns include the Standard Invector™ system.
    The BPS was recently reviewed on the TV show MustHaveOutdoors.com. You might want to take a look at this video from the show (provided courtesy www.musthavehoutoors)"

bushmaster

One of the world's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models, the Bushmaster M4 features the distinctive M4 barrel profile and a six-position telestock for ease of deployment. The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a ""birdcage"" type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9 right-handed twist. Shipped complete with 30-round magazine, a safety and operations manual, and a carrying sling.

Specially angled flutes hide nearly 100% muzzle flash, even during full-auto fire, by dissipating gas and retaining unburned powder for increased residual burn. Gas dissipation works particularly well on short barreled rifles, where large muzzle flash is common. The G6A3 is constructed of the same 8620 bar stock steel used in the manufacture of AR-15/M16 bolts and carriers, then heat-treated to provide a high-strength core and tough, outer shell.

Special, helix design helps align exiting barrel gas to improve accuracy with all bullet types. Skirt extension conceals gap between barrel shoulder and flash hider on AR-15, M16, and M4 rifles. Grooved base ring allows integration of Blank Firing Attachment (BFA) used by law enforcement trainers, and permits installation of the Smith Enterprise M4DC CQB sound and flash suppressor (available factory direct to USG/LE and FMS customers). Helical grooves cut on the surface of the G6A3 allow for easy removal and installation of the M4DC suppressor.

Thread-on design requires no washer. Torque to 10 ft. lbs. maximum, self-tightens as weapon is fired. Use M-193, SS-109 (M855) and MK 262 service ammo for highest degree of flash suppression.

This H&R Pardner® youth single shot .410 has a custom camo covering. It also comes with a custom .32 caliber sleeve that allows greater versatility for hunting different game.
A companion for every day in the field. At H&R, they’re proud of their single-shot heritage and the fact they’ve been a part of the American hunting and shooting tradition from the beginning. This versatile and economical shotgun design has changed very little since they started building them back in 1893, because it works. Their break actions have long been the choice of straight-shooters who want the most out of their single shot at game or a clay target. They’re lightweight, quickpointing and have very few moving parts to maintain. These guns open smoothly when you press the lever, lock up tight as a bank vault door, and H&R's Transfer Bar System acts as a safety to prevent unintended firing. Also, each gun comes complete with its own special locking device for safe storage. The Pardner® lineup pays homage to their total entrenchment in the shooting sports with a wide range of options to cover every situation and budget.
All models are single shot, break-open action with side lever release, automatic ejection.

Keeping with our philosophy of tailoring a rifle to the needs of the sportsman, like the 6.8, the 300AAC Blackout is lightweight, modular, utilizes a Picatinny Rail system and adjustable butt-stock.  Never before seen with the AR platform, the Ambush 300AAC Blackout fires 7.62 x 35 rounds while remaining compatible with the standard M4 Bolt Carrier Group and existing magazines.


Details


Other features include the Cold Hammer Forged, 1:8 twist, 16” S2W Profile barrel and shotgun-inspired hand grip, and is available in REALTREE AP™, MOSSY OAK® BREAK UP® INFINITY™, or MOSSY OAK® BLAZE® PINK. Whether chasing after a wild boar or anticipating a 10 point mule deer, the Ambush 300AAC Blackout supplies ample knock-down power while reducing recoil.

The Ambush Firearms 300 BlackOut is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions.  The testing of the Ambush Firearms 300 Blackout firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend.  Although, through our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

I am looking for two handguns.  I prefer a 1911 either full or officer and another smaller conceal for my wife (380 or 9mm that can easily be put in her purse).  I am not looking for anything cheap like Jimenez or hi-point, but just good quality guns.  May consider rock Island or like 1911's if there is a good second weapon option.  

I would also consider a good 1911 and some cash which I can buy a smaller concealed carry for my wife.  so if you don't have both, make an offer with cash and a 1911.  THanks."
