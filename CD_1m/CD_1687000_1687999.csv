www.edgetactical.net
Specifications Length 8.70 inches Width 1.66 inches Weight Empty 6.4 ounces Weight Loaded 2.02 pounds The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

This collectable pistol is in great working condition, shoots straight and has a strong slide spring and good rifling in the barrel.  As you can see from the pictures it needs some bluing work on the top slide from holster wear.  It comes with a 9 round brand new magazine (and the original 7 round if I can find it) Make me a good offer or trade and I'll deal fairly.  I hate to sell any of my firearms but times are tough and I am having to sacrifice.  My plan was to fix the bluing and let my wife carry it, but she's going to have to wait until finances turn around. (she's pretty tough without a gun, so I am not too worried about it :-)

I know the law in NC so please no funny stuff.  You must be a resident of NC, and must have a valid pistol permit issued by the sheriffs office in your county.  A valid ID issued by the state of NC or drivers license issued by NC DMV will be copied and attached to a bill of sale. If you have a valid unexpired concealed carry permit you do not need a pistol purchase permit.

Things considered for trade:

Assault rifles
Ammo (7.62x39)

I am really needing cash to pay bills so trade is less considered, but if you want to combo trade/cash we can most likely work something out."

If you don't know anything about these, they're great little carry guns, basically a poor man's Walther PPK.  Would be an excellent choice for someone who likes to carry a gun but is very sensitive to weight, these will easily slip into and dissapear into a pocket.
Fires the cheap and readily available 9mm Makarov round (NOT a 9mm luger! This is a 9x18mm makarov).  These have a fixed barrel and are quite accurate.

This particular model was made in 1967, and is about 90% condition, has some muzzle wear and some light scratches but nothing major, and functions just fine.  
Comes with one mag and 250 rounds of FMJ Makarov ammo.  Extra magazines are readily available online for about $20.

I will sell it  for $250 cash FIRM, but I am more interested in  other firearm trades.

I'm pretty open for trades, looking for something around $300 in trade value.  I'd like a nice 12 guage pump shotgun like a Remington 870 or Mossberg 500, preferably with a 20 inch barrel and black synthetic furniture.  No double or single barrels or 20 guages, already have some.

I'm also interested in full sized hand guns like a Taurus PT-92 or pt-100, or millenium in .40 or .45, or just about anything else, but no 22's, and no revolvers or hi points (already have some of each).  Would add some cash for a Rock Island 1911.

I would also be interested in a .308 or 7.62x51mm bolt action rifle (preferably with a scope).

I replaced the stock with an ATI top folding stock with a five shot saddle and pistol grip. I replaced the forend with an AIM tri-rail forend and added a magpul angled fore grip. I also have the original stock and forend with all the hardware. The stock and barrel nut have sling swivels and I have a single point sling and a 15 round shell holder sling as well. 

The shotgun has a custom rattlesnake type camo job. It was not done professionally but looks good. It has not been fired since the camo job so it shows only minor wear from handling.

I also have shells to go with the package. I have:

100 Royal Buck 00 Buck 2 3/4

15 Assorted buckshot and birdshot

I have a very lightly used, pristine condition Rock River Arms National Match A4 up for sale. Has only had 60 rounds fired through it during one range session, and thoroughly cleaned afterwards. The rifle shoots great, and sights were dialed in fairly well from the factory (I made no adjustments).

Features of the National Match version are:
-20"" chrome-lined heavy barrel (better accuracy because of length and weight)
-Removable carry handle with rear sight that you can flip between short and long range (long range sight capable up to 600 yards per Rock River Arms)
-Ambidextrous safety lever (one on each side)
-Two Stage trigger

This particular rifle has also had a Magpul PRS adjustable stock installed at the Rock River factory before it went out the door. Will also include standard stock.

Willing to part with for $1200 (great deal) (pretty firm, but negotiable) - Don't want to sell but need the money.  CASH ONLY - DELAWARE RESIDENTS ONLY - FACE TO FACE ONLY

I believe new Delaware law requires private sales to go through ffl, I will have to check up on that. If that hasn't been enacted yet, I have no problem not going through an ffl; we can just fill out a bill of sale for own records. 
*Edit: New law doesn't go in effect until July 1st, so no ffl is needed. I will print out 2 bills of sale we will both fill out so that we each have one for our records. 

Would like to sell today (Wednesday). Price is semi-negotiable but pretty firm. 


Thanks!!

Would prefer to meet up in New Castle County, but can meet as far south as Dover if needed. Please have cash in hand, and Delaware ID ready to go."

If anything should malfunction (Which it has NEVER given me one problem), they will replace no questions asked, unless its something you did to the pistol in neglect. I am just seeing whats out there for possible trade. I don't want any cheap guns or anything smaller.

If you don't know anything about these, they're great little carry guns, basically a poor man's Walther PPK. Would be an excellent choice for someone who likes to carry a gun but is very sensitive to weight, these will easily slip into and disappear into a pocket.
Fires the cheap and readily available 9mm Makarov round (NOT a 9mm luger! This is a 9x18mm makarov). These have a fixed barrel and are quite accurate.

This particular model was made in 1967, and is about 90% condition, has some muzzle wear and some light scratches but nothing major, and functions just fine. 
Comes with one mag and about 50 rounds of FMJ Makarov ammo. Extra magazines are readily available online for about $20.

Description:

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

The PMAG 30 Gen M3 incorporates additional external improvements to the magazine catch and bolt catch notch areas that have expanded its firearm compatibility to include more than the AR-15 platform alone. It is also fully functional with the FN SCAR-16, the British SA-80, and the HK416/IAR/M27 platforms. The drop-free characteristics of the PMAG were also improved to ensure compatibility with a wider range of magazine wells, including those with tighter tolerances than mil-spec. Made in the USA.

This is a North American Arms .22 short, the smallest functional firearm commercially produced, designed for deep concealment. Only 4 oz, stainless steel, holds 5 rounds. These have a very limited production run, only once per year, and those generally are just to cover backorders. You don't see these come up for sale very often.

Has been carried a bit, fired rarely. Excellent overall condition. This is a newer version with the notched cylinder so it's safe to keep all chambers loaded. Comes with a carrying case and the paperwork, lock, shell casing, etc. I'll also throw in a box of ammo and a really nice pocket holster.

No trades, CASH only. Must be willing to meet near the greater Denver area during daylight hours. Only asking $220 and price is firm. WILL NOT SHIP.
