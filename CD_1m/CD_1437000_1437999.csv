DANIEL DEFENSE 300 BLACKOUT!!!!
Description:
Daniel Defense’s 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm. The 300 Blackout is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions. The testing of the Daniel Defense 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend. Although, though our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

Light, compact and easy to conceal
Five-shot .38 Special+P
Recoil-taming Hogue or Crimson Trace grips
The Ruger Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR) is a light, small-frame handgun with a smooth, easy-to-control trigger and highly manageable recoil. Its patent-pending polymer fire-control housing holds components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduces weight significantly and reduces recoil. An optimized friction-reducing cam results in a smooth, nonstacking trigger pull. The cylinder and barrel are supported by a monolithic, aerospace-grade aluminum frame treated with a black synergistic hard coat to reduce weight and enhance durability. The cylinder is strong 400 Series stainless steel, extensively fluted to reduce weight and is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s durable Target Grey® finish. Five-shot capacity.
Available:
LCR – Chambered in .38 Special+P and outfitted with a Hogue® Tamer™ grip to reduce perceived recoil. Integral U-notch rear sight. Replaceable, pinned, ramp-style front sight.

LCR-LG – Same as the model above but with the added advantage of Crimson Trace® Lasergrips® for fast target acquisition and follow-up shots.

LCR-LM – Standard LCR with LaserMax front-mount laser for positive target acquisition and follow-up shots.

LCR-BGXS – Outfitted with a recoil-absorbing Hogue Boot Grip, U-notch rear sight and an XS® standard dot tritium front sight for quick target acquisition in low light. Chambered in .38 Special+P.

KLCR-357 – Chambered in potent .357 Magnum. Blackened stainless finish. Integral U-notch rear sight. Replaceable, pinned, ramp-style front sight. Hogue Tamer grip reduces perceived recoil."

This gun has run flawlessly regardless of what brand or type of ammo I've fed through it.  Both .223 and 5.56.  The upper came from the factory as a 11.5"" barrel and so the port was drilled accordingly to adjust for the gas level.  The lower is a PSA lower that I bought a few years back and has the pictograms instead of the safe/fire markings (like the H&K MP5's) and also has a low shelf in case you ever feel the need to (legally) obtain a RDIAS and run the gun in full auto.  All in all it's a really great looking pistol and can easily be converted to a Short Barrel Rifle by obtaining the tax stamp and changing out the buffer tube.  Surprisingly this thing shoots softer and more accurately than my 16"" bravo company upper.  Of course know the law and if you have any questions feel free to ask me.  I'll have pictures up this evening, or if you email me I can send you some straight from my phone.  Just haven't uploaded them to my computer yet."

By purchasing you acknowledge and fully understand the statement below. (copied from [url]http://www.calegalmags.com/Rebuild-Kit-Info_ep_42.html[/url])

Rebuild Kit Info   READ PRIOR TO PURCHASING

*Regarding Rebuild Kits*

A ""REBUILD KIT"" is a complete magazine that has been disassembled into parts. 

It contains all the original parts of the magazine that have been taken apart before being shipped into California to comply with state and local laws. I do not remove any parts of the rebuild kit before i ship to buyers

Rebuild kits are not to be used to assemble a new high capacity magazine which would be in violation of local or state law. These rebuild kits are intended to rebuild a legally owned pre-ban magazine or for assembling a 10 round magazine pursuant to local or state law.

You can assemble your rebuild kit into a magazine when you are outside of CA or at a location at which you are legally allowed to possess a high capacity magazine. For example: You can take your rebuild kit from California to Arizona, assemble it, use it, and take it apart before you return to California. Many of buyers are competition shooters who reside in CA but travel the country shooting and require rebuild kits for competition. Others attend weapon training facilities in other states where they are legally allowed to assemble and use rebuild kits as magazines. Just be sure you take them apart completely before returning to California. 

By purchasing a rebuild kit(s) the purchaser accepts sole responsibility to remain in accordance with local or state law and any failure to do so will be the purchasers responsibility. I accepts no liability whatsoever for misuse or negligence on the part of the purchaser. 

It is the responsibility of the buyer to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, and federal laws in regard to the possession, use, and sale of any item purchased from me.

I do not sell hi-capacity magazines period. 

Please consult the CA DOJ and/or your local ATF office if you have any legality related questions. Calegalmags is simply a retail business, we do not answer or respond to any legal or regulation related questions for liability reasons."

By purchasing you acknowledge and fully understand the statement below. (copied from [url]http://www.calegalmags.com/Rebuild-Kit-Info_ep_42.html[/url])

Rebuild Kit Info   READ PRIOR TO PURCHASING

*Regarding Rebuild Kits*

A ""REBUILD KIT"" is a complete magazine that has been disassembled into parts. 

It contains all the original parts of the magazine that have been taken apart before being shipped into California to comply with state and local laws. I do not remove any parts of the rebuild kit before i ship to buyers

Rebuild kits are not to be used to assemble a new high capacity magazine which would be in violation of local or state law. These rebuild kits are intended to rebuild a legally owned pre-ban magazine or for assembling a 10 round magazine pursuant to local or state law.

You can assemble your rebuild kit into a magazine when you are outside of CA or at a location at which you are legally allowed to possess a high capacity magazine. For example: You can take your rebuild kit from California to Arizona, assemble it, use it, and take it apart before you return to California. Many of buyers are competition shooters who reside in CA but travel the country shooting and require rebuild kits for competition. Others attend weapon training facilities in other states where they are legally allowed to assemble and use rebuild kits as magazines. Just be sure you take them apart completely before returning to California. 

By purchasing a rebuild kit(s) the purchaser accepts sole responsibility to remain in accordance with local or state law and any failure to do so will be the purchasers responsibility. I accepts no liability whatsoever for misuse or negligence on the part of the purchaser. 

It is the responsibility of the buyer to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, and federal laws in regard to the possession, use, and sale of any item purchased from me.

I do not sell hi-capacity magazines period. 

Please consult the CA DOJ and/or your local ATF office if you have any legality related questions. Calegalmags is simply a retail business, we do not answer or respond to any legal or regulation related questions for liability reasons."

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel (Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitrating converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitrating process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

The LWRC REPR is being currently deployed with U.S. and British troops overseas. The REPR is accurate enough that it is substituting for the bolt action sniper rifles in some multi role applications.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. This rifle is the Sniper version which includes the Geissele trigger. To complete the system all you would need to get is a short barreled upper.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes a patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers."

Description:
Redi-Fit versions of the Xcoil pad from HiViz Shooting Systems are consctucted of a compostie proven superior at dampening recoil. Our testing has shown that the Xcoil absorbs felt recoil more effectively than any other recoil pad currently available. With today's trend toward magnum and short magnum rifle califers and 3 1/2"" magnum shotgun loads, it is vital to have an effective recoil pad. ""Magnum"" level energy pushing a projectile out the muzzle means magnum-level recoil on your shoulder. The XCoil is the answer. But there's more to the XCoil than simply cushion. The uniques texture of the XCoil's composition resists slipping when shouldered for consistent gun positioning. Too often, shooters look for a slick pad believing that it will compensate for careless shouldering of the firearm. The slippery nature of such pads means the gun easily moves between shots. Such movement is the reason for most bruising and missed second shots on the range and in the field."

This gun was made in the mid 90s and is an ex-Swiss law-enforcement weapon. It was once issued to an officer of their State Police or Highway Patrol. The slide is the heavier milled stainless steel part instead of the earlier stamped one, and has the Swiss canton regional crest(Vaud) on the left side. Since it was an issued weapon there is some finish wear, but this doesn't affect anything. In fact I think it gives the gun some character. Also, because this gun was made in the 1990s with the updated milled slide, it has none of the problems that some of the newer post-2004 Cohen-era Sig pistols have. This one has the best features from a time when Sig built nothing but the best.

With the pistol comes 5 high capacity mags: 3 factory 15-rounders(including one  post-'94 Ban-era 'zipper-back'), a new Mec/Gar 17-rounder, and a Mec/Gar 20 round mag. If you are left-handed I will include a kydex OWB holster by Shadow Holsters of Minnesota. Ammo in the mag pic not included."

The next-generation PMAG 20 GEN M3 is a 20-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) 
polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set 
and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and 
manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to 
exceed rigorous military performance specifications. 

Modified internal 
and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec 
platforms such as the HK&re g; 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® 
SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the 
magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on 
the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. 


The PMAG 20 GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring 
for commonality, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal 
geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease 
cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be 
used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during 
storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture 
gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot 
matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by 
the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate 
aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop 
protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with 
tight double and triple magazine pouches. 

Please note that the PMAG 
Ranger will NOT work with the new GEN M3. It will be getting its own Ranger 
design and we'll provide more info as it becomes available. Basically, GEN M3 
accessories/components will only work with GEN M3 magazines, including its 
Impact/Dust Cover.

The LWRC REPR is being currently deployed with U.S. and British troops overseas. The REPR is accurate enough that it is substituting for the bolt action sniper rifles in some multi role applications.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. This rifle is the Sniper version which includes the Geissele trigger. To complete the system all you would need to get is a short barreled upper.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes a patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers."

The sum of all parts if you wanted to order them new would come out to well over $5,000 and a very long wait. I don't really want to sell this as it has a lot of sentiment with me but I don't get a chance to shoot it and need cash for hunting rifles for me and my boy. The sale includes: Springfield armory barreled receiver in .308 (shoots both .308 and 7.62), unitized gas cylinder. Springfield armory trigger group, cleaned up and frog lubed. Factory LBs, breaks like glass. Sadlak Industries 82nd airborne mount. Rock solid steel 3 points of contact on receiver. Irons sights can be used and ran up to 1K setting underneath the mount. SWFA SS10x42M With butler creek flip ups and long sunshade. Shoots the box like a champ. Chosen for its consistency and durability. Was contracted by the Navy for their 50 cals because of its ruggedness and submersibility in salt water. Burris Xtreme tactical medium rings. JAE Gen 2 Dark Green stock Like new not even marks from the gun safe. Stock was designed to squeeze the most accuracy and consistancy out of M1A and M-14 style rifles. Full aluminum bedded for accuracy. Additional factory options included: Barrel tensioner (Allows to be tuned for accuracy, counteracts accuracy lost from barrel heat during rapid fire), grip rest, front bottom rail for bipod, adjustable cheek rest with spacers, off hand grip with rail for mono pod, QD cups all over the place for quick disconnect sling mounts, 2 quick disconnect sling mounts, butt pad, and monopod (I believe the monopod is made by accushot and supplied to JAE.) These are all JAE parts and can be found on their website. Harris bipod, with horizontal swivel. All rifle metal has been treated with frog lube so that the rifle does not need to be constantly broken down for cleaning and re-zeroed. 1 20 rd Springfield steel mag 7 20 rd ProMag steel mags 1 20 rd polymer mag. 1 Springfield armory 5 or 10 round mag, can't remember which. 1 Black handguard. Brownells chamber brush. A ton of paperwork and books on m1a's. Only has superficial marks in finish at the rear sight and the handguard from installation and fitting. They are visible in the pictures. Has had 210 rounds fired. Very accurate, sub MOA with tensioner adjusted, ammo and shooter dependent. Ships to FFL only. Buyer pays shipping and FFL fees.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS inspects all cartridge cases for defects. The Scharch Range Master machines are fully automated and cases are checked for any debris and pressure tested for any splits or cracks. Primers are removed, flash holes are cleared, and primer pockets are reamed to accept new primers.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS then washes cases in an acid wash specially designed to remove all remaining burnt powder from the flash hole and interior of the case which tumbling doesn't remove. Then cases are tumbled in a dryer for a factory look and finish.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS roll sizes all cases on our own designed machines to meet S.A.A.M.I.specification. This method is the industry standard for commercial sizing, insuring the case wall is sized down to the rim which insures new component performance.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS then loads these processed components on the same fiber optic-controlled Ammo Load machines as our premium new ammo. These are the same machines used by some of the largest manufacturers in the industry. These machines assure S.A.A.M.I. specifications for priming depth, pressure and overall cartridge length.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS ""Like-New"" manufacturing process with the new projectile, powder and primer assures factory ammo performance that discriminating shooters expect.

I've got 500 rounds (10 boxes of 50) for sale. This has been kept in an ammo can, indoors. This ammo was purchased around January of this year, so it hasn't been sitting long. I'm just trying to consolidate calibers. I've personally shot about 200 rounds of this stuff, and it's great for the range.
