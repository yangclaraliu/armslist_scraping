The photo turns the upper/lower purple, just a heads up)

Started out life as a Smith and Wesson M&P-15. I built this rifle for general use - good at everything with an eye to someday do competitive shooting with it. My current job is drawing me away from extra free time to shoot, and I hate to have stuff sitting in my safe I cannot / do not have time to use. So this one goes for sale. The following are its current components up for sale. Purchased in 2004 from Cabelas in Lacey.

16"" 1-9 chrome lined barrel. No mag dumps, no missed cleaning sessions after the range.
Magpul MOE OD Green Stock.
Magpul MIAD Black grip (includes all grip panels / grip core and orginal trigger guard).
MI HK style buffer tube sling mount and single point sling.
Knights Ambi safety lever ( original right handed safety also included).
Magpul BAD lever (lefty here)
Rainer Arms RAPTOR Ambi charging handle.
Magpul MBUS Gen2 black sights front and back.
Viking Tactics 15"" Alpha Rail with all rail attachments.
Magpul AFG2 OD Green grip (Not mounted atm).
Rainier Arms RMC Comp (shoots super flat).
Vortex Viper 1-4x PST MOA (1/2 per click) 30mm scope w/ illuminated reticule (has not yet been sighted in - includes CRS Zero stop shims)
Vortex ADM-X QD 30mm scope mount with 2"" eye relief.
3 USGI 30 round Mags with Yellow Magpul Followers.
6 Magpul 30 round PMAGS
1 Mapgul 20 round PMAG.
2 USGI OTIS cleaning kits.
Eagle Universal 556 chest rig - khaki color. Holds 8 USGI/PMAGs and 4 double stack pistol mags. Purchased from SKD Tactical and never used.

$2500.00. I am not in a rush to sell. I have no health issues (yet) and have no other projects to fund. Just a ton of work over the next year getting a new business venture off the ground. I would be interested in a partial trade for a HK USP .45 V1 w/ 2+ mags and 90% (a bit of holster wear is ok by me) or a HK45 V1 same specs as USP. I would drop the price by up to $1000 for the right HK and mags.

If you are interested in the rifle and accessories but without the optic and mount, the price would be $2000.

If you are interested in the optic, please note I would only sell the mount and optic together as a package. The optic was 500 from Rainier Arms, and the mount was 200 from Optics Planet. I would sell them together for $700. That saves you tax and shipping. They are both brand new. I ain't giving the mount away for free. Don't ask.

The easiest way to contact me is through email. I will check my PMs here on the site, but it may be a day or two between checks.
faster200 at comcast.net. I will respond in kind.


I am located in the Lacey, Olympia Tumwater area and am willing to travel for the asking price."

Along with the FN-style stock and receiver outline, the MK22 has many of the same features as the rifle that inspired it. The receiver is an all-metal construction, with a Picatinny-style rail system on all receiver surfaces. This includes a barrel placement for attaching FN sights. The mussle of the precision match, 16-inch barrel is cut with a 1:28 thread to accept various muzzle breaks and flash hiders.
The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. 
Comes with 22-round magazine. The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. 
The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the gun. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage. Tan finish.

The 500AB is the 500A Mossberg shotgun with some upgrades...specifically a Walnut stock VS the various hardwood stocks found on the regular 500A model. This 500AB also has some metal etchings ,as seen in 1 photo, that the 500A doesnt have ...and it has a 30"" barrel. (Every part on this 500AB is interchangeable with the regular 500A)
This is a fixed full choke 30"" barreled shotgun. 30 inches is a long range shotgun. Perfect for Deer and Water Fowl...and predators of any nature. You get the 75-100 yard reach of a rifle, with the spread pattern of a shotgun. Full choke means it keeps it's shot pattern tight over a long distance, so you get killing/stopping power at rifle like distances. It shoots bird and buck shot...and rifled slugs. It is chambered for 2 and 3/4"" and 3.00"" shells. It functions flawlessly and it looks good. The bore is beautiful inside...slick as a whistle. It also has a metal safety switch, not a plastic one like the newer Mossbergs. It has a Tasco Red Dot scope, a good one, that enables quick sholdering and accurate firing of shotgun. For those folks who don't know what a Red Dot scope is: You turn the switch on and the red dot is displayed in the scope lens...when you look thru the scope, wherever the dot is - is where the bullet goes. If you move your head, the red dot stays on the target your pointing at and you can still see the dot as you move your head around. It makes for very quick and accurate shooting). I love this shotgun, and the new owner will too. I will trade this gun."

Innovative Cam-Lock System Completely Removes Any Slop or Play Inherent with Collapsible Stocks
Will Fit Both a Mil-Spec or Commercial Sized Buffer Tube
Weighs Only 7.3 oz.
Rugged Enough to Pass a 36"", Fully Loaded Drop Test

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the ultimate refinement in AR/M4 stock technology. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. Our stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle.

Along with the FN-style stock and receiver outline, the MK22 has many of the same features as the rifle that inspired it. The receiver is an all-metal construction, with a Picatinny-style rail system on all receiver surfaces. This includes a barrel placement for attaching FN sights. The mussle of the precision match, 16-inch barrel is cut with a 1:28 thread to accept various muzzle breaks and flash hiders.
The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. 
Comes with 22-round magazine. The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. 
The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the gun. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage. Tan finish.

Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system. The Special ultra lightweight profile barrel has a conventional .750"" gas block diameter, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected. The weight of the barrel splits the difference between our light profile and our pencil barrel. Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.

This is by far the most accurate AR15 I have owned even more so than models I have had by KAC and LWRC,and overall is my favorite out of the 3 which is why  still have it and they have been long gone. The rifle has had approx 300-400 rounds down the tube, I am the original owner and have owned it for about 2 years, I have a total of 9 mags available for the rifle the 2 painted black/tan PMAGS came with the rifle and are the only ones I have ever used, I have an additional 5 non windowed PMAGS that have been removed from packaging but never loaded or inserted and 2 tan windowed PMAGS NEW in rapper. The rifle has a 3lb Timney trigger installed,a LMT(Lewis Machine&Tool) Sopmod stock, Hogue pistol grip, and Magpul RVG foregrip,and Surefire Weapon light. The rifle has Troy rails and Troy BUIS from the factory. I alos have available for the right offer or trade 280 rounds of federal 55gr ammo. The rifle was painted TAN up until yesterday in which I decided to remove it  for this listing so there are some specs on the finish here and there small enough you cant see in the pictures and there is a small blemish on the right side of the receiver (see pictures).

 Now I dont have to get rid of this rifle and am honestly in no true hurry to do so, I will listen to all reasonable cash offers but low ballers wont get a response so dont waste my time or yours. The only trades I would consider are for a M1A preferably Socom 16,Socom II, M1A Scout or a nice DSA FAL SA58, or a Savage 110 BA in 300 WIN or 338 Lapua, and those are pretty much the only trades I am interested in at this time.  Just email me with your trade offer and let me know what you have and what you want out of my package, Im not going to trade you everything I have for a standard M1A with one mag so no need to even attempt that."

Remington Model 120 Western Auto& 1930's Mossberg & Sons Model 51M - 22LR Semi Auto Rifle
These are great plinkers!
The barrel and receiver retain their original bluing. The Walnut wood is in nice shape, with some minor marks. It has a 20"" barrel. It has a 15 shot tube magazine that feeds thru the metal butt stock. The model 51M was manufactured in the 1930's thru 1946.
Remington Model 120 Semi-auto tube fed camouflaged.  Good luck finding any info in internet on a Model 120.  I found nothing.  This gun has adjustable rear sight and shoots .22LR.  The tube holds 18rds.  The barrel is stamped “Western Auto Supply Co.”  Sometime in the 1940s or 1950s, or possibly earlier, Western Auto started selling rifles and sold until the 1970’s from my research.  So from this the gun is 40-60 years old I guess.

Mossberg $220.

Remington $200.

Both guns $400.

No lowballers.  I will just put back in the safe.  I’m not living down by the river in a van.

Dear (House Judiciary Committee Member Name),

Please oppose House Bill 1588 and keep it from going to a vote in the Washington State House of Representatives. Universal background checks will do nothing but create a de facto registry of all transferred firearms, create a larger federal bureaucracy, and infringe upon the natural right of Washingtonians to own firearms. 

A Universal Background Check System would not stop criminals from getting their hands on firearms because criminals do not follow laws! All a criminal would have to do is get together with another criminal and sell a firearm without a background check. The law is inherently unenforceable! The only thing that this law does is put every firearms transfer in our state under the thumb of the federal government, allowing them to create a de facto registry of all transferred firearms. It would also make it difficult for people who live in rural areas to transfer firearms as many do not live near a registered FFL dealer. The fees associated with transferring firearms would also go up from their current average of $25 each. This could significantly impact Washingtonians' financial ability to purchase a firearm. 

Overall, this law does nothing to stop criminals and does everything to impede lawful Washingtonians from exercising their constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Please oppose House Bill 1588 and any other state or federal law that infringes upon the Constitution of The United States. Citizens like myself will not stand idly by and watch as our government strips away our natural, God-given rights. 



I am your constituent and I vote. Please represent me.


Sincerely,
Your Name Here"

Any reasonable prices not turned away, new stocks sell for 80$, so I am willing to spend up to 50$ for a fixer up stock, and 100$ for a original in 95-100% condition. Anything less then 95% would be refinished so I consider them fixer up stocks. Willing to do trading also, name what you are looking for, I have a large collection  so I might have a part, magazine,  or anything else you may want. Parts guns are wanted, picked my last one up for 120$ with no magazine and a bad stock, which is alot for a 300$ gun. So please no outrageous prices please, I will ignore them. Also looking for Demro/Foxco wasp tac1 parts in either 9mm or .45 acp, email me with parts or gun lists and your starting prices and we can talk."

Therefore most of your AK 47's today will have miss matched US made barrels, some chrome lined some not. The days it is hard to find an AK which is built right ie with the correct high quality imported chrome lined barrels because the parts have all dried up. MWT built 200 guns. They were built from Hungarian Milled parts kits. The barrels are original chrome lined heavy barrels, not to be confused with the lighter barrels typically found on all AKM's. The furniture is hardwood with a Urethane finish coat. These were built with an ElK River receiver and have a target triggers! Comes with one steel mag.

About the Manufacturer:
This company was founded in 1939 to make Smith & Wesson-type revolvers and is now part of a group that makes products ranging from hand tools to sports equipment. In 1980, after Italian arms manufacturer Beretta had completed its contracts to produce firearms for Brazil's military, Taurus purchased Beretta's Sao Paulo manufacturing plant along with the tooling, technical drawings, and work force necessary to produce several different pistol designs. By the early 1990s the company was employing more than 3000 people in four factories in Brazil. In order to more effectively tap the U.S. market, the company created a subsidiary in 1984 stationed in Miami, Taurus International Manufacturing Incorporated, also known as Taurus USA."

I bought this bike brand new from bellevue ( eastside ) harley in july . it has only 356 orginal miles!! not even broke in yet. It is both beautiful and badass looking, turns heads everywhere. I have always wanted a v-rod since orginally came out in 2001, was able to purchase one in july and then life happend. suffered severe back injury and awaiting surgery. Havent been able to get on the bike in 3+ months, and the possibility of b:e safely/comfortably ever being able to ride again is highly unlikely. Bills are stacking up and its time for this to go.

Save yourself, time and money ie; sales taxs, and freight fees/assembely fees at dealers. Get the bike youve always wanted from me and for thsnds less. This bike was over $20,000 new. My loss will be someones severe gain. I am asking $16900 obo fyi...harley does offer financing as well ). any questions or reasonable offers just email above with your contact info and questions.
