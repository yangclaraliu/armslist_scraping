The original factory stocks would have been black rubber. The photos accurately show the condition of the revolver. The bore and cylinder chambers are excellent, bright and shiny. The rifling is sharp and strong. As you would expect, the action is extremely smooth with a very nice trigger. Timing is spot on and lock-up tight. The condition of the recoil plate, the cylinder face, and the frame bridge indicate that the revolver has been fired very little. The gun comes in a period correct blue plastic Colt box that I believe to be the original box."

It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox™ comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function.

The L-46 model was first produced in 1946. In the early 50's, a few Sakos (Sock-0) and Sako-built Ithacas were sold in the US and were soon noted for their quality. Sako began offering bare actions and barrels for sale to gunsmiths and many custom rifles were built during the 50's.

Most L-46 actions were machined with a magazine well, which was pinned shut with a plate if the gunsmith wanted a single shot, or bench, rifle. A few, like this one, were machined without the magazine well, and were specifically built for the growing sport of bench shooting.

The custom adjustable trigger can, and is, set for a pull force measured in ounces.

The Weaver K8F scope is an original build option

Glossy Browning style bluing

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

We all grew up hearing the phrase, ""Faster than a speeding bullet...,"" but not when it is fired from Smith & Wesson's new Model 460XVR, with the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on earth. The Model 460XVR is so revolutionary that it required an entirely new designation...XVR, X-treme Velocity Revolver.

Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot! Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver.

Rifle, Scope, Bench rest, 1 BX-25 mag, 1 Ruger factory 10 round
I bought the 10/22 new in December to build with all new parts. It has a E.R. Shaw .920"" bull barrel with a Bentz target chamber, Boyd's SS Evolution stock, Volquartson Exact Edge extractor, Tactical Innovations trigger, polished sear, Centerpoint 4-16x40 illuminated (red or green) mil-dot scope with re-zeroing target turrets, adjustable parallax from 5 yard to infinity, flip up lens covers, and wide double bolt scope rings. Scope was bubble leveled to insure proper verticle alignment of the crosshairs.  Scope Base was properly installed with LockTite and torqued accordingly along with the scope rings.  The rifle rest is a Winchester. Using cci mini mags you can run one jagged hole at 50 yards and under 3/4"" at 75 yards. I have not tried any match grade ammo. Groups are likely to be even tighter with match ammo. I have used minimags, RWS subsonic, interceptors, and a few federals. No function problems of any kind. Due to the target chamber, no stinger ammo should be used (Ruger's manual also states that stingers should not be used). I also have the original box and paperwork that came with the rifle when I bought it new. I have over 650+ invested, make cash offer. Make trade + cash offer, make even trade offer, but dont ask my bottom dollar becasue I am not going to say. You must be a KY resident and be willing to meet in Louisville. Thanks for looking"

Originally it did not have a USGI flash hider with bayonet lug - but it does now.

Also, it was a special model (forget the exact model number) but it was refered to as the GI Collector edition. Aside from USGI parts it came with a collector quality USGI walnut stock. The pictures don't do justice as the stock has a beautiful grain to it - and perfect Defense Acceptance Stamp and P cartouches.

I do pefer a local sale in D/FW (I am in Fullerton). If it does not sell within a day or two I will ship. I need cash only at this time, no trades - sorry.

This M1A comes with the following for $1350:

Springfield Armory S#093824) receiver - 12/95 Production Date.
USGI Collector quality stock
One USGI OM marked (Winchester) M14 Magazine
USGI H&R Trigger Housing
USGI SA Hammer
Sprinfield Armory Inc (not USGI) OpRod
USGI TRW Bolt
USGI H&R chrome lined Barrel
USGI Slotted Handguard
Original Springfield Inc H/G also included)
USGI flash hider that has been national match reamed
USGI Web Sling
USGI Buttstock Cleaning Kit
Sadlack Spring Guide
Nylon Assault Rifle Case (the one pictured)

This gun is 15 years old but has only had a couple of hundred rounds down the tube. It is mint. You won't find a better M1A for a better price - at least I did not.

I also have some M14 accessories that I am selling seperately or would be happy to sell along with the gun (but not of course at $1350."

I purchased it new so I am the original owner and it has been well taken care of (only used it to mow my yard). I have followed the scheduled maintenance since I bought it new. I have only used Cub Cadet filters and FULL Synthetic Quaker State since the first oil change. Everything works very well and the engine still runs strong (it has never used any oil which is rare on a small engine). It has been a good solid mower for me I just decided to step up to a newer mower with a larger 60"" deck. It is a used mower so it has the normal wear and tear. However it is good condition and I have taken care of it. The hydrostats work well but I guess it is a tad slower than it was when new (to be expected). Still a speedy mower for sure. Here is the basic specs for the mower:

Cub Cadet Zero Turn (RZT) Mower 
22 HP Briggs & Stratton V-Twin Intek
50 inch mowing deck
331 hours (it has the digital read hour display)
Blades are 1 year old (Cub Cadet Blades)
Good Tires

You are obviously more than welcome to test drive it first, you can mow my entire yard if you want . Will take cash or trade for firearms. I'm pretty open for now on gun trades as long as they are quality firearms. I may consider a bow but would prefer guns or cash.

Since the end of the American Civil War, personal and official use of Confederate flags and of flags derived from these has continued under some controversy. But what isn't a controversy these days?

The display of the Confederate flag is a highly controversial topic generally because of disagreement over its symbolism. Supporters of the flag view it as a symbol of southern heritage and the independence of the distinct cultural tradition of the South from the North. I was hesitant to put these up but got so many responses on the Colorado Gadsden that I figured this may have a niche as well. And at the same time trying to stay neutral as far as it's negative connotations. Good or bad, it is a part of our Nations' history.

Not too many around in this kind of condition. I would rate it at 99%. As with all these guns, they are second to none in quality. The barrel and receiver have matching serial numbers. Chambered for 7.62x54r. It is a very accurate rifle and these guns are considered the best Moisin Nagants ever produced. The oval with the number 11 on the receiver is probably the number given to Poland as a Eastern block nation. Thanks"

The RRA LAR-PDS® Pistol is the first of a new generation of firearms employing
RRA’s patent-pending Piston Driven System (PDS). Featuring a purposedesigned
bolt carrier, an adjustable gas piston and an over-the-barrel spring
and guide rod arrangement, the LAR-PDS® is able to completely do away with
the traditional recoil system associated with AR-style firearms, making for an
extremely versatile weapon platform. 
This is a ""pistol"" but due to posting limitations Armslist would only let me post it as a rifle.
Comes with a carrying case and 1 magazine.
I took this gun to the range 1 time and put 90 rounds through it, brought it home and cleaned it. Put it in the gun safe and that's where it has sat for the last year. Everything works, fired all 90 rounds with out any issues what so ever. I am firm on the price, so please don't call if you are not prepared to pay the price I want. These guns are very hard to get with a waiting list of over 6 months.
I do have other accessories for an additional cost if you want to buy them at the same time.

I am the first owner and bought it in April of 1989.  I have put a max of 250-250 rounds of 9mm through it via a 9mm Hi Power conversion barrel and it is highly accurate.  The original .30 cal barrel (which I’ve never shot) has been put back in, and the gun is as I bought it 24 years ago.

According to Bowers Tactical on Yosemite in Centennial it was manufactured in the mid 1980’s in Belgium.  This is verified by the slide that actually states that it was made in Belgium and the Belgian acceptance stamp / proof mark on the trigger guard (see images).  It has an external extractor that, according to Bowers, dates it as second generation (Mark II and the technician said it was released solo and not as part of a set).

Bowers evaluates it as being in great condition at 95% (has a couple light scratches - see images) and after consulting their hardcopy gun guide, the technician told me that last year it was valued at around $1,100 and recommended I should put it online for between $1,200-1,500.  

Email for more pictures if you’d like.  It comes with the original box with all markings and two stamped polished blue 7.65mm magazines (13 rounds staggered) and a silver one that is not stamped, but is identical in capacity (see images).  Before I realized I wanted to sell, I spent $30 on Hogue wraparound rubber grips (super comfortable), which I’ll throw in as well - but the gun does come with the original grips.  I’ll also include the 9mm conversion barrel, but just for show – Bowers recommends not using it because it’s too thin and could be dangerous (another reason I converted it back to 7.65mm / .30 cal).

Many Browning Hi Powers were manufactured in a variety locations but this is a legitimate, fully Belgian piece I’m looking for a serious collector who recognizes its unique nature.  You will need to fill out a bill of sale, have a valid Colorado ID, & be over 21years old.  No felons / bad guys.

SAFETY

Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

ERGONOMIC

Superior design features give the XD-S™ capabilities that not all pistols of its size can claim. Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.

Picatinny Rail System
A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Short Reset Trigger
The new XD-S™ trigger has a short travel along with a short reset which helps to keep you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots.

Snag Free Sights
The rear sight on the XD-S™ is low-profile and holster friendly. Easier and faster target acquisition is achieved with a fiber optic front sight.

Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.

Mould-Tru Backstraps
With two interchangeable backstraps, Springfield Armory® has stayed true to their focus on providing the user with the most comfortable, and easy to point pistol possible by allowing you to custom fit your grip.

Slim Contour Frame
The ideal grip angle of the XD-S™ is accented by the 1” single stack frame.
