This is an accessory to convert your .223 / 5.56 AR style rifle to fire .22 LR.

AR15 22LR Conversion Kit + 10 Round Mag

Asking 200 FIRM

NEVER SEEN A ROUND!

THIS IS BRAND NEW! Still in box

INFO:

The Target Master .22 long rifle conversion unit is a drop-in, blow-back activated device designed to adapt M16 and AR-15 rifles to fire .22 long rifle cartridges. The Target Master conversion unit installs in less than 1 minute without the use of tools and allows the use of inexpensive .22 long rifle ammunition in lieu of more expensive .223/5.56 ammunition.

Target Master is designed to replace the standard bolt group without any permanent modifications to the rifle. It will not change the appearance, feel, weight or handling of the rifle. The performance and operating procedures do not change, making the Target Master conversion kit a great solution for low-cost training and rifle familiarization.

No need to spend money on a dedicated rifle (and all the accessories that you would need to go with that rifle). Purchasing a drop-in conversion kit will pay for itself in only 500 rounds of shooting!

Accuracy tests show nearly identical shot placement at 50yds when comparing to .223 through the same barrel."

197,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1355197,For Sale:  Colt made Ejercito Argentino Colt Cal .45 Mod 1927,"Winter Springs, Orlando, Florida","$ 2,500","Listed On: Thursday, March 28, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"There were only 10,000 of these pistols made by Colt for the Argentine Army (Ejercito Argentino) under contract in 1927. The pistol is basically a '1911A1' (post 1924) configuration and featured a World War I style (Pre-A1 version) wide spur hammer with checkering, short checkered trigger and a checkered (arched) mainspring housing with lanyard loop. All of these Colts had a deep blue finish. Production is said to have begun in July, 1927 and ended in February, 1928.

The Colt produced Argentine pistols are said to be of the highest quality construction and fit/finish as Colt considered them 'ambassadors' to the foreign market.  The Serial # on this pistol is under 1500.

After the initial 10,000 units were produced, the Argentine government purchased a license to build the 'Model 1927' pistol in Argentina under the markings 'FMAP' which stood for 'Fabrica Militar de Armas Portatiles' (Argentine Military Small Arms Factory) and these guns began with serial #10,001 through 13,000 respectively.

I do not know if this pistol has been refinished or if its original. There are tiny rust spots on the back side of grip, it may not be visible in the photos. I would prefer to sell this pistol to someone locally, so that they can examine and determine for them selves. You may request additional photos.  This 1911 was from a private collection (obtained through auction) that contained many other unique & rare firearms."

Built to the exacting specifications of the G.I. model used by U.S. infantrymen in both WWII theaters of battle and in Korea, this reproduction rifle comes to you chambered in the fun and economical .22 LR cartridge.

Used by officers as well as tankers, drivers, artillery crews, mortar crews, and other personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand rifle, the M-1 carbine weighed only 4.5 to 4.75 pounds. The Citadel M-1, made by Chiappa in Italy, weighs in at 4.8 lbs. – nearly the exact weight of the original. Barrel length and OAL are also the same as the ""United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1"", its official military designation.

Action is smooth and tight, lockup & timing are perfect.

Would make an awesome carry gun, home defense piece, or just a fun range toy. This S&W was made back when the company still cared about the work and materials that went into their guns. All forged steel, real wood grips, real rifling, real rollmarks and hand fitting here...no laser etchings, no MIM and no internal lock! They really don't make them like this anymore. This is a duplicate for me, so I don't mind letting it go to get on to the next S&W.

This is an earlier Gen 4, which is one of the better versions of the rifle ever released. This version accepts the Steyr Aug mags as well as the MSAR STG556 mags. There have never been any issues w/ this rifle at all. Very low round count, probably only about 400 rounds through it total. Rifle has very little recoil and is very compact and maneuverable.

Based on the famous Austrian Steyr AUG assault rifle. Manufacture of this clone became possible because original patents for SteyrAUG have expired, and the demand for civilian version of this weapon in USA was not covered by import of original Austrian-made rifles. MSAR designers took some time to reverse-engineer the Steyr AUG,and then added several additional features that they feel might appeal to US shooters. Most notable of these new features are bolt stop release button and Ar-15 style bolt -closure forward assist button on the left side of receiver. Otherwise, the STG-556 follows the Steyr AUG A2 rifle pattern.

Time to go to make room for something else I do shoot more often.  It functions perfectly with new production ammo, I can't recall any malfunctions although it has been a while.  I recall that some of the surplus would take 2 strikes, like the primers were hard (or the mainspring was getting a little soft)

For those not familiar, the CZ-52 is a cold war era Czech gun that shoots the *very* hot 7.62x25 round.  Its a roller locked gun (fairly unique) and quite accurate.  Ergonomics aren't great, but its a blast (literally) to shoot.  The concussion is .357 territory, and it flings cases about 20-30 feet.  Seriously, its a riot to shoot.

Going rate on Gunbroker is around $250 for the guns themselves.  I'll do 250 face-to-face for the gun, and for another $150 I will throw in (going from memory here) the 6 boxes of Sellier & Bellot non-corrosive I have & around 100 rounds of Bulgarian surplus.  Going rate on the ammo was about $30/box when I was picking it up.

The gun does have a new barrel & rollers installed.  The rifling was pretty trashed in the old barrel so I found a very good condition (may have been surplus unissued, not sure) barrel & installed it."

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

I have an Armalite AR10 .308, with 12"" Daniel Defense lite rail, Rainier Arms 16"" ultramatch barrel (shilen blank), Armalite tactical 2 stage trigger, and lmt sopmod stock on vltor buffer tube. BCG and lower parts are all original factory Armalite parts. It has the improved bolt catch. I also have 8-20 round mags, and 1-10 round mag. All of them except 2-20 rounders are brand new and have only had ammo loaded into them. I've shot the 10 round mag once, and the other 2-20 rounders once or twice each. Rifle is in perfect shape, and has only seen about 60. I've had it over a year now and that's all i've shot it. One of the reasons i'm posting this. 

I'm probably missing a couple things, obv some pictures for now. All I can say if you're looking for an AR10, this is an impressive gun and will not disappoint. Comes with 1-20 round and 1-10 round mags (extra 20 round mags will cost extra). I'm in no hurry at all to part with it, and will consider trades/trades+cash. Anyways, shoot me some offers. 
I won't sell mags unless the rifle goes too. I also have a brand new First Spear Scar heavy kit (seen here http://dsgarms.com/ProductInfo/FSP500-12-00010-002-00.aspx) for mags/gear. It's had mags sitting in it and never used.

Don't lowball me, we all know what a gun like this is worth, i'm not out to rape someone. You can price all the parts out if you'd like, it was built from scratch and barely used. I take a lot of pride in cleaning and maintenance. If you want to look at it, I can arrange someone to meet you or i'll be stateside next Thursday. The extra (6-20 rounders) magazines and first spear rack can be lumped into a deal, but are not included in my asking price. Thanks"

This machined aluminum trigger is a direct replacement for the factory M&P centerfire pistol trigger. It can be used in conjunction with any combination of M&P internals presently available from Apex Tactical* as well as any configuration from the S&W factory.Reduces Trigger Pre-Travel and Over Travel by approximately 20%. The Center Mounted Pivoting Safety bar prevents unintended operation by creating a trigger block that will not disengage unless the shooter places their finger directly on the trigger face. The flat target style trigger causes the shooter to place their finger on the center line of the trigger and encourages trigger manipulation directly to the rear (in line with the bore axis).
The Apex Fully Machined Sear (Hard Sear)* was designed to enhance the performance of what we consider an outstanding pistol. Our modified geometry will not only improve the over-travel and sear reset characteristics, but dramatically reduce the trigger pull weight in most pistols. This sear is made from heat treated A-2 tool steel for durability and long service life."

I am 100% firm on the price -- Cash Only -- 

I am selling two vintage .22 pistols and a .22 rifle that I have no use for. 
The H&R 929 Pistol was bought new by my grandfather in the 50's and is in excellent condition however when I shot it, it would only fire intermittently.  A friend said ""Some years of 929 used a plastic head on the mainspring assembly, and it is prone to crack with age and split in half, parts are available to replace the old unit with a new identical assembly.""

The Hawes was my dad's pistol and he probably sent 4,000 rounds through it.  It fires but the cylinder has spinning problems --  Parts???

I took the  Remington Sportmaster 341-p on trade and whereas it is in rough shape and missing the site with some solder damage to the top,  I was told it fired just fine. Parts???"

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

I am in NH but I can ship Priority - I am offering a discounted flat rate of $5 for up to 4 magazines, and $10 for 5 or more.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

This is a Jennings .22LR semi-auto pistol package.

This 'package' comes with the gun, 4 magazines, a soft case, 3 practice rounds and 7-50 round boxes of Federal .22LR ammo.
We have found this ammo works best in most picky .22 semi-autos.
Although this J22 will work it is being sold as a PROJECT for an aspiring or accomplished gunsmith.
It may function perfectly fine for you or not.
There are videos on YouTube on mods to this and many other guns.

Shipping is $30 to lower 48 states. know your own laws before purchasing as im not responsible if you are not allowed to own this in your state/city.

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired by BCM before leaving the factory. These do not include bolt carrier groups, or charging handles.

Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH series of barrels are made right here in the USA!  (Just like all the BCM products.)

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, because people do not always follow through with purchases, and we can lose guaranteed sales if a firearm is not available because we’re holding it for someone.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."
