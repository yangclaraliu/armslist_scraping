Beautiful rifle!  Stock is in excellent condition, only treated with linseed oil to maintain it.  Smooth to the touch, a real pleasure to hold and shoot.  Has flip up sights added to it, a nice touch.  Everything is original and numbers matching, including the stock, barrel, receiver, magazine, bolt, etc.  Every part on the gun is stamped with the identical number.  The rifle is cleaned of all packing grease and shoots GREAT!  I personally have fired 10 rounds through it and I am extremely pleased to be able to shoot such a wonderful rifle.  The bolt cycles smoothly.  Much more pleasing to shooting than other WW2 rifles such as a nagant or mauser.  The rifling is EXCELLENT and shows that this rifle has seen very little use.  I have a No.3 enfield and when comparing the rifling, this No.4 enfield looks as if it's never been fired!

It's a shame to get rid of such a wonderful rifle.  I searched long and hard to find this rifle, and paid over $500 for it, but I recently got a speeding ticket and must relinquish this beautiful rifle from my collection.
If you want an excellent condition, firing Lee Enfield, look no further.  This rifle is beautiful to look at as well as shoot, and you can do both!

See if you can answer these questions - which every American who loves his country should be able to answer:
1. When and where was the American Revolution won, according to John Adams?
2. When and where did the Revolutionary War break out?
3. What caused the British Regulars, the most well-trained, well-disciplined army in the world, to break and run at Concord's North Bridge, after only two minutes of musket fire by shopkeepers and farmers?
4. What caused this reversal of British military opinion:

BEFORE April 19, 1775:
""Americans are raw, undisciplined and cowardly"". John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich and 1st Lord of the Admiralty 

""With a thousand British grenadiers I would undertake to go from one end of America to the other and geld all the males, partly by force and partly with a little coaxing"". Major General Alured Clarke 

AFTER April 19, 1775:
""Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself very much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about..."" Lieutenant-General Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland

I have had a person claiming to be in Colorado then tell me they were in another state! Nothing replaces a face to face so that you can be comfortable in the transaction [No Thugs or Gangbangers] and you can see the weapon before you buy. This saves everyone time because if someone is trying to sell crap, then you can politely decline and move on. 

NOW I have see some sellers already trying to charge Hickenlooper fees and the law has not even taken effect yet (July 1st) 

And then I have had two seperate experiences where the seller tries a BAIT & SWITCH by offering a shotgun at a decent price, only to turn around and offer you one with less items (magazines & upgrades) but charge me several hundred dollars more!

This is more info I got from a seller: [I have also had people clame to be in Colorado only to find out they are in Arizona. I only sell face to face because I want the person buying anything to see it before they pay. Also in the past I have had people buy stuff and I ship it to them then they scream about the item being non functioning only to get it back and refund the money and find out parts have been stolen. On the Hickenlooper prices, once the mag ban goes into effect, you will not be able to LEGALLY buy or sell ANY detachable mags that have a removable floorplate. You will not be able to give them away or donate them, or sell them or loan them or buy or borrow them. I do hope the stupid anti gun laws get repealed but we must get involved and VOTE, if you do not vote you become part of the problem. Only voting can help the gun owners in Colorado. Also a new scam going around now is to sell a gun online, and when the buyer gets it, all they get is a box with a case and some rocks in it.]

REMEMBER: Avoid scams by dealing locally and NEVER send money to sellers without using a trusted escrow service. 

Be smart - Be Aware - Don't let these scum take advantage of you just like the Politicians have! FOR SHAME on those who wish to F**k honest people over!

This is an absolutely fantastic gun with a high mag count and low rounds through it. Has the quick acquisition sighting on it so it help with faster targeting. My lady likes the M&P 9 mm that my friend has and seems to shoot better with it. It kills me to either sell or trade this gun because it was what i was looking for but i would feel better if my lady feels comfortable with the gun also. It is very accurate and has one of the best triggers on the market so I have heard ( about a 4 lb trigger pull ). Very low slide with minimal recoil to help you get back on target fast. I also might be able to through in 100 or so rounds of ammo to start out with. I also have the speed loader going with the gun which is very easy and only fits the mags for this gun. Comes with 2 15 round mags also. Just a picture of the handgun below... Not actual photo.

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench.  352.634.2o84"

This AR has been fired about 250 times and has not once jammed or had any problem at all... It is pretty much as perfectly customized as an AR can get... If you want a top shelf rifle with all of the right upgrades and aftermarket parts but don't want to deal with buying and installing all of those new components then this is the rifle for you... 

The Colt LE6920 SOCOM was a limited edition AR 15 that Colt released. The rifle stands out mainly due to its Knight's Armament M4 quad rail. This is a limited edition rifle and it is a Colt... so it will retain its value better than just about any other AR out there. This rifle also has the highly desireable M1A1 roll mark on the magwell right under the horse... 

Also included will be a soft AR-15 case, factory sling, factory cleaning kit, 2 factory Colt 30-round magazines, 2 42 round polymer magazines, 1-piece bungee sling.

I also have a EOTech EXPS 3-0 and an EOTech G33 3x magnifier with QD rail mounts that I will include at a discount if purchased with the rifle. 

The EOTech Sight & Magnifier alone: $1050

Bought it from a coworker and to be quite honest, it's just simply way too much scope for what I intended on using it for. It has a class 1 laser range finder (eye safe) built in and can give almost immediate distance measurements in a 3 digit display at the bottom of the scope view. Scope is a FFP with, as expected, crystal clear glass from none other than Zeiss in Germany. It is illuminated reticle, and what I believe is the 60 reticle from Zeiss. I've spoken to their customer service dept and they can relatively easily change the reticle out for one of the Rapid Z-600 or Z-800 series if you prefer, but I haven't done that. The scope will come with the Zeiss mounting rails for mounting on your picitinny rail - these are the original Ziess manufactured rails that are no longer in production. There are no scratches on the lenses, no scratches/smudges on the scope body itself. With the exception of me putting in a new CR-123 for the range finder/illuminated reticle, this scope is basically brand new. I put it on an AR and put maybe 25 rounds down range with it mounted before calling it a day and taking it off. 
The good: Carl Zeiss Hensoldt AG Victory Diarange 3-12x56mm scope, original neoprene scope coat (Zeiss labeled), brand new CR-123 battery. No scratches, no damage, no occlusions - just a perfect, almost brand new Zeiss scope that has been extremely well taken care of and never abused. Original Zeiss mounting rails with specialty tool for taking it on/off (it's triangular in nature). Full, lifetime warranty as offered and covered by Zeiss. 

The bad: No box, no manuals, no paperwork. I have the .pdf that has the full manual in about 8 different languages, and can send it as an email attachment or you can relatively easily find it on line. The original tool that I received with the scope for the mounting rails (triangular in build) has some tooling marks on it and the single throw arm is bent a bit. I don't know if it is from some kind of damage - it's the way I received it from my coworker. I can take pictures of it later on and send them (currently at work). That's all the bad.

This scope is the same as this one shown in the [url=http://www.eurooptic.com/zeiss-victory-diarange-3-12x56-t-rapid-z-800.aspx]link[/url]
As stated above, currently at work and I don't have it here to take photos, but I can easily do so for serious buyers when I get home (4:30 PST).

I'm asking for $3500 shipped to US ONLY(insurance, tracking number, etc), which is what I paid for it, so I'm simply looking to recoup my outlay, which means you get to take $500 off a Zeiss scope and you're getting the $200 mounting rails for free, and I'm eating the shipping cost. Scope is located in northern NV and with the exception of me taking it to the range a few days ago, I'm pretty certain it's never seen the outside of a gun safe. I'd be willing to take personal checks - scope will not ship until it clears, USPS MO (max value of a money order is $1,000, so it would be a couple of them), certified funds (cashiers check, etc) or possibly paypal as a discreet gift....we can talk about the paypal. I mentioned I'm also open to trades as well, with my primary aim at getting relatively good long range optics for a 20"" bull barreled AR, so please keep that in mind. Price is pretty firm, but I would be willing to work something out if it benefits both parties. Please give this scope a great home and take it hunting! :)

I'm selling my new Marlin rifle for $340.00, but you have to buy my 30-30 ammo at cost, with it also. I've only got two boxes, they are $30.00 each for a total of $60.00.  I don't want to be stuck with ammo that I don't have a rifle for..., so it has to go with it....all at the same time. I make no profit off of the ammo. I make no profit off of the gun either...I just have to sell it. 
It's a Marlin. Has a gold trigger. It's new except for a couple of shots being fired. It's beautiful, has a factory Marlin Hammer Extension. Flawless.
I bought 3 firearms this weekend, all small enough for my wife to target practice with, now I have to sell something substantial to cover the expense. My Marlin Deer Rifle, though beautiful, will rarely get used by me, so it is the one I must sell. 
The Marlin 30-30 is a ""everything"" gun. It's a little hard to find a new one right now, it's one of the rifles that has been picked clean off the shelves... if you do find one, mine is cheaper, especially with the ammo. 
Your going to buy ammo if you buy a rifle, so you may as well buy mine at cost...Your not going to beat my rifle at $340.00, not this nice.. plus the ammo you would buy anyway. The scope is optional. It's a 2-6x zoom 28mm that is a perfect fit and size for this rifle...it's new. It is the ONLY scope that looks perfect on the 30/30  in my opinion. And the 6x zoom is right on the money for the .30-.30 round. It's $50.00 extra. Otherwise I keep it and put it on one of the new Henry's that I just bought my wife. $450.00 if you want it with the scope, otherwise 400.00 for rifle and ammo"

You may shoot anything from a .22 rimfire (the Ruger 10/22 and Marlin 795 are popular) to a centerfire such as an AR, AK, SKS, M1A or M1.  You will shoot approximately 250 rounds per day as you try to qualify as a Rifleman (210 Points) on a modified version of the AQT (Army Qualification Test) course of fire.

Politics are not discussed at Appleseed shoots, except for the politics of 1775.

 -forged/CNC, no polymer
 -Mil-Specs/standard specs, no manufacturer-specific features (i.e. must accept after market parts, including replacing trigger guard)
 -Brand new/unused
 -Standard manufacturers (i.e. Spikes, Aero, PSA, etc), not Little Johnny's Drill Shop (although if you have one that says that, please post a picture).
 -Any existing builds that meet the above specs (or LPKs, build kits, etc) that you want to include for a 'reasonable' price will be taken into account. I'm not going to turn down an offer that includes an LPK at over-cost, because I recognize the environment we're in. But, I also know you can buy an LPK online!

 FTF in northern CO, cash only.
 Bidding price $250 for the lower alone, +/- depending on deal/offer.

 I know that's a lot to ask in today's climate, but I also know there's a lower out there with my name on it! PMs are good/fine.

 Thanks."

New, unfired, all factory Palmetto State Armory mil-spec 16"" Barrel. Came with the Magpul handguard. I bought the complete upper and lower a month or so back and just now obtained the new PSA BCG and charging handle. I took apart the bolt assembly and lubed it up and ran a swab of CLP through the bore. Just slap a mag in and you are good to go. Along with S&W I consider PSA the best of the mid-tier AR's. I have another PSA I am keeping and too many other AR's.

Since it didn't come with a rear BUIS, I will include the pictured used Matech folding sight for an extra $40. But lots of other choices out there. It's the same sight Colt put on my Socom II. My favorite and on three of my rifles. If this is your first AR and you have no magazines I can spare up to three Gen 2 Pmags NIB @ $25 per. NOT for sale separately.

If you prefer the Magpul MOE stock, I will install a new black one instead of the PSA at no extra cost.

In the picture you can see I have CCI Mini mag (both round nose and hollow point), Winchester copper plated, Federal semi auto target, and some Remington Thunderbolt. I have more then what is pictured, I just wanted to give everyone an idea of what I have. I also have 40 s&w (both range and home defense), and 9mm (both range and Home defense). I also have 9mm law enforcement only ammo. It is very hard to get so it would have to be a great deal for me to part with it. Lastly is I have 223 and 5.56 ammo. All the ammo I am offering are new, not reloads. They are all brass or copper and not steal.
I'm looking in the Taurus PT709, Kel-Tec P11, 38 snub, Ruger LC9, ect. I'm looking for a 9mm or larger. I might think about a 380 if its a nice gun. If you are offering cash please let me know what you want and what you are willing to pay. I'd perfer to trade so I am not gouging anyone. But I also will not sell it for below market value. I can also add cash for the right handgun."

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Had several deal that either never showed and a few interested but never came to pass. I am pulling out all the stops in hopes of finding someone interested in making a trade. I have gone through all my gear and pulled everything I might be willing to trade. First up is my Smith & Wesson SD40VE with two mags and Hogue hand-all grip. I also have two holsters (a Fobus paddle holster, and a Galco Double-Time kydex holster) that I would be willing to add in, as well as a Nebo Protec 190 lumen tact light (runs both continuous and strobe). Also have 36 rnds of Federal target ammo and 5 rounds of Hornaday Critical Defense hollowpoints. Other gear I have is a Rothco plate carrier (no plates or soft armor in it), a CTS Red Smoke Grenade, and a MSA Millennium Pro Gas Mask (same ones DHS use....the setup I have retails for about $850) and includes a standard filter, CBRN filter, clear polycarbonate outsert lens, voice amplifier, and carry bag that can also be worn as a drop leg carrier. Everything is in good condition, however does show signs of use as I did train with many of these items. I am not looking to cheat anyone in this trade, but I am also not going to trade everything listed of course for a $500 weapon. So lets make a deal, text me anytime at REDACTED can send more pics upon request"

Scope by itself retails for $200, so you're basically getting the binoculars for free (which retail for $115). Willing to ship for $15.00 extra.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

Only 30 rounds of Federal 168 Gold Medal Match fired since assembly.  This rifle is light and handy and with your optics will serve you well  to 800 meters and beyond.

 My guts are wrenching as i type this up because i truly don't want to sell it.  I have let my money get funny and the tax man ain't no joke.  If this doesn't sell quickly i will likely come to my senses so if you are interested, speak up now or forever hold your peace.

Here are the specs:

Factory Armalite upper and lower receivers with forward assist
Armalite LPK with 2-stage trigger
Factory Armalite triple-lapped SASS 16"" barrel (More on this below)
Troy industries stainless low profile gas block 
Troy Industries 13"" TRX extreme handguard (this has removable rails for mounting lights, lasers, night vision or whatever.  I have added a Noveske sling/bipod swivel and a flush mount Noveske QD sling swivel to one side.)
Troy Industries Folding BUIS (HK front)
Armalite Ar15 Buffer tube ( this will allow you to use any ar15 carbine stock)
Slash's heavy buffer and spring (allows use of the ar15 buffer tube instead of the longer ar10 tube)
Magpul CTR Stock
MAgpul MIAD Grip

The barrel on this rifle was part of a contract overrun for the British special forces.  This was not available for civilian purchase from Armalite.  I purchased it from the Rhine Group in factory new condition and has only had 30 rounds down the tube.  It has a tapered contour and a .875 gas block without being too heavy. This 16"" will out shoot a Noveske 18"" every day of the week.  There were a very small number of these produced and the bulk of those were threaded for the OPS inc. suppressor adaptor.  This one however has the standard 5/8 x 24 threads so it will accept all of the standard 7.62 muzzle devices.

This will package will include:
Rifle
1x 10round Gen2 magazine 
2x 20round Gen2 Magazines
2x 25round Gen2 Magazines

I can also include a few boxes of Federal 168 GMM if need be.  Other mags may be for sale with the right deal or at a later date.

No tire kickers.  I will post pictures this evening."

This is what NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox  has  to say about the matter:

""
Your Second Amendment freedoms are on the chopping block RIGHT NOW and ONLY YOU can save them.

Next week, your Senators are scheduled to vote on a so-called ""universal background check"" bill being pushed by lifelong anti-gun zealot, Senator Chuck Schumer. Schumer's bill would MAKE YOU A CRIMINAL if you simply transfer a firearm to an aunt, uncle, cousin or lifelong friend without the federal government's approval.

Even worse, President Barack Obama's Justice Department says that Schumer's bill will only be effective if it's coupled with MANDATORY GUN REGISTRATION.

Please call both of your U.S. Senators TODAY and tell them to vote ""NO"" on Schumer's ""universal background check"" bill. Simply call the Senate switchboard at 202*224*3121 and ask to speak with your Senators by name.

Call today, tomorrow, and put a reminder on your calendar to call next week too!

Think about it. Are criminals going to walk into a licensed gun dealer's store and fill out a federal form every time they want to give one of their criminal buddies a gun? Of course not! And Schumer knows it...he's just trying to play us for fools.

This isn't about making Americans safer...it's about leading law-abiding gun owners down the road to gun registration - and ultimately, GUN CONFISCATION - just like we watched happen in England and Australia.

So please, call your Senators RIGHT NOW and tell them to vote ""NO"" on Chuck Schumer's ""universal background check"" bill! Tell them you aren't fooled and they shouldn't be either!

And please, forward this email to your friends and family and urge them to take immediate action.

Thank you!!!

In Freedom,

Chris

Chris W. Cox
Executive Director
www.NRAILA.org

P.S. We can't leave anything to chance in this battle. So I've had our staff prepare tens of thousands of NRA-ILA's famous action alert postcards that we can mail to gun owners in key states. These cards can be in the hands of our best grassroots activists in a matter of just two days - perfect timing if we want to generate the thousands of phone calls we need to stop Schumer's anti-gun bill from passing!

But to get these cards in the mail I need YOU to make an urgent contribution to NRA-ILA today. If you give just $5 you'll cover the postage for 20 postcards...$10 will double the power of your grassroots activism by helping us mail 40 postcards!

Whatever amount you can afford to give, PLEASE CLICK HERE TO MAKE YOUR CONTRIBUTION NOW. Just a few dollars from you NOW will go a long way toward saving your freedom! But please hurry - we have to act FAST.

Again, on behalf of everyone here at NRA-ILA, thank you for your strong leadership and support! 
""

Further, do you trust the Obama administration with the ability to stop all legal gun sales simply by taking NICS offline? That's the power they will have with ""universal background checks"". And they will use any excuse they can find to do it. This is not about preventing crime. According to the DOJ report ""Enforcement of the Brady Act - 2010"" there were 72,659 failed NICS checks in 2010. Just 62 cases were even referred to federal prosecutors for criminal prosecution for giving false information on form 4473 or anything else. This is not about preventing violent crimes. It's another incremental step to controlling lawful gun owners. The Obama administration couldn't care less about enforcing the gun laws we already have.

If you have one please let me know. Can call or text me at 573-62nine-7234. Thank You

FROM VIKING TACTICS SITE BELOW:
Unlike any sight on the market, the Revolutionary design of the Viking Sight will enhance your ability to close with and destroy the threat, day or night. The Viking Sight from Viking Tactics, Inc. features a tapered front sight that will draw you immediately to the correct aiming point. This sight is not only tapered for speed, but to help with accuracy at distance when needed. The tapered sight leads to an indestructible fiber optic that will help to drive your focus where it is needed. These sights are extremely fast. The rear sight notch has also been cut lower than normal to not only enhance speed, but to allow the shooter to see the tritium vials that have been inserted below the fiber optic. The Viking Sight will allow you to have the fine aiming point that you want and need, coupled with fiber optic to help draw your attention. If the sun goes down you are now able to use the tritium that is slightly below the fiber optic.

Current bid is $670, and with 4 days left it will definitely go up.  Keep in mind the buyer will still have to pay shipping, transfer fees, and sales tax if applicable.

The order for these rifles was cancelled after the Russian Revolution, but most were shipped. This rifle is definitely one that was shipped as its condition is most certainly a war veteran.
The Soviets ""scrubbed"" the receiver markings of anything that was related to the former Czars. Thus, this receiver shows evidence of that being done by the Soviets, but enough survives to tell what it is. The NEW on the NEW England can still be seen as well as the TI in WESTINGHOUSE and the 191 of the 1915 date. It bears its original hex receiver but the serial numbered bolt does not match. Most likely replaced during a war rebuild. Stock is complete but has seen rough usage, bore is dark. it also has sling hangars typical of what the Finns used when they captured these rifles, but it is not marked with an SA stamp. 
Still in its cosmoline from being shipped from the former Soviet Union. Ah, if only these things could talk as to where they have been!
