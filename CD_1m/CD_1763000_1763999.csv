First up is a like new, excellent condition Larue Tactical RAT stock

(Milspec). This stock includes the ""in buttstock"" cleaning kit (which is an additional $25.00 value).

From the website: LaRue Tactical R.A.T.™ Stock

With simplicity in mind, the new LaRue RAT™ Stock was designed to be the ideal complement to the LaRue Tactical AR15 family of rifles. The unique 2-stage trigger mechanism allows shooters to adjust the pull length of the stock while in avariety of shooting positions. The CNC-machined internals allow for smooth operation as trigger mechanism is pulled to the rear and released. The internals provide positive lockup on Mil-Spec receiver extension positions. The internal cavity is designedfor asnug fit without the need for an additional locking mechanism.

Ambidextrous 1/4” swivel sockets, and 1” slots provide ideal anchor points for two-point slings. A locking rear butt-plate slides open to expose compartments that hold cleaning kit components.

Retails for $140.00 (stock and cleaning kit). I'm asking $115.00.

The perfect compliment to the RAT stock above....and new in box.

From the website: LaRue Tactical A-PEG™ Initially designed with the precision shooter in mind, the folks at LaRue Tactical queried trusted individuals in the precision shooting community what they would prefer in a grip. The result is the LaRue A-PEG™. The project grew into an accessory that featured ambidextrous geometry that can be used by all shooters, enchaining control of AR15-type weapons.

Inspired by the human hand, the unique “flats” on the front and back fall more naturally onto the geometry of the hand’s structure. The flat front also provides indexing to helplevel and square the firearm to the target. A sculptured palm swell on either side fits nicely into the hollows of the palm. A gentle taper helps seat the hand towards the firearm, and helps to keepthe hand from sliding. The generous texture added to the sides gives just the right amount of traction in slippery conditions.

Retails for $28.00. I'd like to get $25.00 FIRM.

Gives you a rock steady platfrom to shoot from without adding the weight of aHarris and bipod mount.......

From the website: Vltor/Tango Down ModPod (Modular Side Mounted Bipod)

Designed in partnership with Tango Down, the Vltor Bipod is a sturdy and lightweight unit that mounts to the left and right side rails of the weapon. It locks at every 90-degree angle to fold out of the way when not in use and is adjustable for height. The Vltor Modpod utilizes the rail mounting components of the Scout Mount series and the Tangodown bipod. At first, Vltor was originally going to develop their own bipod legs, but instead chose the robust TD legs. Unlike the TD bipod, Vltor bipod legs fold forward and rearward, locking into each 90 degree position. This gives the user multiple mounting options.

Retails for $189.95......asking $120.00 (which is exactly what I have into it.)

If you're interested please feel free to I'M me or text me at 405-923-4o4o. All items are priced shipped. Thanks."

I have no problem shooting a 1 inch ( 5 shot ) group at 25 feet with it. The trigger is very short, light, crisp, and everything we all love in a good trigger. I bought 3 extra extended mags with the grip extensions for range puropses. The pistol came with 2 standard 5 round mags, which became annoying to reload over and over at the range. The extended mags hold 7 rounds, giving you a maximum of 7+1 in the chamber. Only 2 of the extended magazines are pictured in this photo. I had forgotten the last of the 3 at home in my night stand. Pistol will include all 5 magazines. This pistol is Like new and has never been carried.

3X Magnifier Description(not eotech): The 3X magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with holographic sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field.

Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their sight on their platform. This versatile magnifier also can be used as a handheld magnifying monocular for discrete observation and identification.

Colt 4” Royal Blue Python W/Box, Mfg. 1975, NEAR-MINT Condition. Stock # MSH262010SP. Serial # E911xx. One of several hundred collectible military, antique, sporting, custom, and tactical firearms, as well as edged weapons and militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is also one of several Colt Pythons we currently have in stock. This is a truly beautiful 4” Colt Python! Made in 1975, the pistol is finished in Colt’s awesome Royal Blue, it is fitted with a very nice set of Colt factory checkered wooden grips with gold-plated Colt medallions. The pistol has slight turn marks on the cylinder, and there is one tiny spot of wear (probably from storage in the box) on the tip of the ejector rod housing, otherwise the pistol easily rates 95%, in fact, it looks to be un-fired, but we cannot confirm that, so we’ll just call the gun NEAR-Mint. The pistol comes with the original Colt cardboard and Styrofoam factory box, serial-numbered to the gun (no manual). As most Collectors are aware, Colt Pythons just continue to skyrocket in price, and, kept in this condition, who knows what this gun will be worth in a few years!"

There were various importers, but the main importer appears to have been Dominion Investment Group (D.I.G.), a major firearm importer based out of Virginia Beach, Virginia. This was a group headed by a gentleman who was actually an attorney. Years later, he passed away from a heart attack, so associates assisted his wife in continuing the business by partnering with Intrac. Together they formed Intrac/Dominion Importing.To this day, the SLR-96 is considered one of the most desireable of the AK imports. This is partially because they were a 100% Bulgarian-made Kalashnikov with a milled receiver, and partially because they had the traditional 45 degree gas block and vented gas tube just as the original Type 3 AK-47 (AKK). Aside from being a semi-automatic rifle, the only real difference from the military AK-47 was the stock set, lack of a lower tang, lack of a threaded barrel, and lack of a sling loop on the left/rear of the receiver.A parts kit means you will have to assemble this kit yourself or have a qualified gun smith do it for you.You can do this yourself at home with a minimum of tools.All numbers match.All the parts are in great shape.Small parts Refinished in duracoat.The furniture looks great with some very small handling marks.This AK comes with the factory 5 round mag.(not in pics)I am in lake mary florida.Msg me if interested.$800.00.I can ship this parts kit anywhere in the USA.Will take a US postal money order or discreet paypal(sent as a gift)"

Included is a $6.00 sling from Dunham's, the two original metal magazines plus two Tapco 30 rounders.  The Tapcos fit a bit snug and but work just fine.  The rifle does not have any wiggle or play as some other inexpensive AK variants do.  Cosmetically it shows some signs of wear, specifically the blueing has been rubbed off where the dimple on the safety lever moves.  The dust cover fits snug and needs a bit of coaxing to get back on after weapons maintenance is performed.  Other than those shortcomings its a solid rifle looking for a good home.

902,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1763902,"For Sale:  Heavy .44 Special Ammo - 190 gr. Soft Cast HP-GC (1,150fps) - 20 Round Box","azusa, California, United States",$ 36,"Listed On: Saturday, June 15, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=271

 Our purpose in developing this HEAVY 44 SPL load was to duplicate our renowned 38 SPL +P 158 gr. soft cast HP @ 1000 fps out of a 2 inch revolver, (Item 20A) but with a 190gr. 44 caliber bullet.  This load was designed SPECIFICALLY for defensive use against humans. You can see our below velocities fired from my real world stock revolvers. We use only real world firearms in developing our published velocities and feel it is dishonest to use extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocities that over-the-counter carry guns cannot duplicate. You need to know what your ammo is doing in the real world, not a lab.

    1156 fps - Ruger Super Blackhawk, 5.5 inch barrel
    1098 fps - S&W MT Gun, 4 Inch barrel
    1046 fps - S&W mod. 696, 3 inch barrel
    1057 fps - S&W mod. 396, 3 inch barrel
    1005 fps - S&W mod. 296, 2 inch barrel

We developed this bullet to be soft (6 BHN) enough to mushroom at impact speeds around 750 fps, yet we wanted it hard enough (pure lead is 4 BHN) that it would not lead a normal revolver barrel. This bullet accomplishes both requirements. Depending on impact velocities, expect about 18 inches of penetration is living mammalian tissues, which should give ample penetration at bad angles to disable even very large men.

This bullet was also designed with a special crimp groove and the case mouth is heavily crimped and this bullet will NOT jump crimp in the lightweight alloy revolvers, provided you rotate the unfired rounds and thus do not expose unfired rounds to the recoil of more than about 10 firings.

We are using a flash suppressed powder so you won’t become blinded by your own gunfire in the likely event you drop the hammer in a low –light defensive situation.

This ammunition is for use in ALL 44 SPL and 44 MAG. firearms except the Charter Arms Bull Dog. No, this ammo won’t blow up your Bull Dog, but if you shoot more than a few hundred rounds of this ammo in a Bull Dog, the gun will get looser than it already was, will go out of “time” and stop working."
