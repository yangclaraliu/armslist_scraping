The gun was purchased brand new from Academy for $679 + tax before dove season last year, and has only had 50 rounds put through it since then (I shot 2 rounds of skeet and that was it), and then was meticulously cleaned. It was purchased to see if I liked O/U shotguns, but I just like my semi auto better, though it's a heck of a lot better than my pump. Additionally, when new, these guns came with a brass bead - but I don't like them, so it was replaced almost immediately with a Hi-Viz competition long fiber optic sight (with interchangable size and color pipes). Probably the best $40 I've ever spent on a gun. Other than that, the gun is completely stock, and will come with its original box, 5 chokes, and choke tube wrench.A little about the gun: they are imported exclusively by Academy, along with all the other Yildiz guns but, from what I understand, are popular over in England. The ""Special"" model is a much nicer model than the standard, with a higher grade Turkish walnut stock (I think AA, but am not certain), more elaborate engraving, an improved trigger, and a smoothed out action. I know I'm trying to sell the gun, so I want to make it sound good, but the break open on this gun is absolutely incredible - it can be done with one hand easily. The gun would make a great upland bird gun, as it only weighs 6.2 lbs with 28 in barrels, so is extremely light and easy to carry, but still swings great.I am asking $600 OBO, which will include the gun, box and paperwork, 5 choke tubes and wrench, and the interchangible pipes for the competition sight. If interested please respond to this ad, or text me at 214 four nine nine 6474. Have a great day!!"

This is the ak47 built on the heavier RPK receiver. These are hard to come by, due to Century no longer importing them. This is the double stack model, and not a modified single. It also has a rail mounted dust cover, which works well with the locking button found on the receiver. (Doesn't jiggle when fired.)This is the more expensive model, and I will not entertain any trade/cash values that reflect the N-PAP value, and not the O-pap."

The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.
The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.
The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.
Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."

This is a great gun to get into long range shooting. Easily upgradable if you wanted to stick with it, or great to learn on. Look up some videos of this gun hitting a mile and 1000 yards stock. It is also good for hunting, very light weight, shorter barrel. I'm changing directions with my longrange setup so hopefully someone will enjoy this gun. It comes with the Harris Bipod, AAC 3 prong muzzle brake (original thread cap also included) vortex mid height rings, Nikko Sterling 4-12x50 illuminated optic, extra mag, and original box. The only thing that would really need upgraded is the scope, but it works just fine for a couple hundred yards. Asking $400 obo cash, or trades for AR, glock 19, AK, 1911, milsurp guns, firearms.

It is not like a cheep aluminum smoker from Walmart. This one is all welded 1/8th inch or larger steel. I am looking to trade it b/c it is way too big for my apt complex. It has never even been lit. It has just been sitting out on my deck for about a year and as u can see it has a little surface rust in a couple of spots. I am valuing the grill acordingly, but the lite oxidation should come off with steal wool or can be covered with a few passes of spray paint. The BBQ grill is hand made and one of a kind. It has the Auburn logo welded on the front of the cover. I am only selling because the grill has not been used and will be a hastle to move, but  I'm definantly not going to trade it to  for a 200 dollar Tarrus or something like that. Similar custom grills of this size sell for upwards of $1000. I am obviously not asking anywhere close to that, even in trade value. Offer anything you would like as long as it is reasonable. Pickup will probablty be required, but i might could make some arangements if that is not a possability for you. The grill is for TRADE only at this time."

Century has been using up the last of the CETME surplus parts to make these and I see the stock is running out a lot of vendors and the prices are creeping up On the remaining stock. This newer C308 differs from the original CETME they made in that PTR makes the receivers and maybe the barrels too (don't remember). Also, the receiver has a picatinny rail on top, solving an age-old problem of how to mount optics on this design. Was planning to just hold on to this because I know it will go up in value, but it needs to go to someone that will shoot it. Besides, I need some cash to fund some stuff for my boat.
