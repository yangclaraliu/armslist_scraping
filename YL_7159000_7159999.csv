Two of which magazines are glock factory, one has a TTI firepower +6 round extender (about $50 value, I have Another mag like this if interested) this firearm has served me well, I've put around 4,000 rounds through it.  Thus the new recoil assembly I just installed from glock before I sell it. I put well over $1,100 into this gun. I'm asking for $600 because the cerakote has some holster wear and you may want a different color if the blue titanium doesn't suit you.  Firearm comes with original box. I can also include original trigger if you want it, the Zev trigger is fully adjustable for pre-travel, reset, etc.I will except trades, let me know what you have, worst I can say is no.

They will probably outlive me and still be in excellent condition.This model has an ambidextrous decocker and an ambidextrous magazine release. Very handy for lefties.If you want a 45 that is going to fire every time, be accurate, easy to shoot and be super rugged and reliable, then this is your baby. In single action mode it has an excellent, soft, smooth trigger that will surprise you. It belongs on a gun costing much more than this one.Not going to win any beauty contests, but extremely dependable. Actually I think they are quite handsome - but that is because I shoot them and like how they function.Usual disclaimers. If it is here on the web site, don't ask if it is available. Please just tell me you are interested.If this was only a handgun with a single magazine, it would go for less. But these are four factory magazines, just as reliable and durable as the gun. And they are over $30 each online.Price is firm.You must have a valid permit and ID. Not interested in trades so please don't ask.Thank you for looking."

Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward eject, like in the FN 2000 or the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex. The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. Obviously, the bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable). The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments.

I know you can buy these in bulk at silly-cheap prices, but that usually takes a large investment of cash up front and a decent shipping charge for the weight.

It's a hell of a deal for a hell of a gun. I'm not looking for trades, as I said I need the cash for my AR-15 build.Located in Northville/Novi, willing to travel but nothing crazy.

Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward eject, like in the FN 2000 or the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex. The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. Obviously, the bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable). The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments.

Like New. This one is size medium; I am 5-9 and 150lbs, and I am at the lower end of what the side-strap adjustments can accomodate. There's plenty of room for a thicker individual, but none for a thinner one. Plates are not included. I have included a tacti-cool patch, because, as GarandThumb says: ""What's the point of going out if you don't look good?"" I find that this plate carrier allows me to conceal my triple-curve AR-500 plates under a jacket. SAPI plates may be too thick for this plate carrier.Pull two twenties out of your wallet and this baby is yours!"
