If you have something like this I may be interested, but I will not buy something that is has a too loose action (wobbles or is loose fitting) or rattles when you shake it.  If it doesn't fire, I can possibly work with that but I would need to know make and model so I can check on availability of parts.

Barrel Length: 4.25-inch. 
Overall Length: 7.75-inch. 
Weight: 27 oz. / 1.68 lb. (0.76 kg.) 
Magazine: Single column box magazine. 9-round (.38 Super). 
Finish: Blued Steel. 
Features: Aluminum Coltalloy (tm) frame. 


Good condition. No pitting, some surface oxidation on top left slide. Original coltite grips, Replaced factory magazine with Meggar (original was damaged beyond repair)
Fires flawlessly, less than 20 round count. I still have the box of ammo that came with the gun when i got it backin 89. The man i purchased this pistol from said that he had shot one clip. A small scratch here and there but nothing major(what would be expected from a carried firearm). Colt Emblem has been double stamped(factory error)
the colt 38 super is rare and collectable so I figure that the double colt stamping adds to its collectable character!

This Colt could become a fine showpiece with little effort, like the ones seen on gunbroker and other sites. I know in my heart very few pieces this old are in pristine or mint condition so please respect the gun for what it is and offer accordingly please. would like to get some normal carry pieces out of this deal, they dont have to be new just work!!!

Looking for automatic DA/SA pieces that i can carry or a cash offer or both! send me a email@ REDACTED with pics of trades and a contact number you can be reached at.

It is in immaculate condition- there's not one scratch, it's spotless, and it works perfectly. I bought it brand new not even 6 months ago, and I have only put 28 rounds through it, so it's basically brand new. I have cleaned and oiled it several times because I just enjoy cleaning and assembling firearms (a hobby of mine). I'm selling because I don't use it as much as I thought I would, and it just sits in its case.

This is the flattest and most concealable 9mm handgun on the market today with a width of .88 inches. Kel Tec made it specifically for its concealment, but when fired, it shoots just like a full-sized handgun. It comes with the Kel Tec PF9 handgun itself, a 7 round magazine, a trigger lock, and a belt clip that is attached to the handgun which allows you to conceal carry in your pants without the use of a holster (you can see it in the first picture on the side of the gun.  It is removable if you don't want it on there...and it IS a Kel Tec part, not some homemade attachment. It's a $22 part, but it was well worth it.). This is the newer model PF9 so it comes with an accessory rail in front of the trigger. All this comes in the original case with the instruction booklet.  Kel Tec has a lifetime warranty on their firearms, as well. MSRP for the Kel Tec PF9 is $319-$333, but I'm selling for $260. If you have any questions, feel free to email me. Thanks for your interest."

For instance, it has been changed from cock on closed to cock on open, among other things. It is an older 30-06. It shoots great, looks great, and functions fine. I just want a scope on one, and I was told by the gunsmith that it would actually DEvalue this gun to drill and tap for scope mounts. It has the older sights with adjustment for windage and elevation. It is a really nice piece and would go great for someone who collects this type of thing. Ideally, I would like to trade this for or possibly towards another 30-06 that has a scope or at least provisions to easily put a scope on it. If I didn't trade straight up, I wouldn't be able to put a whole lot of boot with it, meaning I am NOT looking for a $1000 gold plated mantle piece or something. I am looking for something that doesn't mind or has even seen some use. I would sell it for the price listed, but just to use the money to buy another 30-06.

I have exactly 1150 in the rifle and realize it was purchased at the high end of the market, I do not need to recover all my costs but close would be nice. I have pics available and will email upon request. Serious inquires are appreciated and I will give as much detailed information as I have. I have some ideas in mind and I know the AR market is fairly saturated at the moment, I am realistic. Glock 45's 10mm's and 40's with the right accessories (Xtra mags, ammo, light/attachments, ect.) will be considered as well. I'm not going to take a large loss since the rifle isn't ""eating anything"". I also have a Bushmaster Carbon 15 AR Pistol in the same price range, NIB never fired.

Never been fired.  Comes with Leupold Scope Rings and Two Boxes of Ammo.  This is absolutely Beautiful!!!

The Model 82A1 series rifle is a rugged, dependable semi-automatic rifle. In simple terms, it has earned unmatched respect because it works in battlefield conditions. Our military men and women have depended on over 5,000 Model 82A1rifles to protect themselves and to protect our freedoms. 

Unlike other semi-automatic .50 BMG's, the Model 82A1 is completely reliable. Its chamber is chrome plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition. Close tolerances on all parts and intelligent design allows it to function in all environments. The trigger is appropriate for a battle rifle. 

The improved muzzle brake, along with dual barrel springs and a long mainspring design make the Model 82A1 comfortable and fun to shoot. Rapid, accurate fire from its ten round magazine is a breeze. 

The Model 82A1 fits in a regular sized carry case. It is transported disassembled as an upper and lower receiver. The rifle is assembled and ready to fire in under a minute by inserting 2 assembly pins through both receivers. Since the scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, the scope zero is maintained. The Model 82A1's M1913 optics rail is elevated 27 MOA to take full advantage of a scope's elevation travel. Emergency iron sights are provided as well. 

For over 2 decades, the short-recoil, semi-automatic Model 82A1 series has been refined and improved. There are no competitors. 

The Model 82A1 is what you expect in a Barrett. Dependable. Reliable. Well-designed."

I'll consider just about any other caliber as well (rifle or handgun) if you send me a good offer.
Thank you.

I could also do a trade for some extra AR15 mags, SKS mags or AK47 mags."

This gun is used but in very good shape.  I'm very picky, so I tend to give more details than necessary to some but I just want to make sure both parties walk away happy.  Gun has been holstered and shows VERY SLIGHT wear on the slide.  Photo #2 was taken without flash just so you can see this clearly.

I prefer to sell person to person and not have to worry with shipping thru FFL if possible.

About this Glock Model 30:
standard clip is 10 rounds of the Whopping .45ACP + 1 in the barrel if you choose.  Shoots great... if you're near Little Rock AR you would be welcome to meet at Don's Weaponry and shoot it at the indoor range.  It has TRU DOT night sights that glow Green... great for the nightstand.

Clips:  I have (5) of the 10 Round Clips.  Each has the Pinky Gripper installed.  (3) of the (5) are Pierce Brand pinky grippers and other (2) are Scherer Brand pinky grippers.    Also have (1) of the rare 9 Round Clips with Pierce Brand pinky gripper that is great when concealed to make the handle just a tad bit shorter.  So total of (6) clips included with this gun.

Plug included to put in the hole when the 10 round clip is used.  It just pulls in and out - no tools required.

Gun has Extended slide release installed and I have the original slide release loose but will include with sale.

Holster:  Included in the sale is a Kydex Paddle Holster made by www.Hoffners.com and they call it the ""Speed Pro Paddle"".  It's neet that it is adjustable for cant and very handy if you need to be able to slide it on quickly with ease.

Original Glock Box with matching serial number label and owners/safety manual included.  Feel free to contact me with any questions.  

I would like to get a Glock .40 models 22 that may be used for IDPA in the future. 

Keep Smiling,

I would entertain offer of the Glock with only the (2) Scherer Pinky Gripper Mags for only $450.   I could sell the rest of the mags.

I do have few more items for this Glock Model 30 that did not include in the listing that may be included if the deal is right:  a 13 round clip from the Glock 21 Model with +2 extension (that makes it a 15 rounder) with A&G Spacer attached.

Up for sale is my recently built AR. (sorry for the wall of text, just thought I'd put enough information so you know what I'm lookin for) 

The upper is a Colt heavy barrel with the A2 style carry handle. It has a 20"" barrel and rifle length hand guards. The barrel twist is 1/7 so it can reliably shoot 5.56 or .223. It is slightly used, it has seen maybe 90 rounds of ammo. It also has a z-rail attached to the carry handle.

The lower, lower parts kit, and stock are all new. The lower is made by CMMG. It has a DPMS lower parts kit, Ergo Grip pistol grip, and a Command Arms 6 position adjustable stock. There is a tiny bit of wear on the hammer from hand cycling, but it has never actually fired a round. There is space in the back of the stock for 4 CR123 batteries for a mountable flashlight, and space for 2 more of said batteries in the pistol grip.

 It will come with five 30 round magazines (3 of them are normal steel magazines, the other 2 are windowed P-Mags).

Asking price is $850 for everything. Will trade for good condition .357 snub nose+cash, or maybe a Taurus Raging Bull chambered in .44mag or .454 casull+cash. I will consider other trade offers, but I'm mostly interested in handguns, I don't need anymore rifles or shotguns.

Additionally, if you are interested in just the upper or the lower, I will sell those separately as well. Asking price for the lower is $300 or trade for a decent little .357 or any of the guns in the previous paragraph. The upper is $600, or trade for any of the guns above or cash, or a combination of the two, whatever is easiest for you. 

Other things I would be interested in trading for that aren't firearm related are RC cars (nitro or electric) + cash, or a ps3 bundle with Metal Gear Solid 4 + cash.

Face to face only, I will not ship any part of this weapon. Also, please don't contact me wanting to make a deal, then back out and decide that you aren't going to tell me, that just wastes my time as well as yours. 

If you are interested you can email me at REDACTED, or you can give me a call or text any time at REDACTED. If I don't answer then just leave me a message and I'll get back to you. If you have any questions please let me know and I will answer them asap. Thanks for looking."

I will mention that the cylinder gap is very tight.  So tight that after a few cylinders of lead semi wad cutters, it'll start to drag.  I checked it with my feeler gauges and I could get a 2 in there,l but not a 3.  From what I can tell the spec should be between 4 and 10, so she's a little tight.  This could easliy be remedied by a competent gunsmith and a stone, or send it back to Smith and have them adjust it by probably doing the same thing.  No original box or grips.

***EDIT: I am willing to ship. Also while I would rather trade, I will sell for $650.00 OBO***

I have a blued Browning Hi power with adjustable sights. This is, I believe, a MK III Standard Model. Date code ""PN"" indicates it was produced about 1989. It was during the transition to the cast frames, this one has the older style forged frame indicated by looking at the frame near the mag well. Has what I believe to be the factory grips on it in good shape. Still has the magazine safety installed.

Overall I would say that this gun hasn't been fired much and hasn't been carried much. It has one scratch in the bluing on the left side of the slide near the safety but it isn't that bad and some bluing wear/spotting on the front of the grips. I have some detailed photos to show it, the really bad smudge is where I blurred the end of the serial number.

Photos are posted here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/16413443@N00/   

I tried to show any flaws and wear areas. It's a good looking pistol. 

I bought this on a whim and never shot it. I am not the original owner so I can't tell you round count. I have a picture of the barrel lugs showing no wear that I can tell. That said, I am not a gun dealer so just judge it by the photos. 

It comes with a browning hi power box without the sticker on the side, the manual and one 13rd magazine. 

I am willing to use cash either way depending on what someone has for trade.

Want a larger caliber (.308+) AR-10 in trade or a good cash offer so I can purchase one. I prefer Armalite, but there are many great gun manufacturers here in the USA.

Upper: Colt 20-inch barrel 1:9 twist w/ bayonet lug. Barrel marked ""C MP Chrome Bore""; C for the manufacturer Colt, MP stamp means the barrel was magnafluxed and proofed, chrome bore and chamber. (Bolt stamped with SE inside an 8 sided octagon).

Lower: PWA (Pac West Arms, Milan, Ill.; this was the early LMT company I believe and Rock River Arms bought out PWA. From everything that I have heard they are excellent lowers!) 5.56mm Commando. This is a forged lower not cast. Serial# 11174. (PWA post-ban have a year prefix in the serial number. The serial # cutoff was 35222 for preban status).

Standard two point sling. Has a new AR-16 cleaning kit in the butt stock storage compartment. Have one USA 30 round AR-15 .223 magazine by O'Kay Industries, Inc., New Britain, Conn.

This AR is in great shape and supreme working order. I had it fully serviced (new parts, fired & cleaned) by a gunsmith at Anderson's Gun Repair Shop here in Springfield, MO before putting it up for sale; new extractor spring & gas tube (had a dent in the tube which slowed the gas pressure).

I've had this same rifle (but fully auto - M16) issued to me during the latter part of the Vietnam conflict. I hate to part with this, but with the times as they are now I would prefer a much larger caliber for home defense. Not worried about whether or not you can hunt with it.

The P250Â®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUERÂ® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

I have a Daewoo DH40 that I've been thinking about trading off. I would LIKE to do a FTF in Arkansas - I really don't want to ship - but if the deal was really good - I would probably ship it.

I bought it years ago brand new in the box - unfired. I only recently took it out to the range and put a magazine through it. It's flawless - looks absolutely new - comes with the box, owners manual, both mags. Just checked gunbroker and there's not a single one for sale.

The gun has the tri-action... unique to Daewoo - check out the videos on youtube  to see how it works - it's sweet. Looks like a Smith - tight as heck and very accurate. I'm just thinking of sticking to 9mm and .45 - easier to stockpile !

If you have something to trade - let me know. I like pistols. 9mm and .45. Sigs, 1911's, XD's, M&P's, Glocks, etc. But I also like everything else. Optics, rifles, whatever. Just let me know what you have.

Shoot me your offers no matter w hat it is.  I'm always checking my email.

This picture isn't of my gun but this is exactly what it looks like - just like new!
