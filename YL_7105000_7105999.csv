With the exception of taking it out for a few rounds when I first purchased it and got it set up she has just sat in the safe. I put on weaver bases and see through rings to utilize the original sights which I just love and an older 4-12x40 herters scope. I ended up removing the scope and rings recently and decided she probably needs to go to a collector or someone who wants to take this 50 year old girl out to the woods for a little action. Its really just too darn nice for me. If I dropped her in the dirt or scratched her up going through the brush I would be really POed. Bluing and wood are still in amazing shape with minimal wear. Iron sights on this are really great. I am looking to get 600 for the rifle and bases. Let me know if you want pictures of anything in particular.

The OSS retains the loaded chamber indicator of the other 24/7 models, and additionally allows visual verification that the pistol is ready to fire as the striker can be seen when the pistol is cocked"

It shoots well and the trigger is really good on it in single and double action. The reason these go for so cheap is becasue of foreign labor and lack of refinement to inner metals that aren't shown on the exterior finish. This lack of refinement shows tool marks rather than smooth surfaces on areas that don't impact function of the firearm. I'm asking for $220 because it goes for around $260 new.

This pistol is used, it comes with one mag, a hard case and is 24k gold plated with a Tiger stripe pattern. The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time."

Looking to sell my Ruger SP 101 357 mag 2 1/8"" Fixed Sights. It shoots well. This gun is almost new, I shot about 200 rounds (38 spc and /357) – no issues.
Serious inquiries only, please.
Purchase requirements: 2 forms of ID (i.e a Virginia driver’s license/voters card or concealed carry permit, military ID, etc.). Bill of sale is mandatory.
“”You Can Never Be Too Prepared. The Ruger SP101® revolver boasts the strength to handle the powerful 357 Magnum cartridge in a controllable, small-framed double-action revolver. Among the most powerful small-frame revolvers on the market, they are engineered for solid performance. Featuring a recoil-reducing grip, the SP101® is comfortable to shoot and perfect for personal defense or field use.
Strong and reliable shot after shot, all SP101® revolvers have solid steel sidewalls (no side-plates), making them rugged, reliable, and dependable.””
I am interested in .357 4 inch barrel revolvers. I may consider military surplus rifles/pistols in good condition. We can add cash into the mix.
