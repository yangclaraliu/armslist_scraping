They’ll make a great addition to your military arms collection and a joy to use on the range. The pistols were a part of law enforcement/ corrections officer turn in program. We are happy to give our customers the first chance of owning one of the finest pistols ever produced for the western world’s Armed Forces and Law Enforcement Officers, Graded to be in Good Condition with some holster and user wear on the pistols.The Browning Hi-Power has undergone continuous refinement by FN since its introduction. The pistols were originally made in two models: an ""Ordinary Model"" with fixed sights and an ""Adjustable Rear Sight Model"" with a tangent-type rear sight and a slotted grip for attaching a wooden shoulder stock. The adjustable sights are still available on commercial versions of the Hi-Power, although the shoulder stock mounts were discontinued during World War II. In 1962, the design was modified to replace the internal extractor with an external extractor, improving reliability. Standard Hi-Powers are based on a single-action design. Unlike modern double-action semi-automatic pistols, the Hi-Power's trigger is not connected to the hammer. If a double-action pistol is carried with the hammer down with a round in the chamber and a loaded magazine installed, the shooter may fire the pistol by simply pulling the trigger so long as the slide was previously cocked, or by pulling the hammer back and pulling the trigger. In contrast, a single-action pistol must be cocked manually before the first shot, by pulling the slide to the rear and releasing it. In common with the M1911, the Hi-Power is therefore typically carried with the hammer cocked and the safety catch on (a carry mode often called cocked and locked in the USA or ""made ready"" in the UK, or sometimes called condition one).Import Marking Located Under The Pistols, Just Forward Of The Trigger Guard In Small LettersBarrel Length – 4.7” Overall Length – 7.8” inches Weight – 2.2lb Action – Short recoil Operated  Caliber – 9x19mm Parabellum Capacity – 13 rounds Come with One MagazineSights – Most have fixed sightsAs with any Surplus Firearm, Please have your firearm inspected by a gunsmith before firing the firearm.Firearms must ship to FFL Dealer for pickup.

Simple is significant. For a household name like Ken Onion, creativity reigns supreme. His designs run the gamut, inspired by everything from WWII heirlooms to dune buggies. But when he sat down to create the Prowess™ he had something different in mind. This everyday carry folder nods at what a damn good knife should be: simple and functional. No bare bones here, this one is all meat and potatoes. From his workshop in Kaneohe, Hawaii, Ken Onion has carved out a spot for the Prowess™ among his line of hard work inspired everyday carry pocket knives. He spent days mulling over the perfect form—considering the shapes and geometry from a lineup of the most iconic knives of the past. The result: a modified drop point blade in a league all its own. Paired with an IKBS™ ball bearing pivot system and a subtle, textured flipper, it opens fast and digs into your workday without wasting a second. With a textured, black glass-reinforced nylon handle, your grip can withstand adverse conditions and stick to the job at hand. A subtle Yin and Yang detail on the pivot finishes the clean look. Think subtlety falls short? The Prowess™ begs to differ.
