It will come with a IIIa armor insert; you must not be a felon, intend to use for any unlawful purpose. I will respond to emails ASAP; $300 for everything.""The Draco Hardened BackPack [HBP] was created in answer to numerous agency/unit requests for an integrated assault pack/plate carrier solution. Through many design iterations and after reviewing field test evaluations from Real-World end users, we have landed upon the current design. Equally at home running Border Op’s or responding on the backs of a QRF operator half a World away, the Draco HBP has the adaptability to answer any missions needs.By having the plate pocket align with the TOP of the pack, it lines up appropriately with a front side plate carrier. The quick specs include: 1800 cu/in main compartment, separately accessed large SAPI plate pocket, full MOLLE lined interior compartment, full MOLLE front panel, 2 column MOLLE sides, “Armor” compatible shoulder straps with sternum strap, hydration port, (2) interior zipper access flat pockets, and a hanging mesh pouch. The bottom of the armor pocket provides a small discrete space, which perfectly accommodates our Mini-Vis Signal Panel (sold separately, MSRP $29.99).Interfacing the Draco HBP with the ACS Collar can be accomplished 2 ways: First, by simply threading the supplied shoulder straps through the ACS Collar, you can realize the benefits of a padded collar. Secondly, you can interface the Draco HBP with either a DTPC or MPAR/AKARv2 with our Side-Release Kit. This kit provides for a near Outer Tactical Vest solution.The Draco HBP is constructed of 500d Cordura nylon, and utilizes made in the USA hardware and materials.""Mini-Vis Panel not included!Specifications:Materials: 500d Cordura NylonColors: BlackVolume: 1800 in3Weight: 2.4lbs w/o armor 3.8lbs w/ soft armor"

The satin finish does have some very minor handling marks that are very hard to see and on the left side of the frame there is a blemish below the cylinder, but it is only visual, as you cannot feel it if you run your finger across it."

In all time U.S. sales of high-powered rifles, the 336 is second only to the Winchester ’94. Chambered in 30-30, Marlin’s potent Brady to Welker-esque combo has put venison on many a table across the country. It did so via a wide variety of calibers, including 219 Zipper, .32 Special and .44 Magnum. These days you can buy a Marlin lever-action rifle in any caliber you like—as long as it’s 30-30 Winchester or .35 Remington.In the 1950’s, Marlin built its 336 lever guns with their proprietary “Micro-Groove” barrels. The technique ditches a small number of deep rifling grooves (a.k.a. Ballard rifling) for a larger number shallow rifling grooves. The idea: modern jacketed bullets would perform get into the micro-grooves better than they would with Ballard rifling (designed for non-jacketed lead bullets)."

This is a Cold Steel Master Hunter fixed blade knife that was just purchased at Christmas. Knife is excellent and comes in original box with sheath. Here is the description from Cold Steel:Modesty seldom comes into play when we are describing how good our knives are. But in the case of the Master Hunter®, we've been unquestionably negligent in that department. So, modesty aside, we want to go on record and say, without a doubt, the Master Hunter® is the best hunting knife you can obtain at any price. It features a broad VG-1 San Mai III® blade that's been flat ground to achieve the ideal blade cross-section and edge geometry. Carefully honed to razor sharpness, its edge cuts effortlessly while its dropped point simplifies the chore of field dressing and skinning.The spine of the blade is a full 3/16"" thick to allow for the necessary strength and stiffness to field dress and skin the biggest animals like elk, moose, brown bear, and the African Dangerous Seven. The grip is specially designed to promote long use without fatigue. Made of the shock absorbent, slightly tacky feeling Kray-Ex™, and featuring our deeply checkered surface, it positively won't slip no matter how wet or bloody your hands get. Plus, Kray-Ex™ has specially enduring advantages in that it will never rot, shrink, crack, splinter, or mildew, and is completely impervious to even the harshest weather. For safety, the Master Hunter® comes in a thick, heavy Conceal-Ex™ sheath that will accommodate just about any size belt and allow you to carry it all day without fatigue.Priced to move! $75.  Thanks!FTF ONLY.  WILL NOT SHIP.   MUST BE 18 OR OVER."

It is a double or single action, so you can pull the hammer back for a lighter trigger squeeze or leave it down for a full squeeze. It has about 100 rounds through it, never had any problems whatsoever. I'm shipping out for the marine corps so I've gotta get rid of some weapons. You can text any time at REDACTED.

Horner identified their company as Firearms International in Houston, TX. Horner was a member of The Carbine Club and had many years of experience as a gunsmith with M1 Carbines. After Horner began assembling the carbines the owners of Firearms International incorporated Israel Arms International (IAI) and decided to use this name on all of their firearms, instead of the name of Firearms International. Firearms International and Israel Arms International were owned and operated by the same people at the same address in Houston. The carbines with the name of Firearms International were the predecessors of what would become the carbines with the name of Israel Arms International several years later. Differences in the name, markings, and receivers have prompted presenting the history of the Firearms International carbines separate, and as a lead into, the carbines made by IAI. If you have an interest in the history of these companies and their carbines, you may wish to read the web page devoted to Firearms International prior to reading the history of Israel Arms International."

It is a six shot revolver chambered in .38 Special. It was widely used by several U.S. police, sheriff and state agencies. The Model 64 was a popular choice in high humid states because the stainless model 64 was more corrosion and rust resistant than the blued model 10. Noted for its accuracy, dependability and manageable recoil, the Model 64 & the Model 10 .38 Special remain a popular Smith and Wesson revolver more than a hundred years after its introduction.

It is chambered in 7mm Mag. These were made in the mid 90's and is an actual New Haven, Conn. rifle that is built on the pre-'64 M70 action. They were built by Winchester's in-house custom shop and came from the factory with an aluminum bedded HS Precision stock, heavy target douglass barrels and a custom tunable trigger that was adjustable down to 2.5 lbs. The trigger on this baby is sweet. These are very hard to find and great shooting rifles. This one is a sub-moa rifle.The rifle just got back from a fresh dura coat job and looks great. Included with the rifle is a 1 piece Leopold scope mount with rings (scope and bipod not included). Also includes about 90 rounds of 7mm Mag ammo, 70 of it being factory new and the rest handloads. Price is pretty firm, however I am open  on trades.

For the Model 36, they sought to design a revolver that could fire the more powerful .38 Special round in a small, concealable package. Since the older I-frame was not able to handle this load, a new frame was designed, which became the Smith & Wesson J-frame. The new design was introduced at the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) convention in 1950, and was favorably received. A vote was held to name the new revolver, and the name ""Chiefs Special"" won.A three-inch barreled version of this design went into production immediately, due to high demand. It was available in either a blued or nickel plated finish.It was produced as the ""Chiefs Special"" until 1957, when it then became the Model 36."
