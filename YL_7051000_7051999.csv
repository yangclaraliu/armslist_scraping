REASON: THE HANDLE WILL IMPACT THE ARM ON THE 'ISC RISER MOUNT'. THE 'LPM-1H' OPTIC MOUNT IS RECOMMENDED FOR RIFLES WITH LEFT-SIDE CHARGING HANDLES. The ISC Riser optic mount is manufactured from high quality aluminum alloy and has been hardcoat anodized for added surface strength, abrasion resistance, and corrosion protection. ISC is an abbreviation for 'Iron Sight Capable' as this mount allows use of irons sights when attached to the side rail.The picatinny rail is centered over the receiver cover and is positioned away from ejected shell casings. This mount should only be used with optics that will not extend into the path of ejected casings - such as red dot optics. If an optic is used that extends beyond the picatinny rail, there is a high probability that the optic will be impacted regularly by ejected casings.Additional details:- attaches to the rifle using the CSA side rail (side rails can be purchased in the 'Parts and Accessories' section). If your vz.58 does not already have drilled and tapped holes in the receiver, gunsmithing is required to attach the rail by drilling and tapping the receiver.- possesses a quick detach lever- easily attached with the factory folding stock in place- iron sights can be used while the mount is attached- receiver cover and bolt assembly can be removed while the mount is attached- stripper clips can be used to load the magazine with the mount in place"

Great Gun... not used too much. Youtube search for "" Steven M1 Carbine Shooting Colorado Springs "" to see a live video of me shooting the gun. I found out this is a ""Universal"" gun manufacturer, It is the Generation 1 of the gun. It was well produced. Apparently, the Gen2 and Gen3 , were terrible?

Long Belt Pistol w Olry A Nancy Marked Lock
Here we present an antique George Keiser A Vienne Percussion Pistol, made circa 1840 in Vienna, Austria. This pistol was made for putting large holes in things. It could be carried on the belt or on the saddle. It was equally suited for combat as it was for target shooting as it does have both front and rear sights, not a given during this period in firearms history. The lock is marked “OLRY A NANCY”. The top of the barrel flat is marked “GEORGE KEISER A VIENNE”. The stock is finely checkered and stylized as it draws toward the pommel.
The overall condition is fine. The metal was left in the white, which has been nicely preserved. The markings are clear and legible. The walnut stock is fine. The bore is smooth. The action is strong.
Own the original! This is a legitimate antique and not a reproduction.
Barrel is 11-1/2 inches in length.
Caliber: .60
The bore is fine and the firing mechanism is strong.
Overall condition as seen in photos."

Beretta no longer imports this model, making it extremely valuable as a collectible, however, the real value is in the Superb Accuracy and overall functional utility as a go-to weapon of choice for one's home or person.  The weapon is in Pristine condition, with original case, cleaning kit, Owner's manual and High-capacity magazines.  The Optics are Redfield, (owned by Leupold), with a Green dot, Red dot and Laser sighting system.  Only 3 rounds were needed to dial-in the Optics, with 2 rounds going through the same hole in the Bullseye!  With 180 grain ammo, this Firearm delivers over 4 Times the downrange mass of 40 gr. AR round!
With this firepower and accuracy, you will own a most formidable and desirable weapon.  It also comes with an Extremely Bright Streamlight TRL-1 HL weapons-light with touch-on, lock-on and strobe features.  This powerfully illuminates a large and wide area, perfect for home defense.  Also, it comes with a DeSantis cheekpad and extra mag carrier unit, for extra ammo on the go.  I hate to let this one go, but I'm starting a business and will use proceeds for that.
So, here is your opportunity to own a phenomenal weapon that's super-accurate, compact and extremely lethal.  And, with a Private Sale, you will have complete confidentiality with only you and I knowing that you own it, and not the Government.  Make it Yours today!"

The trigger pull is very short but positive and crisp, not mushy, and has a very short reset.)Warren Tactical Sevigny competition series sights with fiber optic front and serrated rearLWD stainless steel takedown pinsExtended slide stop leverExtended magazine releaseFrame work: finger grooves removed (no stippling under the A-grip wrap-I prefer the wrap), double undercut, stippled, and flared trigger guard, relieft cut around magazine release, very slight palm swell reduction (this serves more to make the grip feel more vertical without reducing the size of the grip-I have large hands and it fits great), wedge cut stippling on the index points, custom mixed storm grey duracoat, A-grip synthetic suede grip wrap (most people don't know what this is, but I love it and have it on all my guns. It is soft but very high traction. It works great when wet or dry, doesn't grab on clothing and feels soft when carried concealed. It also lasts literally years, but I just replaced it.)I obviously have a lot of time and money into this gun. It is a formidable competition/race setup, but it's not finicky or unreliable. It still feeds any ammo, has all stock functionality, and it's a fun pistol to shoot. It's had plenty pf rounds through it, but was always maintained well and is 100% reliabe. There a few minor cosmetic issues: Ships/scuffs in the duracoat on the bottom of the trigger guard-this happened while the coating was fresh and still soft. There is also a blemish in the coating on the left side of the slide-it's slightly discolored in a spot. Please contact me with any questions."

The outside of the barrel looks like the old original Winchester Octagon barrel as for the markings and the flats are nice and sharp, it has most of the blued finish on the barrel like 95% but its probably an old re-blued finish at that.

The scope was probably made by Weaver for Sears Co., its a 4x scope marked J.C.Higgins, all steel with standard crosshairs, its very clear and seems to work. The receiver would have originally been color case hardened but somewhere along the line it was re-blued too, not the same as the barrel, its a pale matte blue color, no rust or bad marks on any of the metal.
