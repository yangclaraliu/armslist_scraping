History of Taurus 92 Berreta: Source Taurus

In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

Ruger Super Blackhawk Bisley .44 Mag Revolver, 3.75 Inch Barrel, Stainless Steel, Ruger 0818
The stainless Ruger Super Blackhawk has been a mainstay in the Ruger catalog for many years. Many prefer the Bisley gripframe for its excellent recoil control, while others like the short and handy 3-3/4″ barrel length that makes for a very nice carry size revolver. Our latest exclusive marries these two features into one sixgun that is easy to carry and can handle the heavy recoil from full power 44 Magnum loads. The stainless barrel features a pinned front sight that can be customized to your liking. The black laminate grips contrast well to the clean lines of the satin stainless steel construction. If you are looking for a “little big gun” for the woods, this is the one for you.

I purchased this from Cabelas back in 2012 for grouse hunting. Based off of the serial number I was able to call Remington and get some information about the weapon.
Date of manufacture: 1941
Grade: 11F - Premier Grade
Unknown barrel marks
27 inch barrel
Modified choke
Pheasant and goose engravings
Overall this shotgun is in great condition for it's age. After use I always cleaned it the proper way and it has always operated very well and reliably. I printed off the manual from Remington's website so I'll give you that so you can continue to take pride in this piece of American weaponry. 
This website only allows small images so if you would like more just shoot me an email and I will send you the originals and then some additional ones. 
The reason I am selling it is because I was given some other shotguns that has replaced the need for this 12GA. 
I am open to offers or trades for other hunting/fishing equipment."

Just got it last week and have only put 80 rounds through it. This is the new version that came out this year without the laser. Has real usable sights unlike msot handguns of this type and a slide stop, totally reliable even with steel cased ammo. Smooth trigger, easily pocket carriable but its a bit too small for my hands, so I'd like to trade it for something a bit bigger. Comes with its box and everything it came with, two 6 round magazines, and for the right trade I can include the remainder of the .380 I have left, around 150 rounds.

Primarily looking for a Ruger SR9c or LC9, or a S&W J Frame, particularly a 638, maybe an M&P Shield, but I'm open to similar guns. Prefer 9mm but might consider .40 as well. Can add a little cash depending on what you have. No Kel Tecs please, or rifles or shotguns.

Very fun gun to shoot and from my experience at the range, (today) it eats whatever you feed it. And... It's equipped with that I consider the best laser/light combo on the market, The Crimson Trace Rail Master Pro. This is the green laser model which sells every day for $300.00 hands down. I mounted the laser, sighted it in and ran 6 mags through the Beretta with not one hiccup. I'm not in a hurry but just seeing what else is out there. I'm pretty much open to all reasonable offers, but no lowballers. This gun sells for 600.00 regularly and with the Crimson trace included im looking at nothing less than $900 in trade value. I'm interested in quality handguns, quality Hunting setups in 30-06 and bigger calibers. Just let me know what you have to offer. Thanks for looking."
