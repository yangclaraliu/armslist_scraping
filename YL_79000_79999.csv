Now it is $35 OBO! It's worth $62.50 at the Gun Cellar RIGHT NOW!

I have a very nice barely used De Santis Thumb Break Scabbard holster for RIGHT HANDED shooters! It's a black leather outside the waistband Pancake/Scabbard holster which can be worn either straight up and down OR canted forward. I wore this for maybe two months but I got rid of my 92 .. so I really have no use for it now. It includes original packaging including INSTRUCTIONS .. although that's not too necessary now is it? 

Anyways, this thing ran me $62.50 a few months back (heck the package still has the sticker on it! and it's still running for the same price at both stores that I know of around town that sell these. I figure a $22.50 discount for a perfectly good, brand new holster ain't bad! 

Would be wiling to trade for a Glock 26, Glock 30, or Bersa Thunder .380 holster as well!

6 inch barrel in excellent shape.
This is the model with the firing pin on the hammer making it fairly desirable for most.
It has the large N frame square butt, target hammer, target grips, target trigger, and adjustable target sights. Single action is light, and double action is smooth, and if course being a 6 inch it is accurate as hell.
Comes with a Bianchi Cyclone holster made for the 629, it costs over 100 new and can be worn strong side or crossdraw.
It also comes with a custom made sturdy leather holster covered in skulls and barbed wire. It also will just fit the 629, and probably worth quite a bit, and pretty cool looking.
One of the pictures looks like there is a scuff on the lug, it is just a flash issue.

160,http://www.armslist.com/posts/79160,"For Sale:  LaRue Tactical SPR/M4 1.93"" Mount QD LT-135","Newton, Wichita, Kansas",$ 200,"Listed On: Monday, January 31, 2011",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"(Like New) I bought a scope/mount combo and do not need this mount. Mount only with 1"" rings no box. The LT135 is in the same design family as our popular SPR 1.5 mount (LT104), except it is 1.93"" above the rail in order to get riflescopes (like the S&B ShortDot) up above top-mounted laser/illuminators like PEQ-2's and PEQ-15's... It is as simple as that. If you do NOT need the clearance over a laser/illuminator, order the LT104. 

The LT135 places the centerline of the optic 1.93"" above the top of the rail. The extended cantilever positions the scope far out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and Type-III hard-coat anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed"

The serial number is 7XXX and best I can tell, it was manufactured in 1911 based on the serial numbers manufactured in that time frame. This gun was manufactured from 1907 – 1925.

On the left side of the frame above the grip is a symbol of an eye it seems like, with a horse rearing up in the middle with a guy riding it. 

The rear sight is missing and there is some minor wear to the finish, as well as a couple small rust spots, but overall the revolver is in great shape and mechanically sound.  

I am looking to sell for cash, or would consider a trade, or partial trade and I am willing to pay difference in cash if trading for a gun of greater value than my own, or if I accept a gun in trade that is lesser in value, I will take the difference in cash.  After having done much research, I know the value of this gun as I have had it appraised and I am losing money on it at the price it is at, but I want to move it, so please be reasonable in your responses, as I’m willing to deal a little, but I know the worth of this gun and am already taking a loss.

Pistol is well, it's the 1066. Since it's no longer made factory specs are gettin harder to come by. It's all steel, extremely reliable and in excellent condition.

I have RAISED the price on the gun since doing my homework on it. It is a type 3 without bushing, with an ORIGINAL type 7 magazine with crimped base, original mags go for $50-200 for these guns often averaging around $100 when you can find them. older two tone ones for 250 on gunbroker right now, and the guy selling one right now told me they can go as high as 500 on those older two-tone mags. You need an original mag as the aftermarket mags don't work properly. They will only get scarcer."

First one is a Glock model 26 9mm it is clean and shoots very well it comes with a 10rd clip and a nice holster. It is a police trade gun and has been taken care of well also has been professionally cleaned and serviced by a Glock authorized repair guy. 
 Also I have a real nice S&W 4506 with night sights. It has 2 10rd clips and it has just been sonic cleaned and repaired by the Columbus police armory. I was being stupid and didn't know how to properly tear it down to clean it and long story short it has new parts and is in great condition. 
What I am looking to do is trade or sell them outrite. I am looking for the following items.. s&w 500,at-15, mini 14, desert eagle, or possibly something else that looks interesting and makes a big bang. Sorry I don't have any pics right now  also I am a mechanic and would be willing to work out trades for new items so just let me know."

The metal is excellent and the wood is very nice. This AK has grenade launching capability and grenade launching sight as shown in the pictures.

The rifle shoots the popular 7.62x39 caliber. It is very accurate, features a threaded muzzle with a slant brake installed Two mil-surp metal 30 round mag's and Green canvas sling,bayonet lug,bayonet and scabbard (number matching) and heavy duty bipod with 200 rounds of Ammo,upgraded Black fore end with UltiMAK M9 optic mount ( Wood Fore end Included ).Barrel: 16 1/4"", Overall: 34 1/4"".

The rifle is a combination of original Yugoslavian rifle parts and U.S.-made compliance parts. The fit and finish of the rifle is more than acceptable, with an evenly applied Parkerized finish and an above-average-condition wood fore-end.

The M70B1 has some novel features that set it apart from the run-of-the-mill AK variant. First, it has the enlarged and reinforced area around the trunnion like the RPK on its stamped receiver. In addition, a unique grenade ladder sight located on the gas block, when rotated into its upward open position, provides meter range marks and cuts off the gas port in the gas block. Also, the rifle features front and rear flip-up night sights, although the luminous material has long since disappeared. Has a smooth and comfortable trigger."

The Mariner, with Mossberg's exclusive Marinecote finish , is ideal for hostile weather environments, coastal environments, boat patrol, etc. The Mariner is the ideal choice when a vehicular-mounted shotgun is subjected to all-season climates, which can induce condensation on weapons. Rigorous testing proves the Marinecote resists corrosion better than stainless steel. This finish is harder than ordinary gunmetal and provides the added bonus of greater resistance to wear and distinctly smoother action.

One reason so many military and police organizations purchase Mossberg shotguns is that the guns will withstand heavy wear and tear.

It is a straight action bolt. faster than a normal bolt but still has the acuracy. they look a lot like the BAR but without the gas operating action. Keep this for a future investment as these will most likely go up in value or would be a great hunting rifle.

This is my baby. But she isn't a safe queen, she is a shooter. Very good condition, very well taken care of. Never have used corrosive ammo, I break her down and clean her every week. This rifle was built so well, it will outlive you and your kids and still be shooting long after you are gone. 

I am switching to the 74 platform, its the only reason I'm selling. Only trade offers I'd be interested in are AK74 varients plus appropriate cash. Really interested in trading.

It seems to be original, from what I can tell. Early Type I stock with high wood and 'I' cut for sling/oiler, all cartouches in good shape. 'RMC' in sling well, circled 'P' proof mark on bottom of pistol grip, and properly sized Ordnance Cannons in front of sling well. Handguard is Type II with 'OI' stamped on it. Safety is a plunger (type III, specificially) and the Magazine catch is unmarked, dimensions make it a type IIA. Magazine is marked 'IA', has a flat baseplate (type I), and is in great shape. A few marks on the bluing, and a few scratches, but excellent otherwise.

NO RE-IMPORT MARKS. None. Nada. Its original, and in pretty darn good shape considering. Only things that aren't 'right' is that it doesn't have a sling swivel on the (type I) barrel band and it didn't have an oiler & sling. There are a few dings in the stock and some wear on the parkerizing at a few spots on the metal, but I'd place it at about 90% overall condition.

Bluebook on a Type I Inland without rebuild puts it at $1000; an 80% gun would be $875. I'm going to shoot to the middle and ask $950 for it FTF. 

I've got a recent reproduction sling, swivel, and oiler that can go with it, if you'd like. Sling is a little thick for the oiler it came with, and I didn't want to flatten it to make it fit (like the Dutch did with the ones we gave them). I can if you'd like.

I'd prefer FTF in GSO, on a 4473, but can ship at your expense. Any questions, email me. I've got tons of photos and its parts are VERY well documented (no documentation of its military record or anything, though), so questions are welcomed."

Trade for tactical shotguns, semi auto rifles, I'm 20, so don't offer handguns unless you're willing to trade them to me.
Can throw in cash for the right deal, don't scam me, I'm not a rookie to the world of firearms.

No misc items, firearms only, serious people only, don't waste my time and yours.
Also interested in four wheelers, if you have one you'd like to trade I will consider it, if it's in working condition and isn't a pile of junk.

700 cash takes all.
Last time I'm posting, need them gone before the 14th of January or they're going back in the safe until we get to Arizona and most likely never getting used.
