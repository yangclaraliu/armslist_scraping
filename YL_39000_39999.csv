I am asking 625.00 cash (there is no make an offer here) You guys know what you want for your guns so just ask, no more of this make offer. Those of you that are trade guys; this is a great quality gun.  I would expect the same from your trade offer. No AKS, SKS, or other trash, I do not care how tricked out it is. I like Winchester Levers, Rugers, Remington's, Colt, etc. Hand guns need to be in 45ACP, 9mm, 38 or 357, 44 mag., 22 and 22 mag.

Thanks for looking and God bless America."

I have 3 chainsaws, the Poulan Wildthing has an 18"" bar, runs fantastic, and needs nothing. The Mac has a 16"" bar, runs fantastic, but the chain brake handle is broken as seen in the pic. It still works great and can be repaired to like new with minimal effort. The Homelite 330 is in very good shape, and looks like it was only used a few times. It has a newer 20"" bar and chain. The homelite ran great a couple years ago, but it has been sitting for a while in my shed, and now it runs rough. With minimal effort, it would be a great saw. 



 I have a vintage Briggs & Stratton model 6 engine. I rebuilt this engine several years ago using NOS parts including piston and rings, gaskets, etc and it has never been run. It only needs a new nut for the flywheel/starter pulley. 



Next is a like new Dobbins 12v 15 gallon garden or tree sprayer. I mounted it to a bracket to fit on one of my tractors, and only used it one time, and it worked great. It has only been filled with water. This would be perfect mounted on a ATV.



 I also have a Roovers Industrial Band Embossing Machine, model T-20. I picked this up at an auction a few years back in a lot with some other things I wanted, and I really don't have any use for it. It embosses 7/8"" tape with 3/8"" characters. This is in great shape and works perfectly. It has many applications such as Lettering or numbering bins, parts, machines, storage areas, lockers, etc. These machines sell up wards of $2400 when new, and are still available, as is the tape and parts.



Finally I have a early 80's Toro 826 2 stage Snow blower. This needs a little tlc to be reliable, but it does start, run , and drive. The recoil is broken, but it starts with electric start just fine. I rebuilt the carb on it last year, but it needs some more fine tuning to be reliable. Its not damaged or broken, but just needs some tuning like I stated. It burns no oil, and has great compression.





If you have any firearms you would be interested in trading for any or all of this, drop me an e-mail and we'll take it from there. I have a lot more pictures as well, but they cant be loaded due to file size, so if your interested, just let me know and I'll send you some. Thanks"

Here is a little info on the Enfield #4 for reference:

The Rifle, No. 4 Mk I was first issued in 1939 but not officially adopted until 1941.[30] The No. 4 action was similar to the Mk VI,[31] but lighter, stronger, and most importantly, easier to mass produce.[31] Unlike the SMLE, the No 4 Lee-Enfield barrel protruded from the end of the forestock. The No. 4 rifle was considerably heavier than the No. 1 Mk. III, largely due to its heavier barrel,[31] and a new bayonet was designed to go with the rifle: a spike bayonet,[31] which was essentially a steel rod with a sharp point, and was nicknamed ""pigsticker"" by soldiers. Towards the end of the Second World War, a bladed bayonet was developed, originally intended for use with the Sten gun-but sharing the same mount as the No. 4's spike bayonet-and subsequently the No. 7 and No. 9 blade bayonets were issued for use with the No. 4 rifle as well.

Gun is in pretty good shape, I purchased it around 15 years ago and have owned it since. It has had 1 box of ammo down the tube from me and then sat in the safe. I will provide 1 box of Winchester 303 and another of brass with it for the asking price.

After discounting everything in this list considerably, you pay only $1500 and you need nothing for many months or even years for some shooters.

I'm not willing to part it out, but if you insist, there will not be as good of a discount because I'm already taking way to big of a hit.  This sale is so I can help feed the family during my unemployment so I'm not negotiable on price.  This package is priced to sell.

The left barrel is pretty clean with only a few rust spots, while the right barrel is rusted near the chamber and clean towards the middle and end of the barrel. I have not tried the gun, but both triggers seem functional.

Call for details, I will take the best offer I get.

Used, but in good shape. Llama MiniMax 1911 45ACP with 3 magazines (2 new Meggar, 1 original llama) Clamshell box. Here is some info on the MiniMax:

The Llama Mini-Max was introduced. It was produced in 9mm Parabellum and 38 Super (8-round capacity), .40 S&W (7-round capacity) and .45 ACP (6-round capacity) with a 3.7 inch barrel. The overall length was 7.3 inches and the height 5.1 inches. Designed for concealed carry, it featured an extended safety lever, rounded hammer, Swartz safety, 3-dot sight, checkered neoprene grips and contoured trigger-guard. the use of a flared muzzle eliminated the traditional Llama barrel bushing and made disassemby easier. Standard 1911-type magazines could be used in the .45 ACP model, increasing capacity by one or two rounds.

Star PD Compact 1911 in .45 acp FOR SALE. Imported by Interarms. The gun is in great functioning condition. There is some holster wear, but overall in very nice condition. The action very is smooth. This one has been well maintained and kept very nice. Has a beavertail-style grip, but no grip safety. 

Comes with 3 different grip options. The original-which are in amazing shape and still hold their checkering and color, Olive wood smooth grips in very good condition, and Pachmayr wrap-around rubber grips (on gun now). All springs were recently replaced with Wolff Springs, plus extras are included (Wolff). 
There are at least 4 extra rubber barrel bushings included. These need to be replaced every 500-800 rounds. The one on now has lots of life yet too. They are still easy to get from a couple online stores. 
4 Steel Mags--(2) 6 round, and (2) 7 round.
1 Soft zipper case.
If you didn't know, these were the first compact 1911-style pistol to come on the market. Famous Gun guy Jeff Cooper was fond of this particular pistol, and called it ""A gun to be carried much and fired little"". I think that's why they were so popular back in their heyday.
This is a great collectors piece if anything else, but can make someone a fine carry pistol for sure. I'm selling to make room for something else. Can send more pics too.
Hard to find one in this good of condition.
I bought this a few weeks ago, but decided to get something else.

The .22LR on bottom is a Marlin 60 (microgroove barrel, brass colored trigger) and the 12 gauge pump is a Hiawatha 130VR.  It's simply a Savage Model 30 that was renamed for sale via Sears and Roebuck.  I believe the fixed choke is either full or improved cylinder.  Both guns are fire reliable and the 12 gauge is great for shooting clays.

I picked this up on 5/7 and have never put a round down it. All I did was to clean all of the packing grease Taurus slathers on for shipping from it and lube it with some quality Slipstream lube.  Got it home and realized I overextended myself on the credit card.  It was marked $642.95 and I paid more than that out the door, but you can take it off my hands for $600.  It has really nice walnut grips that are a combination of European stipple and American checkered blended from corner to corner with a Taurus Bull Head logo in the center, very nice looking.  Also comes with the stock black plastic grips if that is more to your liking. 2 blued 8 round mags with bumper pads, blushing wrench, cleaning rod and keys to the Taurus safety system lock included as well. Like I said its brand new. Slide action is very smooth.

This optic was purchased from OpticsPlanet. This is a genuine Trijicon ACOG optic. I paid well over the asking price (search for yourself). I purchased this in early May (can provide receipt for proof), I have never taken it out to the range due to limited range options in my area and no time. Again, the optic has a shelf life of 2 months only! NEW! I rather just sell it now than to have it sit there since I could use the money. I am Paypal & eBay verified (member ID: cam2099). 100% feedback: http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&userid=cam2099&ftab=AllFeedback

I am not looking for any specific setup just something to finish my AR.
I am 20 and do not have a PTP or PTC I am just not old enough to get this part from an FFL, gotta love the strange laws huh.
I have a clean record and would like to use a bill of sale very similar to the application for a permit to purchase (basically stating that I am legally able to own the firearm) or something you would be more comfortable with.
I would like to finish my AR before the 4th of July and the price is negotiable so let me know what you got!

Only 25 rounds fired

Bought this last week, since I was always curious about the 21SF.  

I was specifically looking for the SF-Glock rail version which is harder to find locally--  Tried it out. (Glock rail version is much easier to find holsters for, vs. the Pictinny rail version- which won't fit molded holsters)  I have larger slim hands with long fingers and there is not enough difference for me compared to my regular G21 to justify owning both. Decided to keep my regular G21 since I have it custom tricked out for tactical.

Ambi mag release works fine.

This 21SF has usual Standard sights hicap mags, Glock do-dads and latch box.

Prefer FTF/CHL  in the Cincinnati area.

Also known as the ROMAK III...and also known as the Romanian Dragunov.  These rifles are actually based on the hard hitting and very accurate Romanian RPK machine gun and designed to be a designated marksman rifle.  Call it what you will, it's a hard hitting, dang good looking, and very cheap to shoot rifle that'll get you up to 1.5MOA if you do your part.

It shoots the 7.62x54r round which is easy to find in military surplus cirlces like AIM surplus, ammunition to go, and most of the popular gun/accessories sites online.  20 cents a round for mildly corrosive ammo (which is easy to clean, don't be fooled) and you have power that bests the .308 and rivals the 30-06.  

The POSP type optic has very good glass, an excellent combat reticle, fine adjustments, and it slides on and off the rifle base effortlessly but stays put under fire.

If you're reading this post you already know what this rifle is and you've long wanted one.  This has a total of 50 rounds through it and it's pretty much rid of it's cosmoline.  It comes with one 10 round mag and I have a full size aftermarket case to put it in for you.  The furniture is very attractive on this one and the fit is excellent.  Sometimes the raging monkeys at Century put these together poorly, but lately (and this is evidence of it), they've been doing a good job.
