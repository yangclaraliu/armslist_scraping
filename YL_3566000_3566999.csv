Fluted barrel and bolt with all the weight saving features you will ever find on a gun. Of course it is a tack driver because Weatherby guarantees that with every Mark 5 they sell. Maybe I got lucky but this one shoots Winchester Supreme 130 Grain ballistic tips into tiny little clover leaf groups at 100 yards. Probably shoots other ammo just as well but never saw the reason to buy anything else. Fired maybe 20 times since I have owned it (2005). First 10 shots I shot and cleaned after each round letting the barrel cool completely while adjusting the scope. Fired 3 and cleaned with all 3 inside the little red square on the target. SHot 3 more to fine tune the scope for 2 inches high at 100 and you could cover the group with a quarter. Probably hunted less than 10 times with it over the years which means it sat beside me and a round bale of hay in the pasture waiting for last light. By far the lightest gun I have ever owned and in all honesty it kicks harder than any 270 Winchester I have ever owned too. That's not saying much because the 270 win is pretty mild anyway and the nice recoil pad does the rest. Besides, I have carried a gun many more hours than I have ever fired one and I'll take a little kick at the bench sighting in to save me that much weight. Of course the scope has the lifetime warranty, click adjustments and is the brightest around. My Blue book shows the gun MSRP at 1919$ and 1550$ used but this is a 2011 version and thats without the scope, bases, rings, etc. Weatherby guns don't lose value so hunt with a great gun and make a little profit when your done or leave a gun to the grandchild they will be proud to own. You can get one on Gunbroker.com for 1600-1700$ and put the scope, bases, and rings on for another 350$ or you can buy this one for 1500$ cash. Price is firm for obvious reasons and I can't hold it. First 1500$ gets you the gun of a lifetime with the best scope money can buy and it is all made here in America. Yes! This is a California gun and says so right on the receiver. Best of all, it shoots 270 Winchester that you can buy from anywhere including the local marts, sport shops and anywhere online and you can hunt any animal in North America with this caliber, except those big Brown Grizzlies. Probably could kill one with a 270 but if you need something bigger for bear country I have a NIB Kimber in 300 WSM Classic Select with AA Fancy French Claro Presentation wood for 1200$. Don't regret letting this one get away. I would keep it myself but it is just setting in the safe and hasn't seen the field in a few years. I plan to keep a couple of family heirlooms and the rest will go. Let it breathe and hunt with a Weatherby! Or bow up and be the Main Damn Rod and have the Weatherby and the Kimber. One for the good weather and pretty days and the Weatherby for any weather you want."

I have two firearms that I would like to trade for something new. The Glock 19 is a Gen 3 and comes with plenty of extras! I am including 3 Glock mags, a blackhawk serpa retention holster, a Galco paddle holster, and a side armour iwb holster. Two speed loaders are also included, and two of the three mags have orange baseplates installed. I am including the originals in black if you would like to switch back to those. The 19 is factory with the exception of a Ghost trigger connector. Really makes the trigger nice!
The second firearm is a Savage Mark II .22 LR with a bipod installed. It also includes two mags, the standard 5 round and a ten round mag as well.  It has a rail on top to make it easy to install any optic you may want.  I will include any additional pics you would like, feel free to ask and I will happily send them.

Not really looking to sell them, but I am willing to listen to any offer.  I would like to trade them for a nice AR-15, but like I said am willing to listen to all equitable trade offers including pistols.  Feel free to call or text anytime at REDACTED.
Let me know if you have any questions!"

And you'll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot.
The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact has a 3.8 inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame.

Put in an X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazine, and you have a 19 round full-sized 9mm pistol (16 rounds in .40SW, 13 rounds in .45ACP.) Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact (11 in .40SW, 9 in .45ACP.) Like all XD(M)®’s, the 3.8″ Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel.You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands.
If you want a gun for daily carry as well as a trip to the range, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. You’ll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal. It’s two guns in one.

Both have very little use and have issues. The Leatherwood/Hi Lux is missing one screw cap for windage adjustment. Below are description for both optics. 

Leatherwood / Hi-Lux Optics 1x30mm Red Dot Tactical Sight w/ Integral Mount & Rubber Edge Guards & Flip-up Lens Covers ES1X30TP is ideal for huntingimage and shooting situations when open sights or a rifle scope may not be the best choice. For those special purpose applications, the Leatherwood / Hi-Lux Red-Dot Series 1x30 Electronic Tactical Sights could be the answer to your shooting or hunting success. Handgunners are discovering how much easier it is to simply place the illuminated dot of this Leatherwood red dot sight on their target rather than attempting to align the front sight in the rear sight notch and holding the sight picture as the trigger is squeezed. Turkey hunters appreciate being able to track the approach of an old gobbler without worrying about whether or not the front bead of the shotgun is high or low. And muzzleloading hunters in those states where telescopic sights are not allowed during the special muzzleloader seasons are now turning to non-magnifying red-dot sights for a more positive aiming point.

Leatherwood 1x30mm Red Dot Tactical Sight w/ Integral Mount & Rubber Edge Guards & Flip-up Lens Covers is an extremely compact and lightweight red dot sight. The brightness of the Leather-Wood / Hi-Lux Inc red dot sight can be easily adjusted for easier sighting in either bright or low-light conditions. Leatherwood / Hi-Lux 1x30mm Tactical Red Dot Gun Sight is fully waterproof and shockproof. Leatherwood ES1X30TP 1x30 Tactical Red-Dot Scope comes with The Ribber Rubber Edge Guards.

Truglo Gobble Stopper Red Dot Scope w/Matte Black Finish - Specially designed reticle for turkey hunting. Dual-color reticle illumination (red and green). Illuminated ring represents imagea 24"" circle at 30 yards. Detachable, extended sunshade eliminates glare from the front lens.

The Leatherwood 1x30 Red Dot Sight features an angled colored front objective lens for optimized light refraction. The screws on the Weaver-style mount are intentionally uneven to provide greater holding strength, so the Hi - Lux Optics 1 x 30 mm Red Dot Gun Sight w/ Mount and Flip-up Lens Covers is able to deliver superior shock resistance."

Lead, STeel, Bismuth, Tungsten, whatever. Bought it as my all around shotgun for Waterfowl, Turkey, Dove, etc. Duck hunted twice and gave that up. You couldn't pay me to go Turkey hunting again and I have an old A5 that I can't help but use if and when I ever get to dove hunt again. Cleaning out the safes and I'll keep a couple favorites but this one has to go. Has all the choke tubes for either barrel. Full, Mod, IC, and of course an XF Extended Turkey Choke. Kicks more like a 20 gauge than a 12 and it handles very well. Shot about a half box of shells duck hunting, probably another 10 dove loads at some clay birds to get used to it and I think I shot 3 turkey shells to pattern the gun for that barrel. Never got the Turkey but I got to meet 2 snakes, about 20 ticks and met a coyote face to face because he thought I was a Turkey. Paid 1014$ for the gun plus tax etc. Another 400$ plus for the Turkey barrel and tube. Both barrels have fiber optic sights which cost another 80$ but they are worth every penny, at least to my old eyes they are. First 900$ gets you the one shotgun that will do anything you will ever need it to do. Price is firm for obvious reasons and I can't hold it. But the first 900$ gets you a great gun and saves you 500-700$ in the process. Don't let this one get away. I wish I had the legs, health, and youth to give me a reason to keep it but it just sets in the safe waiting for you to come and get it dirty and let it do what it was made to do."

Shoots 3.5 inch, 3 inch, and 2 3/4 shells with no adjustments and has the recoil of a 20 gauge shooting light loads. Truth is, I got all fired up about turkey hunting because my brother talked me into it. Got this gun, and a turkey barrel for another shotgun. Mastered the calls for a year, watched all the video, had the perfect camo, great places to hunt back home in Oklahoma. Put the birds to bed that night, woke up and went to get 'em. Owl swooped in and stole by foam decoy and trashed it(should have stopped then). No birds to be found so we made a little move near the water. Found a nice tree and set up again. Apparently the tree belonged to a family of rattlesnakes and in the process of high tailing it out managed to pick up about 20 or so ticks. Most of which found the inside of my naval and gave me these beautiful red rings all across my stomach. Managed to get bit by a spider while I changed at the truck and tried to pick all the ticks off. So the gun has no use to me. You couldn't pay me to turkey hunt again. I'll just buy one in November and let the wife cook it up and not worry about what is going to bite me next. I paid way too much for the gun and I'm embarrassed enough that there's no way I'll tell you. It does pattern very well and you can even have the 7 or 8 shells I have left from the 10 round box I bought for the ""great turkey hunt"". There are a couple on Gunbroker.com between 950$ and 1100$ but you can just take this one away for 800$ cash. You get the tubes, the gun, the manual, the leftover shells and you can have all of the turkey hunting to yourself as well. It really is a great gun and when I bought it Outdoor Life had named it the best Turkey gun ever built. Anyway, the price is firm for obvious reasons and I expect it to go soon so I can't hold it. It obviously doubles as a great waterfowl/goose gun but you can shoot dove all day long with 1 ounce loads and then rabbit/squirrel/quail hunt in the afternoon with whatever your game load and then load up some 3 inch OO buck for self defense. I was amazed at the light recoil even with the heavy Turkey load. This is really one gun that can do it all from January through December, and yes, they even make a rifled barrel for the gun as well. This is actually the same gun as a Browning Gold Stalker 3.5 inch. I have one of each and yes, the parts are identical. In fact, the barrel has the exact same imprint that it is made in Belgium as the Browning Autoloader I have. Come get your gun and you can have the woods all to yourself this spring. I'm through getting up at 0400 to hunt ducks and geese as well so even more room for you to enjoy the great outdoors this fall. I'll stick to things with horns that I can shoot from my pop up blind in my old age and let you young bucks fight the snakes, ticks and spiders. My 2011 Blue Book of Gun Values has it listed at 1236$ it will go to the first 800$ cash and I guarantee you that this gun will serve you well."

Don't really care which I sell, and don't need to dump them, so don't expect me to jump at a low-ball but will listen to reasonable offers or partial trades/upgrade deals.

They are both Chinese SKS's with milled receivers & trigger groups, heavy threaded barrel lugs. 

First one is a 1958 vintage, all numbers matching with original stock, cleaning rod, green canvas & leather shoulder strap, and blade bayonet. Bluing is very good.  $440.00

Second is a 1966 vintage, all numbers matching in a Combat Exchange synthetic stock, cleaning rod, and spike bayonet.  Bluing is very good.  $440.00


These are great guns to own under our dire SAFE act circumstances, as when configured with the factory 10-round box magazine it is NOT considered an assault weapon (yet) even with the ""evil"" factory bayonet. It loads easily from the top with stripper clips, and 7.62x39 ammo is still readily available and cheap to shoot.

I'll include 10-pack of new stripper clips (more available) with either rifle, and do have some 7.62x39 FMJ ammo available reasonably for a little more if wanted.

We can meet at Dicks or gun store/FFL of your choice for the NICS check.

This has been one of my carry guns, but I am making some room in the safe. 

This is the only Taurus I have ever bought. A buddy of mine has the exact same gun and after shooting his I told him that I liked ergonomics and the trigger was fantastic for a sub-$400 pistol. Well, a few months later I impulse bought this one from a local gun store. The trigger on this is so impressive and the price is fantastic for what you are getting.

This does have some holster wear, since I actually carry and shoot my guns. It is not beat up however, it has been meticulously cleaned and stored properly. You are getting the gun, original case, manual, wire brush, keys for the sights and 2 12rd. magazines.

I don't have to sell so low-balls will be ignored. You need a VA drivers license and a 2nd form of ID, but a conceal carry permit would be ideal. You will also sign a Bill of Sale. EMAIL OR TEXT 757-two8four-8four6six. I don't answer the phone for numbers I don't know.

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity.  The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven.  If interested, respond with your name and telephone #."

The barrel is a low profile lightweight 16.1” barrel threaded 5/8-24TPI with a 5R 1:7"" twist. The rifle accurately sends rounds down range whether feeding it heavy subsonic or high performance hunting ammunition. The phosphate steel action and barrel are complimented by the compact, lightweight super tough glass polymer filled black stock. All models are equipped with the H&R transfer bar system that makes the Handi-Rifle one the safest single shot platforms available today."

I have realistically fired between 900 - 1000 rounds through this rifle since I built it brand new, my asking price is 1,100$ OBO, it is a lot of rifle for the asking price and has been meticulously cleaned right after each session at the range and maintained with the same level of care. I have taken great care of this rifle and it will take great care of the next owner. Please, feel free to contact me regarding any questions you may have."

More than 100 years ago, the Colt 1911 was chosen as the official sidearm for America’s Armed Forces. Today, a Colt 1911 is once again proudly serving at the side of our country’s military. After a rigorous selection process, the United States Marine Corps selected the Colt Rail Gun as their Close Quarters Battle Pistol (CQBP). This marks the first time since the end of World War II that a Colt 1911 is being shipped to the United States Government.

To honor the brave men and women of this important staple of America’s military might, the Colt CQBP will be made available in limited quantities through the Colt Custom Shop. What makes the CQBP stand out is its Desert Tan Cerakoted Stainless Steel Receiver and Slide, Novak® 3 Dot Night Sights and Flat, Serrated Mainspring Housing with Lanyard Loop. The pistol also features an Enhanced Hammer, Colt Tactical Ambidextrous Safety Lock, and a 5” National Match® Barrel.

The Colt Custom Shop performs hand fitting of critical mating parts and each firearm is test fired by the Custom Shop and supplied with the actual test target.

The clearest, brightest image possible
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD). 
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

Built to offer the same battle-proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, the Micro T-1 performs reliably under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. Suitable for use on
Rifles
Carbines
Shotguns
Submachine guns
Handguns

The Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a standalone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics.

Excellent night vision compatibility

The Micro T-1 can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility. The performance of the Micro T-1 is optimized for use with all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology.

The clearest, brightest image possible
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD). 
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's.

It has a black slide on a black frame. Capacity is 18+1 rounds of 9mm. It’s a great home defense, carry, truck/car pistol. It’s had less than 100 rounds through it. I like the pistol, but I’m thinning my collection a bit, and since this one isn’t getting used often, it’s heading out the door. It shoots very well, no failures using cheap FMJ and using nice HP ammo. Sights are easy to see and the gun is accurate. Recoil is soft and the grip fits very nicely in the hand. The TP9 is a Turkish import clone of the Walther P99. There are plenty of review videos on this pistol on YouTube if you want to know more about it. This is a quality gun at a budget price.

•	Canik TP9 9mm Pistol
•	(2) 18-round Magazines
