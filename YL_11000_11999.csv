I would prefer either a yugo m70, polish ak variants, egyptian, chinese, russian variants (including vepr and saiga types), and bulgarians.

CALIBER 7.62X38R
The Nagant M1895 Revolver was a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for Tsarist Russia. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a (theoretical) boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile. Other Nagant revolver designs were also adopted by police and military services of Sweden (7.5 mm M1887), Norway (M1893), Poland, and Greece (??????????? M1895).

CALIBER 7.62X38R
The Nagant M1895 Revolver was a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for Tsarist Russia. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile.

The upper is a Colt heavy barrel with the A2 style carry handle. It has a 20"" barrel and rifle length hand guards. The barrel twist is 1/7 so it can reliably shoot 5.56 or .223. It is slightly used, it has seen maybe 90 rounds of ammo. It also has a z-rail attached to the carry handle. 

The lower, lower parts kit, and stock are all new. The lower is made by CMMG. It has a DPMS lower parts kit, Ergo Grip pistol grip, and a Calvary Arms 6 position adjustable stock. There is a tiny bit of wear on the hammer from hand cycling, but it has never actually fired a round. There is space in the back of the stock for 4 CR123 batteries for a mountable flashlight, and space for 2 more of said batteries in the pistol grip.

It will come with five 30 round magazines (3 of them are normal steel magazines, the other 2 are windowed P-Mags), approximately 400 rounds of Brown Bear 55 gr. FMJ (cheap but good for plinking), and approximately 75 rounds of good brass ammo. Ammo can in picture not included.

Asking price is $900 for everything, but I can sell the rifle and ammo separately for $800 and $100 respectively. Will trade for good condition .357 snub nose+cash, or maybe a Taurus Raging Bull chambered in .44mag or .454 casull+cash.

Russian Mosin Nagant 91/30 bolt-action rifle that shoots the powerful 7.62 x 54 round. This gun was checked out by a gunsmith and given a clean bill of health (he also cleaned the cosmo out of it). Included are the following items:

Sling
Bayonet
Recoil Pad (original metal plate included - not shown in pic)
Ammo pouch
2 oil bottles
Tool Kit
Extra pouch (for tool kit? - it was in the other pouch when I bought it)
11 stripper clips
Approx. 500 rounds of 7.62x54 ammo (I'll have to get an exact count)
(I also have a copy of the assembly/disassembly instructions I printed off the internet - not shown in pic)

I'm just not a bolt-action type of guy. This is a cheap, accurate, powerful rifle that will literally shoot  a mile - with the emphasis on ""cheap"". Recoil is not bad at all with the pad on it. The wood is about the best I've ever seen on a Nagant with only a few minor dings. No rust anywhere. Asking $275 for everything, FTF within 1 hr. of Harrisburg. No taxes, no state paperwork, just a Bill of Sale.

I would like $600 for the upper only (with bolt and everything of course).

I purchased this in Spring, 2008 from a local gun store in Newbury, OH (the Eastern Great Lakes Outdoor Supply) that had a few extra rifles they had ordered for a local law enforcement agency. I have since put roughly 500 rounds through the rifle. All parts are in perfect mechanical condition. More pictures can be taken for serious buyers.

I may consider selling the entire rifle but I would prefer only to trade for another complete rifle.

Trades Considered - Running truck/SUV, SKS's, AK's, other interesting 7.62x39 long guns, 16"" mid-length, 16"" dissipator, or 20"" rifle-length uppers (or complete rifles for my complete rifle)."

This rifle was built after the switch to the military 7.62-standard bore (.311?) in the early '90's. I really like this rifle - the look, performance, caliber, and especially the ergonomics. I am just trying to liquidate some toys at the moment.

I bought this used just a few months ago (from Great Lakes Outdoor Supply) and it seemed to be in unfired condition. I since put about 50 rounds through it in one range trip where I got some impressive groups. Included is the rifle and the one original 5 round magazine. Maybe a good 30 round USA magazine as well if I can find it here. I am asking $600 firm.

The Nagant M1895 Revolver was a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for Tsarist Russia. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile.

785,http://www.armslist.com/posts/11785,"DPMS LR-308C .308 20"" With 5 mags, scope, mount, and more","Stillwater, Oklahoma, United States","$ 1,100","Listed On: Monday, September 28, 2009",Firearms,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a DPMS LR-308C ""Classic"" with the standard 20"" barrel.  It is in near PERFECT condition with only a couple hundred rounds through it -- and yes, I followed the recommended break-in procedure (one less thing for you to have to do).  This rifle has always been meticulously cleaned.  It comes with FIVE (5) magazines (all high-cap), two of which are brand new and still in the package, a 3-9x40 scope, a quick-detach one-piece scope mount that removes quickly with no tools for instant use of your backup sights, a vortex flash hider (looks and works great), and an M1 marksman's sling (which can be used to support the rifle in both the loop and hasty sling configurations). 

This is a sub-MOA rifle.  I can shoot 1 MOA from unsupported field positions with this thing!  I can vouch for it being a 1000 yard rifle... it has no trouble dinging the 1000 yard silhouette at Badlands Tactical from prone unsupported.  800 yard shots are child's play with this thing if you know what you're doing.  All this with plain NATO surplus ammo mind you (I mostly shoot British Radway Green 147gr out of it).  It has always been stone cold reliable for me... no op-rod to break like M1As love to do so frequently, and whatever optics you desire are extremely easy to mount with the standard-height flat-top receiver, which is a little longer than those on the poodle shooter caliber ARs.  

This is NOT the super-heavy bull barreled version.  This is NOT a bench queen.  This is NOT the stubby 16"" version either (you know, the one that throws a 3-foot muzzle flash from wasting half the powder burned out the muzzle, making the bullet's energy fade away after 600 yards or so and instantly blinding you while giving your position away to anyone within 3 miles)... this is a first-rate Main Battle Rifle.  It compares VERY favorably in accuracy, ergonomics, and price with the M14/M1A, the FAL, the G-3 types, and pretty much any other battle rifle you could think of.  Its a real rifleman's rifle, believe me.  

I think I'm being pretty damn reasonable with the price considering all the stuff that comes with it, especially considering what it would cost YOU to buy one of these plus all the mags and other included stuff, but if you don't like the price, then you can call or e-mail me and try to convince me why it isn't worth that much ;-) .  This thing is in pristine shape.  I'm a marksmanship instructor, so I know how to take care of a rifle.  You will love this thing, I promise... it just feels so right!  ;-)  I kind of hesitate to sell it, actually... I'll buy it back from you if you don't like it.  Hit me up before I change my mind.  I split my time between Stillwater, Norman, and OKC.  I can meet you anywhere reasonably close to any of those towns if you want to look at it.

XD40 pistol
XD gear (holster, magazine loader, two-magazine pouch)
original box (manual, lock, test fired cartridge, test fire date is 10-2008)
2 magazines

Other comments: This pistol has had between 500-600 rounds fired through it. No malfunctions or failures. It has been cleaned and lubricated as recommended after each range trip, hopefully it shows (see photos and feel welcome to inspect it thoroughly). The finish is excellent as it has never been holstered and carried; after range trips it is cleaned, wiped down with a silicone cloth, and stored in a dry safe. At least around here, it is still relatively straightforward to find 40 caliber ammunition (not so for 9mm), so that's another plus.

I'd like to keep it, but I have a baby on the way in Oct, and am selling one of my XD40s.

The rifle was bought in June 2008, it has about 400 - 500 rounds fired. The only flaw in the rifle is the retaining pin for the storage compartment in the butt stock is missing. If the door is open the latch comes out.  As long as it remains closed it doesn't cause a problem. It was this way when I purchased the rifle and I just never got around to calling Springfield Armory or taking it to a gunsmith to look into it."

Film stars Dexter Fletcher, Dickon Tolson and the late David Carradine (is the only zombie movie he was ever in). Shares were sold during funding phase of the movie at $20 CAD per share (film is made in Canada) and gave fans a chance to help fund the movie; shares will pay dividends on earnings. Here's the trailer for the movie, which is soon to be released (Nov. I believe).
