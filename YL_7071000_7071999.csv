If you don't have a lot of money and you want a car that will run with just a little bit of work, this is a great deal for you! Might also be a good parts car for somebody who doesn't want to deal with the brakes. There's some good, some bad, some ugly...The good- Drives good once brakes are addressed- Clean title- Engine runs fine- Transmission has shown no signs of any issues- Air condition works great- Class 2 tow package installedThe bad- Brakes are shot. I will include a set of (front and rear) Hawk high quality pads with sale at asking price - value of $95. This should generally be a $100 - $200 job if you can't do it yourself, depending on whether you have the rotors resurfaced as well or not.  There's a brake fluid leak at the passenger side front caliper, that's probably the main issue beyond needing new pads.  - Fuel gauge does not function, it will show either 0% or 100% but never in between, and it's random. I've never had a problem with this, just fuel up regularly so you don't run out of gas. The ugly- Body damage on driver's side- Body rust on a few body panels- Interior has obviously seen use by a family for a few years. - Drivers door handle is broken off and will need to be fixed. No scam replies please - I will not accept a western union or a foreign check or any other crazy stuff like that. Cash is preferred and I will negotiate a bit more if you're paying cash. I can also take a check if you're paying full asking price, but check must clear before you take possession of the vehicle and title. Sold as-is, no warranty/refunds/etc."

Chambered in 7x57mm MauserReceiver marked ""Fabrika de Armas Oviedo 1914"" I believe 1914 is the manufacture date.Looks like an older sporterization, many of these were sporterized in the 1950's by large dealers/distributors for resale, I think this is one of those. Barrel has been shortened to about 22.5 inches, stock cut down, bolt handle bent, and a black enamel type finish applied to most of the blued parts.Mechanically fine, feeds and cycles rounds alright, but I have never fired it.Stock has a pretty decent crack behind the receiver tang as pictured. There's also a chip off the top of the stock next to the bolt handle (also pictured) Would make a nice project, basically needs refinished and a stock repair (or new stock)Bore is dark, would probably benefit from a good cleaningI have another sporterized stock available that is a little longer than this one (still not full length), but not cracked and in decent shape that I'll include for another $40. Would probably require some minor fitting. let me know if you want pics of it.Possibly willing to sell individual parts off the gun for the right price...Prefer to meet at Field & Stream Easton or somewhere near thereAsking $150 cash, or open to trade offers"

The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.
The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

I am the 2nd owner of this fine firearm, I was acquainted to the first owner and I can firmly confirm and attest that this gun has been fired approx. 100 times (and that was with 44 Special Cowboy ammo) since it's purchase(as new) in 2016. Comes with Smith and Wesson factory blue case in as new condition with the manual, the lock, warranty card and frame lock keys. This big bore wheel gun has a bead blasted stainless steel finish that is nearly flawless with only a slight turn line. Features a 4 inch Barrel (4.2 inch) and has the OEM Grips/Stocks. It's a good ""do everything"" gun (Camping, Hunting, Target Shooting, Self Defense etc). I'm Located in Newland ( Avery County ) but I travel the general area (Boone, Banner Elk, Spruce Pine, Morganton etc) for business and I am willing to meet in a mutually convenient location. NC residents need Purchase or Carry Permit and for those out of state,  I would be more than happy to ship to your FFL for the price in addition to the actual Shipping costs. Since I am far from new to this Armslist game - I'll answer the usual suspect questions right now to avoid wasting anybody's time (Especially my own):Q: Is it available?A: Yes, if it is listed - it is available (unless it just sold the same hour that you inquired) Q: Are you firm on your asking price?A: Usually Yes, I set my price reasonably, you can always make an offer, the worst thing that can happen is that I respectfully decline it.Q: Why are you selling it?A: Just because ( Does this really matter all that much? I get this question seemingly all of the time and really (For me) it usually comes down to the pure ""business"" of it but other reasons for anyone could be - the simple need or want for money, I'm selling to finance another purchase or quite frankly there is too much month at the end of the money)Q: Accept my Certified / Cashiers Check or cheque?A: No ( if you are paying from another area and the item requires shipping the only accepted method of payment is a USPS Money order) and if you send me an email that looks like it was typed by Tonto or Tarzan on ""bad grammar day"" offering ""Cheques"" and referring to me as ""Dear"" most likely your email will be ignored and you can take your scamming ass elsewhere.It really is a good wheelgun, I hope it finds a good home! At only $625 for a near new American made big bore revolver this would be a sweet deal for anyone. Shoot me a message, your phone number gets mine in return, I'd be glad to speak with you.

STI continues its push for honest, game changing innovation with the introduction of the Costa Carry Comp. Its island comp BBL is machined from a single piece of stainless steel, which eliminates timing issues and the potential to come loose. The front sight is attached to the compensated BBL—making this the first ever barrel with a compensator in front of an island sight. The technology further reduces muzzle jump and enables you to keep eyes on the front sight rather than the blast of the comp. The comp reduces recoil by 63%. The STI RecoilMaster dual spring recoil system further reduces recoil, effectively making this the flattest, smoothest shooting pistol on the market PERFORMANCE FEATURES The Costa Carry Comp is DLC coated from top to bottom and features our TreeBark Stippled Grip. This model comes with 2 magazines, 126mm and 140mm, ambidextrous safety, full length tactical rail and STI’s lifetime warranty. The BBL is 4.15” and the comp takes the overall length to 5.1, the same length as a standard 1911. Our RecoilMaster dual spring recoil system is added to further reduce recoil.

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.            SPECIFICATIONS   CZ P-01 – 9mm CZ P-01 – 9mm (low capacity)       Product NameCZ P-01 – 9mm SKU91199 Firearm TypeHandgun MSRP$627.00 Chambering9mm Luger Magazine Capacity14 Magazine TypeDouble Stack FrameAluminum (7075 T6) GripsRubber Trigger MechDA/SA SightsFixed BarrelCold Hammer Forged Barrel Length3.75 in Weight28.1 oz Overall Length7.2 in Height5.03 in Width1.38 in SafetyDecocking Lever, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety"

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.
