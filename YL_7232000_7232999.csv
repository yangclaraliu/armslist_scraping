The buttstock is precision formed for mil-spec receiver extensions to have very little forward or lateral play that is so common in many other buttstocks. This eliminates the need for a tensioning device or friction lock. All of this results in a durable buttstock that will give the shooter a comfortable and repeatable cheek weld and unprecedented control of the firearm. The buttstock can be run with one of two included buttpads or without any buttpad at all to custom fit the rifle to whatever gear the operator must wear. The buttpads come in two sizes: a thicker convex shape (0.8″), and a thinner concave shape (0.5″); designed to keep from snagging when shouldering the rifle. Limited rotation QD swivel attachment points are integrated on both sides of the buttstock for ambidextrous sling connection. Specifications: – Color: Mil Spec+– 7″ Long– 5.5″ Tall– 1.75″ Thick– Weight: 0.50 lb.– For Mil-Spec receiver extension tubes"

When I got the notification I ordered as soon as I could, only problem is I thought it was the Bulgarian and I no longer have a Russian made AK. So, I am hoping to sell this and continue searching for a Bulgarian model, or if someone has a Bulgarian model and wants to do a swap, that is acceptable as well.I am willing to sell this for $175 (this includes shipping).I also have a spare Zenitco RP-1 charging handle. This attaches over the existing charging handle and makes it much more ergonomic. Selling for $50 (includes shipping).If someone would like both items the total would be $215.  If meeting FTF, cost will be $10 less per item.Will only accept money orders if the items are being shipped.

This pistol for sale was manufactured 8/19/1998 and is called a Pre-rail version since in 2000 S&W added a rail to the frame for accessories which most S&W enthsuiasts don't care for. The Pre-rail versions are highly sought after and now hard to find in really good condition like this pistol. The grips are like new, the recoil spring is new, and there are only a couple of signs of minor holster wear on the frame.   The TSW (Tactical Support Weapon) features thicker full length frame rails for enhanced accuracy and delayed unlocking to reduce felt recoil. That and a dual recoil spring set-up make this a highly controllable soft shooter for accurate follow up shots and comfortable fun at the range. Considered a compact with it's 3.5"" barrel,  I found it's accuracy every bit as good as my full size pistols at all target distances with the Novak Lo-Mount 3 dot sights.  The .40 S&W cartridge was developed by Winchester and Smith & Wesson in an effort to to create a round with knock down power similar to the FBI 10mm round (also .40 cal.) but with a shorter case which would facilitate accuracy and allow use of a smaller, more comfortable grip frame. As a result the .40 S&W became the cartridge of choice for law enforcement agencies.Frame construction is lightweight aluminum alloy with a stainless steel slide for a total weight of only 25.7 ozs. empty so this pistol is perfect if you want a handsome carry gun on steroids.The action is called Traditional Double Action (TDA) which describes a longer 1st shot trigger pull which cocks the hammer, and single action short, crisp, and light trigger pull on subsequent shots. An ambidextrous safety / decocker is featured for convenience and ultimate safety.This pistol comes with 2 S&W factory 9 round magazines in equally nice condition in a Smith & Wesson plastic case including the original instruction manual, gun lock, orange empty chamber flag, wax wrap and paperwork it came with new. Additional S&W factory 9 round magazines are available at my $40 cost. Another plus, S&W 11 round Hi-capacity magazines with flush fit adapter are also available for this model for added firepower.Please email  or call / text Bill 813 . 857 . 8287 for more info or pictures. I'm willing to meet anywhere in the bay area to show this fine pistol."
