The Can Cannon is currently configured for launching full, un-opened 12oz soda cans. When used with standard mil spec blanks and fired at an optimum angle it can reach an average distance of 105 yards! Why launch soda cans instead of drinking them? Because you can! Projectile options are only limited by your creativity and hopefully your common sense ;)  BATFE approved design is not considered a Destructive Device or firearm.  The system is compatible with any AR-15 mil standard bolt and most piston bolts. Manufacture has a no-hassle lifetime warranty.  Also launches tennis balls perfectly!  Search ""Can Cannon"" on youtube to see videos featuring the Can Cannon in action. Price is $225 cash, lots of fun priced to sell!  E-mail with any questions or to arrange a time to meet.

I assume PSA test fires their uppers before sale.***Note*** The 10 1/2 inch is a pistol and the lower has never been assembled into anything other than this pistol build. It has a pistol buffer tube that a rifle stock will not fit on. Changing it to a short barreled rifle would be simple but require going through the NFA process unless you like Federal pound me in the ass prison.The pistol has a brand new Vortex Sparc AR red dot sight on it and will come with the box/extra parts (they have a lifetime warranty)- also has a Magpul mbus flip up rear sight. Carry handle sight on the rifle is PSA. Neither firearm has been sighted in as I haven't shot them. Come with (5) Magpul M2 30 round magazines with window brand new in packaging. Also comes with one used Magpul 40 round magazine.There is a small blemish/scratch on the rifle lower near the serial number that you can see in the pictures.

It would make an excellent self/home defense, range, or open carry handgun. Two magazines are included in the purchase (one factory and one Chip McCormick). Also included is 80 rounds of .45 ACP ball ammuniton.

This rifle has only had 10 rounds fired through it. However, I had a friend do a Krylon camo paint job on it, but it was not what I hoped for and therefore removed it. During the removal of the Krylon paint I scratched the finish on the chasis, but it is not terrible and does not affect functionality. I tried to capture it in the photos. The rifle may still have minor krylon residue. Rifle will come as pictured with scope and bipod. A Great package deal for the price. The rifle has a 26-inch barrel, matte blue finish, Magpul PRS-G stock, rubber recoil pad, fixed muzzle brake, rail system, Accu-Trigger, AccuStock, detachable box magazine, sling swivel studs, an overall length of 47.5 inches, an unloaded weight of 14.5 lbs, and a 5+1 round capacity.

Cavalry troopers were armed with the new revolvers. Lawmen and outlaws alike were quick to adopt the handy new 6-shooter which earned the nickname “Peacemaker.”The single-action Army was most widely produced with a color case-hardened frame and blued barrel. Meanwhile, a nickel-plated version was issued to Indian scouts. And a bright charcoal blue finish was available from the factory. But with years of use, the old 6-guns took on a well-handled soft gray patina."

Very reliable, very fuctional. Now the downside, the pistol is not in great cosmetic shape, it has had minor rusting on the left side (that has been cleaned up) that has damaged the finish.

Just pull back on the flipper and the blade moves out of the handle, ready for use.The high-carbon blade steel offers good edge retention and excellent corrosion resistance. The bead-blasted finish is easy to maintain. For safety, the Chive has two locking systems. The frame lock secures the blade open so it can’t accidentally close during use. And to ensure that it won’t accidentally open during transport, the Chive is also equipped with a Tip-Lock slider to lock the blade closed when folded. In pure stainless steel, both blade and handle are easy to clean and maintain."

This is a ww2 dated rifle with the receiver being of February 1943 production. The barrel is a post war HRA made in june of 1955. The barrel has a 2 rating for the throat and the muzzle. The bore has strong clean crisp rifling with a uniform crown. The stock set matches well, but has typical light dings and service wear. The stock is sound with a good lock up. Though this is a CMP rifle (I have the papers), the stock is marked that it once belonged to a VFW, most likely a turn in and rebuild rifle. Rifle comes with CMP case, USGI web sling and 15 en block clips. Rifle is a good USGI collector piece and a all around solid good shooting rifle. This is a 30-06 and needs to be fed with the correct Ball ammo.I have many, many more detailed pictures upon request. I am willing to meet up with serious buyers at my local range to to test it out."
