The multi-configurable M1 variant of the AUG A3 platform is the latest generation of the venerated bullpup platform. Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is available in a Short-Rail version, a High-Rail version as well as an Integrated-Optic version with either a 1.5X or 3X scope. The AUG A3 M1 Optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate accessories like a close-quarters holographic sight. With 16 numbered slots, the High-Rail version was designed to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-slot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver. The AUG A3 M1 boasts am overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG’s matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions. The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger. The receiver was also updated to replace the permanently affixed front sling swivel with a VLTOR Quick-Disconnect Sling Swivel, which makes two-point sling attachment or removal extremely fast and easy, and users of single-point slings can remove the front sling swivel entirely, if they so desire. The AUG A3 M1 stock, cocking piece and forward grip are made of highly durable synthetic and are available in Black, Green, Mud and White colors. The rifle is available in either the standard version that accepts genuine Steyr AUG magazines or as a NATO version that accepts standard STANAG (AR) magazines. - See more at: https://steyrarms.com/firearms/sporting-rifles/steyr-aug-a3-m1.html#sthash.uua5Ws5g.dpuf"

Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precisionrequired to engage the course designer’s most difficult stages. The V11 Pro Series carries the new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnified optics. A newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle length gas system, equals shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue."

Springfield Model 1861 Rifle-Musket Type Rifle musket Place of origin United States Service history In service 1861-72
Used by United StatesConfederate States of America
American Civil War and American Indian Wars Production history Designed 1861. Produced 1861-72 Number built 1,000,000.
The Springfield Model 1861 was a Minie-type rifled musket shoulder-arm used by the United States Army and Marine Corps during the American Civil War. Commonly referred to as the ""Springfield"" (after its original place of production, Springfield, Massachusetts), it was the most widely used U.S. Army weapon during the Civil War, favored for its range, accuracy, and reliability.
Surprisingly accurate once you find the right bullet/powder combination. If you have ever seen the old vintage photos of what a 500 grain, soft lead Minie-ball did to a soldier back in the day, you know they were horrific in nature."

That doesn't compute!  Something smells fishy.       I would say to everyone: Be careful!!! Something is ""Up"". side note: Don't ever accept a check or bank check for ANYTHING, and if you hear the words ""Pickup agent,"" just end the conversation there.  Your bank WILL allow you to deposite a check and show the funds on your ballance. 10 days to 2 weeks later, when they figgure out the check was bogus, they take the funds back from your account.  By that time, the scammers made off with whatever you are selling.  Some people are even dumb enough to take cash out to ""Pay the pickup agent.""  Supposedly, the person buying your stuff will send you a check for the item+ shipping then you give them cash.  Also, if you give them YOUR paypal email, they figgured out a way to send you fake Paypal receipts."

However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies aross the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.The CX4 just begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization. Please visit our accessories page for a full list of CX4 accessories."

This is a great rifle for Marylanders like me since we cannot own full sized AK47s.  I know many locals were looking at this rifle but could not justify spending nearly $1500 from an online store or even more from M+M.  If you wanted to get one of these but were not willing to spend the better part of $2000, this is your chance to get one for a very fair price.  Included will be the orginal box and the owners manual. I would higher perfer to meet up to do this deal.   This is a very nice rifle, with a great finish, smooth action and easy takedown.  It also comes well equipted with a flash hider, Hogue rubberized grip, pop up aluminium sights and a magpul CTR stock.  However, it does not meet any of my current needs and I think this rifle would serve someone else much better!

Initial efforts to lighten the gun by altering the No. 4’s stock and barrel proved to be less than satisfactory, so some experimental rifles were fabricated from scratch. It was found that by trimming a 25.2"" barrel to 20½"", muzzle flash was greatly increased. This was duly addressed and corrected by the addition of a cone-shaped flash hider.The stock itself was shortened and the handguard reduced so that some 11"" of the barrel was now exposed. Metal was pared down wherever possible, resulting in a rifle that was almost 5"" shorter and 2 lbs. lighter than its 9-lb. predecessor.
This rifle is in over all good condition with all the nicks and scratches you would see from a rifle like this yet still remains in better condition than many other similar rifles. it is possible this rifle saw service in Kenya or Malaya. There are large white arsenal markings on the left side of the stock. Mechanically sound and ready for the shooter or collector."

It features new revolutionary suppressor technology based off Surefire SOCOM556-RC, the most advanced suppressor ever made, which was recently selected by US Special Operations Command as first among all competitors in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor evaluation in history. Just over 6 inches in overall length, the SOCOM762-Mini2, is 2.2 inches shorter and 2.5 ounces lighter than the SOCOM762-RC2. Constructed of advanced high-temperature alloys and a stainless steel, it includes advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. The patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvement in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a true technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree. A new indexing system means this suppressor securely mounts to a Surefire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than their previous models and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area. Like all Surefire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM762-Mini2 produces minimal, consistent shift in point of impact compared with an unsuppressed weapon.Features  Same revolutionary suppressor technology as Surefire's SOCOM556-RC, winner of US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) extensive and rigorous suppressor trails 6.2"" overall length for minimum overall weapon length and minimum impact on handling characteristics (2.2 inches shorter and 2.5 ounces lighter than SOCOM762-RC) Optimized for 7.62x39 and 7.62x35 rifles, will also significantly reduce signature on 7.62x51 Nato rifles with barrel lengths of 16"" or longer Advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, cyclic rate, and gas blowback Integrated blast shield increases durability Patent-pending front-plate design and proprietary gas-flow improvements virtually eliminate first-round flash Effective attenuation of noise and dust signatures Patented Fast-Attach design attaches and removes in seconds Minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with unsuppressed weapon  Long service life Mad in the USA  Caliber  7.62mm (.308 Caliber)  Length   6.2""  Weight  17.0 oz  Diameter  1.5""  Thread Size / Color  No  Model Number  SOCOM762-MINI2-BK  UPC Code  REDACTED26"

The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides. 
 
The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul®  flip-up sights included.
 
The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle."

Taurus began building credible, quality descendants of the Beretta 92 series in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the Brazilian Company deftly combined tradition with innovation beginning with its early models. The 92 and 99 series pistols filled a pricing niche beneath the pricey Berettas with no sacrifice of quality. After Beretta introduced its 92SB Compact, Taurus followed suit with their 92 C, which led to the series that includes the photo specimen in the late 1990s, when Taurus took its Beretta Compact type frame and installed a shorter, sturdier slide with looks akin to the German Sig Pistols. The 915 was a transitional model leading to the currently marketed PT 911 that is equipped with Taurus’s internal lock. This pistol, then, is a Pre-Lock Taurus. Type is traditional double and single action semi-automatic; construction is steel barrel, slide and parts mounted on a polished alloy frame; barrel length is service size 4 inches; grip frame is traditional and serrated fore and aft, yet thinned on the order of the Beretta Vertec pistols.Magazine capacity is 15 rounds, 15+1 total capacity, and any Taurus 92/99 magazine will fit into this pistol.Ambidextrous Frame Mounted Safety levers also serve as decockers, to safely return the hammer to its resting, double-action-ready position. The pistol, like all Tauruses with frame mounted safeties, is also capable of cocked-and-locked, single-action-first-shot carry.This particular specimen has served and protected the citizens of Israel with the Mishteret Y’Israel, the Israeli Civilian Police, in Beer-sheva. One of the specimens from this small detachment’s lot of fewer than a dozen pistols was marked by the RETA Supply Company in Beer Sheva. One photo shows Israeli Police decals that came on a couple of the magazine floorplates from this batch of pistols. These were only briefly manufactured in the interim from their introduction in 1999 until the internal lock was added in 2002 and the model number changed to PT 911. It is excellent mechanically; bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean"

Do an Armslist search for ""S&W 10-8"" cuntry wide and see what these are typically selling for! It has a 4"" barrel. While it does show the usual wear from holstering, it's rifling is unusualy good. Looks like it was carried often, but shot little. I personally put a box of 50 through it. Shoots very accurate and the cylinder locks up tight with no slop at all. This is a VERY reliable weapon that police all around the country depended on for years. If they put their trust in this gun, so can you. I would say that this weapon is great for either target practice (hone that trigger technique), home defense or a ""truck gun"". The grips are the ""Square Butt"" style and are in great shape. Extras: $50 leather IWB holster as shown in the pic, rigid plastic & ""egg crate"" foam lined case (case is not factory) and 100 rounds of .38 Spcl to get you started!I will either sell it or trade it. (Extras mean you are basically only paying $250 for the gun!) $325 OBO cash, or trade for a 9mm or .45. Face to face transaction, no shipping.

Backup “ghost-ring” iron sights integrated to the top rail can be deployed within seconds should the optics fail. The rifle can also be fitted with a standard scope, should the need arise. In keeping with Cooper’s requirement for a magazine cutoff, Steyr incorporated a two-position magazine system that allowed the rifle to be fed individually with the five-round magazine in a lowered position. The magazine could be seated one step further with minimal pressure, allowing the bolt to feed cartridges directly from the magazine. A second five-round backup magazine is contained in the buttstock in case of an urgent need to reload. With a fluted, cold-hammer-forged barrel measuring 19 inches, an overall length of 38.6 inches and an out-of-the-box weight of just 6.6 pounds, the Scout is a breeze to pack out on long adventures, patrolling the farm or taking a quick trip to the range. The compact design of the stock features an innovative integrated bipod that is hardly noticeable until it is folded out from the stock. Between the bipod legs is a UIT rail for attachments, and the stock is outfitted with five press-and-twist sling-swivel attachment points that allow the addition of Cooper’s favored Ching Sling on either side of the rifle. The Steyr Scout is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety’s release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position. The Steyr Scout is available in a choice of Black, Grey, Mud and Green, and it is available chambered in .223 Remington, .243 Winchester, 7mm-08 Remington and .308 Winchester calibers. Two 5-round magazines are included, and a high-capacity conversion kit and hi-capacity magazines are available to increase the load-out to 10 rounds. The unique features make the Scout a self-contained platform that can easily be carried in a rifle scabbard without any need for attaching/detaching a bipod or finding extra pockets for a spare magazine, perfect for use on horseback, ATV or on a vehicle rifle rack. - See more at: https://steyrarms.com/firearms/hunting-rifles/steyr-scout.html#sthash.n89mYUMO.dpuf"
