It is a kimber stainless 2 model in 45 ACP with a five inch barrel. The gun has only been to the range a handful of times and has maybe 200 rounds fired. All I have done to the gun is add some better grips and mags. The grips are pakmayr and the new mags are a 8 and 10 round cobra mag. The stock grips and mag will come with the gun. As you will see from the pictures this gun is in new condition and has been cleaned every time after the range. The reason I am selling the pistol is because I basically bought it on impulse and thought I could have a nice range/carry gun. Now after a year with the gun I realize that I want something lighter to carry and I just dont have a need for two pistols, less money to spend on rifles :D.

Bought in Jan of 17. Sales receipt will verify it was purchased from authorized seller. Comes with original box, and everything that came with the box.This knife is used and shows signs of wear. There is some wear to the anodized finish on the thumbstud. There is cosmetic blemishes in the titanium scales. Im sure Chris Reeve can probably make it look like new if such things matter to you. To be honest, the knife did not come that sharp from the factory. I have used a Spyderco Sharpmaker on it, maybe twice or so, but have never been aggressive. It could still use a good sharpening but I don't feel like my skills are good enough to justify getting too crazy with sharpening on such a nice high dollar knife. I will leave that to the next owner to figure out. There are imperfections on the blade edge, either from actual use and/or sharpening. I think I used to cut feathersticks one time, and other than mostly just a few envelopes and boring household tasks, etc. Basically, carried ""some"" and actually used little. Ive NEVER done anything abusive to this knife. I dont baton with folding knives, use them as pry bars etc. Besides, this knife is too expensive to do things like that with. Blade is centered well and everything locks up nice and tight. It feels pretty smooth, and I would guess it will get smoother with age if what some people on the forums say is true. This is not the knife for the collector seeking perfection. It is the knife for the guy who wants to own a Large Sebenza 21 for less than $410, and doesn't mind cosmetic issues, or taking the time to get it shipped to Chris Reeve for spa treatment and or sharpening (if you don't sharpen knives yourself).I prefer face to face. I will not sell to anyone under 18. Proof of age required if I am in doubt, located in Waverly.Email for link to more pics.Thanks for looking-"

One size fits all it has 8 adjustment points 2 shoulder 6 waist & torso it will fit a very large man I'd say up to 300lb I'm 200 and it's drawn almost as tight as it can go.Those of you who know you could pay from 75-250$  just for a load bearing chest rig or plate carrier (without plates) then start having to buy all the mole attachment pouches and holster to put on it could cost you upwards of 400$ just to have this same layout. Here its already done for us righties for 75$ for a brand new never been used and sweated on/in is the best deal your going to find anywhere. This rig Has a cross draw holster w a mag pouch atop the holster storage for 3 more full size pistol mags on left chest area. R chest area can hold a med kit or cuffs or whatever you'd like to shove in there. Padding on l&r shoulder's for rifle recoil reduction. 3 AR/ AK full size mag pouches. Molle webbing on the back for weight bearing attachments. Pull strap between shoulder blades for a buddy to pull you out of harms way if needed. Very light weight and breatheable super heavy duty mesh material. Has 2 interior zippered compartments and full size back pocket. I asume for a plate 2 small side plates will easily fit in the front on either side of the center zipper. Also has 2 adjustable qd buckles if you don't want to use the zipper. And has velcro and heavy snap buttons I assume for attaching to a weapons belt. I also have a new never used 2 liter hydration bladder I could throw in for a extra 15$ fit's right into mesh back slot inside back of vest. Plenty of loops to route hydration hose thru so it's just not flopping.Goes for 127.00 on optics planet (cheapest site I found) I will part with it for 75$ again nothing wrong with it brand new I just haven't used it like I thought I would. Text me it's easier @ REDACTED.... no cheapasses I'm already knocking it down like 35% just to move it fast.

Well I call it a colt because it started life as a mspec colt carbine. I added a magput STR stock, magpul k2 plus grip, vortex strikfire 2 red/green dot sight, forward assist and dust cover ""with the second ammendment on it of corse"", troy industries vtac low profile rail, low profile gas block and an SJC titan muzzle break. The rifle will also come with two 20 round pmags, a stock mag and every stock item the gun originaly had except for the front post sight and gas block. This rifle has been to the range a few times and I love shooting it. The reason being is that it has no recoil with that muzzle break on it. It didnt have much before with the regular birdcage but now its like shooting a pellet gun. Also the gun is REALLY loud like 308 loud with the muzzle break and I find it funny that it has fooled people at the range a couple times until they get closer. All I can say is that if you want a fun and reliable range gun you cannot go wrong with this gun. I kinda dont wanna sell it but I want a semi auto 30 cal for long distance shooting so the AR15 needs to go. If you are interested or have any questions dont hesitate to contact me and we can go from there."

SOFTCOIL GAS TECHNOLOGY
The all new CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an ideal combination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability to conceal comfortably. The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.
The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case."

I have put Magpul flip up front and rear sights, Magpul butstock, and an enlarged trigger guard if you wanted to shoot with gloves. I swapped out the stock grip with a nicer ergo grip, and got the quad rail from Armalite. The optic can go with the rifle or not. It is a generic 4x32 optic with a BDC reticle. It does what it should, but an ACOG it is not. Tack on $100 to the list price to keep the optic. Very nice rifle, barely used. Do not contact me with garbage offers. $1,000 firm.

This is rare off roster gun, and why you won't find many of these for sale in California. I bought the gun from my local gun store to replace my EDC G26, but for me it's still a lot gun for a CCW so went back to my G26 (and only reason I'm selling the gun). The gun is pretty unique in that the Glock emblem and engraving on left side of slide is painted a dark metallic blue, which is still subtle enough that you really don't notice it until it's under the lights (really need to see in person to appreciate, hard to see true color in pics). And only mods done to the gun is the stock plastic Glock guide rod was replaced with a stainless steel guide rod from RYG (but still have the stock guide rod if you want it), and the stock Glock plastic sights were replaced with Glock metal night sights. Sorry will not ship and sale must go through FFL ""in person"" (NO EXCEPTIONS), I'm willing to travel to an FFL in your area as long as it's in the Sacramento, SF Bay Area, or Central Valley."

This has long been one of my favorite pistols however I'm finding that I shoot 9mm far more due to the cost. I simply can't afford to utilize this pistol the way I would like at the range. I'm looking to sell it so I can pickup some of the other 9mm's I've been wanting.This gun comes with the following:HK 45C/CT with factory night sightsHK factory threaded barrelHK factory non-threaded barrelV3 decocker only leverV3 detent plate2, 10 round magazines2, 8 round flush fit magazine for carryDale Fricke ""The Archangel"" IWB Kydex holster FOR the HK 45CT extended barrelDale Fricke ""The Archangel"" IWB Kydex spare magazine carrierThen it also comes with the extra back straps, the case and everything else one would include.I wanted to explain the ""V3 decocking lever and detent plate"" that is included as some may not know. From the factory the HK 45CT comes as a V1 firearm which means it's a DA/SA pistol with a manual safety and decocking lever. The HK 45CT as issues to the US NAVY SEALS does not have a manual safety. The lever only decocks the hammer. I wanted to clone the US NAVY SEALS HK 45CT's so I bought the V3 lever and V3 detent plate. The gun comes with BOTH the V1 and V3 levers and detent plates so you an choose how you want to set it up.With everything I have for this HK, I have well over $1600.00 dollars into it. I'm not going to bother listing it all out, if your interested you can probably figure out what this is worth.I think I'm looking for another GLOCK 19 Gen4 possibly with Trijicon HD night sights? Maybe one with a Trijicon RMR? I might also be intered in an HK P2000 9mm HK P30 or P30L in 9mm, possibly with a threaded barrel?Depending what you have I might want to do a partial cash and pistol trade?
