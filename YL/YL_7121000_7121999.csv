Love it, know it would be a fun plinkerer and I could manage carrying it,  but there's just no room for it right now. Gun is really clean  excluding a scuff  on the right side of the barrel, but is only visible with the slide locked back. Wilson low profile safety  is a world of difference, even with sweaty  hands the safety could not be engaged with a powerstroke.  I felt better with a steel guide rod, but I'll include the stock plastic one too, as well as stock ambi safety. Got Herrett walnut checkered  grips, I started dremeling so magazine release was easier, but probably won't have them refinished/restained for you but probably will sand them down so theyre smooth.  Originals included too. Also got stainless hex screws as well as the originals. Comes with original case and barrel lock. 2 magazines,  and half a box of some 115g  Remington ammo. Need $600 for it, with that I'll cover DROS fee.Will meet at The Armory or The Range for testfire/transfer.

It still remains “the standard” that everyone tries to imitate, but no one Pistol will come with case, books, and one magazine.Please text me (28l) 773-82 SlX NlnE"

One way you can really tell if this gun is new is by the markings on the buttons.  I've find out that the button markins rub off very easily.  So if you have the a pistol and you've taken to the range and you've shot a few times, chances are, you will push the buttons quite a bit, and I remember from my last 2 RXs, after the first trip to the range, I saw the up and down button markings started coming off and fading already.  Are you can see, this gun is still brand new.

I need the safe space and these two need to go.The 20 ga has a story. I have had three shoulder surgeries and needed something to shoot with friends a couple of times a year. I bought this knowing it would be hard to sell when I was finished with it. I looked for a 185-K with a factory ported barrel. I drilled the stock everywhere I could and added lead weight and ended up with a 12 pound 20 ga. To say it is easy on the shoulder is an understatement. It has all the handling characteristics of a sledgehammer but I found I could shoot it fairly well after I got used to it and it doesn't hurt me.It would shine for a woman or child turkey hunterwho is recoil sensitive.  Kind of a load to tote around but once in the blind you can count on it to work and not kick much. 2 3/4' and screw adjustable choke.Next up is a Husquarvana 155 .22. It is a single shot with a walnut stock and very accurate. It needs an extarctor. I take it on walks in the river hills and carry a pocket screwdriver to remove the fired cases. It has a walnut stock and is slender and lightweight with an octogan barrel. Metal and wood are good but show even wear. It weighs a whopping 4 pounds 4 ounces.I don't know where a fellow would get an extractor but it is a usable plinker like it is.Too good to throw away and the one is too heavy to auction off and ship.Not your everyday stuffI'd like to get 125 for both

Both well made guns, probably back in the 1930's. These are made of all steel and heavy duty guns.Both use standard 2 3/4"" 12 gauge shells and function just fine.The 620 has the rounded receiver like a Winchester Model 12 and the 35 has the humpback receiver like a Browning A-5. Not sure of the choke, assume they are both Full. Walnut stocks with no cracks.The 35 has a black parkerizing like finish and scroll work in the buttplate of a pheasant and squirrel. It is missing the front bead sight. No biggie, glue a BB there or buy one to screw in. The 620 has finish wearing off stock and finish wearing off bluing...but reflects the age and actually gives it character.These guns were typically used in prisons or WWII. They would be cut down as riot guns or trench guns. They also breakdown and I believe interchange barrels, but I have not tried that. They also ""slam fire""...you hold the trigger down and it fires as fast as you can rack a shell in...just like the Winchester 1897. Thus why these were great trench guns.If these guns were made today, they would probably be $2,000 each with all the machning and craftmanship\fitting needed. AT one time, I thought about cutting these down and making these into riot or truck guns or having a Williams Vented Polychoke installed for upland small game guns.SELLING AS A PAIR. Please don't ask to seperate. Buy both and you can do that.$350 for both FTF or $400 shipped CONUS to your FFL. NO TRADES PLEASE.Thanks and please check out my other listings. If you buy two or more items, will combine shipping and also cut you a deal."

Sometimes your requirements call for added versatility in a tactical rifle. Enter the SOCOM II. It brings you all the compact power, performance and reliability of the SOCOM 16 with the added capability of a rail system. The SOCOM II has a quad-rail that will allow you to mount whatever accessories your application requires. The SOCOM II has the same specially-engineered 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle brake as the SOCOM 16, so you can expect the same excellent recoil reduction and low muzzle rise. The two-stage military trigger and fast acquisition sights – a ghost ring rear aperture and XS Tritium front sight – are more features that make the SOCOM II a great choice for a tactical rifle. The SOCOM II is the next step in the evolution of the powerful, compact tactical rifle."

A standard G.43 by one of history's most iconic firearms producers, this example of 'Hitler's Garand', is in good, original service condition, appearing composed of matching parts, and retaining its original finish. Lacking an import mark, the rifle is set in a laminated Beech stock with durofol handguard, which may or may not be factory-original to the gun. The small parts are correctly Waffenamt-coded for Walther(WaA359), with the exception of the 'aye'-marked magazine-also correct for a Walther. Of note-the magazine is designated 'K.43', and should be presumed to be a period-vintage replacement, but it may very well be original to the gun. Also lacking any sign of post-war service or property marking, the duffel cut in the fore-end identifies this weapon as a likely veteran bring-back. A classic arm from the collector's favorite maker, this Walther G.43 would be a fine addition to any German arms collection. Email now or whats up me now if interested at (854) 888-5766 for details"

A rare find for the collector, more so given its condition, Erfurt production in 1912 totalled an estimated 10,000 Lugers and owing to wartime attrition, examples so dated are highly prized by collectors. Enhancing the rarity of this Luger, the gun is in excellent condition, and desirably displays Bavarian regimental markings on the front grip strap, and post-war EWB branded left grip panel. While purely speculative, it is surmised that the pistol was carried by a Bavarian officer during the First World War, who then joined the EWB post-war. A historic piece of history-the EWB(Einwohnenwehr Bayern) was an early Nationalist Freikorp(paramilitary organization/militia) that was integral in the founding of the Nazi party. Composed largely of WWI veterans, the EWB was armed by the Reichswehr and used to suppress numerous communist uprisings before its disarmament by the Weimar regime in 1922. Showing very little sign of use and no evidence of post-service refinish, this pistol was likely hidden from the Weimar government and may have been brought home during or after the Second World War as a GI's war trophy. Composed of all matching numbered components apart from the magazine, this historic arm would be a fine addition to the museum or advanced private collection.  Email now or whats up me now if interested at (854) 888-5766 for details"

It is constructed almost entirely from stainless steel and is thus extremely resistant to harsh weather conditions. The 4506 is a traditional double-action/single-action pistol. The first shot is fired in double-action mode. Each subsequent shot is fired single-action mode. It features one-piece Xenoy wrap-around grips with either a curved or straight back strap. The 4506 was produced from 1988 to 1999. Like most 3rd generation Smith & Wesson semi automatic pistols, the 4506 features a combination safety lever and de-cocker mounted on the slide, a plunger type firing pin safety, a magazine disconnect and a pin mounted, pivoting spring actuated external extractor."

This is the most powerful one Hickory Creek makes. Pretty sure this is a 2013 or 2014 manufacture, as follows:--Hickory Creek Inline Crossbow, 125 lb draw weight, with bullpup Draw-Loc, foot stirrup (not pictured), anti-dry-fire device, heavy duty D loop, Whisker Biscuit, very nice rubber limb dampeners. I have applied a camo paint job of sorts on it, as you can see (previously all black). String is still in very good shape (couple seasons left).--Installed Picatinney rail in place of the sight, so you can put on any red dot sight or similar you want up in the riser. If you want an ""IQ"" Brand 4-pin sight instead of this mount, I will substitute out for no charge. --You also get a Hickory Creek picatinney rail that goes on the arm (not pictured), in case you want to use a regular rifle scope on this rig.--I will also throw in the pictured X-bolt case for free with my asking price - this crossbow fits in it, though a bit tightly (and you have to disattach the arm, to fit it in, which takes all of 3 or 4 seconds with Hickory Creek's QD knob system). This is a very nice case, which retailed for $94 new.--I will throw in a basic rubber stabilizer (which you can use to rest the rig on a V-notch attachment on a tripod).NOTE: The pictured Trijicon Reflex sight *DOES NOT* come with this bow.Note that I will install the IQ sight, and re-install both the foot stirrup and the anti-dry-fire device for you if you want; your choice as to each one. (The reason the foot stirrup is not on it is because I prefer to use the riser itself as the stirrup to save weight and bulk when hunting).Note that if you're not familiar with the large advantages of Hickory Creek vertical crossbows over others, they:-Let you draw manually and very quickly, without any cocking device, and de-cock without having to shoot an arrow or having the weight and bulk of a crank mechanism. This allows you to hunt on the move, going quickly between your ambush spots / stands.-Give you just about the same amount of velocity / energy as a much-higher draw weight traditional crossbow, due to increased powerstroke / efficiency. These 125 lb limbs will really sling a heavy arrow - I have it tuned for a 705 gr total weight arrow, so it's a great elk and moose rig in the woods.-The vertical configuration and bullpup drawlock allow you to stalk hunt more easily and lean left or right up against a tree for stability for a shot, which horizontal limbs impede.I have about $1K into this rig without the Trijicon. Your price is $580 FTF or $620 SHIPPED to your door. Shipping is FedEx, insured (signature required vs. not required is up to you). If you live east of the Mississippi, and/or south of the Mason-Dixon, add $10 since FedEx is going to charge me more.Also please note that I have been buying, selling, and trading on the honor system for about 22 years without problems on various sites including ArcheryTalk, Thefiringline, Thehighroad, rimfirecentral, gunbroker, gunsamerica, ebay, Armslist, graybeardoutdoors, and several others.Thanks for looking.
