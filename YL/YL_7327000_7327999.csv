This is a 1988 Taurus model 66, 6 shot, 4 inch barrel 357 revolver. This gun was just picked up from the smith a few days ago where he applied a satin blue finish. And before he got it, it had just returned from Taurus in Florida where they replaced all the internals that showed signs of wear, such as the firing pin. The gun is tight and is a power house. The model 66 from 1986-1988 was produced using the same exact machines and metal as the S&W K-frames of the time due to Taurus buying an S&W's factory and using the equipment and left over material. You can look up this year model, it is sought after as it is known as the best revolver Taurus has ever made. I will trade for another handgun only. I would prefer to trade it for a revolver that is smaller and is rated for continuous 38+p. But I will consider other trades as well. Just let me know what you have to offer."

This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD). Ready For Use Around The Clock With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 sight is ready for round the clock use."

It is lightweight, handy, and very customizeable. This one is a demo gun and in excellent condition. It comes in its original serial matched box, with sealed Colt accessory pack.The CCU features a midlength gas system with a low-profile gas block. This means the block has been moved closer to the muzzle, giving several benefits. For one, it has the same distance and dwell time as a military M4 with a 14.5"" barrel. This gives for a smoother recoil impulse, and greater reliability. Also it allows for a longer handguard for grip and attaching accessories. The barrel is 16"" long, with a medium-lightweight profile, so it feels great and balances well. It has a 1/7 twist rate, has been MP tested, and is threaded 1/2x28 with a removable A2 birdcage flash hider. There is a milspec M1913 Picatinny rail, which runs the entire length from the charging handle in the back, to out past the gasblock in the front. This means you can mount literally any kind of optic setup you might possibly need no matter what. The upper receiver has a standard forward assist and dustcover, and the lower is rollmarked M4 and Colt's Defense with all proper proofs."

It is a 223 rem barrel built on a sako l416 action.  Everytime i see these rifles on auction they go for 1000 to 1500 bucks.  This rifle weighs about 5 and a half pounds.  Has a super good light trigger on it and can nail a tack.  Rifle has a trap door on the bottom but i bekieve its missing the spring and follower.  Im just load 1 in at a time but could be replaced with a sako l416 reciever parts.  Rifle was built in the 70s and looks brand new.   Im just seeing whats out there im interested in ak variants and ar 15s and .lever guns like a nice quality 1911 variant This rifle just sits in the case looks so beautiful id hate to use it for hunting. . Look um up. Definately a collector's piece. Ill take cash. Shoot me an offer. Serious offers only please.  We are talking about a high quality rifle.

I am posting for a buddy that is not technologically inclined. His information will be provided upon purchase/agreement to terms of sale.For sale is a pre-ban EA Co J-15 complete lower for sale. This is a cast lower, and has a serial number in the 8xxx range. The receiver is in excellent condition, and has no cracks. The only marks on the receiver are superficial finish wear. The stock, grip, and parts kit are all original as I understand. The stock does have cracks on it, and the trap door on the stock is missing the release tab (more pictures will be sent upon request, and will include timestamps/proof that this is not a scam).This lower belongs in a state that it can be appreciated. He has done some research, and knows what this is worth. He is willing to let it go for a very reasonable price, so feel free to make an offer, but he won't let it go for close to nothing as he paid a good amount for it before moving from Connecticut to Ohio.All offers will be passed along to him before a deal will be made. Again, valid identification will be passed along to potential buyers with time stamps to prove this is not a scam. Payment will be expected via USPS MO, as this form of payment offers the best fraud protection for both the buyer and the seller. Serious buyers will be given the actual sellers number to contact him directly.As this is a firearm, it will need to be transferred to an FFL in the state of CT. We will require proof of the receiving FFL before shipping. The seller is very close with a local FFL, so shipping from FFL to FFL is not an issue (information for his FFL will gladly be provided as well).Please contact me with any further questions, as they will be answered promptly!"

Speedfeed stock, synthetic fore-end, 6+1 capacity, oversized charging handle, 20"" full choke, 3"" magnum barrel. This gun was made in 1969 and, as such, is not showroom perfect, but does not look its age. The blueing is a little worn here and there, and shows minor surface rust in a few spots. Nothing some steel wool and CLP wouldn't fix up in a hot minute. Functionally, the gun works great. This would be a great candidate to return to a classic, wood-stocked gun, or clean it up and use it as a home defense gun. Even though it is a '69, the receiver will accept any modern barrel designed for a model 1100, meaning, by changing the barrel and magazine spring and removing the magazine extension, this gun can be made practical for hunting or sporting purposes.I have more pictures available on request. The gun will come in a soft case.As this is my last 12-guage, I have a cache of ammo available for sale as well. All are 2-3/4"".

There is zero wear on the body/frame/slide (tiny bit from firing on the actual barrel top). I purchased it with the intent of making it my carry gun, but then went a different route, so this gun has sat in my safe since purchase. I have put maybe 3 mags through it when I first bought it, then cleaned it and put it away. Never carried/put in a holster etc. Literally as new as you can get without buying from the store. It will come with the pistol, the two included 15 round mags, and the Sig Carrying Case. I know retail is still $1,195 and Buds sells it for $1,049 and the only ones I have seen on here (not in this state were all around $900+shipping+transfer fees). So I am going to set my price at $850 cash in Tulsa/hours drive from here. That means I am not interested at $700 ""cash today"".Trades: I know pretty much regardless of what I put here, I will be sent numerous trades I do not want, but I will put the things I am interested in. If there is a significant price difference either way there will be $$ added. And as far as a trade value, I am putting it at $900-$1k. Which is about where I have seen guns priced at, so seems fair for a trade. Sig MPX 9mm (gen 2)Kriss Gen 2 Pistol (9mm or .45)Benelli M2 or M4Sig P938 (9mm)Sig P238Glock 19 or 43 (9mm)Daniel Defense/Noveske/LWRC/Sig/Other higher tier 5.56 (complete build, not frankengun)"

So I am looking to sell this one. I live in midtown Tulsa, and can travel to an extent for the right deal. Currently has the original BR Rubber strap on it, I wanted to put it back to stock for the listing (bands are very to change, comes with the BR OEM tools)Open to firearm trades/partials, and possibly other watch trades. Do realize $1800 is my cash price, this watch is over $3k new without the extras. Spam emails will be deleted, if I wanted to do paypal I would put it on ebay.... Since I can only upload 3 pics, I picked the three best ones. One as it is right now, one with it on the leather strap, and the paperwork/card etc. I have like 30 pics on my computer so if you want a specific one, just let me know.Check ebay/Chrono24 etc before making a low offer, my price is very reasonable especially for a watch with all these extras.Original watch: BR 03-92 ""Carbon Dial"" with PVD case and Black Rubber Strap and PVD clasp. Comes with original BR Black Nylon Strap (never worn) too. Along with the original boxes (two outer Black and White, along with large Leather Presentation Box), papers, warranty card, tools, etc. I am not the original buyer, and I even have a copy of the receipt from when it was purchased New. It does show some wear, but on the PVD it has a very nice worn patina that you wont find on a new one, plus there are no scratches or mars on the crystal it also runs perfectly. Extras:""Golden Heritage"" style (Not OEM) leather strap with BR Stainless clasp. About as close as you will get to the ""Honey Heritage Strap"" for under $650Orange Nylon Strap (never used)""Army Green"" Nylon Strap (put on for about a month)"
