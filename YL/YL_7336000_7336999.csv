The 107CR is modeled after the famous AK-104...these rifles are no longer in production and have not been imported by Arsenal for a couple years now. This is an excellent SBR candidate if you want to cut the barrel down or it can be enjoyed as-is with the 16"" factory barrel. I am the 2nd owner of this rifle so I don't know the exact round count but I've only put a couple hundred rounds through it in the 6 months I've owned it and it's in great condition. I replaced the factory furniture with a refinished Izzy triangle side-folder stock and beautiful Russian 74 style wood hand-guards and grip. I also installed an ALG AKT trigger. I no longer have the factory polymer furniture but the factory trigger group will be included. The faux-booster/barrel shroud is also included. The rifle will come with 1 steel magazine. I am asking $1500 or best offer. **The fastest way to reach me is to TEXT me at REDACTED or send me an email. Don't call, I won't answer.

My understanding is that only 500 were produced. This is similar to a CZ P-01, except that the frame is steel and it has a safety instead of a decoker, which allows for cocked-and-locked capability. I bought it for shooting in defensive pistol matches. but find the 38 ounce weight a bit too much for my shooting. The pistol has been worked over by polishing many components and adding these parts from Cajun Gun Works: comp hammer and pins, 85 trigger, floating trigger pin, light trigger spring, TS extended left side safety, and hardened firing pin retaining pin. I also have a 11.5 and 13 pound mainsprings although the stock spring is installed now. To maintain reliable ignition with the lighter springs, I think a light firing pin spring would be needed, and possible an extended firing pin. I put 100 rounds thru the pistol and found it very accurate. There are 2 14 round mags, the factory case, cleaing rods, and paperwork. I'm asking $750 with all the CGW goodies installed and will include the stock parts. Willing to drive 30 minutes to meet a KY CCW holder face to face. Add $30 if you want it shipped to your FFL."

The upper comes with a detachable rail section for light/laser configuration.This is a very well balanced upper. It was my go to upper for my CQB training courses, extremely manuverable, dead accurate at 50 meters and reliable as a PDW. It has been sitting in my safe oiled and lubed for over a year now. Like many of you, I have too much stuff and have other projects more interesting right now.If you do a quick Google search on the upper, BCG/CH, sights, and CQB device, you are in for $600 - $279 for upper, $100 for BCG/CH, $150 for PWS CQB, $80 for MBUS2 + shipping new. My price is firm and final. Cash only and no trades. I do all my transactions at Young Guns in Apex, NC in person. I require a CCW for all transactions (even uppers) and will provide a bill of sale that includes a waiver that you understand the NFA rules for this upper."
