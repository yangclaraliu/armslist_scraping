I wanted to have both barrels, one for carry and then the threaded one.This gun came as a V3 with a decocker and manually safety but I was trying to replicate the US NAVY SEALS issued HK 45CT which is decocker only, no manual safety so I orderd the correct V3 detent plate from HK Parts as well as the correct deockering lever that does NOT have the S / F markings on it. Those are currently installed and I will include the additional V1 detent and S / F marked decocker/safet lever.Gun comes in the orignal case with two, 10 round mags and one, 8 round magazine with a flush fit baseplate.Also comes with a Dale Fricke Archangel IWB holster in Coyote TAN that is correct for the HK 45CT size pistol with the CT barrel installed as well as one of Dale's HK 45C/CT magazine carriers in Black Kydex.I paid $1050.00 for the pistol with the two 10 round mags, another $60.00 for the 8 round mag with the flush base and then the CT barrel was $319.00 dollars plus shipping. The holster was another $100.00 and the magazine carrier was $40.00 dollars. Then the decocker mentioned above was $30.00 dollars and the detent plate was another $18.00 dollars.I have well over $1600.00 into everything if you include tax and FFL fees.

It dates back to WWII when it was developed to improve on the Type 98 sword. This sword is a beautiful, heavy, very clean blade, in excellent condition, with a cutting edge that measures 27 inches. It displays a straight hamon and is very sharp. The tang has two holes for strengthening the grip of the sword. It is stamped in two places with Kanji characters to record the name of the sword smith which I believe is Minamoto; see pictures. The iron scabbard is in excellent condition and retains its original paint, without any dings or dents, and only a few light scratches from use. The sword and scabbard measure 39 inches overall. This sword was carried back from WWII by a U.S. Army veteran and has remained in his family. The handle had never been taken off until I removed for pictures to show the signatures. I will include the original bamboo retaining pin. 100% of the proceeds from this sale will be returned to the family of the veteran. Again, the blade is straight and free of nicks, pitting, rust, or evidence of sharpening. Very clean example for an item as old as it is and a great addition to any collection. Please ask any questions that you may have and I will answer to the best of my ability. I will send additional pictures on request. Good luck and thanks for looking."

Ive bought a decent amount of custom parts so it has a Magpul handgaurd with rails on it, basic Magpul buttstock, and the nicer upgraded Mapgul handle that has adjustable back straps and the front part is adjustable to. I have a Magpul flip sight for the rear sight, and the handle looking type rear sight that takes up the rail, but i have a rail that attaches to the handle also. It is real nice and the condition of the gun is like new. It doesn't have any cheap parts on it either, Id honestly prefer it over any of the lower priced popular brand ARs without hesitation.

The metal surfaces are NOT scratched to hell, dented up and still show the arithmic amplitude of the carded surface finish applied to it by Colt in 1918. With these 1918 the better the conidtion and the more finish that is there usually the higer the price. This pistol has had  museum wax warmed on to it to seal it in order to minumize oxidateding.

The gun is in a choate ultimate sniper stock with full length V bed. This rifle has had the action trued, boltface and lugs lapped, and the barrel slugged to remove factory imperfections. It has a Konus M30 pro 6.5x25x44 mil dot scope with Leupold base and rings. The rifle has low mileage and is extremely accurate. I have well over 2000 in this setup. I am looking for something a little lighter but still a heavy barrel tack driver that would serve dual purpose as a target and hunting setup. I am only interested in precision rifles preferably in 308 but let me see what you have. I may take something else. Examples I am looking for are 700p, 700 5R, savage 10 ba stealth, or 1400 cash. Price is a lot less than I have in it so it is firm."

The stock has been replaced with a customized stock with a recoil pad, and the barrel has been replaced with a Winchester Model 1893 barrel. The foregrip looks original, but unfortunatley, I am unable to tell for certain. The receiver locks up tight, and the magazine spring seems nice and strong. It looks like someone in the past put a plug in the magazine, since it holds only 2 shells, but it should be possible to remove it. I don't see any rust or pitting on it anywhere, and the barrel is clean on the inside. There are a few knicks and dings just from its age, but everything should function properly. This can make a good cowboy action shotgun, but please know that in order to fire it, the barrel must be replaced with a Winchester 1897 barrel or a newer variant able to handle smokeless powder. Buyer must go through an FFL. Cashier's check or Money Order accepted. No returns accepted."
