The new M&P BODYGUARD 380 retains original design features including a 2 ¾-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 5 ¼ inches and an unloaded weight of only 12.3 ounces making it perfectly suited for concealed carry.  Lightweight, simple to use and featuring integrated laser sights – nothing protects like a BODYGUARD. This gun has only been shot twice. I'm selling it with 3 clips and a leather conceal carry holster. Gun also comes with original packaging. Call Dan if interested @ REDACTED"

This is a slip-on recoil pad/spacer, that fits on standard sized AK stocks, both wood or polymer. It adds some useful and necessary length-of-pull, recoil softening, but most imprtantly, it increases the area of the tiny butt-plate, which allows you to properly shoulder the rifle so the bottom corner of the stock isn't digging into your shoulder, and you're not forced to crank your neck sideways to sight in. (AK stocks were designed with the assumption the user would be wearing a thick,heavy parka, which automatically solves this well-known ergonomic shortcoming.) I've been a fan of these things, for years now, because they're a highly practical and functional upgrade, and are very econmomical.Look to trade for a box of pistol ammo, like 9mm,38 or 45. Can meet at the Exit 19 Chevron in SW Harris co, or N. Columbus around Williams rd/ Veterans parkway, on days I'm in town.Thanks for looking"

One of the last companies offered a contract by the Third Reich to produce this iconic arm, Gustloff notably maintained higher standards of build quality than the other producers throughout the war. The rifle has typical features for the year and producer, including all milled components, with all parts properly Waffenamted(Eagle/1) and the Eagle/Swaztikas being unmarred. Importantly, all serialized components show matching numbers, including the lower comb of the buttstock and the barrel channel of the handguard. A superb candidate for having been brought back by a GI returning from the war, K98ks in all-original, matching condition, are rapidly disappearing from the market place and this weapon would be a superb addition to the most advanced collection.Condition:Near excellent condition, the rifle has seen no restoration or refinish, with originally thin bluing naturally fading to a powder blue-tinged hue. There are light traces of oxidation, but no rust or deep pitting and the milling marks on the metal are distinct. Markings are well-struck, correct and no import mark is present. As stated above, all numbered components are matching, to include the handguard and buttstock, with the bayonet lug and cleaning rod unnumbered. The furniture is in correspondingly near excellent condition, having dings, scrapes, mild laminate separation and a tight hairline crack extending from the the wrist beneath the receiver on the right side of the stock. Mechanically flawless, the bore is very good but should clean to better, having strong, sharp rifling beneath lint"

One of the last companies offered a contract by the Third Reich to produce this iconic arm, Gustloff notably maintained higher standards of build quality than the other producers throughout the war. The rifle has typical features for the year and producer, including all milled components, with all parts properly Waffenamted(Eagle/1) and the Eagle/Swaztikas being unmarred. Importantly, all serialized components show matching numbers, including the lower comb of the buttstock and the barrel channel of the handguard. A superb candidate for having been brought back by a GI returning from the war, K98ks in all-original, matching condition, are rapidly disappearing from the market place and this weapon would be a superb addition to the most advanced collection.Condition:Near excellent condition, the rifle has seen no restoration or refinish, with originally thin bluing naturally fading to a powder blue-tinged hue. There are light traces of oxidation, but no rust or deep pitting and the milling marks on the metal are distinct. Markings are well-struck, correct and no import mark is present. As stated above, all numbered components are matching, to include the handguard and buttstock, with the bayonet lug and cleaning rod unnumbered. The furniture is in correspondingly near excellent condition, having dings, scrapes, mild laminate separation and a tight hairline crack extending from the the wrist beneath the receiver on the right side of the stock. Mechanically flawless, the bore is very good but should clean to better, having strong, sharp rifling beneath lint, residue and a hint of frost."
