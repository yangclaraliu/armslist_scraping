Here for sale is a very rare ZT 0650 - G&G Hawk Auto with Box and Instructions. These are very rare and hard to find - long discontinued. Dated Oct 2008. I am the original owner and bought it new. Never sharpened. Has been handled and fired a handful of times. It's never left my house. I did carry it around the house in my jeans over a few days when I first bought it to see how it carried.This is a phenomenal auto. It has a little heft and opens with a thud. Locks up nicely. No issues. The photos show a little oil residue on the blade.8.75"" overall.5"" closed.Stainless black blade.Clip point.ZT 0650 Descruption: Drop point black DLC coated 154CM stainless steel blade (partially serrated). The handles of the 650 series are aircraft grade aluminum and feature an black G-10 overlay to add gripping power. This automatic knife feature s unique safety integrated into the firing button. When the button is all the way to the left the knife is locked. Push it to the right and slide it down and the blade rockets open automatically. The action is quick and the lockup is solid. Reversible pocket clip (tip up, right or left hand carry)Price is 550.00. No trades and no offers - please don't waste my time asking. This is a good price - a couple 0650's consigned to Arizona knives over the past few years have sold between 450.00 and 800.00.I will meet in person for a cash transaction or I'll ship (in the U.S.) if paid via PP. Will not ship to a state that prohibits auto knives. I'm a top rated seller on ebay with almost 1300 feedback ratings. Shipping will be an additional 7.50 to ship via priority mail with signature confirmation."

If you leave a message I will respond.  541-914-1513Here is what Starline Brass says about the 6.5 Grendel The 6.5 Grendel was designed for use in an AR-15 type rifle to offer ballistics similar to the .308 Winchester, with less recoil. This flat shooting round utilizes the inherently accurate, high ballistic coefficient 6.5mm diameter bullet. Its short case length allows it to use some of the longer, heavier match bullets, making this caliber one of the best choices for long range shooting. With proper bullet selection, this caliber is no slouch in the field either, being suitable for deer-size game as well as varmint hunting. Several manufacturers are now producing bolt action rifles in this caliber, many of which are built on “mini” actions, making for a lightweight rifle with plenty of range."

This is a well taken care of firearm. It has functioned flawlessly. I have never had any malfunctions, failure to feed, light primer strikes, or any problems whatsoever.
 
Has the DA/SA trigger, upgraded with the Short Reset Trigger (SRT), and has a 17 lb Wolff hammer spring for a lighter and smoother trigger pull. This trigger feels great. I still have the original Sear and original safety lever that I will include, but the SRT kit is a great upgrade over the original. I will also include the original hammer spring and a never used 18 lb and 19 lb Wolff hammer springs in case you want them.
 
Hogue G10 checkered grips are installed. These were over $100 grips, and were well worth it. The E2 grips that came on the gun feel much better than the bulky old Sig p226 grips, but these G10 grips are even better than the E2 grips in my opinion. I will include both the Hogue G10’s and the E2 grips (with E2 grip removal tool).
 
The Bladetech OWB (outside the waistband) holster has attachments to be used as a through the belt, or a paddle style, so you can choose which way you like. The Mag holster is a paddle style. Both holsters have adjustable retention, so you can have them hold as tight or as loose as you like.
 
Also included is the original Sig Sauer hard case and manual, as well as 4 Magazines."

972,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7957972,For Sale:  H&K VP9,"Owasso, Tulsa, Oklahoma",$ 600,"Listed On: Saturday, February 10, 2018",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"H&K VP9 with Meprolight Tru Dot Night Sites and Three 15 round magazines. Includes case, three mags, speed loader, three backstraps, three sizes of side grip plates, manual, test round, and gun. Not shot a ton, but I've put some rounds through it. Shoots great and easy to custom fit to your hand.
In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.
The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."
