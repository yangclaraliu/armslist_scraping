Rifle is a mixmaster with primary components coming from Springfield and a few minor parts from Winchester. This rifle definitely has the ""been there done that look"" and shows its over 75 years of age. That being said it still functions well and is an honest example of a fine military rifle.Some bad news, the barrel is fairly shot out and swallows M2 ball to the neck. Despite this, there is no pitting or rust present in the barrel and it still shoots fairly well considering. I have a 1944 Springfield barrel with CMP field grade numbers that can be included for $75. Additionally, the stock lockup on the rifle is not perfect and there is some minor movement. I've fixed this with some small magnetic shims placed between the stock and the trigger group, but I also have a DoD marked stock with good lockup that can be included for $75.Over all decent rifle, fairly priced, with the option to purchase the parts needed to get her back to fighting shape. Face to Face in the Albany area only. Thanks for looking!"

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" OAL and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1.75"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube which is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail accepts many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

It's pretty much brand new and only 50 rounds down the barrel. I had a Eotech, Trijicon Acog and a Aimpoint at one point mounted on it but sold them. Comes with Magpul 2 flip up sights and vertical grip. This gun just sits in my gun safe. ///////NO OPTICS INCLUDED/////DescriptionThe Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V5 is a semi-automatic tactical rifle chambered in 5.56 NATO. The LW has identical features to the V5 and costs the same too, but the difference is the LW has a lightweight barrel, which cuts a third of a pound.ADVERTISEMENTThe LW uses the Omega X Rail 12 handguards. These handguards are free-floating, so when the barrel heats up and swells they won’t press against each other. It has Picatinny rails running along the top, bottom and sides, which allow for easy mounting of optics or accessories. The top runs continuously and meets with the upper receiver and extends slightly after the front sight. But it is available with fixed sight, flip sights or not sights.It has a mid-length gas operating system, so propellant gases are caught in a tube near the muzzle, the tube guides it back to the bolt and then catches in another tube on the bolt. When the gas is caught, it drives the bolt back. This delays recoil until the projectile has left the bore. Mid-length means that the gas is caught after a medium distance in the barrel, so less pressure is used to push the bolt back (compared to the short-length gas system).Features include a chrome lined bore, a vertical fore-grip, a MagPul buttstock that’s lightweight and adjustable, a cold hammer forged barrel, so a machine carefully carved the grooves in the bore. This process produces accurate and durable rifling. And it has a sling swivel attachment points, so users can attach a combat sling, which allows them to sling it while carrying it at the ready.Daniel Defense recommends the LW for military, law enforcement or personal security.danieldefense_v5nosight0304113 danieldefense_v5_0304113SpecificationsFixed SightsCaliber: 5.56 NATOCapacity: 30Sights: Flat top Features: Mid-lenght gas system; vertical fore-grip; birdcage flash hider; chrome lined bore; cold hammer forged barrel; and Omega X rail 12 handguard (quad rail system)Action: Semi-autoStock: MagPul adjustableMaterial/Finish: Steel/phosphateScope: Picatinny railWebsite: https://danieldefens…Weight: 6.5125 poundsBarrel Length: 16""Twist: 1 in 7""Flip-Up SightsCaliber: 5.56 NATOCapacity: 30Sights: Flip up sightsFeatures: Mid-lenght gas system; vertical fore-grip; birdcage flash hider; chrome lined bore; cold hammer forged barrel; and Omega X rail 12 handguard (quad rail system)Action: Semi-autoStock: MagPul adjustableMaterial/Finish: Steel/phosphateScope: Picatinny railWebsite: https://danieldefens…Weight: 6.5125 poundsBarrel Length: 16""Twist: 1 in 7""No SightsCaliber: 5.56 NATOCapacity: 30Features: Mid-lenght gas system; vertical fore-grip; birdcage flash hider; chrome lined bore; cold hammer forged barrel; and Omega X rail 12 handguard (quad rail system)Action: Semi-autoStock: MagPul adjustableMaterial/Finish: Steel/phosphateScope: Picatinny railWebsite: https://danieldefens…Weight: 6.3375 poundsBarrel Length: 16""Twist: 1 in 7""MSRP $1469.00NO EOTECH INCLUDEDPlease be legal with a Va ID and a CCW or Military. A bill of sale will be made out for both of us. Will not travel no more than 20 miles from Virginia Beach.

It has a stainless slide on black frame, has factory Sig night sight, stainless controls and factory Extreme grips (identical to Hogue Piranha G10 grips). I had a SRT trigger kit installed in the gun as well, the trigger reset on the gun is amazingly short and crisp. Included are two factory 12 round flush fit magazines. I purchased some 10 round flush fit mags from Sig and modified two of them to hold 12 rounds (by drilling out the dimples that restrict the mags) and those two will be included with the gun for free. I have another 8 factory 10 round magazines that I am willing to include for an additional $100 ($12.50/mag)My price is firm at $700 for the gun with the 4 included mags or $800 for the gun with a total of 12 mags."

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7735998,For Sale:  Benelli M2 light new only 20 rounds through it shotgun it has ghost ring and back rifle sighting in the front this is a tactical Beast with extended to for 8 rounds of shells.,"clemson sc, Greenville, South Carolina",$ 850,"Listed On: Monday, April 2, 2018",Shotguns,Benelli                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Shotgun,This is a fantastic weapon with 3 chokes 20 rounds through it I have a few little marks on the end because my AR-15 when I will close the safe door was falling against it and sit since it's a shorter weapon it would slide down the barrel some so it has one small scratch or I would say a mark and then it has a bunch of small marks on the end I didn't know it was even happening but this gun is absolutely no more than 6 months old it is beautiful you can look at the rest of it and tell it hasn't hardly been shot or touched in any way. It was 1175 bucks and I'm only asking 800 just because of a few marks on the end of the extension which was actually extra peace it wasn't the original piece which I have that as well. Anyway it holds I believe 8 rounds or two and three quarter it has three chokes it is a beast of an Italian weapon meant for the military but you can use it for deer hunting or whatever as long as you limit the shots I believe with deer hunting you don't have to but it is a great weapon the price I'm asking is is absolute lowest I will go and I want cash I don't want another gun. Let me know if anyone's interested... Anyway I'm only asking $850 please call or text REDACTED I will reply to emails but text messages I like better.
