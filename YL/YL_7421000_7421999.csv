We do not ship firearms direct to any person. We only ship to a transferring Federal Firearm Licensed dealer. We will need you to provide us with the contact information for that dealer. FFL's can be scanned and sent to us at the contact information you will receive during the checkout process.
Please make sure that your purchase is legal in your state. If it is not a legal firearm (or other item) for you to purchase, please do not attempt to buy.

Please keep in mind that USED GUNS ARE USED GUNS! Most used guns have some wear and tear from use. Please request more pictures if you would like more details on a used gun. We will happily comply with your request as we want you to be satisfied with your purchase. Please ask your receiving FFL Dealer to allow you, the buyer, open the box in which the firearm is shipped. By doing so, you will see how carefully the gun is packaged. It also eliminates someone else handling the gun prior to us shipping and you, the buyer, receiving your gun.

It's a Savage 10 FCP-SR chambered in .308. It has a threaded barrel and has been dropped into an MDT LSS Chassis. It has the MDT stock extension and a Magpul MOE Fixed Stock and a Hogue Grip with battery storage. It also has an Atlas bipod knock-off that's actually decent. It has an Accutrigger and this gun was sub MOA out of the box with the accustock. When I put it in this chassis I was able to get it down to .4 with a Vortex Viper scope - already sold - This gun is incredible and it's in perfect condition. It has only one problem. MDT made the  Chassis tolerances a little tight and there's a spot that is hindering the bolt release lever. So the bolt is not removable without taking it out of the stock. Two options for fixing this are grind or mill the spot out a couple of millimeters or get MDT to replace it. I've had two gunsmiths look at it, one who is the among best in the hill country, and that was their suggestion. Other than that the gun is flawless, shoots insanely tight groups, little recoil, suppressor ready and looks bad ass. This package cost me 1,250 before taxes and shipping on all the parts. So you couldn't this for under 1340 something. I'm selling cheap for quick turn and because of the small problem with the Chassis. It's a pretty darn good deal and I'm only selling to invest in equipment for my business. So no trade offers will be considered."

So I apologize for not getting back to anyone who was trying to reach me. I then gave up after a buyer backed out ....but here we go again...Rock Island 10mm with 250 rounds of Underwood Ammo. This is the real 10mm ammo and no that watered down crap people try to pass for ammo.400 for the pistol or 600 for pistol and ammo. The pistol has a bull barrel and a 20lb recoil spring.One of the mags is broken so the slide doesn't lock back but it still functions. However I think the ammo included more than makes up for the deal. Trying to make it a deal, I don't know about you but I hate it when people post their used shit up for crack head prices. Or even better,they customize it so magically its worth more used then what you would buy new, assuming you even want the customs. and don't even get me started on the ""tricked out"" 200 dollar used hi points for sell......wow....just wow.....and yet I digress again.The pistol was orginally used only for woods carry but I live in suburbia now and have no use for it.Also I'll do my best to respond to every email. I don't know about you but I hate it when I email someone about a gun and they don't respond, its like WTF...take down the ad if its not available. At the very least you will get an email from me that i'm not interested or its been taken.One more thing you can try to negotiate or bargain if you want, the worse I can say is no. I hate it when people are like ""don't low ball me"".....For real? Its not low balling, its called negotiating and getting the best deal...its a used item you are selling not a brand new LMT straight off thefactory...seriously chill the F**k out......for real.....if you don't like negotiating then don't sell used sh*t online and stop taking yourself so seriously...and yet I digress againAnywayas, hope you have a great weekend."

This safe is shy of 900 pounds and will protect whatever you put in it. The safe is in excellent safe and I am only selling as I am moving to an upstairs Condo and it is unfortunate that this will be too large and heavy for my future needs. I am pricing to sell, so please understand this is a quality safe and priced less than half of a new one. There are plenty of knockoff safes out there, however like anything else it is buyer beware. Buyer can contact the Liberty Safe Company and I can fill out a form that will transfer the warranty over to you in the event you ever need to use it. Sorry about the poor quality pictures, but it is what it is. Thanks Brian  Liberty Options included : Door Panel Storage, 2 Pistol Racks, Mag Mount, Cool Pocket, Jewelry Drawer, Dehumidifier, Brightview Lights (4) and lock light."

I'm selling my titanium gold Desert Eagle, chambered in 50 AE, model number DE50TG. This gun has fewer than 50 rounds put through it, and the finish has no scratches, dents, or deformations at all; it is practically brand new. The gun will come with the factory hard case, instrcution manual, dvd manual, disassembly tool, 27 rounds of Hornady 300gr XTP hollow points, and a gold base-plated magazine (now discontinued from the factory).I am not willing to ship the gun, as I've had difficulty with that in the past, so please do not contact me unless you're able to purchase the gun in person at a Colorado FFL. If you're in a neighboring state and want me to drive to you for the exchange, message me and we'll work out some details.The gun retails for $1900, and I feel my price of $1500 reflects the gun's condition while still giving the buyer a nearly 25% discount off factory new."
