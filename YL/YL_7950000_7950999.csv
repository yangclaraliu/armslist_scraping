Includes handgun and two magazines. Buyer must have be able to demonstrate Georgia residency (see below).I've sold a few guns through ArmsList, so here are answers to some of the most Frequently Asked Questions:- I’m in South Georgia; & that’s about a 3-1/2 hour drive from Atlanta (over 6 hours round trip).- I'm only selling; I'm not looking to trade.- I am NOT desperate to sell, and the asking price is firm.- I will sell in a face-to-face transaction. I do not ship, it is too much trouble.- It is against federal law for me to sell a handgun directly to a non-Georgia resident. I'm asking to see the buyer's GA drivers license to verify residency. I'll also accept a current military ID with assignment (PCS) orders to a Georgia base. - I don't sell guns for a living, and I have a job. Scheduling a time to meet will take some patience and coordination, so please bear with me.- I will provide two copies of a bill of sale, & the buyer must sign it stating that they are not prohibited from owning a firearm. There are lots of fine, law abiding citizens but I don’t know everyone’s background so I require the bill of sale.Thanks for your interest and for reading all this!"

It has never been fired.After 25-plus years of making history, the powerhouse rifle that started it all is still leading the pack. With its low perceived recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down. For more than two decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. the result is a feat of engineering so impossibly precise, it’s hard to believe it’s man-made. As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot. The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it’s transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. the rifle’s M1913 optics rail has a 27 MOA taper to take full advantage of the scope’s elevation travel.

Remington 700 SPS Tactical 308 with 16 1/2 inch heavy threaded barrel. The rifle is in excellent condition, I'm the second owner. The first owner claimed to have had a gunsmith do a trigger job and some stock bedding done. I do not have receips or other proof of that other than pulling the trigger and it is very nice, I have not removed the stock to check for the claimed stock work. I can say that the couple times I have taken the rifle out I have not experienced the stock flexing and contacting the barrel I have seen some complain about in forums. I have fired 60 rounds of off the shelf commrcial ammo, both 150 and 180 grain, and its an absolute tack driver out to 300 yards. I have not had the opportunity to shoot it farther.  The bipod in the picture will not be included, the optic is negotiable as well as 179 rounds of various manufacture brass cased ammo. 20 rounds are mil-surp tracer, I have not fired any trader rounds thru this rifle though, so no concerns about a burnt bore. It has a one piece Leopold base and 30mm rings that will stay with the rifle. Just shy of $100 alone."
