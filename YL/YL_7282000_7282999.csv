It's in correct early configuration. It features one of the nicest high wood stocks I've ever encountered. Roughly 10,000 of the ""X"" suffix rifles were produced. Inland subcontracted Saginaw Gear to make receivers for them and they made several runs, but Saginaw accidentally overran their contract by about 10,000 rifles and ended up duplicating serial numbers. The ""X"" was added to denote a serial that had already been used. These are fairly uncommon and desirable for any collection. You can find more details on these in ""War Baby"" on page 344. I beleive this serial number falls into the M1A1 range as well, so it's double the fun for what it is. Mine features an ordnance wheel/IO marked high wood stock in outstanding condition. There's very minor wear and a slight scratch behind the recoil plate, but overall it's one of the best I've ever seen. It has no major cracks, dents, dings, or deep scratches. It's smooth, clean, and has excellent grain. The two rivet hand guard matches flawlessly. The rear sight does appear to have been changed during its life, most likely during service and then converted back to it's proper configuration afterwards. It's an original ""S"" marked flip but I can see some stake marks underneath. The flat bolt is ""IO"" marked and maintains good bluing. The hammer is marked ""HI"" and the Type 1 barrel band is an ""IU."" Overall, the finish and condition is excellent. I would personally rate it an 8 out of 10 if 10 was unissued. The only major deterrence is the sight having been swapped at some point during its life, but it being original and correct to the rifle is how it should be. There's a little bit of wear on the magazine release and the underside of the trigger well. It's hardly noticable. It shoots well and accurately but I am wanting to retire it. This rifle belongs pampered in a collection needing something rare or an ""X"" series to complete it. This one requires nothing further and is all matching and correct as it should be. I am asking $2,200 OBO or perhaps a partial trade. Feel free to request more photos. Armslist is refusing to let me upload more than 1, but I have a whole album and can take anything requested."

Ruger etc The close combat Bar was instituted on November 25th 1942 by Adolf Hitler in order to recognize the courage of the German soldier in hand-to-hand combat. This award was completely independent of the infantry assault badge. The badge is diecast, manufactured in zinc though examples in Tombac or aluminum are also found. It is slightly convex with the centerpiece consisting of the national emblem surmounting a crossed bayonet and hand grenade. This piece is cut out with a flat Square of blackened Steel crimped in place. The pin is always Broad in the center and tapering at the end. The bar varies in length from between 95 to 97.5 mm and in height from between 25 to 27 mm according to all known makers. Presentation of the badge was made by the company Battalion or regimental Commander or the equivalent. On March 26th 1944 Adolf Hitler reserved the right to personally present the close combat bar in gold as the highest highest infantry decoration. The Gold Class recipients were automatically presented the German Cross in gold and were permitted to spend 21 days at home. The close combat badge decoration was to be worn one centimeter above the ribbon bear or mounted group. If more than one grade was presented to the same individual only the highest grade was to be worn, though the recipient kept all grades in his possession. The badge was presented based on the number of combat days as follows~ bronze clasp for 15 combat days_ Silver clasp for 30 combat days_ Gold Class for 50 combat days. All combat days in which the soldier had the opportunity to be close enough to see the whites of the enemy's eyes and use close combat weapons to assault the enemy man-to-man and be victorious. Days in which the soldier was part of a major attack or assault reconnaissance attack. Defense of a position. Or single messenger run. These actions can take place in the front line or in the rear against partisans.The initial combat days were established taking in count the uninterrupted time of engagement on the Eastern Front since June 22nd of 1941 or in Africa since March 26th of 1943. 15 months equals 15 combat days. 12 months equals 10 combat days 8 months equals 5 combat days. This decoration was also awarded posthumously. In which case both decoration and certificate were sent to the next of kin and the division Commander was able to authorize the award to a wounded soldier who because of permanent injury would no longer have the opportunity to complete the minimum days provided he completed the following ~ bronze class 10 days minimum server class 20 days minimum Gold Class 40 days minimum.The close combat bar was also awarded to members of the luftwaffe that would later be replaced by the luftwaffe close combat bar."

One gun shoots both calibers. This is a striker fired locked breech pistol with second strike capability (can drop the striker again by simply pulling the trigger again should the first strike fail to ignite a hard primer). It's a great choice for anyone with low hand strength or recoil shyness.  The locked breech doesnt require a heavy recoil spring so operating the slide is very easy, and the slide velocity is lower than a blowback gun so it also tames the already low recoil of the .32 and .380 calibers. People that have shot this gun comment that it feels like shooting a .22 pistol, but of course it makes much bigger holes. In it's niche it stands out the only high capacity locked breech compact .380 available, ideal for carry or plinking and much easier to grasp and control than a subcompact Glock 42 or S&W Bodyguard. The ample grip, low recoil and light weight make this an easy gun for novices to shoot quickly and accurately without flinching.I purchased the extra slide with the original intention of converting it to .32 NAA but a surprise baby has canned that experiment. Pistol includes both .380 and .32 ACP upper assemblies, 2x 12 round .380 magazines and 3x 10 round .32acp magazines. The .380 upper extractor and barrel have been carefully polished to enhance feeding. Prior to polishing these parts FMJ ammunition fed fairly reliably, but HP or FP ammunition would hang up every now and then. After the polishing it's a completely different gun though, it's impossible for me to induce a feed failure with FMJ, FP, or HP ammunition. Feeding is so smooth now that .380 will even feed reliably feed from the .32 acp magazines, and while I wouldnt use the .32 magazines while carrying .380 it does gives you a few more magazines to practice with at the range.Also of note is the Taurus security lock integrated into the gun. Should you wish to disable the pistol while storing it, use the included Taurus security keys to twist the locking cam 180 degrees and the firing mechanism is disabled.Additional pictures available on request. Prefer a face to face transaction in North Platte but will ship at buyer's expense. Shipment outside of Nebraska must go to an FFL."
