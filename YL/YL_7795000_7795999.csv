This handsome revolver is factory finished in bright blue with color case hardened hammer and trigger. Condition is excellent with nearly all of the original finish remaining. There is a light cylinder turn line and a couple of very small handling marks. There is no rust or any pitting. The stocks are in fine shape but do show a little more handling wear than the revolver. The mechanics are in perfect working order with good timing and solid lock-up. The bore is excellent too with bright, sharp rifling. It's quite evident that this was a ""safe queen"" and saw only limited and careful use since new. According to the serial number, this beauty was manufactured in about 1980-82. A very nice revolver...they just don't make like this any longer!Buyer pays $20.00 shipping."

The grips were custom built for me by Altamonte ($120) in simulated ivory with a silver S&W logo inlay. The in-waist holster is a Cross Breed ($70). All total I have put close to $800 in this set up. I do have the original, wood grips it came with, but that's it. Box dissapeared.This is made of good ol' stainless steel. Way less recoil than the plastic framed, aluminum framed or scandium framed revolvers. The model 60 is considered by S&W lovers to be a must have, and a classic design. Gun runs great.

Let's play ""Who is the moron"".  Here are your options:1. the idiot that lists on Armslist a used version of this firearm for $$$$ more than what I am asking for BNIB;2. the guy that pays that for the used one; or3. me for selling brand new fireams at such incredibly low prices.My wife picks #3 (but for totally unrelated reasons). This revolver reminds me of the Shay Model A convertibles that were sold in the 1980's through Ford dealers. They took modern mechanical features, and installed them in a 1920's looking Model A bodies. They were cool vintage looking cars, but with modern comfort and dependability (by 1980s standards). Rock Island has done basically the same trick with the M206 revolver. This revolver is HEAVILY inspired by the old Colt Detective revolvers that were the mainstay of undercover law enforcement through the 1970's. Gives you 6 shot capacity, and excepts Colt Detective speedloaders. features a ""floating"" frame mounted firing pin with a transfer bar safety similar to the Colt King Cobra. In the unlikely event the gun is dropped, this means it will not discharge until the trigger is squeezed. Other modern upgrades include replacing the Detective Special's leaf style hammer spring with a stronger coil spring. the frame is constructed out of 4140 ordnance grade steel. The double action trigger pull weight is fairly standard at 12- pounds, while single action breaks much lighter.A black oxide finish provides excellent durability and has been professionally applied.The M206 Spurless Revolver is ideal for self defense and concealed carry with a 2"" fully shrouded barrel and spurless hammer, fixed front sight, and smooth channel frame cut rear sight. Includes both wood and rubber grips.  It is backed by a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. Overall, the Rock Island 206 is a well priced, solidly built handgun designed to save your life in an emergency. Unloaded weight is 1.5lbs. rated for occassional + P use, but why would you use +p anyway? IMO much better gun then the offerings from Taurus and Rossi. I like it so much, I'm keeping one for myself.  Not quite the quality of a Smith and Wesson, but it doesn't cost anywhere near what a S&W will run you. Speed loaders are available for only $16.00, but only if purchased with the revolver.  Photo's look a little spotty due to thin coat of oil from the factory.  These are first quality guns.  All sales are final and ""as is"".  If you have any issue with the firearm you will need to address it with the manufacter/importer.  It is solely your responsibility to make certain that you can legally own the firearm where you reside.  All used/surplus firearms should be inspected by a gunsmith before firing."

So it is in immaculate condition. This scope is under a full factory warranty by Primary Arms. I purchased this red dot sight only to find out I have an astigmatism. So unfortunately my poor vision prevents me from using holographic optics. Instead of listing all the specifications myself, I thought it would be easier to copy and paste the links to each product on Amazon.com. So you can follow the 2 links below to see all the specs on Amazon.com (I purchased it from Amazon). The first link is for the scope itself, and second link is for the riser mount. I encourage you to read some reviews. The reviews are incredibly high as this is a very popular high quality red dot sight. https://www.amazon.com/Primary-Arms-Advanced-MD-ADS-Riflescope/dp/B00OD2L62M/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=REDACTED&sr=8-2-spons&keywords=primary+arms+advanced+micro+dot&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/Primary-Arms-Micro-Mount-Riser/dp/B00WGZSU5O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=REDACTED&sr=8-3&keywords=primary+arms+riserThe price includes both the optic and the riser mount. The riser mount will give you a perfect lower 1/3 co-witness on any standard AR platform rifle. If you are not interested in the riser mount I will consider selling just the scope with the standard mount that it came with. ***If you would like to see more photos please contact me and I can text or email them to you.

A total of 4 magazines: 2 factory mags (9 rounds), and 2 Glock 22 magazines (15 rounds).

One Uncle Mike's Kydex OWB holster.
One basic Uncle Mike's IWB holster (cloth).

As for wear on the firearm, there is a little scratch on the rear of the slide, but it is very minor. I have included pictures of it. Otherwise it is just some minimal holsterwear. It has spent most of its life in my firearm safe.
 
This firearm has been great to me, I am selling it because I don't shoot it often enough to keep it.
