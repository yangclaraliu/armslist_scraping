Preferences listed below, but I am not stuck on any one trade. It was painted all black by a previous owner before I acquired it 25 or more years ago, and no I don't know what it looks like under the paint. That can be the next owner's mystery to solve.The action is tight, and the bore is shiny and bright, and has good sharp rifling. the safety works, and the firing pin hits hard, all good mechanically. It does not appear to have seen any actual military use, and may have never been issued or fired. Look it over and see what you think.I have personally never fired it or bought any ammo, but FMJ and SP hunting ammo is readily available, and it is a ballistically formidable caliber. It uses an enbloc clip, similar to the type used by a Garand, and I have one of them to include. Others are available online.Other than the paint and the bayonet slot filled with a well fitted wood plug, and a missing buttplate, it appears to be unaltered, with the original fixed sights.I am just looking to trade, not interested in selling for cash to lowballers wanting to buy it for half the price of others I see advertised, don't ask how much.No apparent defects, but milsurps are not really my thing, even if one of these very Carcano rifles allegedly killed JFK. I had originally bought it for that novelty factor, as this was the only one of these that I had ever seen at that time, 25 years or more after JFK.Don't contact me to complain about the paint. I didn't do the paint.Hopefully I have covered any potential questions here.All negotiation and discussion by email until an agreement is reached.I.D. and C.C.W permit required and bill of sale/trade exchange required, in person only, reasonably near Gadsden.I will meet you at a public location for a no-obligation inspection in Gadsden area, and will travel a little for an appealing trade.ABSOLUTELY NO SHIPPING - DON""T ASK."

Amazingly, despite the adoption of the ill-fated Model 1882 Chaffee-Reese Bolt Action Magazine Rifle, new models of trapdoor rifles continued to be produced and used all the way through the mid-1890s, until finally, the Krag-Jorgensen was adopted. Trapdoors continued to see use all the way through the Spanish American War in 1898. The U.S. continued to see unrest and conflict with the displaced Native Americans during this time, including the Wounded Knee Massacre on December 29th, 1890. They were sturdy, simple rifles, with plenty of range and power.This specimen is one of the early production of the Model 1884, featuring a “U.S./MODEL/1884” marked breech. The lock is marked with a federal eagle next to “U.S./SPRINGFIELD”. One of the distinctive features of this model was the highly adjustable, long-range rear sight, called a Buffington rear sight. The front sight is a fine blade, making this sighting combination very effective at long distances. This model was also designed to handle the larger 45-70-500 cartridge, with a 500-grain bullet, versus the 45-70-405 of earlier models of the trapdoor. The lock is marked “Eagle/U.S./Springfield”. The left side of the barrel bears the “V/P/Eagle head” proof marks. The left side of the stock bears the faint remnants of the inspector cartouche.The overall condition is very good. The metal surfaces show lots of original blue. The markings are clear and legible. The walnut stock is solid and show the usual handling marks. Cleaning rod absent. The bore is sharp and bright. The action is excellent. Here is a great example of an Indian Wars Trapdoor!Own the original! This is a legitimate antique and not a reproduction.Barrel is 32-5/8 inches.Caliber: .45-70 GOVTBuyer will pay $15 for shipping"

I’ll include those and a few more extra parts. Left grip is broken, right grip is almost perfect but has a chip at the bottom. Side panel nut has another groove cut into it like a Phillips head (originally flat head) Bore is dark but has decent rifling and no pitting. Timing seems alright, but I’m not a professional gunsmith so I can’t promise anything."

The piston system is self-cleaning, and has three settings: one for semi-auto Fire, one for suppressed fire, and one for single shot action. The hand guard is a Samson Star C-EX-P Free Float Carbine Length Rail that wraps around the gas block.The BCG is full auto design, no cut backs in that aspect, the back end of the BCG is wider, with the corners rounded so as to reduce carrier tilt and wear on the buffer tube when it passes the receiver in the tube. The Bolt is marked “M” for magnetic particle inspection.On the inside of the receiver, were the cam pin rotates into the little pocket on the side, Adams Arms rounded off that corner to assist with wear mitigation so the cam pin slides into place instead of wearing that corner down on the receiver wall making for a smother transition when locking and unlocking the bolt into position.The gas block is railed at receiver height, providing for continuous rail down the length of the rifle, with the adjustment knob at the end for quick and easy access. This is a very nice quality rifle. $1,000 for the whole package, or $800 for just the complete upper."

The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty.  This year the compact-sized P-07 features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day, snag-free carry.The CZ P-07 is an excellent choice for defense, duty, competition, and concealed carry. The CZ P-07 is well made using high quality components and an excellent design built from the ground up to make it an ultra reliable pistol. For the discerning shooter the CZ P-07 will impress with its fit, finish, and most importantly functionality. For concealed carry permit holders, the CZ P-07 represents the pinnacle of conceal ability and stopping power.Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.

The ergonomics are greatly improved with stippled-type grip surface, not too rough or smooth, great improvements in the frame that not only look great but also decrease overall weight. If there was a trophy for “Most Improved Model”, This gun would win hands down! THIS is the the M&P that should have been built the first time!
