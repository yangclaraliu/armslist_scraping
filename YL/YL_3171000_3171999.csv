Starts with Colt AR 15 223/5.56 Nato with all papers and boxes.          

You can email me for add'l pics and I can email you back or I can text them.....You can also text me, my number is at bottom of listing.



This set up has just about everything you could want for a very basic bug out kit.  It has a waterproof Pelican hard case with wheels ($250-400 value), quadrail ($150 value), FDE sling and Adapter ($70-80), cleaning kit, vertical grip ($39), low profile rail covers ($50) Camillus survival kit (fire starters and such),  Camillus Multi-tool, large fixed blade Camillus Les Stroud survival knife, led flashlight ($60), military compass, first aid kit, emergency drinking water, emergency food rations, and a waterproof map pouch. All are brand new and never used. I think I listed everything.  (All in total with rifle and extras the value is around $2000)  

Mags not included unless full price offer, pink stuffed dog definitely not included, kids would be upset :)



Retails for $1699 plus tax at best price I've seen, average retail is $1850 plus tax.

I have a few too many ar's right now so I am selling a couple or trading.



Must be Fl Resident, Non Felon.  Cash only or Cash plus trade.....no shipping unless you want to pay extra but this set up is heavy and probably expensive to ship.



I'm asking $1650 which is very fair for all that this comes with and no taxes too. You must be able to meet me in Clermont, West Orlando, Groveland or Four Corners......I cant travel any further unless Im heading in to Orlando for an appt which is not to often.



Trades I might consider are new or like new High quality AR in .308 ,  possibly ar 5.56 if piston, Mulitiple GLocks, Glocks plus cash, Sig P238 in FDE or Desert or Scorpion and other handguns I might consider plus cash but must be new or like new and not junk brands.  I really only would consider other hand guns in 1911 only if it was a great deal for me as I would likely sell it later, but would still need cash on top, I cant do even trade, sorry.  I might be interested in New in Box nice optics like eotech, aimpoint, trijicon or similar plus weapons or cash.



Please don't waste our time with full retail on your gun as I'm not asking full retail, I can just keep this and sell it whenever someone is willing to pay a reasonable amount.  I value NEW unfired Glocks at $450-525 depending on model and features, I dont need 6 holsters with it and 20 mags, I'll take them but I cant give them much value since I dont need them.  No  offense, but I have plenty of all of that.   



407-701-41 zero zero text only, dont call, I can't speak to everyone that wants to chat........we can come to an agreement on email or text and then we will definitely speak before meeting. I apologize for all the lengthy details, but I've dealt with lots of unique people on here and just trying to cover everything up front. 

 Last, again, no offense.....but if you can get this cheaper elsewhere, I don't need to know about it, thank you for your time and consideration."

NOTE...  It is ""ILLEGAL"" to ship (or RECEIVE) ammunition via the USPS or many other well know services. Online some people say that it is legal at some companies with the proper labels but I also know that labels are not always legal if printed yourself. Labels must be certain size over-all with certain size lettering and color to be legal and I would not trust printing your own. Plus you may be violating copyright laws by simply printing and using labels. I value my 2nd Amendment Right too much to be caught up in ILLEGALLY shipping or receiving merchandise. 
If you want this item shipped the buyer would have to pay 100% of the S&H costs and I will only ship with a legal transporter which might be from a FFL on my end to an FFL on your end."

This is a crazy good deal guys, for a gas piston AR that cost $1,100 new. TELL YOU WHAT, screw it...you can have the whole thing YHM sights included for $800!!! If you can beat this deal then, god bless ya because between the rifle and the YHM flip up iron sights, there is $1200 in value here.. Lowballers, bother someone else, I already got this thing lowballed down as low as its going. This is a hell of a deal, anyone who knows anything about firearms will know this. budsgunshop.com made a error, they have it listed as a 223....its is a 5.56, even the barrel is stamped 5.56."

404,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3171404,For Sale:  1996 Land Rover Discovery,"Socorro, Albuquerque, New Mexico","$ 1,600","Listed On: Friday, June 13, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a 1996 Land Rover Discovery. It has a 4.0L V8, Automatic Transmission, and 4WD. It has 172k miles. I bought it a couple months ago intending to fix it up a little and keep it, but I recently got an unexpected great deal on a BMW so I dont need the Discovery anymore. I dont need the money, I just dont need the vehicle so Im open to trading as well.

I will take cash or trade for firearm(s) with an appropriate amount of money on either end to balance the deal. Specifically I am looking for an M1A, HK91 (PTR, etc), AR10, AR15, Mossberg pump shotgun, or Ruger LCR-X .357 (exposed hammer), but let me know what you have. I will also take .22, .40, 12ga, or .30-06 ammo.

The Good:
-Starts every time and has never failed to take me where I wanted to go - including off road.
-Comes out of the factory with 4WD and locking differentials. This thing is a beast off road.
-Clean title with no liens ready to sign.
-Aftermarket Speakers and head unit
-Comes with extra set of different factory wheels and tires. This car has a rare wheel lug pattern so wheels are harder to come by. The tires probably have 25% tread life left, and one does not have any air. I dont know if it has a hole or if it just went flat from sitting. They came with the car when I bought it and I have not messed with them.

The Bad:
-Crankshaft position sensor needs replaced eventually. It will occasionally cause a random misfire on one of the cylinders but most of the time it runs normal. I have a new sensor.
-Power steering fluid leak. The seal where the steering wheel shaft goes into the steering box leaks. I have a new steering box.
-Transmission makes a hard shift sometimes. It may be a loose or worn mount or something else. I dont know a thing about automatic transmissions. However it has always shifted at the correct points and never even acted like it didnt want to change gears.
-Fuel Filler vent line is rotted out. Will overflow when filled over 80% full. I have a new hose.

I may replace one or more of those parts this week.

Call me if you have any questions. The car is located in Socorro. I am in Socorro Wed evenings and weekends and I can show it then. Special arrangements can be made if you want to see it a different night. Also, if necessary I can drive it to ABQ and it can be seen Mon, Tue, and Thu evenings, but only if you are serious. My other car gets better fuel economy so I prefer to drive it.

447,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3171447,For Sale:  SALE-CZ VZ50 32CAL PISTOLS W HOLSTERS-$275 EACH,"Springfield, Springfield, Missouri",$ 275,"Listed On: Monday, July 7, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Armed Sources has a pair of CZ VZOR 50 pistols in stock for only $275 EACH. These pistols are in very good condition and come with one mag and a leather holster. 7.65 Browning caliber(32). We will ship to the lower 48 where legal for $25 each. 
Here is a description on the CZ VZOR 50 from world.guns.ru:
The small, pocket-sized Vz.50 was developed during late 1940s for police use and it was chambered for the marginally powerful 7.65x17 Browning ammunition. Apparently influenced by the Walther PP in design, the Vz.50 had several differences in safety and disassembly. In the early 1970s the basic design went through minor face-lift, and the ""new"" design received the designation of Vz.70. Many Vz.50 pistols were refurbished to Vz.70 standard, with different finish, grip panels and a slightly different safety lever. New Vz.70 pistols were also manufactured between 1970 and 1983. After the replacement in service of the older Vz.50 and Vz.70 by more modern 9mm Vz.82 pistol, most were sold as surplus, as Cz-50 and Cz-70, respectively.

The Vz.50 (commercially sold as Cz-50) is a compact pistol of all-steel construction, firing the relatively weak 7.65mm ammunition. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed. Magazines are single stack. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. Vz.70 (Cz-70) pistols are similar, with minor differences in the finish, shape of the safety lever and grips. Manual safety is a lever at left side of the frame, behind the trigger guard. To set on safe: pull the lever down; if the hammer was cocked, it will be automatically brought down to rest. To disengage safety: push the lever up; a red dot will appear on the frame."

   pgs 11-12.  McCraner a ""Gunsmith"" with 5th Reg. US Army in the Mexican War, moved to Ohio after his discharge in 1849. Here J (Jacob) Wilt supplied barrels for McCraner as J Wilt & Co., Dayton, O. until 1853. Both men left their stamp on the barrel of this piece.
Later many of McCraner's rifles were used in the Civil War, in fact this piece was purchased in northern Georgia in the early 1960's. Still later Elisha Woods McCraner custom built a rifle for a young Annie Oakley and her stepfather.  Quite possibly the rifle she used to support her family and possibly the rifle she used during her competition with Butler. ""We used two traps, gun below the elbow, one barrel to be used,"" Annie wrote. ""I shot a muzzle-loader, but it was a good one"".

Originally developed by Herters, now sold by Brownells who sells it for $43 + $25 hazmat shipping = $68. I’m selling for a very firm $25 - at less than that I'll keep it.  I used enough of this to blue a short pistol barrel, then decided to Duracoat the gun, so 95% or better of the original quantity is still there. An ideal choice for the occasional rebluer who can't afford/doesn't want a hot salts bluing set- up. Applies easily: Clean the gun, boil the metal in water, remove, wipe dry, swab on Belgian Blue, return to the boiling water, then remove and card with fine steel wool. Repeat until the desired color is achieved. Also works pretty good if the metal is just heated with a hair dryer until hot, then swabbed, then washed in hot water. Works on all gun steels except stainless. Instruction sheet included.  Read about it at Brownells website at: http://www.brownells.com/gunsmith-tools-supplies/metal-prep-coloring/metal-bluing/specialty-bluing-chemicals/belgian-blue-prod7604.aspx .

This is a commander size 1911 (commander length slide and frame) but the barrel is lengthened and threaded for a suppressor. The paperwork says it is a 4 and 3/4 inch barrel, so it's only a quarter inch shorter than a full size government 1911. The frame is railed for a light/laser, etc. Pretty standard single dot sights, extended beaver tail, ambidextrous safety, commander style hammer. The trigger is quite good for a factory job. There is one very minor scratch near the ejection port. It's pretty hard to see unless you're in the right light. I've put around 200 rounds through it since new. Will come with the original paperwork, the original 8rd factory mag and two Kimber 8rd mags. I installed VZ g10 grips that are very nice. If you prefer, I'll swap the grips back to the black Remington ones and drop $50 from the price.
