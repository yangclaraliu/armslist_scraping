I got it as a Gen 1, barebones model. I have since sent it to UTAS to be retrofitted with all of the upgrades to make it a Gen 3, and now it cycles everything reliably. I've shot high brass, low brass, and no brass (estate hulls are all plastic), and they all cycle perfectly.Included with this sale:- Original Box- UTAS UTS-15 shotgun in like new condition- 7"" UTAS barrel extension- Aluminum pop-up sights- ATI Scorpion AR-15 X2 Recoil Pistol Grip (shotgun accepts standard AR-15 grips.)- UTS-15 Laser/LED Flashlight internal unit (no longer made or available as far as I know)- Cheapo eBay rubber ladder rail coversI'm selling because although I love this shotgun, it's no longer my home defense gun (I need lefty-friendly HD guns now that my wife needs to be able to use them, so bullpups are a no-go), although it would be great for that purpose for most people. It is overall very short, comfortable, with a generous recoil pad on the stock, and soft rubber on the back of the grip as well. The integrated laser/light can be switched using the trigger finger very easily, and it's a quality light that runs on two CR123A batteries.I got the extended barrel so that I could practice with clays, but I never really used it, because I forgot it at home almost every time.In my experience, after the retrofit, this shotgun has been dead reliable, as a shotgun should be. Although there is another bullpup shotgun design out there the KSG, I would not compare the two. Having fired both, the UTS-15 is superior in every way, except maybe weight.The shotgun has been stored in a humidity controlled safe all its life.I'm asking $1000 for this package.Additional images Album: https://imgur.com/a/ziUN3Text is best: REDACTED"

Q: Why have I never fired it?A: Springfield 1911's have always been reliable to me and since I bought it from Bud's used I have never had a pressing need to go shoot it. I'm very comfortable with Springfield's 1911. Q: Why are you selling?A: I just bought a KRISS Vector chambered in .45 and I bought a B&T TP9. So I'm very strapped for cash at the moment. Which has led me to this decision. Q: Is price negotiable?A: Yes. I'm looking for 700 in cash or around 800 in trade. But I'm open to any respectable offer."
