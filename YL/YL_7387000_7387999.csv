Steyr hand guns are hard to find as it is and rarely do disribitors have them is stock. This model is extremely rare and the hardest to find of all Steyrs hand gun models. It has a 3.6” barrel and is classified as sub compact very close in size to a Glock 26. It is perfect for every day carry or home defense. This Gun is a beauty and they shoot super straight with low felt recoil due to a very low bore axis and great ergonomics. Along with one of the best stock triggers on the market with super short reset and no grit.I don’t care if you see one in an ad online for less go order then and pay for shipping and transfer fees plus tax and you’ll be waiting a while since most shops don’t even have them in stock. $550 cash My price is firm and not looking for trades.I am a ccw holder and prefer to sell to a fellow ccw holder. However open to someone in good character with a valid Arizona DL and must sign a bill of sale.Thank you for looking and if you know firearms you know my words and price are fair as well as true.

I am selling a brand new, freshly built Precision type AR-15 complete upper receiver group. This upper is loaded down with some of the best mil parts on the planet. Let’s begin with the barrel. It is a Ballistic Advantage Hanson profile 14.5” with a Surefire WarComp muzzle device. This will accept all fast attach socom suppressors as well as the Surefire Warden blast diffuser. The rail is the BCM KMR Rail 13” in length. The upper receiver is a Ballistic Advantage model with M4 feed ramps. Strike Industries charging handle with oversized latch. Also comes with a bipod. This is a rather inexpensive bipod, but it should get the job done for most people’s needs. The included Bolt Carrier Group is a Spike’s Tactical mil-spec model with a phosphate finish. It also comes with the newer Streamlight ProTac Rail Mount HL-X. It is mounted on a BCM offset mount, and comes complete with tape switch. As pictured, also comes with some BCM Keymod rail covers in FDE color. I may have left something out. Just have a look at it and tell me what you think. Thank you.."

I haven't shot this one enough to know, but my other AR is a Palmetto and it shoots sub-MOA with pretty much every quality load I've put into it; my buddy with his fancy Colt seems a little bit jealous. I have no reason to think this one won't do the same. I've got an extra Magpul MBUS rear sight if you'd rather have that instead of the carry handle - I'd lower the price a bit if so.If you want to knock the price down a little, I have a Magpul MOE buttstock (non-locking, no sling attachment), or a standard milspec buttstock, that I could sub in, and/or I have standard milspec handguard I could sub in.Could make you a decent deal on .223 ammo too if you need any, I kinda overbought before the election.

Comes with hybrid appendix holster, pistol case and ammo box for $350.00 cash. Gun is in perfect mechanical shape, finish isn't 100% but it is an old service pistol so thats to be expected. I have replacement grips on there, can include original if you want but they are cracked. If you would like more pictures or info feel free to ask. Will meet in Lexington, purchaser must be allowed to legally own firearms and must have a valid ky id. I am open to trades but would prefer to sell. I am willing to mail to an ffl provided it is legal to do so in whatever state the purchaser is in. Email preferred but if need be text at 3 zero 4 3 one nine 20 eighty six. Thank you!"
