Will come with Blackhawk holster, and mag carrier, three 6 round mags ( one kimber, and two Wilson combat), a High Noon IWB holster and one galco soft mag carrier. May also toss I the hornaday and Winchester hollow points in the pic for the right deal. 
This is a nice and complete carry setup. Please don't low ball me. 
Cash price for everything is 475 no less. 
You are not going to find better for the gun, three mags, two holsters, two mag carriers, and ammo. 
This is a package deal, not looking to break it up. 
I am looking for firearms, or cash only. Nothing else. 
Thanks.

I had some problems with my email account not receiving emails from Armslist for some reason. The problem seems to be fix, but if you sent an offer in the last 2 months, I most likely didn't see it. 

With that being said,

I have a parkerized Springfield Loaded A-1, mainly looking for trades. Great shooter, I am the third owner so previous round count is unknown. I have put 16 rounds through it since I've had it. According to Springfield, it was manufactured in 2003. 

Good:
Comes with 3 mags, Fobus OWB, Houge panel grips and original grips. FL guide rod has been replaced with a Wilson Combat flat wire spring, GI length guide rod, and an Ed Brown plug. Have original two piece Fl guide rod somewhere if you want that. 

Bad: 
There is an idiot mark that the previous owner advised was on there when he received it. 

The Novak night sights are not glowing that much anymore because of its age. I dotted out the front sight with white nail polish as I like standard dot sights and didn't want to get new sights. 

Neither of those were issues for me as I was going to refinish in cerakote and I don't really care about night sights. 

I just want to be 100% transparent about the weapon. 

As I said I'm mainly looking for trades, specifically, a railed 1911, or a 9mm (M&P 9, G19 ONLY, Sig) along those lines.

Also would be interested in a 2.5-10x optic. Mainly a 32mm Mrad PST.

The gun is in great condition, and it's been cleaned regularly. The only two small things I'm aware of are: 1) the little screw pin in the front iron sight is missing. I currently have a home-made solution in there that actually works perfectly, but replacing the pin would be really cheap if you wanted. 2) the stock cleaning rod that goes under the barrel is missing - this would also be very cheap to replace if you don't have another rifle cleaning rod (or if you just want a stock one). Those are the only two little pieces it doesn't have. Nothing is broken or damaged.

This can be seen in the second photo. Tiny, but wanted to disclose this. It would probably come right off with goo gone but I'm leaving that up to you and there enlies the extra discount. Already a steal if you consider that the armory, superior, and Bob's gun shop also this gun for $580. Which equals $610 out the door with tax. Only $10-$20 less if you were to ship it to yourself via FFL and buy online. I'm pricing it $130 less for a brand new Glock to sell quick!

This is also one of the newly ""banned rifles"" as far as not being able to buy it new off the shelf, so you will not be seeing any of these in stores any time soon if ever again; you will however be able to still buy whatever accessories or swap the furniture because those items are not affected by the new executive order President Obama signed in regards to Russian AK47's.

     or
$1,150 or best offer for all of it

This was supposedly sold a week ago and I held on to it for a gentleman that came down from Duluth today. He wanted to pay with a check and would not go to a bank and get cash or a money order; he then expected me to somehow take his credit card and became mad at me when I refused to ... needless to say, cash and or equal fair trades only.

If you're ""weird"" I'm going to insist on an FFL transfer ... if you're ""normal"" I don't need one. Although I don't need one, if you want a bill of sale that's fine by me. 
Thanks for looking."

I got this to try out an ATV and find its not really my cup of tea so to speak. So its time to move it along and let someone enjoy it as I rarely do and when I do its only around my property. Just dealer serviced to include the drive belt. I have a new cable for the front locker I have yet to install. Dealer also installed a new OEM AGM battery. ATV is in great shape with approx 2000 miles and 350 hrs. I have 2 sets of wheels and tires for it. One set are the very hard to find 30 inch ITP Mudlites on 14 inch SS wheels. The 2nd set is the stock size 25 inch all terrains on 12 inch chrome option wheels. The Mudlites are in great shape and I would guess them to be 90-95% new. The stock tires also look really good and my guess on them would be at least 75% new. This is a monster of an atv and not for the faint of heart or new rider.

The only flaws are very minor. The rear brake light lens is broken, one of the tires has a plug, and the free spool on the winch needs reset (think the cotter pin broke it wont disengage and allow the winch to turn I've had to fix that in the past on this type winch). The plastics look good with just normal scuffs and wear. If I recall correctly there is one very small crack in one of the black trim pieces. It has a ball hitch on the rear to move around trailers etc.

That all I can think of at the moment. feel free to ask questions"

Cd player, manual locks/windows, fog lights. (still have all the original paperwork and sale sticker from dealership) ASKING $800 

I bought this vehicle off of my buddy who was a logger and had a tree fall on him. Due to medical bills he needed to sell it and I helped him out by buying it. 

The Good:

This truck has 4 brand new (30 miles) tires, brakes, shackles, oil/filter,spark plugs,wires,coil packs, alternator, water pump, fuel filter, fuel pump, newer battery other things that I am leaving out.

The bad:

-Truck has a little rust on corner caps, (typical not bad.)
-Body has a good amount of dents and dings on it (was a loggers work truck)
-Runs pretty rough. I am not a mechanic so not sure if its just a tune up or what. I drove it over an hour home though and it ran the whole time. Truck starts right up and will run/drive/shift every-time though, just hesitates and has a misfire to it and is running a little rich.
-At some point in time my buddy set the air bags off while on a job, so it does not have airbags currently. The center piece on the steering wheel is still there though and the dash has been sealed back on. 

Come take a look at it and we can go from there. Would make a great work/winter truck, or first vehicle with a little TLC. Will trade for good solid running car thats good on gas etc. RUNNING RELIABLE PROJECT CARS ARE WELCOME AS WELL. Or firearms with cash, 1 nice rifle etc.

The workmanship and standards are unparalleled to that of most any other pistol, let alone the 1911. I am only selling it because unfortunately I need money for other living expenses. I carry this firearm almost daily, it has had 300-500 rounds fired flawlessly through it. never jammed, never mis-fed, and always ejected properly. (I recommend using decent ammo; winchester white box works well) Cleaned and oiled after every use. Selling to good home for a very reasonable price. I am also open to trades plus cash, i will consider pistols, rifles or other firearm related items. feel free to email me with offers, please include a picture w/ trades, and please don't insult me with low-ball offers. 

The Kimber Ultra Crimson Carry II is a 3"" barrel .45ACP 1911 paired with a full- size frame and includes Crimson Carry red dot laser grips. Kimber workmanship and construction quality are easy to see, even down to the smallest detail. The melded forged steel slide and lightweight alloy frame fit together with tight tolerances and function perfectly. Recoil on the Kimber Custom Ultra Carry II feels significantly less than that of competing designs. This is due in part to this pistol’s lower center of gravity, which is slightly below the slide, and very close to where the shooter's hand grips the gun. Although the single-stack magazine puts the Kimber's capacity at only eight rounds, the relatively small diameter of the 1911's frame still allow the shooter to create a secure two-handed grip. 

The Kimber Pro Crimson Carry II includes a lightweight aluminum alloy frame to reduce weight for concealed carry. Crimson Trace laser grips provide instant squeeze activation and deliver a decisive advantage in low light situations. A match grade barrel and bushing deliver tack driving accuracy. For added reliability, Kimber includes a full- length guide rod, as the shorter G.I. style guide rods have a tendency to bind or break over time. Snag-free, low profile front and rear iron sights sit on top of the slide and provide a consistent target presentation. The checkering on the mainspring housing, plus the texture of the laser grips feel secure.The knurled extended magazine release of the Kimber Pro Crimson Carry II is a huge improvement over releases seen on other pistols. Performing tactical reloads is quick, simple and efficient. 

The Kimber Pro Crimson Carry II single stage, match grade aluminum trigger is a joy to pull, especially over the mushy triggers seen on most double action pistols. The 4 – 5 lbs pull is steady and smooth, while the reset is short and crisp. This is a gun that fires naturally, even for beginner's that have “low and left” trigger slap tendencies. In fact, the Kimber Pro Crimson Carry II has one of the smoothest trigger pulls of any production 1911 on the market.. Other features includes an ambidextrous paddles. Finally, to further minimize felt recoil, the grip safety is a high-ride beavertail style designed to quickly establish a positive grip for maximum control under stress fire conditions.

The marking is of the hammer & sickle. The stock has been refinished with great care and precision. It is a deep lighter stain with a minwax finish that is not heavy or glossy. Really you need to see this to appreciate it. There's about 15 hours of man time in finishing this stock down. All the metal has been cleaned with hoppes #9, froglube, and the cleaned with rem-oil. It fires easily and accurately with a very smooth bolt. I have shot it 20 times (one box) with non-corrisive ammo then cleaned.

It comes with era authentic ammo pouch and sling. There is also a bayonet included, but it is a reproduction. 

Also is a sealed spam can of 440 rounds of 7.62 x 54r ammo. There are russian markings on the can.
