Will come with three mags (two have larry vickers baseplates on them).I purchased Glock factory tritium night sights and had them installed by a gunsmith. Blue loctite was applied to the front sight screw before everything was aligned and torqued. Sights are zeroed and the pistol is way more accurate than I am.The pistol has seen no more than 300 rounds and was cleaned between every range trip.I purchased it for $645 and the sights and install was another $100. Therefore my asking price is fixed. Thank you.

Reviews are awesome, and look at GCode site for other specsINCOG ECLIPSE is a mission specific evolution of the INCOG IWB concept.Single clip, mid-line carry, offers enhanced placement of the mount so as to take full advantage of the rigs natural center of gravity. Inherent are adjustments in the depth of carry, angle of carry and the position of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting point of the holster. Introduced here is the patent pending Super MoJo adaptor that is used both to place the clip in the correct orientation and to provide multiple angle adjustments. The mounting clip Incorporates a patent pending negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the conceal-ability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the security of the holster during use. This facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The INCOG Eclipse is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, concealment holster.
