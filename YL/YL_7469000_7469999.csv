I only have about 50 rounds through it, and though the gun is reliable, I just don't carry it much. Gun comes in original case, and 4 magazines. I also have some practice rounds, but I cannot say for certain how many. I really do not want to sell this gun, but I have to pay for some of my daughters college expenses. I will be firm on the price. **NOTE** I will meet the interested party at my local gun shop for proper transer of handgun. You will be responsible for paying any transfer fees assosiated with the purchase of this gun. Out of state purchases, I will locate a local gun shop to your location and contact them for instructions on how to properly transfer this gun to you. **
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

Comes with a mid sized scope sighted in at around 1500 yards, two 10 round magazines, eight inch muzzle break, bolt action and a custom stinger missile case with wheels to carry or wheel around. Don't want to sell but bills come first. I know how this looks and it is not a scam. Everyone doesn't believe that it is real but reassuredly, it is very much real.If you feel like you want to see it in person before buying it, my number is 7 eight five-2 2 zero-four 8 one seven.So much fun to shoot, only has the kick of a 30-06 (hard to believe). Not to mention the rifle will com with one hundred rounds of HE rounds as an added bonus.Look foward to hearing from yall"
