Included are names, addresses, contact information, and recent transactions.*  A digital data base of almost 8,000 transactions completed over the life of this hobby/business, mimicking the BATF-mandated Bound Book, and documenting the sale/purchase history of the firm's clients. * The referrals of my clients to you and your business as they contact me for services at my long-established phone number, email address, or website. *  Numerous crates of various used scopes, scope mounts, factory ammo, mags, ammo boxes. holsters, slings, tools, grips, shipping supplies, books, and miscellaneous gun-related accessories.

Not that it is any lesser condition either. The blade remains original + unsharpened with the stamp on the ricasso and hilt. The button and spring really work like new (tested on a rifle) with not a hint of stickiness and a strong spring. The wood is not missing any pieces like many others though it has some minor dents on one side. Nothing is loose on the bayonet and it fits tightly in the scabbard. The metal scabbard is also much better than many other recent ones as it has no rust and almost the entire scabbard still has decent color (many are worn bare). No dents either and the stamp on the clip is clear as new with a WG under it. The point of the bayonet is fine (some are chipped or bent) and only the last 2 inches have surface scratches which are from the insertion in the scabbard as sand and grit builds up over time in the bottom. Overall a great example.
