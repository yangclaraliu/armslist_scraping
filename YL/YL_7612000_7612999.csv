We've replaced the trigger bar with a hardened billet steel hammer that removes the main tolerance issue in the Bodyguard's trigger bar channel not being flat or rough. We've also gone with a new flat faced performance trigger, the Santiago trigger. This all new trigger has the pre travel stop built into the trigger itself and is adjustable for post travel. The kit still includes the increased rate hammer spring, the decreased rate blocker spring and decreased rate firing pin return spring, as well as the hammer spring spacer. This kit is the culmination of years of experience with the Bodyguard platform and will really bring your Bodyguard to the next level. The Santiago trigger comes in three colors Red, Black, and Hybrid and the trigger carries the namesake of St. James, The Moor slayer. -Custom made to our specs this will shorten your pull and reset by 35%.-Made from high grade alloy steel and fully heat treated for long service life. -It does not lighten the pull but shortens it, making staying on target easy and follow up shots faster. No factory safeties are affected. -After the early break the trigger will stop about 1/8 past break when correctly adjusted. -Includes .050 spacer for increased hammer spring rate to increase the impact of firing pin for harder primer bulk ammos, see faq page for ammo info. ***Includes Hammer, Santiago trigger, increased rate hammer spring (for light strike prevention), reduced power blocker spring, .050 spacer, and reduced power firing pin return spring*** We strive to make all parts we manufacture to be drop in, although there is the rare occasion where a part will HAVE to be fitted to the tolerances of your particular pistol. We cannot control the tolerances of mass produced firearms, therefore we highly suggest that if you run into a tolerance issue to contact us at tech@gallowayprecision.com before taking it to a qualified armorer to fit the part. We also offer installation of all triggers, trigger kits, and parts that we make for a nominal fee. Santiago Trigger is available in Red, Black, and Hybrid (Milled sides / Black face and back). Fits Smith & Wesson BG380 and MP380 Pistols. *** A 20% restocking fee will be applied on returned trigger kits that have been installed. Non-installed parts will receive a full refund minus shipping. ***  Brand: Galloway Precision   SKU: GP-732-RED"

A finnish mosin, maybe. A pair of m44s? NOT messed up? maybe with a bit of cash. Three type 53s in shootable condition without bubba gunsmithing? sure.(project level stuff is going to be valued appropriately. Yes, I might be interested in a partial trade for a cracked stock vz52 rifle. No, your type 56 1963 production beater is not worth $500. You might sell it for $350 to someone if they don't check under the barrel.... but I can and will find one for $285 on a C&R sale. your rearsenaled russian? maybe $400. it's rearsenaled. I promise.)Nope, no broken quads, no 4x4 projects. Not doing computers, Teevees, video games, or any other stuff. good metalworking machine tools *maybe* I collect guns, not junquethat's it for trades.No, I won't sell it for $250 for black friday. I can put it on gunbroker.You REALLY REALLY REALLY have to be a Nevada resident and be willing to let my have a gander at  your DL or CFP (CCW). Gonna write a short bill of sale.

It is dated 1938 and was recovered from combat during the Normandy Beach Invasion. The grips are original but were sanded by the Veteran that recovered it. The serial numbers match including the clip--many of the Lugers remaining do no have matching clips. Solders who practiced would toss clips in a basket where the clips were reloaded for the shooter. The soldiers would simply pick up another clip and thus not all guns have matching serial numbered clips. The military mark on this one is an eagle. A gunsmith disassembled the gun and said it was in good shooting condition with a strong spring. I am asking $1500.

Many of the Lugers remaining do not have matching magazines, Soldiers that practiced would toss the magazines in a basket where they were reloaded for the shooter. soldiers would simply pick up another magazine and that is why you see so few of these with the matching numbers.The military mark on this one is an eagle.

Rock River Arms lower
This National Match two-stage trigger from RRA is an excellent trigger for your AR15 rifle. These are used frequently in Varmint and Long Range AR builds where a lighter 2-Stage trigger really helps accuracy and round placement. These triggers come pre-adjusted by Rock River gunsmiths as a matched pair and drop in all mil-spec lowers with no adjustment necessary for an easy drop-in install.  This New Never fired."

The gun has one small ding on the front of the frame. Comes with original S&W hard case. Price will depend on what you want with it. I have a Simply Rugged pancake holster with removable IWB straps and removable retention strap, a belt pouch for speed strips (and 2 speed strips) an Uncle Mike's IWB holster, Pachmayr rubber grips, brass, ammo, 44 cleaning supplies, and some snap caps.

The guy I bought it from had modified the ejector. Every third round or so, the gun catches a spent casing as it tries to load another round. The spent casing and new round get caught together. I thought I would try to fix it. I put in a new extractor and replaced the main trigger spring. It is somewhat better but continues to catch spent casings. I am tired of messing with it.  Maybe someone else will have more knowhow and can fix this gun.  It comes with two 25 round magazines and the gun manual. I added some low profile, flip up sights that are adustable, etc. The gun fires just fine, but has a fail-to-eject issue. I am selling the gun at a reduced price, as is, and hope someone else will be able to fix the gun. Text or call me for more information @ (316) 512-three-427."
