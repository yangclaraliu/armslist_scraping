Barrel has been shortened to about 22.5 inches, stock cut down, bolt handle bent, and a black enamel type finish applied to most of the blued parts.Mechanically fine, feeds and cycles rounds alright, but I have never fired it.Stock has a pretty decent crack behind the receiver tang as pictured. There's also a chip off the top of the stock next to the bolt handle (also pictured) Would make a nice project, basically needs refinished and a stock repair (or new stock)Bore is dark, would probably benefit from a good cleaningI have another sporterized stock available that is a little longer than this one (still not full length), but not cracked and in decent shape that I'll include for another $40. Would probably require some minor fitting. let me know if you want pics of it.Possibly willing to sell individual parts off the gun for the right price...Prefer to meet at Field & Stream Easton or somewhere near thereAsking $150 cash, or open to trade offersCould easily be parted out for more than I'm asking..."

With the optional SteadyGrip™ stock, this 12-gauge shotgun can be transformed into a high-performance turkey gun or mount a fully-rifled slug barrel for tack-driving accuracy on deer. It’s like having several Benelli shotguns in one. There’s even a barrel with rifle sights for home defense and the Nova Tactical fitted with a ghost-ring rear sight. At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making these shotguns super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But it isn’t just tough on the outside. With its dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel, the Benelli Nova series is rock solid to the core."

So add the numbers up from the receipt and this piece is over 3k (hence the ""sour"" part).  It was also originally Stealth Grey and I had it refinished in Stealth Grey.Fast forward 3 months after it came back, and after 600 rounds total through it, the finish started wearing again on the slide.  i was hoping I would be able to have some sort of a warranty or a discount second time around.  Nope.  In any case, I was gonna sell it as-is just to get rid of it.  But decided to have it made into stainless, since Ed Brown 1911s can be easily changed to any color or stainless steel if you would like.  They even offer that on their website, and apparently, many people send their 1911s back to make into Stainless Steel when they don't want to deal with the wear anymore.  Well, so here I go trying to get it to stainless.  I didn't like their satin stainless finish, so I had it polished a step further into a higher polished stainless.  It looks a million times better than the Stealth Grey, and never will I have to deal with the finish coming off again.  WOW, that was a novel.Looking to sell this pistol.  If you're looking for a trade, I will consider something a bit more than what I'm asking, since that seems to be the trend on ""trading"".Gun is in EXCELLENT condition.  It has a total of less than 800 rounds through it.  For a custom 1911, this is BARELY broken in.  Yes, UNDER 800 rounds.  The internals look brand new if you open it up.  If you would like to see the inside, I will gladly open it up for you to inspect.  Yes, this gun is almost in brand spanking new condition.  Most of the custom 1911 you find on here will have thousands and thousands of rounds through them. This is again, barely broken into.As seen in the photos, I have the original receipt and the receipt when I went to get it refinished the first time.  This is something very common for Ed Brown owners apparently.  It came with only ONE magazine.  Yes, Ed Brown 1911s only ship with 1 magazine.  And I NEVER used the mag.  Other than the gun, everything that came inside the package was never touched.  I don't use any mag other than the Wilson Combat 47d mags or Chip McCormick Power 10.Please text me: (28l) 773-82 SlX NlnE."

Yes, there was a wait on these.  Wilson Combat did a second wave of production with only the full size and that was it for the genuine 92G Brigadier.  Of course, you can take an M9 and 92F, etc, and add all your upgrades.  However, it still won't be as authentic as the Serial number.  I'm sure you can buy a slide with the WC crest, but it will probably cost you more than what this authentic one will go for.  Wilson Combat had already completed the second wave of production and basically, that was it.

Hogue stock & butt plate with a large brake means you can hit the 10-ring from sunrise to sunset with next to no fatigue. Easily puts rounds where you want them out to 300m; haven't been anywhere to test farther, but having run primarily 175gr match ammo through the rifle, I'm sure it could manage several hundred more, and better marksmen than me say they're accurate to 1000m. Fitted to accept an external box magazine (comes with one 10rd magazine). Scoped with 4x12 Nikon Buckmaster. Also equipped with: factory Hogue stock, M11 severe duty muzzle brake, large tactical bolt knob, foam cheek rest, black elastic sling. Muzzle cap, breech flag, range bag w/ 5 magazine pouches, & over-ear ear protection also included. No trades."

The only finish worn on this gun is the lines around the cylinder, I would rate it at 98% of its original finish. It has all of the case colored finish and no wear on the barrel or grip frame. The bore is like new and the action works like new with no alterations. There is a little timing issue where the cylinder lock comes up prematurely causing the drag line on the cylinder, a fairly common issue with single actions. It's a first year, third generation gun, like the second gen. guns it has the SA after the serial number, they changed to third gen. after serial number 80000 so only 2K guns were first year guns. This gun was made in 1976, and again that's the first year of the third generation Colts SAA. Colt moved the SA to the front of the serial number (prefix)after serial number 100,000, they started with SA01000, about mid-1978.

This is a nice rifle fitted with a 20 inch barrel and is chambered in 32 Winchester Special. This is a special order rifle with multiple extra features. The gun is fitted with a half mag tube, tapered barrel, Winchester deluxe sling swivels, pistol grip shotgun-butt stock. The checkering may have been done by Winchester, but we are not certain of this. The gun is also fitted with a Lyman peep sight. The rifle was made in 1910, and has been lettered by Buffalo Bill. The gun is in good condition. The stock is a nice piece of walnut. The stock has some light marks, but no chips or cracks. The pistol grip cap is in great condition, and has no chips or cracks. The butt plate is the original Winchester plate. The plate has some light marks, and there is a small chip missing on the bottom edge. The forend has some light impressions, but no chips or cracks. The checkering on the forend and buttstock are worn, but prominent. The bluing on this gun is worn. The barrel retains the majority of the original bluing. The left side of the barrel shows more wear. The barrel band is heavily worn, and only retains blue around the swivel. The bluing on the receiver is heavily worn. The majority of the remaining bluing is around the saddle ring. The barrel is fitted with a Winchester Express sight with three ranging leaves. The barrel is 20 inches and has a slight taper. The bore is a little frosty, but the rifling is still prominent. Overall the gun still looks good. The gun is over 100 years old, and shows some honest wear. The action is smooth and the gun locks up tight. The hammer spring is strong, and the trigger is crisp."
