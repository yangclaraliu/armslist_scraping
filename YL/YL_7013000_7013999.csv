An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a rob robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger"

All HK45 pistol series are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components. The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a rob robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger"

245,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7013245,For Sale:  Bronze Signal Cannon ca 1675,"West, Toledo, Ohio",$ 490,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 9, 2017",Muzzle,Kimber,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"This is a genuinely antique small signal cannon from Eastern Europe, likely Russia. It was made prior to 1700, and regardless of size, cannon of this age can readily be discerned by the nature of their construction. ALL bronze cannon of that age contain small short iron rods embedded in the body, which were used to keep the material in the bore centered during the casting process. These rods are called cruzettas, and in the case of a small piece such as this, are about the thickness of the lead in a mechanical pencil. They are buried within the wall of the cannon and can be located with a magnet. This is the true test of genuine age in bronze cannon. There are three such pieces in this cannon. Signal cannon were not irrelevant items on sailing ships of the period. On a ship at sail it would be nearly impossible to hear alerts or warnings that were shouted. So small cannon were fired, which were loud and caused a cloud of smoke that could be seen to let sailors know of watch changes and so forth. This piece is bronze, 5.5"" long, just under 2"" across the trunions, and has a bore approx 5/8"". Small, but weighs about 2 pounds. This is not an item for casual collection, but is a meaningful piece of cannon history. Please email any questions.Someone asked for ""provenance"" for this piece. With the exception of terribly expensive cannons that were salvaged by reputable parties, or have been in known collections for years, there is no provenance except for the construction technique mentioned above. If one cannot make a reasonable and reliable determination on their own by personal inspection of what a piece is - and this applies to nearly all manner of things- then perhaps one shouldn't acquire the item.  An item speaks for itself to the knowledgeable."

The receiver is drilled and tapped, and grooved so the shooter would have several different options for scope mounting. The rifle currently has a grove mounted UltaLux 6X24 Scope that is included.

Asking $800. Consider that the price of a WASR without any extras is usually somewhere around $600. The Magpul stock is $100 alone. The Magpul handguard/gas brake attachment is $100, Magpul grips are about $20, the MI rail attachment is over $100 as well. Please don't try to lowball me. I feel like this is a pretty fair price. If you're going to make an offer at least make it reasonable.

I basically bought this, replaced the standard wooden parts with the Magpul attachments and had a couple range days with it. That's it. Comes with the stock aluminum mag. I also have the rail attachment, as you can see from the picture, Midwest Industries side-mounted rail. Check out the video if you want to see it, I explain some things and show a little bit more than the pictures.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4SytgMsBxE 

Asking $850. Consider that the price of a WASR without any extras is usually somewhere around $600. The Magpul stock is $100 alone. The Magpul handguard/gas brake attachment is $100, Magpul grips are about $20, the MI rail attachment is over $100 as well. Please don't try to lowball me. I feel like this is a pretty fair price. If you're going to make an offer at least make it reasonable.
(Original wooden parts are included but they're in rough shape since they pretty much sat in my basement since I got this)"
