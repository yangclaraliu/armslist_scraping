The benefit of the torqued grip is it allows the hand to fit further forward on the pistol, which means the grip frame wraps over the top of the shooter’s hand. The oversize trigger guard is angled to match the contour of the grip, so everything flows together aesthetically and functionally. The sides of the grip are stippled, and the front strap features two finger grooves, which separate the second and third fingers. Another groove descends forward at an angle from the top of the frame and gives the strong-hand thumb a place to rest. The front of the trigger guard is grooved so you can ride that spot with your weak-hand index finger after drawing. The dust cover has an accessory rail for securing a light, laser or other accessory.The Steyr’s bore axis is substantially lower than other popular duty-size handguns. The lower bore axis will provide for faster follow-up shots."

The length of pull, which is the distance from the center of the trigger to the center of the buttpad is only 13"". This makes the gun easier to shoulder, quicker to point, lighter and easier to carry - something that is very appealing to younger people and experienced shooters and hunters alike. It carries all the fine features that have made the Browning Citori the number one selling over and under shotgun in the world. The all-steel deeply blued receiver and barrels, the single selective trigger and hammer ejectors with the famous and easily navigated top-tang barrel selector/safety. These time-proven features may not be readily understood by many shooters, but will play a key role in how the gun works in their hands, and how easily it is operated and shouldered. A recoil pad is fit to the 12 gauge models. This is a very fine choice for the dad who is looking for a more lighter, smaller over/under and certainly ideal for youth and ladies. And, the Browning name fits right in with the family. It has for generations.Specifications and Features:12 gauge 26"" vent rib barrel 3"" chamber Top tange barrel selector/safety Single-selective trigger Hammer ejectors Satin finished American walnut stock Matte blued barrel and receiver Vector Pro lengthened forcing cone Includes 2 Invector-Plus choke tubes: Modified and Improved cylinder Ivory front bead sight Recoil pad Precision cut checkering 41-3/4"" overall length 13"" length of pull 1-5/8"" drop at comb 2-1/2"" drop at heel 5/16"" rib width Weighs 6 pounds 11 ounces*** This shotgun is in good condition with some marks on the finish as shown.

The length of pull, which is the distance from the center of the trigger to the center of the buttpad is only 13"". This makes the gun easier to shoulder, quicker to point, lighter and easier to carry - something that is very appealing to younger people and experienced shooters and hunters alike. It carries all the fine features that have made the Browning Citori the number one selling over and under shotgun in the world. The all-steel deeply blued receiver and barrels, the single selective trigger and hammer ejectors with the famous and easily navigated top-tang barrel selector/safety. These time-proven features may not be readily understood by many shooters, but will play a key role in how the gun works in their hands, and how easily it is operated and shouldered. A recoil pad is fit to the 12 gauge models. This is a very fine choice for the dad who is looking for a more lighter, smaller over/under and certainly ideal for youth and ladies. And, the Browning name fits right in with the family. It has for generations.Specifications and Features:12 gauge 26"" vent rib barrel 3"" chamber Top tange barrel selector/safety Single-selective trigger Hammer ejectors Satin finished American walnut stock Matte blued barrel and receiver Vector Pro lengthened forcing cone Includes 2 Invector-Plus choke tubes: Modified and Improved cylinder Ivory front bead sight Recoil pad Precision cut checkering 41-3/4"" overall length 13"" length of pull 1-5/8"" drop at comb 2-1/2"" drop at heel 5/16"" rib width Weighs 6 pounds 11 ounces*** This shotgun is in good condition with some marks on the finish as shown.

This makes the gun easier to shoulder, quicker to point, lighter and easier to carry - something that is very appealing to younger people and experienced shooters and hunters alike. It carries all the fine features that have made the Browning Citori the number one selling over and under shotgun in the world. The all-steel deeply blued receiver and barrels, the single selective trigger and hammer ejectors with the famous and easily navigated top-tang barrel selector/safety. These time-proven features may not be readily understood by many shooters, but will play a key role in how the gun works in their hands, and how easily it is operated and shouldered. A recoil pad is fit to the 12 gauge models. This is a very fine choice for the dad who is looking for a more lighter, smaller over/under and certainly ideal for youth and ladies.

The officer bought the gun for his wife to carry for her personal protection and she owned it until she was no longer able to handle a gun.The gun was purchased new in 1977 by her dad as best the daughter could remember. She indicated her father took her mom to the gun range when he first bought the gun so she could be comfortable knowing she could use it if the need arose. The daughter said her dad took her mom out a few more times over the early years just to refresh her on shooting the gun, but those times were pretty few and far between.This gun stayed in a dresser drawer with his service revolver until the officer passed away. The mother then began carrying the gun in her purse when she went out and kept it under her pillow when she was home, but it was never fired again. This is the first gun I have ever owned that had makeup on the grips when I bought it!The serial number indicates this gun to be of 1976 vintage. It is a S&W blued steel .38 Special with a 2"" pinned barrel, shrouded hammer, and five shot capacity. The gun is very convenient and easy to carry with its shrouded hammer and is a wonderful shooter. I took it out to the gun range and have put 100 rounds of factory Federal .38 Special (no +P) rounds through it. I was very impressed with both the single and double action trigger pull and accuracy. I can see why these Model 49's with the shrouded hammer were such popular carry conceal weapons by law enforcement officers and are still coveted today. As was the case with many officer owned revolvers back then, this gun had its original grips taken off at initial purchase at an officer-frequented gun shop and were replaced. The officer wanted his wife to be able to hold and shoot the gun comfortably, so it now wears rubber Pachmayr Gripper grips. While the gun has the Pachmayr grips installed, this gun also comes with a set of S&W diamond wood grips. The wood grips are not numbered to the gun and the left grip is darker than the right side grip, but they give the gun its traditional steel and wood look if you prefer that to the steel and rubber grips.  This gun is in good used condition. It was shot just a few times at a gun range by the mother in the early years after it was originally purchased to ensure she knew how it operated, but after that it wasn't fired again until I bought it. The mother carried it in her purse after her husband passed just as she found it when she took it out of the dresser drawer. As a result of having it in her purse there are some scratches and nicks from just moving around against other items in the purse. The most noticeable is on the side of the cylinder that was exposed the most and a bit at the muzzle, but it is just honest wear and not peeling of the bluing. The bore and chambers are nice and clean and it is fully functional and ready to be conceal carried, used as house protection, or as a car or truck gun.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.
