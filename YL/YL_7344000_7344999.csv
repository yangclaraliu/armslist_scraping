I also have a Mitchell O120SVS Vintage Sunburst Acoustic guitar, I paid 250 for last year, its still in great shape. Also, not sure if I really want to trade it yet or not, but I have a super nice Jackson RR3R in Blue, kind of a rare Jackson you don't see them that often it has a reverse headstock and plays really really well and it comes in a Jackson Hardshell custom fitted case, I paid around 700 for it years and years ago, when the came out they were 1150 so it's a pretty high quality guitar. They only made this model for 2 or 3 years in the 90's..... Just let me know if you are interested in any trades, mostly handguns or a rifle maybe, or you can offer cash for one of these if you want them bad enough and don't wanna trade. To give you an example of guns I am interested in right now I have a Kimber Custom II 1911 a Glock 43, a 1928 Russian Mosin Nagant, and a Savage Arms Tactical 12 Gauge.

Sorry to let it go, really was excited to get my hands on this thing but unfortunately no matter how I change my grip, the weapon just doesn't fit me as well as my CZs or my Sigs. The gun shoots beautifully and manages the snappy recoil of the 40 as well or better then the cz it is derived from. I even had installed a Cajun gun works single action only flat trigger trying to improve it, but honestly it's time to let it go to a new home where someone will use it because it is always getting left behind on range days. Looking mostly for cash but if you have an interesting trade I'd be willing to entertain them.Looking for a volquartsen 22/45 complete frame, Ruger 1022 takedown lite, p320, universal m1 Carbine in 256 win mag, etc... It can be weird and pique my interest so if you have something you are looking to get rid of let me know maybe we can make a deal. Also have need of a Glock 17, gen 3. Would like to have with threaded barrel but if you have one you'd like to trade let me know."

Fleur des lis carved stock and formed.  Also has rifle sights.That said, some of the duracoat got into the chamber. The gun fires fine but it causes some shells to stick and not seat all the way.  The duracoat was done by a gunsmith who declined to correct the issue and, frankly, I really never shoot the gun and it's been sitting in a case.  I'm selling it as a ""gunsmith special"" with probably minimal work or would be a fantastic gun to build on. I purchased it lightly used several years ago in the Wingmaster configuration and added the extended tube and a ghost ring rifle sight (which is not included with this shotgun).  The bluing on the original was not to my liking and I had it duracoated by a gunsmith - after which the feeding issue was noted.  Otherwise the gun is in fantastic condition.  There's also a spot on the receiver where a bit of overspray caused a blemish - I tried to get a photo but it's hardly noticeable and I couldn't get a clear shot of it.  I've installed the rare fleur des lis stock set that came with the gun.  I've fired the gun twice since refinishing and cleaned it.  I'll also include the original spring and follower should you want to remove the tube extension and clamp (both factory Remington parts).  If you want it blued or parkerised - I recently learned that Remington and Wilson combat provide those refinishing services and should have looked into it further in the first place. Ive priced it to sell quickly and hassle free.  I have quite a few shotguns and have had plenty of time to fix this one and haven't so I'm selling to accessorize a new carry pistol. Located in Wheeling near Oglebay - happy to meet somewhere closer to Wheeling itself.  Feel free to text me : REDACTED"

I am selling a new DPMS AR-10 that I purchased last year but have never shot. I no longer have the box but the rifle is in original condition other than having oil applied to the bolt. I am not interested in trades as I am trying to buy/build another weapon to add to my collection of older type weapons. I am wanting $680 for the rifle which is a very good price for a new weapon with these rifles currently selling in the stores for over $730 not counting tax and registration..

The original Colt hard case is in excellent condition too, no label or papers just the case but it is the correct case for the Anacondas. The action works like a new gun and the bore is excellent too, no modifications to this gun. It's serial number is MM6526x, made in the mid 1990's, they don't seem to have much information on the Anaconda serial numbers. It's a nice gun not unfired condition but certainly nice enough for most."

This is not a military surplus weapon and was sold commercially in the United States after being imported from Italy to Berben,New York.  The condition on this pistol is like new. The bluing is in great shape and the anodizing is almost as good as when it left the factory. This is a special version of this model it has a ported barrel and better  taller front and rear sites then any other model I have seen in a 92S.  I have the original box with the serial number and the  model number there were very few of these imported literally a handful at the time. It has the traditional six holes on the extended barrel which is only extended slightly. Overall condition is 96%   Comes with two pre-ban magazines flush fitting Beretta lock original box and pistol. It is very hard to find information on this model as it is very rare I am asking  $700 trade $600 cash and I have ordered a set of black wood grips for it checkered the original grips are in excellent condition. This pistol was dated  as one of the final models right as the military  trials started and is from 1982 you will not find another one like it that is from the factory. The grip screws have never been messed with and the gun has been meticulously maintained. REDACTED"

I thought I could get away with it, but it isn't meant to be, I guess. This is the V1 configuration, which is their light LEM trigger. This is a DAO setup, but feels similar to a striker fired gun in operation. Little longer take up, but a nice light (5 lbs?), Crisp trigger. Also gives you the option to restrike if needed, albeit with a longer DA pull. I was very happy with the trigger setup on this gun. No manual safety or decocker. My loss is your gain. Comes with 3 13 round magazines, the box, and all the stuff in the box. Factory luminescent 3 Dot sights (not night sights) - I blacked out the dots in the back with a magic marker. Would probably come off if you want the dots back. Also will have 4 additional mags (BNIB) you can purchase if you like. Will make you a good deal.May consider quality AR upper parts as a partial trade.Face to face sale to somebody who can appreciate this great gun and the great deal (and who is able to legally own a gun and who is not a felon...)"

Cuts it even lower.  Hard to argue with that.I'm not looking to haggle but I will listen to offers.I will negotiate within reason and am likely to sell this to the very 1st person that shows up with cash.I don't know anything about these besides them being a budget pistol and low capacity.It has a magazine safety and a thumb safety and I'm told they have a lifetime warranty.  I am not sure.It's all metal no plastic.If i get $80 I'll throw in a leather storage case and a half box of 380 ammo.I prefer text or email because I don't always have my phone on me and my voicemail seems to never work.So email or text.Maybe you'll get lucky with a call but if I don't pick up just send a text or email and I'll respond.5 2O.  2 72 ,-  O2 20Any time should be fine."
