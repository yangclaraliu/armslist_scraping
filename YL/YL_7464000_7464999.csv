It has been properly torqued and assembled with the correct A2 front sight, but still needs a gas tube, compensator, sling swivel, and forward-assist.The stock is (I believe) a Colt piece, with QD mounts installed. It's been spray-painted green (received it like that), which has been partially cleaned off.ETA: Other than what is in the photo, no other parts are included, and I do not want to split them up.I'm assigning a trade value of about $400 for everything (the barrel alone is about $300)."

It is chambered for the .22LR cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want ‘em.The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!
Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.
