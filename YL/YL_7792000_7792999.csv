Barrel is marked .38"" .767"" and the revolver has many stampings of BNP (British National Party). Cyclinder is marked England and serialized to match the frame. Frame is marked made in USA and has the SW square butt k frame look with the serial numbers on the bottom of the grip. The chamber shows evidence of being rechambered from .38 SW to .38 Spl showing the second ledge inside the chamber.

Ended up never really using the 9mm barrel after I started reloading my .40. I paid 110.00 each for the conversion barrels and 54.00 for the BT Guide Rod.

It uses the internal hammer design which is considered superior to external double hammers since they are prone to failure or mis fire, and sometimes are fake hammers that functon to fire internal hammers.  With internal hammers nothing to snag, break or fail.  It also has shell ejectors that extract the empty shell cases.  The rifle breaks down into 3 small pieces in about 5 seconds. the handgaurd has a lever that when opened allows you to take seperate the handguard, and barrel from the receiver/stock.  The 3 small pieces can fit in a small back pack or case.  you can use it for bug out bag having slugs and various buck shot and bird shot you can hunt or stop anything. you can also get caliber tubes to shoot 9mm, 22, 45 ammunition. The wood is pristine and smooth, no dings or blemishes. it has a short 20' barrel. This is great for cowboy western fans, home protection, truck gun or like i said a very light and conceilable portable rifle or back pack bug out bag gun."

From what I understand, this rifle must have been used during ww1 then put away due to the treaty of Versailles, then when Hitler came to power in 1933, he issued this rifle out to the gestapo (secret police) which collaborated with the waffen SS. Now, I'm not a historian, but I am a war history and gun buff. I could be wrong and if I am, please send me your input. I'm interested in knowing more about this piece of history."
