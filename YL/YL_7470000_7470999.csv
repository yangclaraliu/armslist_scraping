The digital optic system effectively bundles numerous devices and technologies together in a state-of-the-art package that brings confidence and improved accuracy to the shooter at distances of up to 500 yards. Integrated capabilities include:  3-21X Digital Scope   Laser Rangefinder (750 Yard Range) The Most Advanced Ballistic Computer Available Video /Audio Recorder Still Camera (frame capture) Wi-Fi Server  Looking through the Remington 2020 Digital Optic System, the shooter is presented with a Heads-Up Display (HUD) that overlays the information about the ammunition, environment and shot orientation that effect accuracy to the field of view before them. Through a sequence referred to as Tag, Track and React (TTR™), the Remington 2020 Digital Optic System allows the shooter to designate the desired location of a shot (""Tag""). The advanced internal ballistic computer immediately generates a firing solution based on a far greater number of inputs and factors that affect the bullet's flight than other ballistic calculators or tables. The shooter then simply adjusts their point of aim to bring the ballistically corrected reticle on target (""Track"") and take the shot (""React""). Even on targets moving up to 10 mph. Recording and Streaming The system can also broadcast a Wi-Fi signal allowing others to see a streaming live video feed from the HUD via a smartphone (Apple iOS or Andriod) app. For the first time, another person can share what the shooter is seeing and doing wirelessly for more effective coaching, mentoring or guiding. From the time a Tag is placed until a preset time after the shot is taken, this stream can also be recorded, with audio, to internal memory for later downloading and sharing.  The benefits of the Remington 2020 go beyond improved shot placement and the consolidation of gear currently required to perform ballistic calculations. The true benefit lies in the confidence, and enhanced capabilities that this technology provides to the user. All of which encourages a more ethical hunt.Comes with the 2020 Digital Optic System. $2500! Come on down to West Mountain Pawn if you'd like to take a closer look!"

It also has the hybrid cut BCG that allows you to run either Glock mags or Colt style mags with the same upper. It has the Glock mag lower receiver, it will take everything from glock factory mags, magpul mags, and even the cheap glock mags you can buy online. If you wanted to run Colt style mags you would need to get the corresponding lower from PSA. The lower receiver comes with no stock as it is a pistol and not an SBR. It does have a magpul MOE grip. This gun is a lot of fun to shoot, I have ran around 400 rounds through it since I got it this last February. It has not had a single malfunction of any kind. Problem is, I have since moved into town and no longer have a place to go shoot whenever I want and I do not enjoy paying a range to stand inside and shoot paper…So I am looking to fund some other projects now. This gun is really a lot of fun, and you do not see them very often!"

The lower and all parts were bought locally (Eden Prairie) so I know that I paid more than if I shopped it out online, and will lose out on this deal but I really don't have a place to hunt with the .300 and could use the cash. I will require a PTP or PTC and photo ID along with a bill of sale. Price is OBO. No, I won't take $350 so don't insult me. Thanks for looking."

THE BAD: It has a little bit of rust.  The driver side door doesn't line up completely (you have to lift up and shut at the same time, its annoying, but it doesn't affect anything once its shut, and can be fixed by replacing the worn out bushings in the door. Its not an expensive fix. I just haven't had time to get to it.) The AC works, but makes a squeaking noise sometimes (you just have to turn it off & right back on and the squeaking will stop.) It leaks a tiny bit of antifreeze (I just add a little to the overflow once every six weeks or so. It is a really tiny leak.) It was leaking a little bit of oil. I put some of the Lucas Stop leak in it and that seems to have taken care of it. It has 200,000 miles so its pretty normal to leak a tiny bit of oil.  The radio sometimes doesn't work. It has a check engine light on, and it has since I bought it. I had someone check it with one of the computers that you can hook up to the car, but they said the code that was causing it was something small, and not worth worrying about on a vehicle that old, and that was 50,000 miles ago. THE GOOD: I've owned it for the last 50,000 miles. It has always had regular maintenance done on it. It has been really dependable. I've only had to replace the tie rods once and that was it besides normal things like tires and the occasional brake light. I drive it to and from WSU from the west side 4 days a week. I'm only getting rid of it because I got an internship offer for the spring that will require me to commute to Hutchison, and I decided to buy a 4 cylinder car to make the commute. Its not the most glamorous thing in the world, but it will get you from point a to point b, and it is only $1600. Kelly Blue Book prices it at $1600 in fair condition with 203,000 miles on it.
