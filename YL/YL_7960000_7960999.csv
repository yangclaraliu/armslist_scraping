Vol 2 is where both the K-14 and K-15 rifles are dissected and a full report given, including a detailed history. KDF was incorporated in 1970 in Seguin, TX after Bob Kleinguenther convinced Voere in Vohrenenbach, Germany that their rifle model, the Shikar, was not going to be successful and that both he and they should set about designing a new rifle to be marketed by KDF in the U.S. In 1972, the design was approved and sent to production with a model number of K-14 for Kleinguenther project number 14. In Europe, it was referred to as M2145. About 7,000 rifles were produced between 1973 and 1977 with final sales taking place as late as 1978. Robert Kleinguenther's years as a chief designer and engineer for Weatherby are apparent in his designs.These were produced with a 0.5 MOA guarantee from Kleinguenther at a time when Weatherby could only guarantee 1.5MOA. They’re known as the most accurate hunting rifle you could buy. I would rate this rifle as Very Good. The trigger is phenomenal and the action is smoother than a silk scarf gliding over polished marble. 26” barrel with strong, sharp rifling. There is a small amount of typical finish wear at the muzzle and very slight wear on the top of the barrel just forward of the scope. The stock retains its excellent shine, and has a few superficial handling marks that don’t break through the clear coat (which has no bubbling/cracking, very unusual for these guns). Putting it up to test the waters—did a search and couldn’t find one ever posted on NW Firearms for sale.Scope is not included in sale. The rare, highly-praised and period-correct Buehler rings/mounts are included in the sale.$1400 cash FTF. Transfer at Money Market Pawn unless we can agree to another place. Will ship on your dime."

Be sure to put a phone number in your reply and reference the gun by name (P229).  Can meet anywhere off of I-465 but prefer to meet on the SE side.      The price is absolutely firm and I'm NOT interested in trades (I don't want any more guns.)  This is priced a lot lower than it probably should be but I don't have the time to fool with a prolonged sale.

Piston rifles such as this one run much much cleaner than gas tube rifles. They’ll also cycle any ammo you want to use. 200 rounds of cheap steel case ammo through a piston rifle is leaves the bolt and chamber cleaner than 20 rounds of good brass ammo through any other rifle. I’ve been shooting ARs since the mid 80’s, and nothing I’ve shot compares to this one. I’ve never had a hang up or malfunction of any type with any ammo through this rifle. This is NOT a home/custom build rifle! It’s extremely dependable! Has a factory voodoo barrel, magpul grip and hand guard, laser with pressure switch, 45 degree backup iron sights, red/green lighted reticle scope, Rogers super stock, aftermarket oversize charging handle, and single point sling. Also has rifle specific cleaning kit, double rifle padded camo case, about 14 mags, and around 2000 rounds of ammo. Really nice setup! I have well over $2000 in this setup! It’s a steal, considering the ammo and mags cost over $1000 alone!"

I've got something here for you today that you just don't see everyday. Well, unless you live in Bulgaria... then you probably do. For the rest of us, here is a Bulgarian AK-74 right here in Idaho. Well, she is mostly Bulgarian. Got a few good ol' USA parts for compliance. Receiver, barrel, trigger, gas piston and magazine are U.S. made to ensure 922r compliance. It has enough parts that you can use surplus European mags and still be good. This was built from a Bulgarian parts kit and it is all numbers matching... down to the extractor. She also has beautiful wood, surplus sling and a very uniquely patterned bakelite grip to finish her off. Not only that, but she comes with 50 rounds of 7N6 ammo. For those not familiar, that is the steel core, military surplus ammo that is banned from import. Very hard to get as it is not coming into the country at all anymore. This Bulgarian beauty is priced to sell at $825 for the package. Mostly looking for cash, but I may consider a trade + cash deal or even possibly just trade, depending on what'cha got. Thanks for looking!Text 818Five1Two57TwentyThree"

The hand guard is a Samson Star C-EX-P Free Float carbine length rail that wraps around the gas block.The BCG is full auto design, no cut backs in that aspect, the back end of the BCG is wider, with the corners rounded so as to reduce carrier tilt and wear on the buffer tube when it passes the receiver in the tube. The Bolt is marked “M” for magnetic particle inspection.On the inside of the receiver, were the cam pin rotates into the little pocket on the side, Adams Arms rounded off that corner to assist with wear mitigation so the cam pin slides into place instead of wearing that corner down on the receiver wall making for a smother transition when locking and unlocking the bolt into position.The gas block is railed at receiver height, providing for continuous rail down the rifle length, with the adjustment knob at the very end for quick and easy access. This is a very nice quality rifle. $1,000.00 for the whole rifle, or $800 for just the complete upper."

Feeds just fine and fires fine, running successful strings of rounds 5-15 rounds without a FTE but still has them. I have replaced a buffer that made it run better but replaced the extractor spring which is stiffer and now runs less than it did.

Vol 2 is where both the K-14 and K-15 rifles are dissected and a full report given, including a detailed history. KDF was incorporated in 1970 in Seguin, TX after Bob Kleinguenther convinced Voere in Vohrenenbach, Germany that their rifle model, the Shikar, was not going to be successful and that both he and they should set about designing a new rifle to be marketed by KDF in the U.S. In 1972, the design was approved and sent to production with a model number of K-14 for Kleinguenther project number 14. In Europe, it was referred to as M2145. About 7,000 rifles were produced between 1973 and 1977 with final sales taking place as late as 1978. Robert Kleinguenther's years as a chief designer and engineer for Weatherby are apparent in his designs.These were produced with a 0.5 MOA guarantee from Kleinguenther at a time when Weatherby could only guarantee 1.5MOA. They’re known as the most accurate hunting rifle you could buy. I would rate this rifle as Very Good. The trigger is phenomenal and the action is smoother than a silk scarf gliding over polished marble. 26” barrel with strong, sharp rifling. There is a small amount of typical finish wear at the muzzle and very slight wear on the top of the barrel just forward of the scope. The stock retains its excellent shine, and has a few superficial handling marks that don’t break through the clear coat (which has no bubbling/cracking, very unusual for these guns). Putting it up to test the waters—did a search and couldn’t find one ever posted on NW Firearms for sale.Scope is not included in sale. The rare, highly-praised and period-correct Buehler rings/mounts are included in the sale. Happy to send additional photos or take specific shots by request. $1500 cash obo.

This is a really great shooting Mosin Nagant. The action is silky smooth and the bore is more than nice with strong rifling. The target crown was done by a local reputable gun smith. Its very clean. I am meticulous about keeping my rifles clean and this rifle shows it. It averages about 1.5 moa at 100 yrd. With Tulammo steel case with my best group being just under .75 moa. With higher grade factory loads and even PPU ammo it can maintain 1 moa or under no problem if you do your part. The trigger has the upgraded Finish Mosin trigger return spring which takes the creep out of the original trigger. I had a gunsmith polish the trigger and sear for a much crisper trigger pull.
