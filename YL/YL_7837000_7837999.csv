A pre 2010 production Gen 3 would be my first pick but I might consider newer. Excellent to like new condition with matching numbers only and preferably all stock or at least with no permanent modifications. Not really interested in tons of custom extras that don't really enhance function like engraved slide cover plates, just not my thing. For the trade I have a practically new SIG P225-A1 9mm that is the all black model with factory G10 grips, SIGLITE sights and Short Reset Trigger. It comes in the original case with the manual, lock, price and warning tags, wrapping plastic, sticker and 2 8rd mags. Would make a perfect EDC and it feels just like a shrunken Legion but I almost always go with my revolver for carry and I would rather continue putting all the wear on my other older SIGs at the range so this one never gets touched. I would trade for a Glock if you can add some cash and I'm not trying to be greedy or get rich but most Gen 3s and my P225-A1 are not approved in MA and there is quite a price gap between the two new or pre-owned. Let me know what you have and the basic details about it, I wont answer replies that only say ""Got a 22 to trade."". EFA10 transfer. If you can meet local I can be free almost any time or can set something up another day if that doesn't work. All laws will be followed. Thanks."

This provides a tight fit with any standard AR15 upper receiver.- Threaded Takedown Pin Detent Recess - Allows user to easily install the Takedown Pin detent and spring with the use of a 4-40 set screw (no more launching detents across the room).- Increased Magwell Flare - Increased the flare of the magwell to aid in quick and efficient magazine changes.- Marked and milled to accept short-throw safety selectors, but will work with standard selectors as well.Includes:- Stripped M4E1 Lower Receiver- Nylon tipped tensioning set screw- Threaded Bolt Catch Pin""https://aeroprecisionusa.com/m4e1-stripped-lower-receiver-fde-cerakote.html$110 cash only, not looking for any trades at the moment.

One of the Witness’ most distinctive features is the way the slide rides inside the frame, giving the slide a short top-to-bottom profile. Full-length rails on the frame mate tightly with the slide rails—a level of tolerance that lends itself to improved accuracy. The pistol features a long beavertail to protect the web of the shooter’s hand from hammer bite, which can happen with a high grip on some pistols. The rounded Commander-style hammer is blackened steel. There is no decocker, however, and caution should be used when setting the pistol back into double-action mode."
