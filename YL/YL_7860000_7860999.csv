I know the market is down so the price is OBO. But I feel that is a fair price considering what others are selling for and this is even harder to find. Please do your research before messaging me if needed.

Originally this was in a different caliber. I bought a .223 Wylde upper, but had a standard barrel profile, so I could not mount it. I bought a brand new heavy barrel directly from BCA and had it installed and made sure barrel was at proper torque spec. Barrel was brand new until today, when I took it to the range to do a basic function test of 50 rounds. Then took it home and cleaned it. Gun runs fine. It did not have a rear sight on it when I got it, and I am not selling my red dot on it, so it has a cheap Chinese Mbus knock off rear sight. Got me on paper today at 50yds, albiet high and to the right. I would suggest changing the rear sight. Sorry, but it was all I had and figured better than nothing for now. The lower has probably around 400rds run thru it. Comes with manual, sticker, a C Products Defense 10rd magazine. Pick up in Westminster. No trades, selling outright to help fund a new car. By committing to buy, you agree; 1. You are not prohibited from owning a firearm. 2. To show Maryland ID, and sign a bill of sale. Price is $425.00 firm, again picked up in Westminster, as I have limited vehicle use at times."
