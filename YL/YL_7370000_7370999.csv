It loves bulk pack ammo, even Golden Bullets and the lousy Thunderbolts (aka Thunderturds), so no need to pony up for more expensive rimfire ammo as you would with picky rimfire guns. Unlike most AR-22's, the 15-22 does have last round bolt hold open, and it stays open when you eject the mag. I have made some upgrades and am selling the base rifle with one mag and including all the OEM parts with the option of taking some upgrades. As you can see from the upgrades, it's pretty easy to change our parts to match your AR, or give your kid an AR that looks just like Dad's. Even the trigger can be swapped out for your trigger of choice; I was running a Geissele Super 3 Gun trigger and it worked great.The biggest upgrade is swapping out the OEM handguard for a free float handguard, in this case, the Midwest Industries Gen 2 SS 12"" handguard. This handguard is very light, includes handguard, 3 rail sections one of which has a quick disconnect sling socket, and a bipod nut. This upgrade option also includes the Tacticool22 free float handguard converter nut, which is required to mount a free float handguard on the 15-22. It also includes the converter nut wrench. Besides being slick and very comfortable in the hand, this setup allows for easy replacement of the handguard in the future if desired. The handguard will also come with the foliage paracord, which I weaved into the handguard to poke fun at Warsport's 'tactical bungee' on their LVOA rifle.The other optional upgrades are the stock, which is the Magpul STR stock in foliage green, and the grip, which is the BCM Gunfighter Mod 3 in foliage green. The base rifle includes the OEM stock and grip, so even if you opt for an upgrade, you'll also get the OEM parts.1. Base rifle: $2902. 1 + MI Gen 2 SS 12"" handguard, all accessories that come w/ handguard, Tacticool22 converter and wrench: $3503. 2 + Magpul STR stock: $3954. 3 + BCM Gunfighter grip: $405Local pickup, so no shipping or FFL fees. All laws apply. I will need to see your NC drivers license. Simple bill of sale is optional.Armslist limits number of pics and resolution, so email me for better pics, thanks."

Very accurate shooter with quality Lapua, SK, Wolf or Federal match ammo. It does NOT like ELEY for some reason. It will not extract the fired Eley case from the chamber."

The rifle has been cut down,(to 16.5 inches, with a great crowning job, can send pictures) has had a post for a front sight installed. The barrel is a Belguim B stamped barrel, while the date is not stamped on the rifle it was for sure assembled after the war as all B stamped barreled rifles were. The previous owner installed a scope mount, doing this they did a crummy job milling out the rear sight post. The rifle still fires perfectly, will probably work fine if you decide you want to slap a scope on it for deer season. Rifle is in overall good conidition for an old milsurp gun. Bought it to be a project gun, don't have the time. I'm assuming whoever buys this will likely want to try and replace the rear sights. Gun just needs a little tender love and care. 150 for the rifle, most B barrel mosins go for much more, but considering bubba done played with this I think 150 is fair considering your average mosin goes for 200 now. Make it 165 and I will throw in 45 rounds of ammo."

It distills all the proven qualities and design features of the best-selling Para Military 2 into a more compact, scaled-down platform ideal for everyday carry. The Para 3’s full-flat-ground CPM®S30V®stainless steel blade measures exactly three inches, providing plenty of blade for even the toughest cutting chores while making the knife both convenient and legal to carry in most areas. The blade’s signature Trademark Round Hole™ allows quick, positive, one-handed opening with either hand, while its textured index-finger choil and thumb ramp ensure enhanced control during precise cutting tasks. Slim and pocket friendly, its lightweight, open-backed handle features stainless steel liners nested into machined recesses in the textured G-10 scales. This minimizes handle thickness and provides excellent structural support for the knife’s high-strength Compression Lock™ mechanism. A four-position hourglass clip and an oversized lined lanyard hole complete the design, offering ambidextrous tip-up or tip-down carry and allowing the easy attachment of fobs and lanyards.

Well, it's a heck of firearm that does function wonderfully and performs its duty with no issue whatsoever. This handgun has had 1000 rounds through it, so it's just now broken in. It has been meticulously kept and comes with all original paperwork and the case. It also comes with 2 extra 10 round mags on top of the 9 round stock magazine.

Looking to fund another project, so not looking for trades at this time. I'd rather do face to face to avoid shipping the ammo, but I'm willing to entertain it if the price is right. Buyer would pay for shipping on all items in that event. The gun is in great shape, but there are some MINOR dings in the wood from being in the safe with other rifles. The pictures were taken with the flash on in order to high light the marks on the wood. This makes them appear worse than they actually are, but I would rather be completely honest than ignore the blemishes on the rifle. The wood on this rifle is excellent and it comes with a hammer spur for cocking while scoped. Unfortunately, this rifle was sold to me with surface rust on the barrel by the front sight. I've cleaned it up, but there is minor pitting. It can be restored if you have the skills or the desire to send it off, but it is there. It does NOT affect the accuracy of the rifle. Just like the dings in the wood, this is photographed in the harshest light possible. This makes it look worse than it is, but I'd rather be brutally honest in this than gloss over it or hide like the original owner did with me. Armslist will only allow me to post one picture of the rifle. Please contact me for additional pictures.Rifle includes: 15 Rds Winchester 44 Special 200 Gr Silver tip 45 Rds American Eagle 240 Gr JHP 45 Rds Remington UMC 180 Gr JSP 45 Rds Federal 240 Gr JHP 20 Rds Barnes Vortex 225 Gr XPB HP 50 Rds 44 Special cast reloads"

Arms .31 Maynard primer revolver. It is one of one thousand produced with serial number 598. The primer door is marked ""Maynard's Patent/Sep. 22,1845"" and the top strap is marked ""Mass. Arms Co./ Chikopee Falls."" The function is fine and the hand turn cylinder (to beat Colt's self revolving cylinder patent) Is good. Door opens smoothly and the accessories are lovely. The Flask is very good with the Mass. Arms embossing and the mold is also good and stamped mass. Arms. The cartridge packets are repros of an original made expressly for Mass Arms, very cool and there are even a few rolls of original Maynard primers in there. The case is very nice walnut but not of the period. Now the good part. I believe this one to be one of a 200 gun shipment to Ron Brown before the Civil War. I have researched this gun for a short time (one pot of coffee on a Minnesota winter Sunday afternoon) and found on the internet a letter (copy included)from Geo. L. Stearns to Brown offering to act as an agent in procuring the 200 pistols and confirming a price of $6.50 each, another letter (copy included) from John Brown to his supporter W.H.D. Collender, telling Collender how he intends to pay for the order and adding ""I am on my way west."" There is a copy of the letter from Stearns (see above) to the Mass. Arms Co. finally ordering the 200 pistols at $6.50 each to include powder flasks, bullet molds and extra mainsprings, such order to be forwarded to John Brown in Iowa City, Iowa by mail! I bought this gun at a gun show ten years ago that is on the Iowa Nebraska Minnesota border so it comes from the neighborhood of the 1856 shipment, or maybe later from Kansas just one state away. I have other letters and info that comes with this one and you will find several leads stamped on the letter copies from the museums. Please understand that I do not have a serial number match or anything that proves John Brown bought this but after looking through the minutes of his groups meetings (all on file at the University of VA and Kansas State Historical Society) and finding it so near to where he raised hell you can probably prove it as there are documents everywhere on the internet but it will take some research. I also have a copy of an article published in ""The Rampant Colt"" (Fall 2007) magazine about this particular gun being one of the competitors sneaking around the Colt's Patent."

The birds on the left appear to be Chucker and the right Dove. The birds are Gold sculpted inlays with a barn / homestead in the background surrounded by fields. The borders are gold inlay. The serial number is on the underside of the receiver in Gold. The left side of the barrel is marked “WINCHESTER / TRADE MARK / MADE IN U.S.A. /----MODEL 42---410----3IN CHAM--- / -------WINCHESTER PROOF STEEL------“. The barrel is marked “SKEET” and with the matching serial number to the receiver in Gold. Barrel Length: 26” Choke: Skeet Sights / Optics: This shotgun is mounted with a bead at the muzzle on a ventilated rib Stock Configuration & Condition: The stocks are high grain darkwood with hand checkering. The fit at the receiver is evenly proud. The stock has a polished finish, and there are some dry spots and light scratches from cleaning and buffing. In our opinion, for a used gun, most would not even mention these minor flaws. There are no chips or cracks to the stock. The LOP measures 14.25” from the front of the trigger to the back of the Winchester buttplate. The high grade wood was mated with the factory butt plate well. The stocks rate in about Excellent overall condition. Type of Finish: Blue, Gold, and in the white (It almost appears like a French Grey) Finish Originality: The gun has been refinished (obviously) from the 1954 shotgun. Original since engraving 2015 Bore Condition: The bore is bright. There is NO erosion. Overall Condition: This shotgun retains about 98% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows normal operational wear from cycling the action, assembly and disassembly. The gun is not a Safe queen 100% never touched Virgin. This gun was taken to the range, enjoyed, and well cared for. There is no indication of slamming the butt or muzzle in racks or deformations to the rib. The gun has good honest wear from a responsible shooter. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. Overall, this shotgun rates in about Excellent condition, we are not discounting for operational wear. Mechanics: The action functions correctly. We have not fired this shotgun. As with all used firearms, a thorough cleaning may be necessary to meet your maintenance standards. Box, Paperwork & Accessories: Included is a Certificate of Authenticity signed by Angelo Bee verifying the serial number and model engraved. The gun is housed in a beautiful Pro Gun Custom Case. Bill’s card inside just in case you need him. Also thrown in is the instructions to change the combo locks on the front still set to the default “000”. The gold colored accents to the case with the purple liner makes for a beautiful overall presentation. Our Assessment: We are so glad to have had the opportunity to handle such a fine Master Engraved shotgun. The detail is top notch, almost feels like looking at a painting made of cut metal and Gold. There is something truly beautiful in the contrast of fine lines and detail on such a hard surface that we cannot describe. We hope the pictures do it justice. The gun has been used, but not abused. It has been well cared for and handled VERY lightly. There are no wedding ring dings to the forend or rack rash that we can see. This gun is too beautiful not to enjoy, we hope it finds a new home in the hands of a Sportsman. CA Legal or CA Private Party Transferable: This shotgun can be transferred in California."

882,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7370882,For Sale:  Colt 1861 Navy .36 Cal. - 4 Digit # - Unusual Grip,"Clevaland, Cleveland, Ohio","$ 1,300","Listed On: Monday, September 25, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is the much rarer Model 1861 Colt Navy revolver. Made in a smaller size for the Navy, with the caliber reduced to .36"". The Colt Model 1861 Navy cap & ball .36-caliber revolver was a six-shot, single-action percussion weapon produced by Colt's Manufacturing Company from 1861 until 1873. It incorporated the ""creeping"" or ratchet loading lever and round barrel of the .44-caliber Army Model of 1860 but had a barrel one half inch shorter, at 7.5 inches. Total production was 38,000 revolvers. This Colt has a four digit serial number 22XX, and was produced very close to the start of the production run of 1861 or 1862. The serial number is on the frame, trigger guard, cylinder and even the wedge.The cylinder has some of the original battle scene still evident. Usually the scroll is completely gone, especially for such an early piece. Pretty nice.The action is rather good, and the cylinder does a complete turn when the hammer is retracted. The hammer locks into position, and fires as it should. The original trigger was missing when I got it, so I had a gunsmith put in a reproduction. He even case hardened it just like the originals were made! If I didn't tell you, you wouldn't have known...The barrel still retains the Colt name and address. The bore is rather nice with solid lands and grooves. There is some slight brown surface oxidation marks, but really on the light side. Overall it has a nice gray appearance, with some minimal blue under the loading lever.The loading lever is nice, and retains some light blue. It operates nice and tight, and the plunger inserts into the cylinder properly.The wedge is original, and has the same serial number 2XX. The spring is a replacement, and needs the screw to hold it in place. The side screw for the wedge is missing, and a replacement is needed.The most unusual and intriguing characteristic of this revolver is the handles. When I first looked at it we thought it was from a Remington. Or maybe from a Confederate revolver. Or maybe Manhattan? We matched them up to every revolver we knew of, and it did not match any of them. I took them off and they are a perfect set of production brass castings, not something a blacksmith or gunsmith made. They match up to all of the surfaces and screws perfectly. It is like they were an aftermarket or Colt experimental set of grips and frame. The wood had a small sliver out of them, which the gunsmith fixed. They are very intriguing, and are certainly 100+ years old. Patina and wear matches all the way around. If someone wanted to fake them, they would have just used a current repro set... The grips are secured to the brass frame with a Remington style center pin. See the pictures for details. If you have any information on this alteration, please let me know!With this low serial number, this revolver certainly saw its fair share of action during the Civil War. Really a neat revolver, with an interesting grip variance."

Only the Sharps and multi-shot Spencer Cavalry Carbines were issued in larger numbers. The Burnside Carbine was invented by Ambrose E. Burnside, who was the Treasurer of the Bristol Firearms Company before the Civil War. Burnside's pre-war financial difficulties caused him to sell his interest in the company in June 1859.Eventually the Bristol Firearms Company became the Burnside Rifle Company but Burnside had no financial interest in, or control over, this company when the Civil War began. As a result, Burnside never personally profited from the large number of weapons purchased during the war. Burnside did, however, see to that cavalry units under his command were armed with carbines of his design during the war. Ambrose Burnside became a major general during the Civil War and was the ineffectual commander of the Union Army of the Potomac at Fredericksburg before being demoted to commander of the Union IX Corps, which he led for the remainder of the war without distinction.The Burnside Carbine underwent several design modifications during its production life. The First Model, which was made by the Bristol Firearms Company in Bristol, Rhode Island, was a .54 caliber percussion, breech loading carbine with a tap primer system that was integrated into the frame. The First Model did not have a forend stock and only about 300 were manufactured before the Civil War began. The Second Model Burnside was also made by the Bristol Firearms Company and is principally different than the First Model by the elimination of the tape primer system and incorporation of the traditional cap primer system. Approximately 2,000 Second Models were produced from 1860-1862.The Third Model was manufactured by the Bristol Firearms Company and differs from the Second Model by the addition of a wooden forend and a different style hammer. Approximately 1,500 Third Model Carbines were manufactured, all in 1862.The introduction of a new hinged breech action, which prevented the breech block from falling too low beneath the frame during reloading (it sometimes traveled so low that it became disengaged from the frame entirely), created the Fourth Model. There has been much confusion about the Fourth Model Burnside Carbine with some sources in recent years stating that the Fourth Model should be broken down into a Fourth and Fifth Model. The Fourth Model had a double-jointed breech action and hinge bolt making it easier for troopers to load and extract cartridges. The final or ""Fifth Model,"" was made by adding a screw-pin in the right side of the frame to improve the functioning of the carbine. The Ordnance Department during the Civil War referred to the Fourth and ""Fifth"" Models as the Model 1863 Burnside Carbine and would purchase over 50,000 by war's end. Adding more confusion to the proper nomenclature of Fourth/Fifth Model 1863 Burnside Carbines is the fact that the production run from 1863 to 1865, approximately 43,000 carbines, are all marked on the receiver “MODEL OF 1864.”This Model 1863 Burnside Carbine is serial number 27384, and is in NRA Antique Very Fine Condition. The Stock is the original black walnut and retains its original finish. On the left stock flat, just to the rear of the frame, are two original cartouches. The first is a rectangle with the script initials “DPS,” which is probably the initials of Ordnance Inspector Daniel P. Strong. The second is a rounded end cartouche with script initials “GC,” which is probably the initials of Ordnance Inspector George Curtis. Both cartouches are still crisp. There are several very small dings and scratches from storage but there are no cracks observed. On the bottom of the butt is the original and very fine condition sling swivel assembly. Although there is a cavalry sling bar and ring, Burnside Carbines from this period also had a sling swivel assembly. Period photographs of Union cavalrymen carrying Burnside Carbines show that the lower sling swivel was often used with the other end attached to the barrel by a loop of leather. The assembly has a serif “C” inspection stamp. Both original convex-head screws retain 99% of their original bright blue finish with no marring of the slot. The swivel is also present and exhibits a plum and pewter patina and it moves freely.The original butt plate is present and exhibits a very smooth pewter and plum patina. The tang has the original serif “S” inspection stamp above the screw hole. The convex, single slot butt plate screw is present and retains all of its original blued finish and the slot is unmarred. The convex, single slot tang screw is also present and the slot is unmarred.The original Forend, also of black walnut, has also has very minor dings and small scratches from storage but there are no cracks or chips noted. On the bottom of the forend, just forward of the frame, is the stamp “H.D.H.,” which are the inspection initials of Ordnance sub-inspector Henry D. Hastings. The forend screw is the correct convex, single-slot screw, which is unmarred and it retains 95% of its original bright blue finish. The barrel band retaining spring on the bottom of the forend is present and it retains 95% of its original bright blue finish. The rear end of the spring has the serif “C” inspection stamp. The Barrel Band exhibits a very smooth pewter patina.The right side lockplate to the rear of the Hammer is marked ""BURNSIDE RIFLE Co./PROVIDENCE=R.I.,"" all still crisply stamped. The Lockplate has a pewter and plum finish. There is a serif “C” inspection stamp to the rear of the lockplate. The Receiver or Frame shows areas of original case colors on both sides and the top. The top front of the Receiver is marked ""BURNSIDE PATENT/MARCH 25TH 1856,"" which was the stamp used up through 1863 when the patent date was changed to “MODEL OF 1864.” Below the patent date is the serial number “27394.”The Breechblock has the matching serial number “27384” and is in very fine condition. It exhibits 98% plus of its original, bright blue finish with only minor scratches on the top surface. The left side of the breechblock has the crisp serif “S” inspection stamp. The Breech itself is very clean and appears to be unfired. The Bottom of the Breech Block has a crisp serif “G” inspection stamp. The Nipple Block is also in very fine condition and exhibits 98% of the original bright blue finish. The left side of the Nipple Block has the crisp serif “S” inspection stamp. The rear surface of the Nipple Block Spring and Plunger is unmarred and retains the vast majority of its original blued finish.

The Nipple Block Plunger Retaining Screw retains virtually all of its original bright blue finish and the single slot is unmarred.The Breechblock Link retains 90% of its original bright blue finish with friction wear from riding into the receiver. The Breechblock Link Screw retains 90% of the original bright blue finish and the slot is unmarred. The Takedown Lever retains the majority of its original blued finish with wear noted on the sharp edges. The outer edge of the Takedown Lever has a crisp serif “S” inspection stamp. The Takedown Lever detent retains the majority of its original blued finish and the spring remains strong.The Finger Lever retains 95% plus of the original, bright blue finish with wear noted on the outer, rounded surface from storage. The Main Lever Retaining Screw retains the vast majority of its original bright blue finish and the slot is unmarred. The bottom of the Finger Lever has a serif “H” inpection stamp. The Lever Catch exhibits generous traces of the original color case hardened finish and there is a crisp serif “C” inspection stamp on the left side. The visible portions of the Lever Latch Spring still exhibit bright fire blue finish. The Finger Lever Latch Lock still exhibits considerable case hardened finish and it has a crisp serif “C” inspection stamp on the left side.The left side of the receiver has the original serif “H” inspection stamp. The left side of the Receiver also has the original Cavalry Sling Bar that is perfectly straight and unbent. The original Sling Bar Ring is also present. The rear bar flange has a serif “G” inspection stamp. The bar screw retains 98% of its original fire blue finish and the slot is unmarred. The Cam Screw on the right side exhibits a pewter patina and the slot is unmarred.The original Hammer shows some original case colors and has the cross-hatched thumb piece. The right side of the Hammer has the serif “W” inspection stamp. The original dome-head, single-slot Hammer Screw is present and is unmarred. The Hammer Spring is still strong. The strike face of the Hammer exhibits the original color case finish and there is no evidence of the carbine having fired a percussion cap.The Trigger Plate exhibits strong remnants of color case hardened finish. The Trigger is largely in the white with some plum staining on the front face. The Trigger Plate Screw retains all of its original bright blue finish and the slot is unmarred. The rear of the Trigger Plate has a crisp serif “H” inspection stamp. The Upper Tang exhibits a plum and pewter patina. The Upper Tang Screw, Front Tang Screw and Rear Tang Screw all retain virtually all of their original bright blue finish and all three slots are unmarred. The rear of the Upper Tang has a crisp serif “H” inspection stamp.The Trigger itself exhibits is now largely a plum patina. The end of the Trigger Guard Plate has a serif “C” inspection stamp. The interior portions of the breech assembly still show areas of original blue finish. The seal at the breech end of the barrel is present. The breech assembly, to include the locking bar, has the original serif assembler's marks “H.” The original nipple is present and exhibits a plum patina with the presence of old corrosion. The nipple is not obstructed with a clear passage all the way to the breech cavity. The Breech Cavity itself is very clean. The entire mechanism still works perfectly and is tight in battery.The Barrel exhibits a mixed pewter and brown patina from age but it is very clean on the outer surface. The bore is in very fine, unfired condition with a mirror finish and crisp rifling the entire length of the barrel. The top of the barrel, just forward of the receiver, has the serif “H” inspection stamp. Just offset to the right is a slightly larger serif “P” proof stamp. The top of the barrel also has the “CAST=STEEL” stamp. The breech end of the barrel is in very fine condition and the breech seal remains in the white with absolutely no wear from firing noted.The original front sight is present and is correctly brazed to the barrel. The Adjustable Rear Sight is in very fine condition and retains the vast majority of its original blued finish. The Leaf has a 100 yard ""V"" notch when the leaf is down and in the up position there is a 300 yard large aperture with ""V"" notch and a ""V"" notch at the top for 500 yards. The original single-slot rear sight screw is present. The right side of the rear sight base has a serif “C” inspection stamp.This Burnside Cavalry Carbine functions perfectly. Given the condition of the original fire bluing present as well as the mint, unfired condition of the barrel, breech block, breech and breech seal, it appears as if this weapon was never even issued during the Civil War.This Carbine is an antique so it can be shipped to anyone. This carbine will come shipped in a new Plano rifle hard case and will also come with a historical writeup and a CD of all photos in the listing.
