Shoots a jet of burning diesel fuel 50 to 60 feet at full pressure. Pressure is provided by a CO2 tank and regulated to a max of 120 psi. I have only done 1 full on test with it but it performed quite well (see picture, a screenshot from the video of the test).Pros: it works, it is simple, CO2 and diesel are easy to get, it uses ALICE pack shoulder and back straps and was built using dimensions of the ALICE pack frame. Fairly rugged and very easy to use.Cons: it is big, bulky, ugly, and heavy. I think with 4 gallons of diesel in the fuel tank it weighs on the order of 75 lbs. Also some of the welds on the frame are not perfectly square because I built this as a hobby project and did not have access to a welding table. It is rock solid though.I would like to get 250 for it because it cost more than that to build but I will take offers. Cash is preferred but will take trades with a minimum value of 300 dollars.Respond to this post via email to get in touch with me, or text to 71 nine 359 1 six 25Ps.

This particular rifle dates to 1944 if my memory serves, based on the serial number. It has a heavy barrel and a thick full sized stock. These were used by the military as indoor training rifles and were sized to feel and weigh in like a full size rifle. It has the original correct sights, and an original magazine. A leather sling is included but is not original though it is period correct. The only thing I have done to this rifle is add a reproduction sight good since they are always missing. This is gun is in probably 98% condition. One or two small dings from the last 70 years. One or two small marks in the bluing. Overall absolutely beautiful and amazing condition. This rifle shoots great and is very accurate. I will include a gun sock. $350. Located in Reno."

In fact, our commitment is so strong, that we have put together the only GuaranteeD® Lifetime Replacement Warranty available in the firearms industry. It works like this...... If anything ever goes wrong with any gun you buy with the Davidson's GuaranteeD® Lifetime Replacement Warranty, it will be replaced. If no replacement is available, it will be repaired at no charge to you. Simple, just return it to the GuaranteeD® retailer where you purchased it, pay for the return shipping and upon receipt Davidson's will ship the returning retailer a *BRAND NEW GUN. See the warranty details below. So make sure every firearm you purchase works for you. Ask for the GuaranteeD® Lifetime Replacement Warranty.  Limited Warranty Limited Warranty Terms and Conditions Davidson’s, Inc. (“Davidson’s”) warrants to you that if any firearm sold by Davidson’s ever becomes defective, Davidson’s will replace the firearm at no charge, subject to the conditions set forth below. This warranty applies only if Davidson’s sold the firearm to the licensed firearms dealer from which you purchased it and the warranty extends only to the original purchaser from that dealer. This warranty applies only to firearms that are not regulated by The National Firearms Act of 1934, its amendments and rulings. This warranty does not cover any other type of merchandise. In order to be eligible for warranty coverage, within 30 days from date of purchase the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online at www.galleryofguns.com. If Davidson’s determines that your firearm satisfies the conditions for warranty coverage under this limited warranty, Davidson’s will, at no charge, replace the firearm with the same model. If no replacement is available, Davidson’s will repair the firearm if the firearm can be repaired, as determined by Davidson’s in its sole discretion. If the no replacement is available and Davidson’s determines that the firearm cannot be repaired, Davidson’s will replace your nonperforming or defective firearm with a firearm that, in Davidson sole determination, is substantially similar to the your firearm. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the firearm as originally sold by us, but does not extend to any firearm that is altered or rebuilt after original purchase, damaged through abuse, misuse or lack of proper care and maintenance, or used other than for its legal intended purposes. To obtain performance under this warranty, you must return the nonperforming or defective firearm to the licensed firearms dealer from which you purchased and pay the cost of shipping the product to Davidson's. TO AVOID VIOLATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS, DO NOT SHIP THE FIREARM DIRECTLY TO DAVIDSON’S. If the dealer is no longer in business, you may contact us directly at Davidson's, Inc., 2625 Stearman Road, Prescott, Arizona 86301, REDACTED, to arrange for you to deliver the firearm to another licensed firearms dealer. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO A FIREARM SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE FIREARM AS DESCRIBED IN THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY SHALL BE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO A NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE FIREARM, AND. DAVIDSON’S WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR DIMUNITION IN VALUE DUE TO REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT WITH A DIFFERENT FIREARM. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. *BRAND NEW GUN: If no replacement is available and your firearm can be repaired, we will send your firearm to the factory or an authorized warranty station for repair. Some manufacturers run up to 120 days in processing repairs.  ◊"

(notches cut in both sides, from the factory)   I purchased these new from 44mag.com, in year 2014.  I have been the only owner since then.  Since then, they have been nested together in an ammo can, doing nothing. I purchased these back when I was convinced that somebody who wanted to trample fun and freedom was going to get elected for 2017 and my few favorite toys were going to become very challenging to get supplies for. Whoops, more battle rattle sitting around than I actually have use for now.Let my mistake be your gain.Condition: ""like new"" to ""new in plastic"". Caveat: as likely discernible in my photos, there are some spots of wear/abrasion to the thin plastic packaging from shipping and storage Full Disclosure:I believe these to be the generation/model that do NOT have steel-reinforced feed lips.As is visible in the photo with 11 magazines, at least one of these has shipping and storage wear on the plastic packaging (nicks, scrapes, pinch-marks in the plastic bag). I am not selling any ammunition pictured here. Nor is the dollar bill in the photos for sale nor rebate purposes.  It is there for size reference only. I'll sell these for 28 per magazine. I'll exchange for cash, and cash only.   No personal identification necessary for this item - that'd be weird.  I will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Merrimack Police Department in Merrimack, NH. 
I will not sell firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms right to an individual (i.e., bypassing the FFL).Again, please do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.  
The Ugly Part:If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order.   If purchasing a firearm, buyer agrees that I (seller) cannot and should not be able to monitor the use of the firearm anymore (it will no longer be my possession, my responsibility, or any of my business for that matter)."

The original owner was an old friend of the family who collected, but rarely shot the guns that he had. This has been used maybe 3-4 times at the range, 50 or so rounds in total. I bought it about five years ago because he was selling off his collection, but I have never fired it. He had a Simmons Whitetail Classic 3.5-10x40 scope professionally mounted and zeroed. The scope model number is WTC23. The rifle includes a total of five Sako brand magazines. Three are standard 5-round magazines and two are 10-round magazines. I also have the original boxes for both the rifle and the scope. The gun has two brush marks on the wood, and would otherwise be in perfect condition. I can send photos of that and more as requested.We can arrange to meet at a local gun dealer if you want to examine the rifle. If you buy long-distance, then you must arrange and pay for shipping, plus transfer fee. Note that I don't check email every minute so please don't send requests to meet ""tomorrow"", as it's usually already tomorrow before I read the email.Thanks!"

$15 per magazine.  
I took more pictures than the 3 I am able to post on Armslist with my free account.  If you want more pics, please let me know and I can email them.Full Disclosure:  The reddish/pinkish line down the side of one of them is red paint pen.  Some of the baseplates have red paint pen on them, now leaving the ruger logo kind of pinkish on those ones.  (needed to mark some of them so my range-buddies wouldn't mix them up in their range bags during clean up time) I have recently done a thorough, detailing clean of these, and each magazine has only been reloaded and fired twice since the cleaning. - They are running flawlessly with crappy, non-plated, raw-lead projectile, bulk value pack .22LR.  Me likey!!There is no ammunition nor firearms for sale here.  Just magazines.  No Identification necessary for this item - that'd be weird.I'll exchange for cash, and cash only, at the ""craigslist parking spots"" at Merrimack Police Department, in Merrimack, NH.Again, my price is $15 per magazine.
I will not sell firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms right to an individual (i.e., bypassing the FFL).Please do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.

The Accu-Bushing system holds the barrel with much more precision, enabling us to cut group sizes nearly in half. This particular pistol is fitted with the CZ Custom Shop Barrel as well! In testing, the pistols returned groups substantially less than 3"" at 50 yards (using Fiocci 124 JHP). Add to that a full complement of custom work including competition hammer, lighter springs (11 lb. recoil, 13 lb. main), thin black aluminum grips, stainless steel guide rod and polished internals.A short-reset disconnector is used to greatly reduce trigger reset between shots, making this SA/DA trigger reset like a nicely-tuned single-action only trigger. The Accu-Shadow is topped with a fiber optic front and HAJO serrated target rear (adjustable for height, also drift adjustable for windage).Short of a full custom pistol, it’d be difficult to find greater out-of-the-box accuracy than the Accu-Shadow can deliver.

Most men worry about the size of their penis at some point in their lives. And most do come to terms with what they’ve got. But for some men, the anxiety about size continues to grow until it becomes a serious disability, impacting on their sexuality, relationships and their perception of themselves as men.
Unfortunately, whenever it’s recognized that people feel insecure about an aspect of themselves, such as their appearance or sexuality, there will be unscrupulous types who’ll try to turn it into a money-making opportunity. This is why ads for miracle ‘cures’ for the small penis abound – on the internet, in magazines, in your inbox – not because they work, but because the advertisers know that millions of men hope these claims just might be true+27788145199
