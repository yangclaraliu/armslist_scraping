The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine, and a low capacity-compliant version is available with two 10 round magazines. With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.

But I'm no means an expert on them.  This gun has been laying around wrapped in an oily rag by my family for years.   The hammer is missing so I have no idea if it'll work.   The cylinder does turn and will rotate when you pull the trigger.   Ejection star seems to work ok.   Not sure what all is missing on this one, so you're buying it as is.    The Colt has had rust once upon a time, years ago, there is pitting on it.  But most of the finish is the old brownish oily finish you see on these things.  Stamped Colt D A 41 on the barrel and some writing on the top of the barrel that I can't make out.  Asking $200 for the old Colt.The second is an old High Standard Longhorn.  This one has a LONG barrel on it and is like the High Standard Double Nine revolvers, it's made to look like a single action but actually is a double action.   This one has been in a box of parts in the family again for years.   I have no idea if all the parts are there or not but it does look like the major ones are.    I do see two hammers in the box and there is a small bag of screws and pins I got a gunshow years ago that goes along with it.     This one has both .22 LR and .22 Magnum cylinders and also comes with an old leather holster as seen.    The finish on the Long Horn is in ok shape, there are some scratches and a couple of spots on the tip of the barrel where rust started to take hold years ago, but otherwise its in ok shape.   Asking $150 for the High Standard.Would also trade for whatever, just let me know what  you have.I'm located in Richmond off of 99 Grand Parkway and can meet you in this area nights and weekends and meet you in Sugar Land week days.Text or call if interested or if more questions and I'll do my best to answer them, I also have more pics I can send.   Eight three 2 6OO 3O07Please no texts or calls after 9:00 pm or prior to 7:00 am.

Its specifications are very similar to the M1938, with the unique addition of a permanently affixed, side-folding cruciform-spike bayonet. A groove for the folded bayonet is inlet into the right side of the stock. These were in use not only by the Soviet Union, but also its various sstellite nations.

Fun rifle to shoot, just dont get out enough. Less than 500 rounds through it in 5 years. This is  a bolt rifle that is capable of shooting both the 223 or 5.56 cartridge. It will accept a standard AR style magazine. Have never had a problem with the rifle. Comes with a Center Point scope,  sling and a bipod. The Mossberg MVP FLEX Bolt-Action Tactical Rifles bring the FLEX TLS™ (Tool-less Locking System) to its family of MVP Series Bolt Actions. Chambered in 5.56mm NATO (223 Rem.) and 7.62mm NATO (.308 Win.). The FLEX TLS allows removal and remounting the rifle's stock without tools in seconds. These rifles deliver a bolt-action engineering breakthrough with the MVP's patent-pending Drop-Push bolt, designed to accept and reliably feed from AR-style magazines. Adding to the rifle's precision performance is the patented Mossberg (Lightning Bolt Action) LBA™ Adjustable Trigger System, which is user-adjustable from 2 to 7 lbs. Even at the lightest adjustment setting, the unique lightning bolt trigger blade blocks the sear from releasing the striker unless the blade is fully depressed. Other standard features on the MVP FLEX Rifles include fluted, button-rifled barrels with a FLEX six-position tactical stock, durable matte-blued finish on exposed metalwork, receiver-mounted Picatinny rails, distinctive spiral-fluted bolts, front and rear sling swivel studs and 10-round capacity magazines. Rifle stocks and recoil pads are adjustable to fit individual shooters. Standard FLEX stocks also allow for interchangeability of recoil pads with a simple TLS connection and choice of small (3/4""), medium (1-3/4"") or large (1-1/2"")FLEX accessory recoil pads."
