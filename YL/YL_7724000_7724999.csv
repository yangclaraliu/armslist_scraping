I send them to manufacturer for re-calibration about 1x every 2 years. I do not tighten anything to ‘tight enough’, if there is a torque spec I will tighten to that.I use the proper sized drift and roll pin punches.If I do not have the proper tool I will order a new one. I do not use the wrong tool for a job.Before any work is done, I list out the steps after consulting 3x armorer’s manuals and any manufacturers documentation before starting the work. If there are no manufacturer documents, I will contact them directly and get the information I need before I start the work.
For any repairs, contact me with a detailed description of the problem and how often it occurs.For maintenance schedules and tune-ups, it is best if you can provide a round count.First time buyers, I can provide general ar15 information, suggest brands, places to shoot and places to train.  The most important purchase a first time buyer can make is training.
Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  I have a lot of resources available that I can leverage.Rail systems I have experience with:Samson (evo)Daniel Defense (RIS, MFR, Keymod)BCM (keymod)Brands I have experience with:ColtBCMDaniel DefenseAdams ArmsBushmasterSpikes TacticalPalmetto State ArmorySome interesting information:I've been getting many Palmetto State Armory Freedom uppers, though the problems have been minor to fix (4x broken firing pin retainer pins, 1 charging handle latch, 1x buffer retainer popped loose, and others).  Firing pin retainer pins are breaking in cold weather, and other small parts seem to be breaking at around 3K-4K rounds (heat treating issue maybe).  I have not seen any cracked bolts, carrier or barrel problems.  They are over gassed but seem to run well with brass cased ammo (i don't have any data with steel cased ammo).I've gotten 2x Adams Arms uppers with a seized barrel nut. Adams Arms makes a fine product, but if you need work done on a handguard and barrel make sure it is handled properly and the proper high temperature moly paste is applied to the threads before tightening down the barrel nut."

The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate, and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built-in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other Glock pistols.

The Glock Modular Optic System (MOS) simplifies the mounting of popular optics without costly custom-machining of the pistol’s slide.
