Mostly reloads or factory ball ammo. It is missing a grip screw which does not impede function at all. If that’s a huge deal breaker for you I’ll order a set. The factory recoil spring wore out and I had to purchase a aftermarket spring kit for this gun so the gun will come with a few different springs including a couple different weighted recoil springs. I kept this gun very clean and it has the usual concealed carry ware on it (where the barrel and slide meet, barrel hood, feed ramp etc.) but the gun is extremely reliable and a straight shooter. Don’t be afraid to ask questions pI’m really looking to trade this for something listed below. Cash offers aren’t off the table but highly unlikely I’ll say yes."

This provides flatter, clearer night vision images. The COREplatform offers ‘best in class’ resolution with up to 70 lp/mm, and increased photocathode sensitivity levels of upwards of 400µm/lm, providing image quality that rivals that of high-end Gen 2 image tubes, even in challenging ambient light conditions. The body of the unit is made from solid aluminum; the O-ring is sealed and rubber coated for further protection. Like all Armasight scopes, the Vampire is nitrogen-treated and comes complete with batteries, a soft carrying case, a user manual, and all necessary hardware for solid mounting to a standard 7/8” Picatinny or Weaver-style rail. The Vampire has multicoated all-glass lenses and a manually-adjustable fine reticle that makes precise shot placement incredibly easy. This Night Vision riflescope is also water, dust, and sand-proof for increased reliability. Complete with tactical rails for lasers or illuminators (the high-power IR illuminator is included standard), the Armasight Vampire is ideal for the predator hunter, tactical marksmen, or anyone looking for a compact, sturdy, lightweight night vision riflescope. Features: – CORE Techology – Shock protected, all-glass IR transmission multicoated optics – Illuminated reticle with brightness adjustment – Detachable long-range infrared illuminator – Water and fog resistant design – Low battery indicator – Quick release mount – Mounts to standard weaver rails"

Equipped with a powerful CREE XHP35 HD LED capable of a 1200 lumen max output and 213 yards of throw, it’s great for searching, exploring and camping. A silent three-in-one tailcap switch helps you remain discrete in tactical situations and gives you quick access to constant, momentary illumination and momentary strobe modes. A second side switch located near the bezel of the light gives an alternative option to powering on/off the light, cycling through six brightness levels while providing a more comfortable handling option for everyday uses like camping or working. The side switch also allows to you engage the lockout mode which prevents the light from accidentally activating while you’re on the go. This compact and high performance flashlight is powered by a single 18650 battery (>5A output) or two CR123A batteries with up to 50 days runtime. The M2T Warrior even includes two CR123A batteries so it’s ready to go right out of the box. The durable aluminum alloy body is dust-proof, waterproof and impact resistant, making it great for all weather uses. And the M2T Warrior includes a pocket clip, holster and lanyard, providing you with multiple carrying options for daily use."

Sorry for the long pitch, there’s a lot going on with this gun.Since I am starting a new project, I’m going to be selling my .308 rifle.For sale I have a DPMS G2 Recon that has been set up nicely. It was bought new, and it was a project gun that I got to shoot a bit at a 500 yard range I had access to.There have been several upgrades made to the rifle. It comes with a 12” Midwest Industries Free Floating MLOK handguard, and an SLR Sentry 7 adjustable gas block so you can easily tune the gas system to your liking. It also comes with an AAC 51T flash hider if you happen to use their cans for suppression like I do.The stock has been upgraded to a VLTOR Enhanced MOD stock, which has a great cheek weld and has QD sling mount points to compliment those on the handguard.The trigger is a Hipertouch 24E trigger, set to 2.5 lbs. The reason I chose this trigger is because it offers excellent hammer striking energy, while still allowing a great, light trigger. This allows you to easily run cheaper, mil-surp 7.61x51 ammo without any concern of light primer strikes.The gun comes with a Lancer L7AWM Smoke Translucent 20 round magazine as pictured, and the Magpul MLOK foregrip and bipod mount are included.This gun shoots great, is really reliable (Especially once you tune the gas system the way you like it) and is extremely accurate. Definitely under 1 MOA if you use match ammo. What you get is a set-up 16” .308 that is ready to go for many applications. I love this gun, but I really want to start a 9mm SBR project since I do not have the opportunity to shoot long range as much anymore.A quick summary of what has gone into this rifle:Rifle: 1275 NewTrigger: 205Rail: 220Stock: 90SLR Gas Block: 120Magpul Stuff: 30 ishLancer Mag: 45Total cost into the rifle ~$2000However, of course since it is used, (approximately 185 rounds through it), I obviously won’t be selling it for that much. I’m asking 1400 for it and am somewhat flexible. Please contact me with any questions!(Not very interested in trades, however I’d love a B&T APC9 if you want to trade that. My chances of that are pretty slim though)"

985,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7949985,For Trade:  WTT my SIG 9mm for a Glock 40s&w.,"Bristol County, Massachusetts, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Friday, February 9, 2018",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Pistol,"Looking to add another Glock. Mainly interested in a 27 but I might also be interested in others. My first pick would be a pre 2010 production date gen 3 but I would consider newer. Excellent to like new condition only with no permanent modifications. Not really interested in holsters or tons of non functional extras like engraved slide cover plates. Let me know what model you have including the gen, the condition and all that comes with it. I will not answer vague ""Got a G27 to trade."" type replies, shouldn't have to ask for the gen or the basics. For the trade I have still basically new 2017 date SIG P225A1 9mm (225A-9-BSS-CL which is the all black/Nitron one with G10 grips and SIGLITE sights) in the original case with the manual, lock, sticker, price/warning tags and 2 8rd mags. Love SIGs and have more than a few but I just haven't touched this one yet. I would trade it for a basic Glock if you can add some cash, not being  greedy and I can be more than reasonable but you shouldn't be able to buy either one new in MA and the SIG will run a bit more. I will be using a EFA10 for mine. I can make myself free any time if you can meet local but if not can work out a time and place. All laws will be followed. Thanks."
