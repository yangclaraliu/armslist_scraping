I'd guess about 500 rounds through it but it is very well cared for. It comes with 5 magazines, the case (with accessories), a Viridian SXD Green laser. This also includes holsters for both the gun with the laser, and one for the gun without the laser. No trades (sorry - this money is going towards a can)"

This ""tactical"" model has a full length 5"" barrel, which provides added velocity, a longer sight radius, and surprisingly noticeable improvements in handling. This pistol is the softest shooting 9mm I have ever personally fired. The added slide mass really dampens recoil (compared to say, a Glock 19), and helps keep the muzzle down. This is an easy handgun to shoot well.Condition:The condition of this item is about as close to like-new-in-box as a used gun can be. The internal wear clearly tells the story of this gun: 500 rounds, tops. This combined with the fact that it is properly lubricated is about the only thing which will distinguish it from a new firearm. The gun has no abnormalities to disclose, what you see is what you get. Included with the pistol is the original hard case, manual, and (2) factory ten-round magazines. Also included is a ruger pistol lock.Ownership History:I am the only owner of this pistol. I purchased it new in early 2017, and payed around $530 out the door. That is still a good price for a new one, box stores have these listed upwards of $600. I have fired it approximately 400-500 times. I experienced 2 stoppages in the first 2 mags (stovepipes), and zero malfunctions from there on out. It is normal for fresh recoil springs to cause a stovepipe or two right out of the box, the important thing is it did break-in immediately. Whether you are on a one or two way range, you can expect this gun to be as reliable as any quality polymer/striker fire gun on the market. So why am I selling it? I'm a C&R collector first, and a shooter second. Sue me. I bought this modern weapon to practice with, but it turns out I'm less committed to training than I thought. I'd rather just sell it so I can scratch my surplus itch, and get some beat up hunk of walnut, steel, and history. Rest assured that I am the one with the problem, not the gun.***If you are a motivated buyer willing to meet me in Lafayette, I will pay for the transfer fee and your background check***"

""Rick Barry"" is engraved on the derringer. Research indicates a Rick Barry from Lexington served as speaker of the TN House from 1954 to 1967. Mr. Barry passed away in 2013. It is not known for sure if this derringer belonged to Mr. Barry. 
""The ""Southerner"" Derringer was a neat little turn-barrel pistol. Its name, emblazoned on the top of the barrel, was obviously intended to appeal to buyers south of the Mason-Dixon line, though incongruously it was manufactured in Newburyport, Mass., by Merrimack Arms and Brown Mfg. Co. Perhaps it was the makers' attempt at letting bygones be bygones-though probably it was just a very clever marketing ploy.
Standard Southerners measured 5 inches overall and had 2 1/2-inch iron barrels, spur triggers, walnut or rosewood grips and either iron or brass frames. Some 6,500 were made between 1867 and 1869 marked on their barrels, ""MERRIMACK ARMS & MANUFACTURING CO/NEWBURYPORT/MASS/PATENTED APRIL 9, 1867."" Another 10,000 were turned out from 1869 to 1873 by Merrimack's successor with their barrels stamped, ""BROWN MANUFACTURING CO/NEWBURYPORT, MASS/PAT APR.9, 1869."""
