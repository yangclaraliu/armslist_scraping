It's a combination of colors--upper is probably olive drab, hand guard is a dark tan, and barrel is a matte finish--hopefully you can see enough in the crappy cell phone pics.I figured I'd get a matching lower so I also got an SI-branded lower (manufactured by Aero Precision). Once I got it, my local gun shop/gunsmith finished it with parts he had in stock. At the time I was planning to set it up as a Tier 1 mid-long range gun, but life had other ideas and I never even made it to the range to zero it so, other than what SI did with it before sending it to me, it's never been fired. I'm willing to sell the entire rifle with all accessories as pictured, or break it up and sell the upper separately if that's more of interest.

This is one of Para's double-stack 1911 pistols; 14-round mags of .45ACP. This gun is a pleasure to shoot. I am the 2nd owner (I believe), and have always kept it clean and in my safe when not in use (it was never a carry pistol of mine, so no holster wear to speak of). This pistol has the factory match-grade barrel and the fiber optic sights. I couldn't find the exact production year based on the serial number, but there is a shipping sticker still on the case that shows a ship date of November 8, 2012 (so I would guess a 2011-2012 model)I have a couple of aftermarket parts currently installed on the pistol: A set of Hogue rubber wraparound grips, a Fusion Firearms silver checkered extended mag catch, and Wolff +10% power springs in both of the factory mags. I had intended at one point to deck this out with brushed nickel accessories, but never quite finished the build, so all of those parts are included. The following parts will be included with the pistol:- One additional Wolff +10% power mag spring- One Wolff 18.5# recoil spring- Two Wolff hammer springs- One JTM brushed nickel trigger- One Guncraft SS mag release- One Wilson Combat SS extended slide release- One MecGar 14-round magazine- One USA Magazines 14-round magazine- Factory case/boxAdditionally, the two factory Para mags are included, as well as the factory grips and mag catch that were replaced. These double-stack 1911's are becoming rarer to find these days, and I wanted to have spares of all of the doublestack-specific parts on hand. Any other part on this gun can be replaced with standard 1911 parts, with the exception of the magazines, trigger, and mag catch, so I have backups of all of those.This particular model does have a history of feeding issues. Full disclosure: This does happen occasionally on this pistol, depending on how you are gripping it while firing. There are numerous articles available that describe fixes for this issue, and I have all of the parts that are needed, I just never had the time to test the different spring/magazine combinations to find the ideal combo. A day at the range experimenting with different spring combos would probably do the trick, or worst-case scenario, it may need the barrel feed ramp polished.Please e-mail or text REDACTED) with questions.

The lower receiver features an over-molded metal insert, which reinforces the buffer tube housing and rear takedown pin. This allows for metal-on-metal contact with both the buffer tube as well as the rear takedown pin, delivering the strength and durability to withstand recoil and constant use.Incredibly tough.In fact, the Omni Hybrid lower has been specifically tested to withstand all sorts of use and abuse. The folks at ATI put it through all the pressure and weight-bearing tests, similar to the US Military's testing, and found it to function flawlessly, even after supporting up to 250 lbs. and being run over by an 800-lb. forklift. Then, they ran 2,000 rounds through it without a hiccup. You can deploy this dependable AR-15 in your collection for less than you think when you order from The Guide.  Both the upper and lower are built from a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert, with extra reinforcements in high-pressure sections Inter-lock hammer and trigger pin retainment system built into the Lower prevents movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing 16"" M4 phosphated 4140 steel barrel with A2 flash hider Mil-spec sized M4 buttstock and buffer tube Low-profile gas block Standard charging handle A2 handguard Includes one 30-rd. polymer magazine Model: ATIGOMX556LTD UPC: 813393019173"

This gun is lightweight, shoots flatter than any other AR I have ever shot (uses a great muzzle device made by war sport), and the barrel is extremely accurate, no problem shooting sub-moa. I have changed the stock from the original Magpul CTR to an STR. This gun is one of a few that featues the military/law enforcement stamp on the lower receiver (will send pictures on request), making this gun even more unique. It has the stamp because the gun was produced for law enforcement and ended up not being purchased (because of money, not gun flaws).Gun only has 150 rounds through it. Will sell with or without optic. (List price includes optic)Gun retails brand new for $1500, I can provide original receipt. Optic is the Eotech XPS2 with the 3x g23 magnifier (~$1100 retail, comes with orginial boxes and receipts).Hard case, one 30rd hex mag, and 3 picatinny rail sections included.

I purchased it brand new to be my deer gun and had to order it from Benelli as they were nowhere to be found. After 7 months of waiting on the gun I never even bothered to use it as intended. It has been sitting in my Liberty ever since.The gun has never been carried in the field or taken on a hunt. I put a total of 5 slugs through it (Hornady) just to test it out when I first got it. It has since been cleaned twice.The gun comes with a ComfortTech Gel cheek riser ($100) as well as the flat one from the factory. My goal was to put a scope on it but never got around to it. If you decided to mount an optic on it you won't have to worry about adding a cheek piece. It also has the three stock shims so you can adjust it to your fit, as well as the assembly tool. Sling is also included.My loss truly is your gain on this one. These CryoBarrels are insanely accurate and the gun is like brand new. I just have no need for it.The cheapest I can find this gun anywhere online in stock is $750, and thats only two websites. I am asking $525 for everything or best reasonable offer. I will not respond to low-balls. NO TRADES!!!Deer season is only a few months away!!Thanks for looking!"

Lets you shift from long-range to short-range targeting almost instantly. Heavy-duty machined-aluminum construction ensures solid, wobble-free mounting on MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny receiver rail, so the magnifier stays correctly positioned behind the sight. Mount bolts directly to the factory holes in the bottom of the 3XMag (machine screws included)no gunsmithing required. Ambi design allows installation with lever and flip path on the left or right side. Quick-flip tab has deep, grooves for easy activation with a flick of your thumb. Bolt-On model clamps to rail with a robust locking bar and bolt system. Bolt serves as a recoil lug that locks into one rail slot to prevent unwanted movement under recoil. Also available with A.R.M.S. quick-release throw-lever base that lets you remove the magnifier and mount as a unit in seconds; re-mount just as fast without loss of zero. Steel lever system combines a cam and locking foot with a robust recoil lug to clamp the mount to the rail as tightly as the bolt-on base. Lever closes securely against the side of the mount to prevent snagging on other objects, yet releases easily when needed.***New but not in original packaging***"

I got it because my wife is in the Army and she wanted to practice before she went to Ft. Knox for training and had to zero and qualify with a M16, this was the closest I could find to a M16 so I bought it only for her to zero it and then practice, she went through 50 rounds. 
She's done qualifying with the M16 now and has moved onto the M4 so we no longer need this firearm. 
Its weighted for competition use and very accurate

Versa-Pod M618 Tactical Forward Grip The Model 618 is extremely strong with an all steel chassis, and also extremely comfortable and durable with its PA66 molding. The PA66 molding gives this foregip superior strength without the added weight. It is a great alternative to the longer Model 616 and 656 when the extra length is not needed. The ribbed style grip is designed to allow the shooter positive grip in wet conditions even with gloves on. The tactical version includes a quick release sling loop to allow an additional point to attach your sling. Our foregrips allow reduced muzzle climb and greater accuracy with full-auto or burst fire. The Versa-Pod bipod can be folded up and out of the way or completly removed when not needed. The All-Steel spigot fits our Versa-Pod Classic Series and 50 Series bipod lines, and allows full axial rotation. This foregrip adapter attaches to a standard MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail with our patented U-bolt and quick release thumb screw.

It starts with a CNC-machined stainless steel receiver. This receiver features an integral Picatinny rail and is threaded to accept the stainless steel barrel of your choice. The stainless steel receiver helps achieve that delicate balance that shooters are always looking for. It features all CNC-machined and wire-EDM components as we feel this is essential in building the best semi-auto rimfire rifle available. The CNC-machined bolt includes a titanium round firing pin, tuned extractor and are black nitride coated for improved performance and function."
