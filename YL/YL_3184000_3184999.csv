The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.
The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional. LNIB with all factory papers, test casing, bushing wrench etc. serious inquiries only, no trades.

Great rifles, but I never shoot it as much as my other ARs

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.
Optics - on top is a Vortex Viper HS 2.5-10x44 with the Dead Hold BDC reticle & 30mm tube. This scope has an unconditional lifetime warranty that is transferable, and not limited to the original owner. It is sighted in dead on at 200yds. It comes with a screw on sunshade (not shown in picture), and I still have the original box it came in. The scope is mounted in Warne all steel 30mm rings. Warne makes all of their rings in the USA.

Price: $1450 Or make an offer

___________________________________________________

Bottom Rifle: This rifle is a great optics ready carbine. The upper is a Bushmaster factory upper with 16"" chrome lined barrel and lightweight profile. It has a fixed mil-spec front sight on it, and I swapped the furniture out for some Magpul furniture and vertical pistol grip. I have a Diamond rear sight that is on at 100yds. The lower is a DPMS lower with mil-spec trigger and some more Magpul furniture including pistol grip with storage, enhanced trigger guard for shooting with gloves, and lightweight 6 position buttstock.

This excuse for a man goes by the name of ""HUNTER MARTIN"" I am not sure it is his real name but he uses google phone to hide his identity. He made off with a large sum of my hard earned cash and a very expensive Noveske Lower Receiver yesterday. He advertised a rifle where the internals did not match what was advertised or agreed upon through a series of text messages and in spoken word. As of now he is selling a Noveske KX3 pig for 300blk. He drives a brand new 2013 dark red Honda Civic and will ask to meet in a public place in the GRANTS PASS area. I suggest you do not do business with this THIEF!! 
Thank you

GOD BLESS AMERICA!


EDIT: many people are asking more details of the transaction so here it is..


It was my first AR buy. My 4 year old and 8 month old came with me so it was a quick deal. It wasn't just the internals. 

The upper wasn't billet, the charging handle wasn't BCM and I didn't think to bring a measuring tape to check the gas length. He said the barrel was mid length gas, it was carbine. He said the upper was complete from Midwest Industries, only thing that MI made was the forearm cover. The bolt group was swapped out too. 

I learned my lesson but it still doesn't excuse the fact that he straight up lied to me both over texts and in person. I now know how to research these things in the future. Either way the guy is a complete scumbag. His final words were ""then sell this gun and go and buy another one."" 

I am an honest person and cannot recover the sum lost because the parts are trash. I will try to sell some of the parts, but in the end he made out with lots of my hard earned cash. I will continue to repost my ad about him until no one in the Rogue Valley deals with him again."

Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 14 rounds of 12 gauge 2.75” rounds in total (7 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 2.75"".
 This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
 The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
 The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

393,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3184393,For Sale:  Mil-A-Spec 46100 Body Armor With Condor Carriers,"Tucson, Payson, Phoenix, Tempe, Maricopa Az, Tucson, Arizona",$ 200,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 1, 2014",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The available colors of the vests are ""Desert Tan"" ""OD Green"" ""Black"" NOTE: If you buy 3 or more sets I will offer a discount. If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x8"" Text or call Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five
(Please serious buyer's only)

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the complete set of Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates would be $300.00"

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x8"" Text or call Cody @ 480-228-8195 or call 520-723-92five-five
(Please serious buyer's only)

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the complete set of Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates would be $300.00"

432,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3184432,For Sale/Trade:  WWII Nazi JP Sauer & Sohn 38h pistol with papers,"West Chicago, Chicago, Illinois",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, June 22, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Attn: all SIG Sauer and WWII collectors! What is listed here is a JP Sauer & Sohn 38H pistol chambered in 32 auto. The gun itself has all the correct Nazi proof marks as well as a matching slide to frame! Everything on this gun is functional up to and including the cocker/decocker lever! You did hear that correct, the decocker also functions as a recocker! This gun was really a head of its time! Not only do you get the gun, you also get two SuS stamped magazines, the property marked original Otto Sindel holster, and the original GI war trophy bring back papers! This gun has great prominence and just looks good! To add to the interesting side, in my opinion, it has been fitted with field replacement grips. The original bakealite grips were fragile and often fell apart; Soldiers in the field needed replacements. That being said it is my understanding that they use to mill grips out of shot down plaine's windscreens to make these replacement grips. This seems to be the case with this gun. Proof marks are of a eagle over c and eagle over n. All in correct locations including the barrel. Bore is bright and shiny with four Grove rifling. This is a mid war gun with both the manual safety and decocker / cocker. Hard to come by with the original ""war trophy"" certificate! Currently listed on Gunbroker as well with a low reserve! There is still time to discuss a deal but should that reserve get met, it will sell.

The all-new Mark 6 1-6x20mm scope was engineered based on the years of elite riflescope making expertise in order to deliver relevant performance features to competition shooters and tactical operators in mid-range to CQB scenarios.

 SAFETY
 Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

 Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
 Trigger System™
 The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

 Loaded Chamber Indicator
 The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

 Grip Safety
 All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

 Fail-Safe Disassembly
 The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

 Secure Grip Texture
 The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

 Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
 To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries."

All matching numbers including the bolt, stock, and brass-tipped cleaning rod. Overall, the finish is still strong with 97-98% bright original blue overall. Nice crisp markings and sharp edges throughout. Like almost all Argentine 1891's, it has had the crest on the receiver removed with just shadows of the original Argentine crest still visible. I've heard many stories over the years why this was done...from a newer gov't that wanted to defile and older regime to a story that they were secretly supplied to another country for a war...who knows???? The stock is in Fine condition overall with a couple of gouges, nicks, and dings, from many years of military storage. No chips, cracks, or repairs. The bolt still has all of its original bright polish. Excellent action and a MINT bore!!! This is a lot of gun for the money and Model 1891's are some of the nicest military Antique rifles found in today's market."

 22 Rimfire suppressor from RockCreek $275.00 and includes Ohio sales tax. Silencer is threaded with 1/2x28 thread pitch. 

All NFA devices upon application for transfer require a $200 dollar tax stamp fee. There is no getting around this. 


Total cost to own this NFA item is $475.00 this program allows you to get started for $255.00

 For those interested I have a dealer demo setup on a Walther P22 pistol and a Marlin XT long gun. Try them for your self. YouTube is good but until you get some trigger time on it your just never going to know. It's a try before you buy. 

The wait times for application approval is the tough nut to get past. Typically 8 months from when the application is submitted. 

Filing an application using an NFA trust is typically a little quicker but time will soon tell. Also the ATF has added an additional 30 people to its staff to help address backlog and new applications. 

To help offset the frustration, I am offering the ability to get started for $255 dollars. Here is how it works:

 We start with a phone call. I will ask some basic questions so I can pre fill out all the paperwork on your behalf. I need a check made payable to the BATF for 200 dollars and a check for $55 dollars made out to Home on the Range LLC. 

I will send you a complete package of everything you need pre filled out so there are no mistakes. I also include instructions on how to finalize what you need to do. I also include return mailers so all you have to do initially is drop the information back in the mail to me. I take care of the final review and submission to the BATF. Once submitted you will receive a copy of your BATF check with the serial number of the device and a number you can call for status updates

 Once everything is submitted you just make 4 monthly payments to Home on the Range LLC for $55 dollars. 

One the transfer is approved you come in and pick your item up. 

All firearms in the picture are in stock. Feel to PM me with any questions or to get started

 Location is Mantua OH 44255

 Just to keep things real, packets will only be sent out once the BATF and first $55 dollar installment payment is received. 

Of course we can always do all of this in person as well, for those real local folks just give me a shout

Great rifles, but I never shoot it as much as my other ARs

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.
Optics - on top is a Vortex Viper HS 2.5-10x44 with the Dead Hold BDC reticle & 30mm tube. This scope has an unconditional lifetime warranty that is transferable, and not limited to the original owner. It is sighted in dead on at 200yds. It comes with a screw on sunshade (not shown in picture), and I still have the original box it came in. The scope is mounted in Warne all steel 30mm rings. Warne makes all of their rings in the USA.

Bottom Rifle: This rifle is a great optics ready carbine. The upper is a Bushmaster factory upper with 16"" chrome lined barrel and lightweight profile. It has a fixed mil-spec front sight on it, and I swapped the furniture out for some Magpul furniture and vertical pistol grip. I have a Diamond rear sight that is on at 100yds. The lower is a DPMS lower with mil-spec trigger and some more Magpul furniture including pistol grip with storage, enhanced trigger guard for shooting with gloves, and lightweight 6 position buttstock.

It will come with everything as delivered from the factory and has had a M&P armorer installed Apex Tactical AEK trigger kit. The factory trigger parts are included in the box.

The Apex tactical AEK trigger replaces the bottom pivot safety of the factory trigger with a center pivot safety like Glock. It greatly reduces take up and over travel, makes for super smooth trigger pull and ridiculously short trigger reset. The trigger alone was $80 plus install

The optic is a Leupold DeltaPoint 7.5MOA triangle optic. Very fast to acquire and very accurate with the tip of the triangle sighted in at 50 yds.

Its a super accurate pistol and very fast hits at 100 yds on 18"" steel were no problem.

The Clean channel has controls for Volume, Treble, Middle, and Bass. The Crunch and Lead channels feature individual Volume and Gain controls, with shared Treble, Middle, and Bass tone controls. The Tone Shift switch on the Crunch/Lead channels reconfigures the way the all important middle control works and the overall Deep switch adds masses of extra push at the low end.With 3 channels giving every bit as much flexibility as their higher powered brethren, the TSL60s use a pair of Svetlana EL34 power valves for that classic pure Marshall valve tone.

The addition of separate Reverb controls for the Clean or Crunch/Lead channels and an overall FX Loop with Level and Mix controls, that are also on/off footswitchable means that the TSL not only gives more, but also allows the player to use the facilities in a live situation to an extent only dreamed of before. The TSL60s also feature a built-in speaker emulated DI circuit for recording or direct to the PA situations. The supplied 5-way footswitch provides remote switching for the 3 individual channels, plus the effects loop and the reverb.

Brand New, never fired!

A matching Muddy Girl Camo Diamondback DB9 pistol and Diamondback DB15S AR, both with Muddy Girl Camo Bulldog Cases. Can be bought as a pair (which is COOL!) or I'll sell separately. Here's the details for the DB9. Check my listing under rifles for a full description of the AR.

The DB9 is a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

The gun is fantastic sub the bolt handle. Here's the story behind it, and why it's so cheap.
I was out with my buddies on one of their properties and I had a cartridge jam on me (I'd just put around 35 rounds downrange successfully) and in my usual fit of rage I tried to knock the bolt open with the 2x4 I keep handy for my Mosin Nagants. Then boom, the bolt handle comes clean off. Imagine my astonishment at this unpleasant surprise. Anyway, I had my professional mechanic weld the handle back onto the bolt for me and it's sturdier than ever, it just has a few battle scars.
With this deal you get;
- One Remington 770
- One soft gun case
- Two five round magazines
- 2 and a half boxes of .270 ammunition (These best hunting round ever imo)
- A sight (Mounted, sighted in at ~85 yards)

I take great care of my guns, and though it brought me a few deer in its time, I've moved on to a more expensive rifle. This rifle is perfect for your teenager or friend that you are teaching/is learning about gun safety, and will allow them the use of a round that has stood the test of time. Or even for the new hunter looking for something to get started with.
You will be required to fill out a bill of sale, so bring your driver's license. I can meet you anywhere on Mercer Island.

Between The Ammo, Case, Mags and Sight alone that's ~$130, that's $95 for a rifle that has never missed a shot! This is a great deal."
