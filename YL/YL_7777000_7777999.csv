The Aimpoint Micro T-2 redefines everything you thought you knew about compact red dot sights. Cutting edge lens coatings radically improve the shape and clarity of the 2 MOA red dot and physical protection has been added for even more ruggedness.

Cutting edge lens coatings radically improve the shape and clarity of the 2 MOA red dot especially when used with an accessory magnifier. The Micro T-2 is a lightweight sight for extreme conditions. Built to offer the same battle-proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, the Micro T-2 performs reliably under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon.

The performance of the Micro T-2 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation Night Vision Technology. Aimpoint's unique coating on the front lens reflects the dots selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction.

The powerful, virtually indestructible X300 Ultra WeaponLight was primarily designed for handguns but is also excellent for long guns and mounts securely to MIL-STD 1913 rail-equipped rifles via its newly enhanced T-slot mounting system. This top-selling WeaponLight features a high-performance LED that generates 600 lumens of stunning white light that’s focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a high-intensity beam with extended range yet it provides significant surround light for peripheral vision in close quarters. The highly efficient virtually failure-proof LED generates tactical-level light—ideal for close- to long-range target identification—for 1.5 hours per set of batteries.
 
Activating the X300 Ultra is done via intuitive, ambidextrous switches—now wider and shorter for improved ergonomics—at the rear of the body. Simply press the switch on either side for momentary-on activation or flip up or down for constant-on activation. Optional DG grip switches (for handguns) and pressure-activated XT tape switches (for long guns) permit the X300 Ultra to be activated remotely.
 
The X300U-B can be securely attached to a handgun or a long gun via its new mounting system which incorporates a tightening screw and a T-slot mounting rail. Universal and Picatinny crossbar wedges are included for simple, foolproof installation. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body—including the mounting system—is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and its O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture.
FITS: The new T-slot mounting system fits most railed handguns (and rail-equipped long guns) but adapter mounts are available for some non-railed handguns."

This gun has been shot and carried very little. It is a solidly built tiny .380 that easily fits in the pocket or purse. It comes with everything from the factory plus I have purchased an extra 6 round mag, an extra 7 round mag, and a Pierce finger extension (over $70 in extras). The barrel and feed ramp have been polished as well as a lot of the internal parts. I have had no problems with it except for cheap Perfecta ammo from a gun show that didn’t work well. I love the gun but my daughter can’t rack the slide so we have had to go to a RM380 since it is the only small .380 she could work. In the hand the Kahr feels like a real gun not a toy and mine has a very smooth trigger. It has actual sights that don’t snag and locks open after the last round for fast reloads.  Also with the three mag setup you have a shorter mag for deep concealed carry, a longer for all fingers for the range or waistband, and the 7 round for backup. Now the small print: ftf only, must see a valid IN Driver’s License and prefer concealed carry license also, and will do a bill of sale.  I might consider trade for a 9mm Shield with safety or toward a Sig P938 or 9mm Beretta PX4 compact. If interested I can send more pics. For any questions, or to meet just let me know. Thanks"

156,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7777156,For Sale:  Surefire X300 Ultra A Weapon Light,"Saint Cloud, Orlando, Florida",$ 175,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 2, 2018",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale a very gently used Surefire X300 A. This is the 500 lumen model with the Rail Lock mounting system. Comes with the Weapon Light, two 123A batteries, and the alternative plates to mount to either Universal or Picattiny rails. Price is firm and I'm not interested in trades. Shown mounted on a Glock 19 for size comparison, weapon is not for sale.
The powerful, virtually indestructible X300 Ultra WeaponLight was primarily designed for handguns but is also excellent for long guns and mounts securely to MIL-STD 1913 rail-equipped rifles via its newly enhanced T-slot mounting system. This top-selling WeaponLight features a high-performance LED that generates 600 lumens of stunning white light that’s focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a high-intensity beam with extended range yet it provides significant surround light for peripheral vision in close quarters. The highly efficient virtually failure-proof LED generates tactical-level light—ideal for close- to long-range target identification—for 1.5 hours per set of batteries.
 
Activating the X300 Ultra is done via intuitive, ambidextrous switches—now wider and shorter for improved ergonomics—at the rear of the body. Simply press the switch on either side for momentary-on activation or flip up or down for constant-on activation. Optional DG grip switches (for handguns) and pressure-activated XT tape switches (for long guns) permit the X300 Ultra to be activated remotely.
 
The X300U-B can be securely attached to a handgun or a long gun via its new mounting system which incorporates a tightening screw and a T-slot mounting rail. Universal and Picatinny crossbar wedges are included for simple, foolproof installation. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body—including the mounting system—is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and its O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture.
 
FITS: The new T-slot mounting system fits most railed handguns (and rail-equipped long guns) but adapter mounts are available for some non-railed handguns"

This P938 BRG features a black, hard-coat anodized alloy frame, and a Nitron™ coated stainless steel slide. Hogue rubber, finger-groove grips provide an excellent hold, enhancing fire control for rapid follow up shots. Sig P938 pistols are modeled on a 1911-style, single action design, with an ambidextrous thumb safety; though the slide can be cycled with the safety engaged. The hammer recesses into the beavertail section of the frame to protect it when carrying the weapon on safe, and to avoid hammer-bite while firing. The pistol operates with a locked-breech, short recoil action (instead of blowback) that locks the action closed. Slide serrations enhance the shooter's ability to pull the slide back for loading and clearing the action. The Sig Sauer P938 BRG Semi-Auto Pistol comes with SIGLITE® night sights, dovetail to the slide, for rapid sight acquisition in any light, including total darkness. The compact P938 can be carried comfortably all-day—everyday, keeping it within reach for situations that call for rapid deployment of well-placed shots.
