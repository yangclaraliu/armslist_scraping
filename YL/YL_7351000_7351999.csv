The PX4 utilizes a rotating barrel locking system that reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise by releasing recoil energy radially. The corrosion resistant fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame comes with 3 interchangeable backstraps to obtain a proper fit according to the individual shooter's hand. Non-slip texturing on the grip also aids in weapon control. An integral Picatinny rail provides rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The PX4 Storm is a double/single action semi-automatic pistol with an external hammer. The ambidextrous safety doubles as a decocking lever. The slide features a Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating for superior corrosion and wear resistant finish, while forward and rear serrations provides a non-slip hold on the slide when loading and unloading the weapon. White, 3-dot sights provide quick sight acquisition in varied lighting. The gun's chrome-lined barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance.http://www.battlecreekarmory.com/product-p/brpx4strm.htmFEDERAL FIREARMS LICENSE REQUIRED!!

I payed $389 plus tax for the carbine with 1 mag, this one cost more then the BLACK ones in the smaller calibers "".40 and 9mm. Just because it the .45 with DIGITAL CAMO""  I also bought another mag for $24, also a soft case made by pitbull for $33  I got all that from Petrey's Guns/ Ace Hardware. I also went to Dick Sporting Goods and purchased a TRUGLO RED/GREEN DOT SIGHT/scope for $56 it has no magnification but has 11 settings on it, 1-5 for RED DOT----1-5 for GREEN DOT Set it on ""0"" to turn it off 1 being the dimmest and 5 being the brightest. It Works awesome in very bright daylight and night time and the last thing I got from DICKS is a MAGPUL foregrip payed $45 for that. With the scope and foregrip on it tops it off looks harass. So I just payed $550 before taxes for everything after taxes close to $575 or so . This is a GREAT gun in everyway shoots great feels great and defiantly looks GREAT. I really don't want to sell it but I'm just seeing what offers are out there i no I won't get what I got in it. But its defiantly worth buying! I guarantee its worth the money and you will enjoy it. I've decided that I want to build me an AR-10. instead to use for deer hunting this year and for fun. So after all that I'm going to ask for $450 obo.

I have for sale a Mossberg 500 shotgun with the factory pistol grip and the 18"" breacher barrel. I bought it new last year from Bud's Gun Shop and it is completely factory stock. No modifications whatsoever and is in great shape. I travel to St. Louis frequently and this is my truck gun I keep loaded with defensive rounds and within arms reach anytime I am in the St. Louis area. I have ran somewhere around 100 rounds through it over the past year and given it a light cleaning after each use. Being a Mossberg 500 it has of course been 100% reliable. I have my eye on a new suppressor and have to give a couple of firearms up to be able to afford it and although I want to keep them all I have to choose a few to let go. Buying this new will cost you at least $400 plus transfer fees, tax, etc. I need $300 cash for this one. I am located in Trumann and prefer to have it picked up here but I am also in Jonesboro every few days and could meet somewhere there. The price is absolutely firm and I can not accept trades due to the fact I will be using the cash for a suppressor. I very rarely check my email so if interested please give me a call or a text. My name is Jason and my number is REDACTED. Again, I very rarely check my email so PLEASE contact me by a phone call or text. Thank you. SOLD PENDING PAYMENT."

The rife is in great condition with a few minor blemishes at the front sight post area.  It has 30 rounds of jacketed rounds through it as well as 200 powder-coated lead rounds.  Feel free to ask me any questions.  I live in Hartford but I’ll meet you on a parking lot somewhere in the Waukesha area.  You must be 18, a Wisconsin resident, and not a felon.  I'm not desperate to sell; I just don't have time or space for more than a couple rifles.    
 $1000 or best offer -or- if you don't want the scope and rail, $950 obo  The story:  I'll keep it short as I already posted a write-up on castboolits.com about my foray into cast 7.62x39.  I purchased the Saiga several years ago but didn't do anything with it as I'm really only into bolt-guns.   Eventually as a hobby I decided to find out how much accuracy I could get out of the AK platform and set about making some changes as well as handloads for the 7.62x39.  Yes, I realize that there's at least 20 reasons why the AK and benchrest accuracy don't go together but I'm a reloader and wanted the challenge.  To the rifle I effected the following changes:
 
- I re-crowned the muzzle but kept the length.  Yes, I realize a 20"" barrel won't be as accurate as a 16"" but wanted to leave it intact, knowing that I would sell it.
- I removed (but later reinstalled) the front sight post.
- I added a 74 style brake to control barrel whip.
- I re-ground the gas tube so that it wouldn't impinge on the barrel so much when it heats up.
- I did put a much better trigger in but have returned the stock trigger to it.
 
Most importantly however were the handloads I developed.  AK throats are cavernous so I cast bullets that came to .315 after powder coating and seated them very far out.  The barrel on this rifle slugs to a tight .3115 which is great for any AK and typical for a Saiga.  My best handload is listed below if you're interested.  To not everyone's surprise however, I was never able to get a cast cartridge to chamber without the bolt stripping lead off of the top round in the magazine.  AKs have a particularly violent action and absolutely abuse cartridges going in and cases coming out.  With cast bullets, I was forced to hand chamber each one.  Anyway, the best I could do was 2 and 1 quarter inches at 100 yards, pretty good for an AK despite the 95% BS out there concerning accuracy.  Prior to all of this I fired a handful of jacketed bulk rounds through this rifle and scored 5 inches, typical for a high-end AK.  The rifle was cleaned (properly) twice; once after I fired the jacketed rounds, and once recently.  There's no leading or powder coat present and the gun functions flawlessly, as any AK should.  I still have the market stock if you want it.  Also, if you want the 7.62 dies, let me know and I'll sell them but would advise loading only jacketed or plated projectiles.  To sum it up, yes, this is a great rifle but no, you can't get any gains by firing cast loads through it.
 
My load:
 
- 150 grain (wheel weights) cast round nose, flat point dropped at .315 then red powder coat and swaged to .315
- Winchester brass expanded appropriately
- CCI primers
- 29.5 grains of BL-C2
- topped with 3 grains of cream-of-wheat
- COL of 2.190
- moderate crimp (to preserve .315)"

At less than an inch thick, it can be adapted to practically every platform on the market. To activate the brace functionality, depress the release button and pull the arm down. This creates the shelf that will counterbalance the muzzle weight of your large frame handgun. The ability of your forearm to hold the weight allows you to relax your shooting wrist and concentrate on trigger control. True one handed operation is achieved since you do not need a second hand to attach the brace to your arm. MOD 1 can be set up for right or left handed operation. We start with a solid piece of billet aluminum and meticulously machine every aspect for a part that is as nice to look at as it is to use. This version clamps to pistol buffer tubes or adapter spuds ranging from 1.17"" to 1.2"" in diameter. It features a limited rotation sling swivel QD socket as well. Weighing in at a scant 4.5 ounces, you will never feel it there. That is, until you want to use it. It is finished with a hard anodizing to withstand years of serious use.Remember that when this is installed on a pistol, it does not change the classification of the pistol with correct intended use. But recent ATF opinion states that using a pistol brace as shoulder stock could be considered manufacturing a rifle.Included in the package is the Mod 1 brace and hex wrench for installation only. It does NOT come with any adapters or buffer tube for mounting to your pistol.http://www.battlecreekarmory.com/product-p/ghwthpb.htm"

Well you don't see many of these. A pre-banned Chinese Norinco AK-47 rifle. A high quality Chinese brand. The russian Saiga ones are banned these are pre-banned from importations meaning in a 1-2 or a few years they will most likely get banned as well or they might have already gotten banned not sure about that as of right now etc. You can do your own research and find out.. Great great quality and i mean that, very nice and clean rifle with min amount of wear, however, the rifle is used.. everything you see in that bad pic (the rifle is very beautiful not a good pic..) is original on this rifle except the 75rd plastic made drum (the good ones worth $85+) that i bought for it for $85 ON SALE! I also bought a good new 30rd metal mag for it works all good but it's new so.. b/c i lost my last one lol. I can also throw in 30rds of reg 7.62x39 russian made ammo IF you don't have any already b/c i got two other aks myself so i'd rather keep my ammo! haha. I'm kinda short on the regular ones right now i like the good ones :D.. The rifle has it's own original carry strap already on it as well and by observing that closely at the meet up you can see the rifle is not old or too used and has been well taken care of. As you can see in my bad picture the rifle has it's own original factory made all wooden thumb-hole stock this stock alone that goes on the 91 model retails online for $300+ and all the wooden furniture is original as well. So pretty much everything you see is in great/clean condition and is all originals that came with the rifle except the parts that i purchased for it.. Tbh i haven't shot it a lot at all i only shot it once only once at the range after purchase from a collector using my drum and shooting 70rds as fast as i possibly could to see if it was going to jam on me and it did all good with no jammings or jams i guess..? and that was some yea some good time ago and the rifle was cleaned by pros & and had a good spot in my locker standing up the whole time might have moved it around here and there but never shot it again after that one time no lies no bs. Really you don't see any signs of wear when just checking it out.. I was honestly trying to keep it all healthy & clean for myself and not use it. like an investment i guess you can call it but everyone needs money hah. TRADES ARE NOT CONSIDERED AT ALL NO MATTER HOW GOOD IT MIGHT SOUND TO YOU! FOR SALE AND CASH ONLY! FTF DEALS IN PUBLIC NO WAY AROUND IT. NO MONEYGRAM NO NONE OF THOSE STUPID SIMPLE BS SCAMS. PRICE IS OBO! OBO! OBO! THIS RIFLE IS NOT A COMMON ONE AND THEY WILL ALL SOON GET BANNED! when that happens their prices will be pretty much the same as Saigas all over $1100 for sure like how the Saigas $$ got raised up. They weren't that expensive at the beginning when they weren't banned from importing into the U.S. etc. I'm also throwing in a drum, ammo.. so $900 is pretty fair. It's YES or NO just like that please don't waste my time and i won't waste yours :)! I can drive a fair amount depending on what i think is good enough..
