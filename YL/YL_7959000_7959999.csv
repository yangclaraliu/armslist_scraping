Winchester 748 lot - Sealed 8# jug, 2 sealed 1# jars and one opened 8# jug (4+ pounds remaining).  $280 for the lot. That's a smidge less than $20/#
I live in Illinois and commute to Chesterfield each week.  Prices are FTF in Chesterfield area.  Beyond that, it needs to be convenient.
Open to offers, but to avoid confusion you should understand that I'm not broke, destitute, unemployed or upside down on my mortgage. My ""best price"" is my asking price.  If you want an item for less than the asking price, make an offer. I'll politely accept, counter or decline.
Thanks for looking!"

Worst I can say is no. I actually really like the gun. It's recent production and very tight. It has about 50 rounds through it and shoots roughly 3""s high at 20 yards. I prefer Bomar sights or Heinie sights, hence the possibility of a trade deal. The trigger is on the heavy side, but crisp at 5.5lbs. For my intended purposes, the novak sights aren't exactly my cup of tea. I would be willing to add cash for certain 1911s, such as a colt gold cup trophy, older sig, or dan wesson. The pistol will most likely be sold as stock. Currently pictured with a nighthawk trigger and EGW bushing. The only 1911s I'm not terribly interested in are: remingtons, RIA, most colts, para ord, kimber."

The pistol was purchased new in December and has been carried a handful of times. If shot it once at buds and other than that most handling has been cleaning just because!  I have a alien gear and hidden hybrid holster plus all the original swag and the soft case and legion coin in my position. The legion stickers ar even still in the box. I’m looking for glock 19s gen 4 or higher that have some pretty serious work done. I’m also interested in a beneli M4 or probably high end 1911’s. Thanks.
