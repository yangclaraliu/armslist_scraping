This is a 12 gauge Browning A5 with serial number 07647PR151. This has a 32 inch ribbed barrel with a 3 inch chamber. This shotgun has a champion black synethic stock in place of the wood stock that was factory. This was used for hunting ducks and thus is why he went with the black synthetic stock for durablity. The stock does not fit completly correct on the rear bottom and this can be seen on the pictures. It appears this is a an issue due to the aftermarket stock. This shotgun can be used as is and does not effect function. We did test fire this shotgun with 3 inch shells and it functions well with no problems. Overall the condition is nice there are a couple minor marks on the front barrel that can be seen in the pictures but there is no pitting or major issues of concern. If your looking for a great A5 to hunt with this would be a great choice. If you have any questions please ask.

It is an absolute big-bore tack driver with the capacity of a 9mm. Gun is in great shape. I recently replaced the grips with a new set of factory ones due to wear on the originals. This gun is not new but has been well taken care of and shoots like a dream. I have had 2 Sig P220s and a CZ 97B, and none of them were as accurate or as reliable as this one.The holster and mag carrier set was special-ordered from Turkey and is brand new. I love this gun.

This is a limited production 1988-1989 with approximately 3500 total made. The barrel is factory “broach cut” to accept the factory scope ring configuration. S&W factory rings were made by mullet.  Later S&W changed to Leupold mounts, but you needed to remove the rear sight to attach the leupold design. No need to do that with this model. If your lucky enough find one of these, they almost NEVER have the original rings., (The rings alone if you can find them on ebay are 300-400$ because they are rare). Includes the orignal Hogue Tulipwood finger groove grips. Hogue's grips are one piece-style that slide up and over the grip frame and fasten with a stirrup and screw entering the bottom of the grip. Very nice and not a mark on them. Let me know if you have any questions. I am open to trades for Glock 19's or 20's, but will entertain all gun offers. Will do Cash plus gun or multiple gun trades. Email or text 918-4o2-o854All transactions are final and face to face in Tulsa area only."

The slide has been flattened and serrated and has lightening cuts on top. The barrel is of standard configuration with bushing, not flared like an Officers model barrel. Although not marked, it’s possible that this gun was actually customized by renowned pistolsmith Austin Behlert, with Seecamp only doing the D/A trigger conversion. Behlert worked in conjunction with Seecamp on many guns, particularly the cut down minis like this gun. An interesting possibility, though there’s no sure provenance. It has beautiful figured custom grips with Colt medallions. A great example of 20th Century custom pistolsmithing.
