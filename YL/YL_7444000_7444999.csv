Some of the features are:*Stock adusts in six seperate positions*Can be easily swithced between Standard and Rapid Fire modes*It has an ambidextrous sling mount (QD sling mount as well) and finger rest *Comes with the extra insert that converts it to a regular style stock.  Take that insert out and put in the finger rest insert and it returns to being able to maintain the rapid fire we all love from the line of SlideFire Stocks*Has santoprene grips for better grip and more ergonical feel*Has a nice rubber butt pad, something that the OGR and SBS do not have.  (No need to tear up your shoulder just because you want to shoot +900 rounds a minute)*Extremely more accurate than the SBS or OGR stocks and is easily able to rapid fire or do a controlled 3 round burst as well as being able to quickly and effectively shoot semi-automatic. *It's for use on AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube *Compatible with mil-spec buffer tubes*Last but not least (at least on this list) it makes your AR-15 resemble guns such as the SCAR and similar type rifles making the apperance of the rifle absolutely beautiful.This stock is practially new.  It comes with everything that comes in the original packaging (which I still have) and well as a letter of approval from ATF and user manual (and don't forget that it comes with the extra finger insert).GET IT WHILE YOU CAN.  The bill that is being passed around will not ban SlideFire stocks, but rather stop production of these stocks, so there are a limited number of them.  If you have not purchased one before today, you will NOT be able to purchase one from any online or brick and mortar store, making the value of these stocks rise literally every hour.  At this time, I am selling for $600, but would rather do a trade than sell."

This pistol is ""United States Property"" marked of the left side of the receiver. The 'Rampant Colt' is found on the top rear of the left side of the slide. The left side of the slide also has 5 different Patent dates. The last one is Aug. 19, 1913.The Inspector's stamp on the left side of the frame, just above the magazine release, corresponds to Major John M. Gilbert. By serial number, this pistol was made around 1918. The pistol appears to have been re-Parkerized at some time, and the hammer replaced, but we could not find any arsenal re-work markings. The wooden grips appear to be original. The magazine is after-market. There are some blemishes in the finish (see pictures). One is the circular 'ring' around the right side of the frame, where the slide release pin comes through. Overall condition is around 90+%. Bore is in great condition, but the barrel is a High Standard. This is great 1911 for a Colt 1911 collector. Good luck in the bidding."

The Inertia Driven® system in these Benelli shotguns requires no springs or gas cylinder under the forend. That allows the Montefeltro's forend to be slim and graceful, while the lightweight, anodized aluminum receiver keeps weight to a minimum.The 12-gauge and the 20-gauge shotgun are chambered for 3"" magnum loads, making the Montefeltro equally at home in New England woodcock cover and a Louisiana duck blind. This is one gun that looks as good as it shoots. Stocked with beautifully finished satin walnut, the Montefeltro is the gun for the wingshooting purist who wants the feel of a classic game gun with the added advantage of a semi-auto.This Benelli Montefeltro comes with the Benelli Box and Benelli Hard case. It does come with Chokes, Full, Modified, and Improved Cylinder. It also has the choke wrench. This gun was very well taken care of. It is used but the gun has no markings or scratches. (Pictures!) You will be able to see in the pictures. This gun is chambered in 20 Ga, and has a 26"" Barrel. In my opinion, the gun as a whole, I would grade it at 95+, on because it has been shot.SPECIFICATIONS: Mfg Item Num: 10865Category: FIREARMS - SHOTGUNSGauge: 20 GaugeBarrel Length: 26 in Capacity: 4+1Chamber: 3 in Overall Length: Weight: 7.1Sight: Fiber Optic front, Mid Bead Sight Used!

The pistol also comes with the factory box, one factory magazine, all of the paperwork, lock, and several stickers as well as a BCM hat that was in the box when purchased new. I am the original owner and purchaser of this item and have only shot 20-25 rounds through it total. I rarely get to the range anymore so I have no use for this particular item. Again, I do not need to sell this so my price is more than firm and fair at $1,500 which is $800 off the total new for something that has only have 25 rounds fired through it. If you don't like my price, be an adult and move on. I don't have time for lowballers and window shoppers.

It is thin, at barely an inch wide, making it a favorite for concealed carry.The trigger is DA first shot with following shots SA. The difference between this pistol and others claiming to be double action is that the first shot is true double action. The hammer strikes every time the trigger is pulled just like a revolver. Trigger pull is very smooth with DA pull at about 10 lbs and SA pull at about four lbs. A short reset allows quick follow up shots. Comes with 3, 8 round magazines, manual and original case.

Pistons are constructed from 17-4 stainless steel, then heat treated for maximum durability.The piston is part of the Nielsen device that moves and allows semi-automatic cycling, but it also contains the female threads that attach to the muzzle of the host pistol or sub-gun. These pistons are easily interchangeable for compatibility with all relevant host guns and can be changed out to be compatible with sub-caliber host guns, which means you can shoot smaller caliber rounds through the same suppressor, making it a multi-caliber silencer.I've been an Armslist seller since April 2011call/text 720four91156four"

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters."

LOOK AT THAT WOOD AMAZING I bought it at first sight, and if I could shoot it I would. I have had 6 back surgeries and I tried to shoot skeet again (the last surgery felt better then all of the previous surgeries did), but I can't. I picked Beretta because I have sot them in the past and loved them. I picked the A400 XCEL because of the recoil reduction system and fast cycling times. I picked this one because of the recoil reducer in the stock and the Limbsaver recoil pad and then of course I could not pass up that wood. Which is why it has taken me 2 months since I shot it last to bring myself to list it. It is a gun I thought about just keeping for its shear beauty as another one to match it would be hard to find.this A400 has had the following modifications ,Graco adjustable comb stock,professional trigger job,recoil reducer in the stock,limbsaver pad,and it comes with a wide range of 7 chokes (Cyl, SK, IC, M, IM, F, & EF) so you can shoot just about any type of shotgun shooting event you can find. Skeet, trap, sporting clays or anything in between and this shotgun and chokes can hit it.Shipping will cost $30,for any questions contact me,"
