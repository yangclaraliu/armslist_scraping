In our experience, S&W Customer service will send owners the standard release button so long as they live in jurisdictions where they are legal. The Smith & Wesson M&P 15 Sport, writes the factory stenographers, is designed for just that Shooting sports. It is also ready to take on any other AR job description, personal defense, target, home protection, varmint hunting or just plinking. It features a 16 inch barrel, an adjustable style stock, adjustable front and rear sights, chrome lined gas key and bolt carrier. Veteran shoppers will note that the receiver lacks a forward bolt assist. Also, absent from the factory blurb, is chrome lined barrel, which this one is not. We have had superior accuracy from the absence of chrome lining in the Del-ton rifles, and this one will follow that example as well; chrome lining in a rifle barrel always adversely affects accuracy. Factory specs are caliber 5.56mm NATO / .223; action Gas Operated Semi Auto; Overall Length 35 inches; stock is M4 type 6 position fully retractable; Forend Thermo-Set M4 style vented Handguard; Sight Length 14.75 inches; Barrel 16 inches 1:9 twist Melonite coated 4140 Steel with ported muzzle brake, light barrel configuration underneath the forend; weight empty w/o mag 6.74 lbs; trigger pull approx. 7 pounds; upper & lower material 7075 T6 Aluminum; chromed gas key, and bolt carrier; hard coat black anodized finish; adjustable post front sight and fully adjustable and easily detachable dual aperture rear sight. Note that the receiver is a fully calibrated 12 slot Picatinny type, and the front sight gas assembly comes with bayonet or accessory lug. The MP15 comes standard with a Mag-Pul Polymer 10 shot magazine; we will sub 20 or 30 rounder if the buyer resides in a jurisdiction where they are not restricted. This rifle, then, is as versatile as anything on the market, including its Colt, Bushmaster, and Remington competitors that sell for two or three times as much money.

This is from Sig's traditional line for those that want Sig Sauer quality and reliability with the classic 1911 shape. A Commander length 4.25"" barrel on an Officer size 7rd frame, nice balance of size for both carrying and shooting. Everything on it is stainless, slide, frame, magazines, levers (even the black levers are Nitron coated stainless), semi-extended slide release, extended mag release button, and semi-extended safety lever with smooth edges for concealed carry, speed bump grip safety, skeletonized hammer, match-grade skeletonized adjustable trigger, barrel, bushing, and internals and the flush-fit barrel. The sights are low profile Novak sights with Siglite night sights which many think are the brightest on the market. 

This is not just an ""out of the box model"", the out of the box models are all stainless with blackwood grips. This one was custom ordered with contrasting black levers, backstrap, and rosewood grips. A new stock one runs 1k and the custom features I ordered on this one added another $200. I need a quick sale and will part with it for $900. It is mint condition like new in the box with everything it originally came with. I have only fired a single 7rd clip through it just to make sure it functioned perfectly back when I first ordered it (you would never be able to tell if I hadn't told you) and it is a tack driver! This is one of those guns that could be a legacy piece and has been treated as such, one you can pass on to your kids if you want and enjoy years and years of shooting out of it. Sig quit doing custom orders last year so you can't even order one like this anymore and as far as I know it's a 1 of 1. 

I don't really need trades as I am needing to free up some extra cash to buy a rare 1800s gun that I have been searching for years for. The only things I might be interested in taking as a partial trade would be a new or low round count Sig Sauer P938 SAS two-tone 9mm with a build date in 2014 for my GF, or an MP5 / HK94 9mm clone."

Overview 
The Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) replaced the Personal Armor 
System Group Troop (PASGT) fragmentation vest. The OTV is 
lighter than the PASGT and provides an increased level of 
protection when worn with ESAPI plates. The OTV is a protective 
vest worn over clothing for protection against fragmentation and 
small arms projectiles up to 9mm handgun rounds. When the OTV 
is worn with ESAPI plates the level of protection is upgraded to 
“specific” 5.56/7.62mm rifle threats. 

Features 
Vest design: 
• Front open vest 
• Web straps to allow attachment of other modular load carriage 
items 

Armor: (all removable): 
• Yoke & Collar, throat and groin protectors (all included)
• Soft armor panels (all included)
• ESAPI plates (optional and not included)
• Side SAPI carriers and plates (optional and not included)


All ballistic protection and attachments are removable to allow for 
ease of cleaning and repairing and can be replaced or upgraded 
as technology permits. The OTV is capable of securing soft armor 
panels and ESAPI plates in front and rear pockets. The ESAPI 
provides increased ballistic protection of the body’s vital organs. 

Fielding Status 
Fielding is complete and is currently being sustained by the 
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).

 Like new in the box, this is a beautiful Semi Auto 9mm, Feels good, Looks Good, well made. But its reasonably priced.
 The SAR Arms B6P is the ultimate handgun designed for price, safety, and comfort. Designed after the already comfortable CZ-75, SAR Arms altered the design slightly to make it fit nicer in the average hand, and also used a polymer material for the frame to lessen the weight of the firearm. Just like the CZ-75, the B6P features the slimline slide to take away some of the weight and because of the lightweight polymer frame the gun is top heavy when unloaded. However, as soon as there are rounds in the magazine, the SAR Arms B6P has great balance that allows the user to shoot accurately with speed. With the 4.5"" barrel, the B6P can be easily concealed and could also be used as a great home defense firearm with it's (17+1) capacity. 

 SAR ARMS B6P 9MM FEATURES 

 Some of the external firearm features are: 
•Right handed external manual safety 
•Slide release (also right handed) 
•Double and single action hammer 
•Right handed magazine release 

 Only 50 rounds down the tube, Shoots great, just thinning the herd.

I am looking to liquidate a couple extras to raise some cash for a new house. First one to go is a very nice Colt Wiley Clapp edition commander 1911 in 45 acp. It is in overall very good condition with a little holster wear on the slide. It wasn't a ""safe queen"", but I took very good care of it as I do with all my 1911's. I swamped out a couple of parts, I put in a full-length two-piece guide rod, and the trigger is a 3-hole adjustable instead of the think black trigger that came factory. Everything else is factory on it. It is a great shooter and a very sweet looking 1911. It comes with the factory box and 2 Colt mags. For those who don't know all the modifications of this edition here they are: 

Series 70 Firing System 
Lightweight Aluminum Alloy Frame 
Original 1911 Small Safety Lock 
Front and Rear Slide Serrations

So, up for sale is: 

(2) used 7 or 8 round CZ50/70 magazines in .32 ACP.  I have no way to verify how many rounds can be loaded as I don't have any .32, and I've seen listings for the exact same mag that list both numbers.  As you can see there are 7 sight holes that are in line and one that is offset.  The follower does go well below the last hole so if I had to guess I would say it's an 8 rounder.  I assume the mags are functional but have no way to verify.  Followers move smoothly.  These are OEM, and not circle K or any other aftermarket brand.

(1) holster.  Exactly the same size/style as a surplus PA63.  Again, I can make an assumption that a CZ50 fits in it fine, but I'm unable to verify.  There are specs on the size of a Hungarian FEG PA 63 out there that you could compare against.  Magazine fits great in the holder.

Looks like the mags are going for ~$40/ea + shipping on ebay(only listing right now is for $60 or a much less desirable aftermarket for $45), the holster sells for $15+shipping.  I'll offer the package(2 mags and holster) together for $80 shipped."

I have a DPMS AR-15 that has never been fired (except the 1 round required at the factory). I have all original parts, to include carry case. The rifle comes stock with a 6-point collapsible stock, bayonet lug, and flash suppressor. Currently installed and included are a blackhawk quad rail system, and a foregrip that turns into a bipod. This is one serious rifle, almost identical to an M4 carbine. I purchased this as a present to myself after leaving the military....and I never use it! I would rather see it go to someone who will truly take advantage of it."
