The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine will remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™."

This pistol is Parkerized. Slide is properly marked MARINA DE GUERRA ( late Navy markings ) . All numbers on the pistol match, with the exception of the magazine numbered 241 numbers earlier than the pistol. The post goes on to say that the Best available steel from Germany, Britian and Sweden were used in making them. They were made on Colt equipment , to Colt specs, and under Colt supervision. They are regarded as 100% Colt pistols. Completely made to interchange all parts with USGI parts. This pistol has had Wilson Combat sights installed front and rear, with no modification made to the slide ( original 1911A1 sights could easily be re-installed  ) Only the smallest amount of holster wear is visible at the muzzle. The lands and grooves appear to be as new. Overall condition is about 98%.  $695 ( try to buy a GI Colt for that ) FFL required outside of Oklahoma."

The ZT-9 could well be the strongest production knife on the face of the earth. At a full ¼ inch wide, the full-tang ZT-9 blade is thicker than standard bayonet blades. But the real difference is the quality of the steel—S30V. For all-around performance, S30V is the state-of-the-art in high-end stainless steel. Tough. Wear resistant. Yet sharpens easily. For storage—or when you’re using the ZT-9 as a field knife—there’s a high-impact polymer sheath with ballistic-nylon harness. This versatile sheath can be worn in the drop-down position, on a belt, or attached using the built-in slots. The ZT-9 is the result of the latest collaboration between Zero Tolerance Knives and Strider Knives—two companies dedicated to the finest in military and professional-duty knives.
The ZT-9 mounts on the M-16/M-4/AR-15 series of rifles. When mounted, a full six inches of blade extends beyond the muzzle—more than today’s standard-issue bayonets. Comes complete with sheath for use as a field knife.
