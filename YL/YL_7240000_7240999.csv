I am selling to surprise my wife with a trip for our anniversary. It has been amazing, and eaten every type of ammunition you can toss at it; I've put about 500 rounds through it myself. Thoroughly cleaned after each trip, stored in a climate safe when not out. All the parts are tight, and flow beautifully. There is some brass wear on the deflector. (Shown in pictures)
This is an AR pistol, however, due to recent changes by the ATF, it meets the measurement requirements to be shoulder-fired and also have a vertical grip attached. (Links to this info below)
I am asking $1,700 OBO - price is negotiable, no trades please. However please do not attempt to low-ball, as anyone interested should know the worth of what is here. It will also come with a large, hard case with foam cut to fit. It's much like a Pelican- wheels, handle, six different locking tabs.. And will also come with four PMags, a Magpul two/one-point sling and the Vortex Spitefire 1x shown in the pictures.
Here is a full parts list:
Ascend Armory matched billet receiver set: $500
Timney 3lb two-stage trigger: $240

UTG .5"" optic riser: $20
Odin GW ambi-mag release: $20
BCM QD end plate: $17
Extra QD swivel: $14
As you can see, no expense was spared on this build; and with the included Vortex optic, case and mags, you can't really go wrong.
If you are interested, you can text me (preferred) any time at REDACTED or call after 3 PM. I am willing to travel some distance north or south for serious inquiries, and can also send more pictures if desired. (Site wouldn't let me go very large on the size) Thanks a bunch for looking!"

I am selling to surprise my wife with a trip for our anniversary. It has been amazing, and eaten every type of ammunition you can toss at it; I've put about 500 rounds through it myself. Thoroughly cleaned after each trip, stored in a climate safe when not out. All the parts are tight, and flow beautifully. There is some brass wear on the deflector. (Shown in pictures)
This is an AR pistol, however, due to recent changes by the ATF, it meets the measurement requirements to be shoulder-fired and also have a vertical grip attached. (Links to this info below)
I am asking $1,700 OBO - price is negotiable, no trades please. However please do not attempt to low-ball, as anyone interested should know the worth of what is here. It will also come with a large, hard case with foam cut to fit. It's much like a Pelican- wheels, handle, six different locking tabs.. And will also come with four PMags, a Magpul two/one-point sling and the Vortex Spitefire 1x shown in the pictures.
Here is a full parts list:
Ascend Armory matched billet receiver set: $500
Timney 3lb two-stage trigger: $240
Fortis 12"" Night Rail: $240
Tactical Penguin TiNi BCG: $220
Faxon Arms 10.5"" barrel: $110
Hera Arms LC Gen 2 compensator: $110
Shockwave Blade kit: $90
MBUS sight set: $90
Odin GW adjustable gas block: $90
BCM ambi-charging handle: $85
Odin GW lower parts kit w/anti rotating pins: $60
Nemo Arms buffer .300 BLK customer buffer spring and buffer: $45
Seekins Precision 45-degree ambi-safety: $40
Magpul handstop kit and rail covers: $40
Mission First Tactical cheek weld: $25
MOE+ pistol grip: $24
UTG .5"" optic riser: $20
Odin GW ambi-mag release: $20
BCM QD end plate: $17
Extra QD swivel: $14
As you can see, no expense was spared on this build; and with the included Vortex optic, case and mags, you can't really go wrong.
If you are interested, you can text me (preferred) any time at (385) 445-8144 or call after 3 PM. I am willing to travel some distance north or south for serious inquiries, and can also send more pictures if desired. (Site wouldn't let me go very large on the size) Thanks a bunch for looking!"

Gun now cycle and functions as it should. $150may consider trades for ammo, reloading supplies, 9mm ar parts, or towards other guns"

RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18 model to be only 26.1 long, or as much as 14 shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.
The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work drop free and do not need to be tilted in. Six 20 round magazines included. Barrels on current models are 18 long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with Kel-Tec`s A2-style Flash Hider. Kel-Tec kydex cheek rest and 3"" Quad-Rail included.
All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action.
A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user`s preference."

The 5.45x39 Carbine Base 16"" Upper comes complete and ready to go onto any mil-spec AR 15 lower. This upper is built with the Adams Arms proprietary piston system. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The bolt and bolt carrier have also been protected by using an ion bond finish. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surp ammo without fear of the parts being unduly worn out. Each upper also comes with a 30 round magazine and a Wolff extra power hammer spring to ignite the older hardened primers.

Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/franklin-armory-bfs-iii-binary-firing-system-gen-3-5550/ Description BFS III Binary Firing System Gen 3 Description: The revolutionary Binary Firing System will be appreciated by three gun competitors, tactical shooters, and recreational enthusiasts. It features a three position selector that allows the user to switch from Mode 1 for Safe, Mode 2 for traditional Semiautomatic Mode, or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode, the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by simply moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Features: – Easy to installation. No custom fitting.– Better trigger pull. 4.5 pounds, +-.5 pound– The release phase now has a positive reset.– The design eliminates backup disconnector.– Stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. Specifications: – Works in every AR application: Ar10, AR15, MPX, etc.– Works in the F17 series in .17 WSM WITHOUT modification.– Works on .22LR uppers WITHOUT modification.– Works on 9mm uppers WITHOUT modification.

Improper installation, use, or tampering with the BFS™ will void the warranty and MAY LEAD TO UNINTENTIONAL DISCHARGE OF THE FIREARM THAT MAY LEAD TO INJURY OR EVEN DEATH.   No refunds will be issued for triggers after installation has been attempted.

Created by Toxey Haas nearly 30 years ago, Bottomland camo was one of the first patterns offered by Mossy Oak. Patterned on the natural foliage of the Mississippi bottomland. Bottomland is a mixture of different shades of brown, with small amounts of darker colors to break up the pattern. The camo patterns design works well at breaking up silhouettes by mimicking trees and ground cover. Bottomland Original camouflage is a great pattern to help the hunter blend into the back ground. Black Wolf Supply is proud to be one of the exclusive Dealers of Tru-Spec’s Bottomland Original Camo. Bottomland camo is one of the grandfathers of the Mossy Oak line of camouflage and still an excellent choice for hunters today.

This is a factory D Grade (#4, Peerless Grade) engraved gun made in 1912. Serial number 30905 appears on the receiver as well as the barrel. There is a brass plaque inletted into the left side of the butt stock which reads, “Presented To Ernest Pardo Chicago, Illinois 1919). I have no idea who Mr. Pardo might have been but clearly someone thought highly of him to gift such a fantastic firearm. I borrowed this description from The Great Model 8 & 81website. The Model 8’s receiver is a vast area of flat and semi curved surfaces, an ideal canvas for the Remington engraver. The “D” grade is the first entry into the gorgeously engraved Model 8’s. Remington marketed the work as, “a rich scroll hand engraving”. Indeed the engraving on these higher grade Model 8’s is a work of art. A combination of rarity, individual uniqueness, labor involved, and artistic art. Approximately one quarter of the receiver is covered in scroll work. Engraving can also be found on the base of the magazine with little to none on the sides of the magazine. There is a modest amount of scroll work at the rear of the barrel jacket. An engraved barrel jacket head is frequently witnessed in Remington’s period advertisements, but most 8D’s will have no engraving on the barrel jacket head whatsoever. According to Remington’s Pre-WWI catalogs, the Model 8 D, E, and F grades had “all working parts hand polished”. Specifications for the 8D stock and forearm were the same as the 8C but with a higher grade of English walnut. The checkering patterns were also a little more elaborate cut to 22 lines-per-inch. The gun has had two extra holes drilled and tapped on the left side of the receiver which are plugged with set screws. I assume this was done for a scope mount. The rear sight is Lyman #41R and the front is a Marble #6. I think it’s possible the barrel which is serial numbered to match the receiver has been reblued. I am basing this on the faintness of the barrel address. There are some light scratches on the barrel hood but it still retains 85% blue with no dints or dings. I don’t think the receiver has been refinished as the engraving is still sharp and I see no evidence of polishing. I am going to say it retains 50% of the original finish,lastly shipping is available for it."

They had many nice features which improved reliability and usability like coned barrel (eliminated barrel bushing, increasing reliability), full guide rod (increasing reliability), hi dpi front strap checkering, big dot night sights, flared and lowered ejection port, polished internals, lightweight frame, non-reflective finish, and some other features that I can’t remember right now. This is a really nice 1911 pistol, small enough to be easily concealable. The pistol with come with kimber box and papers and two magazines. The pistol came with only one Kimber mag from the factory. Again, this is as fully loaded gun as custom 1911 made by Kimber can be.
