Sometimes your requirements call for added versatility in a tactical rifle. Enter the SOCOM II. It brings you all the compact power, performance and reliability of the SOCOM 16 with the added capability of a rail system.
The SOCOM II has a quad-rail that will allow you to mount whatever accessories your application requires. Maybe you need a light, laser or vertical foregrip – there’s ample space for all of these. Co-witnessed night vision and low-magnification optics are commonly found on rifles in this class, and the extended rail option gives you plenty of room for this. The SOCOM II has the same specially-engineered 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle brake as the SOCOM 16, so you can expect the same excellent recoil reduction and low muzzle rise. The two-stage military trigger and fast acquisition sights – a ghost ring rear aperture and XS Tritium front sight – are more features that make the SOCOM II a great choice for a tactical rifle.
The SOCOM II is the next step in the evolution of the powerful, compact tactical rifle. Bring Enough Gun!

Research Beretta J92M9A3M for exact features.Based on military feedback, Beretta has designed another member of the M9 family, the M9A3 9mm pistol. The M9A3 delivers all of the critical features that today's combat professionals require in demanding environments.The redesigned pistol features a reduced-circumference grip, universal slide design with a universal sadfety decocker , an extended threaded barrel, a beveled magazine well, oversize mag-release button, a 3-slot Picatinny rail, front and back strap checkering, reduced circumference grip with thin grip panels as well as a wrap-around backstrap grip (included, not installed), and 3- sand-resistant magazine for maximum firepower.The M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law enforcement and consumers demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to perform exceptionally in any tactical or home defense situation. Proudly made in the U.S.A.M9A3: Evolution of the Tactical-Pistol ConceptWith the M9A3 semiauto pistol, Beretta has created a coming-together of all the tactical and functional features that today’s combat professionals may require. From Vertec-style thin grip to universal slide design, from a beveled magazine well to oversize mag-release button, from a 3-slot built-in Picatinny rail to high-capacity capability for maximum firepower, the M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law-enforcement and VIP-protection professionals demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition. Vertec-Style Thin Grip for Instinctive PointabilityThe Vertec-style vertical grip of the M9A3 offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent. Versatility and easy AccessorizationrEasy to Use and MaintainThe M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds, and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over.Caliber: 9mm Luger -Barrel: 5.2"" threaded -Tan Slide & Frame -Polymer Grip -3-slot picatinny rail -Beveled magazine well -Removable fixed night sights -Three, sand-resistant 17-round magazines -Overall Weight: 35.2 oz.UNIVERSAL SAFETY DECOCK LEVERS"

It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels. It also has molded finger grooves for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model has a Gray frame, black slide with 3-dot sights, and includes two (2), 15-round magazines.

As I understand it, this is the transitional gun manufactured between the Registered Magnum and the Model 27. It’s a N frame Smith chambered in .357 Magnum. I can’t say I’ve had the opportunity to shoot an N frame .357, but I imagine the frame size makes shooting the .357 far more enjoyable. The gun has a fair amount of holster wear on the cylinder and some by the muzzle, but looks to be in fairly good condition otherwise. Armslist won’t allow me to post more than one high resolution photo. Please email me for detailed photos to judge condition for yourself. I don’t know all that much about revolvers, but feel free to contact me with any questions you may have and I’ll answer as best I can."
