In USPSA Production Division, CZ pistols are now used by twice as many top-level competitors than any other maker. Given that popularity, it was high time to up the ante. Starting from scratch, CZUB engineers took the best features of the original Shadow and improved upon them. More than two years later, we’re seeing the fruits of their efforts. With a higher beavertail and undercut trigger guard, the shooter’s hand is able to be as close to the bore axis as possible. With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. Increased weight at the dust cover/rail also helps keep the muzzle down. The Shadow 2’s swappable mag release has an adjustable, extended button with three settings to allow shooters to set it in the spot most comfortable for them. Best of all, new trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset. A hardy nitride finish coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion. Thin blue aluminum grips have healthy checkering to match the fine front and backstrap checkering of the pistol itself. Sitting atop the slide are a set of target sights — fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage).Available at two conveinient locations-Forsyth-15262 US HWY 160Forsyth, Mo 65653REDACTED-Ozark-737 N 20th StOzark, Mo 65721REDACTED"

Trigger components are fabricated from 8620 alloy steel and S7 Tool steel, machined to exacting tolerances and finished for the longest service life possible. Minimal Lock-time is designed into the assembly using controlled hammer weight and balance and activated using a Rocket Wire hammer spring. This assures repeatable function, with either commercial or military grade ammunition. Positive Trigger Reset allows a quick follow up shot on target.
