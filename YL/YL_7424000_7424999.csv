It does have a discreet Century import marking as well.This is in original military configuration.  The stock is in good condition for its age, showing just a few dings, as well as some flaking of the varnish used by the Soviets on their stocks. I will include 220 rounds of hard-to-find milsurp ammunition with the sale.   These are the copper washed rounds that in my opinion are far superior to the plain steel commercial rounds that can be hard to extract from Mosins.In addition, you will get many accessories with the gun and all are in excellent shape. These include a bayonet, a period-correct leather and canvas sling, an oil/solvent bottle, ammunition pouches and a canvas tool bag with all the tools.  
Face to face cash sale to MN resident. Must have PTP or PTC. I would be willing to travel (within reason - i.e. southern Metro, Rochester, Mankato) to meet a serious buyer. Reply via e-mail. I will remove this ad when sold.
P.S. Lowballers will be ignored, as will people who ask if the gun is still available."

Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case..Features:With the interchangeable backstraps, Springfield has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter’s hand positionTraditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

The photo shows the actual SSAR-15 SBS being sold. There are more pictures on the Slidefire web site.All three of these stocks are designed to simulate full-automatic fire using either an AR-15 or AK-47 semi-automatic rifle.Future sales of these and other bump-fire stocks are almost certainly going to be banned, and probably very soon. For now, however, these Slidefire stocks can be sold and purchased legally.At this point, my prices are firm. I expect prices to rise, not fall, over the next week. I will accept cash in a face-to-face sale. Paypal is best when a sale involves shipping. Buyers who want me to ship can choose the service they want, but they will need to pay for shipping charges. I cannot ship to California because bump-stocks are banned in that state.Thanks,TK$400 for SSAK-47 XRS, right-handed (for AK-47 rifles)$500 for SSAR-15 SBS, right-handed (for AR-15 rifles)$775 for SSAR-15 MOD, ambidextrous (fancier, adjustable stock for AR-15 rifles)"

It was dated mid to late 1800s, and is believed to be Belgian. On the rib, it says Twist, with another word infront of it, I was told it used to say Damascus Twist. Very beautiful gun, would make a great decoration.  It does need minor work however, it is missing one of the brass locks that holds the barrel pin, the right hammer needs a screw, and the left hammer key is stripped. Other then that, it is in very good condition esp for being so old! The previous owner was a gun nut, and told me it does function, as he fired it once, cleaned it and put it away. I really don't know what the gun is worth, so make me an offer, but please don't low ball me, I have sold and own several antique firearms and know it is worth more then $50....

Very beautiful gun, would make a great decoration.  It does need minor work however, it is missing one of the brass locks that holds the barrel pin, the right hammer needs a screw, and the left hammer key is stripped. Other then that, it is in very good condition esp for being so old! The previous owner was a gun nut, and told me it does function, as he fired it once, cleaned it and put it away. I really don't know what the gun is worth, so make me an offer, but please don't low ball me, I have sold and own several antique firearms and know it is worth more then $50.... Also maybe open to trades, doesn't hurt to ask! Anything hunting/guns. Please message me with any offers, trades, or questions!Have more pictures upon requestI will ship for an additional $25.
