Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 models now feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability. The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.For more information contact The Tactical Edge at REDACTED, or stop in the shop at 1925 Fort Campbell Blvd, Clarksville TN 37042"

Designed to be a lightweight and versatile low profile armour carrier, offering enhanced mobility without compromising protection.
The RPC has been developed to hold medium and large SAPI and ESAPI stand alone plates and the most common 10” x 12“ I.C.W. plates available. Plate pockets have been backed with 3D mesh for added ballistic performance, comfort and dispersal of body heat. The Recon Plate Carrier comes standard with ladder style cummerbunds that attach to the RPCs front via 2 removable ITW SR Clips. This allows rapid access when getting in and out of the RPC (ITW SR Clips have a combined breaking strength of 600lbs per side). The RPCs shoulders can be worn in 3 different configurations as a slick low profile with the addition of Velcro padded shoulders and wrap around sleeve for hydration and comms channelling.
The RPC comes as standard with a removable MOLLE front flap held in place by 2 vertical clips, and strong Velcro which allows the panel to be removed and replaced with a wide variety of preconfigured weapon-specific pouch panels (Warrior’s removable triple open mag pouch, and Warrior’s triple covered M4 pouch) and Warrior’s new Pathfinder Chest Rig. The RPC also integrates with Warrior’s new Back Panel.

Has Talley rings, and will include the stock stainless rings and the box we recently took it out of.We took it out of the box to sight in, shot 5 rounds, the last two were in the same hole. I really like the gun, but my son is 14, and he was a little nervous and akward operating it with the safety because its a 2 stage. This model locks the bolt and trigger when the safety is on. I now want him to have a 3 stage safety. This gun cost $1000 + with scope and rings."

I have done a very minor polishing  job on the FP block and the trigger bar.This gun is well sorted and taken care of, I just don't shoot or carry it much so it's probably time to part ways for things I will shoot.Permit to carry or purchase is needed as well as signing a bill of sale written up by myself.

I also had a few components in the suspension replaced recently.There are small (quarter size) rust spots in a few places in the truck's body, but nothing too serious that would take much work to fix, if you wanted to.The truck passed inspection this September, but to pass inspection next September it will need new brake pads, as well as some work or replacement of the muffler (which is rusting out).The truck is exempt from emissions inspection due to its age.The engine has run great over the last year, and I've no problems whatsoever with either the engine or powertrain. All said, it's in great shape for the money.  If you're going to use it just on a farm, you probably won't have to put anything into it. However, by next September, if you want it to pass inspection and be street legal for registration in PA, you'll probably have to put about $500 in parts into it.. I'm guessing.  Maybe less.. as these trucks' parts are pretty cheap and readily available at auto parts stores. Feel free to ask me anything, and I'll be happy to send additional pix if you'd like."
