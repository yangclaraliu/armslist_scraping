I bought this a few years back, off a guy who said he'd had it for some years and only shot it a few times cuz it was too heavy for him to lug around, using black hills 168gr ammo he claimed 1/4"" groups @ 100. He sold it to me with a crappy scope (he told me so) I wasted a box of ammo hoping to sight it in, to no avail. First thing first, I got a new scope, I chose a nightforce shv 4-14 and took it out again, I clearanced the top rail to be able to fit a 56mm obj lense. With some cheap freedom munition 155gr Amax I printed a 3/4"" group at 200yds! Freedom 168's tended to open up to about 1.5"" and the cheapest stuff at Walmart ZQI 150gr was about baseball sized groups. I don't handload, and I stocked up on freedom since it did so well. After I saw what it would do I added a Lantac dragon 7.62 brake, geissele super dynamic combat trigger, pof roll pin, grip, and the PRS stock. Since I bought it, I've probly sent 200ish rounds through it, and it's never had a single hiccup. Runs really clean too, compared to 223/556 and especially 300blk. I painted it camo with krylon, the paint is wearing in good. If you wanted to remove it denatured alcohol takes it right off, or just paint it to your liking. The price reflects just the rifle, no scope, and no bipod. Scope would run about $1200 and the bipod $200. I will include 1 painted 20rd pmag, as well as 1 box of the 155gr amax, so you can verify, and sight in your scope. Call or text REDACTED. No lowballs, it's an awesome rifle and I'd just as soon keep it"

I am merely interested in what is out there. -I got rid of the ambidextrous safety. It is notorious for being gritty and unreliable and had it built with a tradition safety that has been correctly modified for semi-auto use. This eliminates the tendency for the hammer to drop when disassembling. All articulating surfaces polished-This has the stock wire side folding stock all Tantals had. Has has had the action worked to make it smooth to deploy. Has the regular handguard and a Hogue Overmolded pistol grip. -5 mags in total. One Russian ""Plum"", two Duracoated metal mags, and two black Bulgarian poly mags with the steel reinforced feed lips. -Cerakote finish, don't remember the exact color, but it is a little darker than FDE. - Had it built with an upgraded barrel. The stock barrel has a large extension to hold a multipurpose barrel device. I had this built with a Green Mountain barrel with it threaded in 1/2""x28 tpi so it could take all AR style muzzle devices. It currently has the typical slant brake to make it as short as possible, but for the right price/trade I can include a DPMS Miculek brake or a Smith Enterprises Good Iron Brake-Custom ground and polished Tapco G2 trigger and hammer. This is the best AK trigger I've used-Polished bolt guides and rails-Circle 10 AK U-Notch sight. Game changer on the AK, in my opinion. -A few hundred rounds of Silver Bear ammo-Some more stuff I'm forgetting right now"

Hi-Point Firearms of Dayton, Ohio has been distributing the Hi-Point line of pistols and carbines for several years now.
You’ll a lot of good reports about the Hi-Point carbine. Shooters that have them seem to love them.
The stock of the Hi-Point carbine is made of a reinforced polymer.
Great the accuracy and performance. The carbine’s sixteen and one-half inch barrel the performance of 9mm ammo is substantially greater than from a handgun barrel. Also, due to the gun’s heft and the excellent telescoping butt pad, felt recoil is nothing. There is absolutely no pain at all delivered to the shooter’s shoulder. Upon firing, the butt plate has about one-half inch of travel to absorb what little recoil there is. The Hi-Point carbine fires from a closed bolt, and is a straight blowback action.
It is a lot of fun to shoot, and is very easy on recoil. The magazine holds ten rounds, and fits flush with the pistol grip. The charging handle is easy to operate, even for someone with limited hand strength. The Hi-Point would make a very good home defense carbine.The Hi-Point carbine has a very good warranty. It is a lifetime warranty, and follows the weapon, so if you sell it, the next owner gets the same warranty.  Of course, you do not want to file a warranty claim, but I did some research.  They said Hi-Point is great – they do the work and send it back promptly (and fix it right the first time).
The Hi-Point carbine is 100% made in the USA.

Stainless steel slide and barrel.
Easy to operate.  One button drops the magazine. 
Uses the excellent Smith & Wesson 3 Dot site system for easy target acquisition.
High capacity magazine (also made from stainless steel).
 
A safety built into the trigger ensures that the pistol fires only when the trigger is pulled.  Bullets are fired when an internal striker hits the round. Easy take down and field disassembly: two recessed buttons below the barrel just forward of the trigger must be simultaneously slid downward so that the slide and barrel can be removed (similar to the Glock).
 
Grip uses the excellent Smith & Wesson design that is ergonomically perfect.  Simple, streamlined and sleek -- There is no hammer to cock or to inadvertently snag on clothing (helps for concealed carry on a weapon in this category).

This is the model that has the external hammer spur which allows you to manually place the revolver in single action. It comes with all the original accessories and case to include the pink grips and key for the internal lock. The internal lock mechanism has been removed by a gun smith, this feature is a useless gimmick added to appease lawyers and those who believe it adds safety. All that lock adds is an additional mechanism that can malfunction at the worse possible time, a malfunction anyone who actually shoots their firearms or who has been around newer Smith revolvers can testify to witnessing. I'll include the pieces needed to restore said lock if you'd like. Thank you for your interest and do not hesitate to message me with questions. Asking 400.00$ OBO.
