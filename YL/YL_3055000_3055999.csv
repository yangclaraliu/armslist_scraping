◾ 3-Ply, dual chamber pocket bags.

Description: 
This pant could be worn anywhere you would wear a pair of Dockers or similar pants.  They can pass as dress pants, professional pants, or just for dress-casual.  The Chino is ideal for situations where discretion is important. The Elite Concealed Carry Chino has the clean profile of a standard pair of pants with no external cargo or utility pocketing, but offers the added advantage of a hidden chamber pocket strategically constructed to reduce printing.  The conceal pocket is loose and deep on the inside, and no one will have a clue you are carrying.  

It is perfect for those situations where you need to have your shirt tucked in all day and don't want to or can't wear a jacket to cover up your holster.

This is a VERY nice and VERY accurate shooting rifle capable of shooting over 1000 yards if you can. I believe it is a #4, MK1 because that is what I see on it. The price is $400.00. I do have some ammo to go with it. ** I would also be willing to make a trade for a WORKING and fully functioning riding lawn tractor even up if it is what im looking for."

Technical Details / Condition: 

For sale is a Mauser Model 1910 pocket pistol in 25ACP. Marked 'Waffenfabrik Mauser A.S. Obendorf A.N. Mauser Patent' with Mauser Stamp on frame and on original grips. All numbered parts are matching with serial number #80xxx placing production date between 1914 and 1921. Magazine is original but unnumbered. Bore is worn but sufficiently rifled still. Finish is worn on lower aspect of frame but overall okay, looks like holster wear. Grips are original. I believe this is a transitional model 1910/1914 as per page 3 of http://www.mauserguns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Mauser1910.pdf. 

Additional Information:

Although still a pocket gun, it is larger than most 25acp handguns which was very helpful shooting at the range. The gun functions well but did not like aluminum cased ammo (at least in my experience). Accuracy was comparable to a .38 snub nose in my hands, about what I expected from it so I think in better hands it would group well.  No military or other markings save the proof mark and Mauser banner and writing mentioned above. Was a fun range toy but I have moved on to more fun german guns. 

Included is a partial box of blazer 25 auto 50 grains, 40 rounds. 

Terms: 

Please contact me through Armslist if interested. I live in louisville and am willing to travel within louisville to make the sell. FFL transfer is possible but if your FFL will not accept transfers from individuals, then a transfer fee may be added along with shipping.

The slide is also a Remsport assembly that I purchased fully assembled off a fully built pistol and it has been fired. It's forged carbon steel and cerakoted in armorers black, w/tight fitting barrel bushing, Wilson Combat U notch rear serrated sight, front night sight, Novak cut.  I fired it on a Colt officer frame I have and it worked flawless. The front of the slide has a chip in the cerakote so it will need to be recoated at some point. The front sight still works, age unknown. The slide was originally built by John, the owner of Remsport.

I had the slide fitted recently to the frame by pistol smith Greg Derr, Derr Precision in Marshfield, Ma., it slides like butter on a hot skillet. 

8/25/14 ... I just ordered over $400 in parts to finish this build, the price will obviously go up. Greg Derr has the pistol again and is fitting a Beavetail Grip safety, flush cutting the barrel/doing a small crown, tweaking the a Wilson extended thumb safety to better fit the frame contour and fitting a Greider trigger to the frame. I ordered mostly Ed Brown Parts, fire control, thumb safety and springs, and a Wilson ext. slide stop like the one in the picture except in SS.  I'm going to have the cerakote stripped off the slide , coating choice is still in the air.

The parts are in , I will finish the gun to the buyers liking depending on the $

  I have over $1500 into this project. Remsport is a supplier for some of the HIGH END 1911 makers. After some digging the ONLY high end maker that I could find that sold 25lpi checkered parts is ED BROWN, so this may be the same frame and slide assembly as what they use???

The .357 Sig Round was developed by Sig Sauer in the Early-Mid 90's and is based on the .40 Smith & Wesson Cartridge, the cartridges are so similar that their magazines interchange(some barrels do also-more info below) but they are very differrent still, the .357 Sig Round is Drastically more powerful and is in a class of it's own, they basically made a round that could be carried in the high capacity semi-automatic handguns with the same ballistics as the hard hitting .357 Magnum. They accomplished their goal, the .357 Sig Round is the Round Chosen for duty by the FBI and countless other Law Enforcement Agencies including the Virginia State Police. It is known for its laser beam accuracy and flat trajectory, its accurate at well over 100 yards fired from a pistol, and it travels through barriers like car doors, windshields, walls and others better than any other round. Its so powerful because it travels at 1400-1700+ Feet Per Second and has 600-700+ Foot Pounds of Energy from Regular Full Metal Jacket Ammunition and even higher energy from Jacketed Hollow Point Self Defense Type Ammunition. Its an awesome self-defense round and all around fun to shoot as well. If you've not familiar with the .357 Sig Round.you'll fall in Love with it like myself, and so many others have. This is a truly awesome round and its fired from a very durable, always reliable Glock Handgun. This Gun can easily be 2 Guns in One with a simple barrel change, for a little over $100 you can buy a new .40 Smith and Wesson barrel for this pistol and they interchange perfectly and function with 100% Reliability. Glock even lists the barrels as being directly interchangeable since the Glock 33 Pistol and the Glock 27 Pistols are built exactly the same with all of the same parts You can easily drop in the .40 S&W Barrel and have 100% Reliability and Functionality, you can even use the same magazines, the .357 Sig Magazines feed the 40 S&W Ammo Flawlessly. When Glock makes the G33 and G27 the parts are all exactly the same except for the barrels so they simply mark one .357 and one .40 and use the different barrels and Mark the Guns Differently and sell 2 seperate guns to maximize profits. They don't want us to know that the only difference is the barrel because they want us to buy a $600+ Gun instead of a $109.95 Barrel when we want different caliber guns but the secret is out, this is the same with Sig Sauerr Pistols, Smith and Wesson Pistols, and several others, the .357 Sig Barrels and .40 S&W Barrels are direct Replacements for one another. this Gun can also be a reliable 9mm Pistol as well but that requires a specially made conversion barrel and different magazines specifically for 9mm Ammo which is still very cheap(for 100% Reliability with 9mm you should use a 9mm Extractor/Ejector and possibly a different recoil spring but many people use 9mm with only a conversion barrel and the 9mm specific magazines and have no issues or complaints), you could basically have 3 Guns in One for a fraction of the price, this would be ideal in a situation where ammo was hard to find- out of the  2-3 calibers you owned, you would think at least one could be found.

Included: Facory Glock Hard Plastic Case with Glock 33 Subcompact .357 Sig Pistol, 3 Factory Glock Magazines, Glock Speedloader, Cleaning Rod with Brush and Patch Holder for Cleaning, 3 Different Sizes of Backstraps that change the size of the Grip according to whatever is most comfortable in your hands and Installation Tool, All Factory Paperwork including Warranty Card, Owner's Manual with all Information and Instructions, Details about the Pistol & Glock Tournaments, Events, a Retail Catalog, and More, Factory Fired Shell Sealed in Envelope, factory supplied safety padlock, everything you would get if you went to your local Gun Dealer and bought a new pistol identical to this one.  VERY IMPORTANT: THE .357 SIG CARTRIDGE IS BASED ON THE .40 S&W CARTRIDGE AND THEREFORE YOU CAN EASILY CONVERT THIS GUN TO A .40 S&W BY SIMPLY DROPPING IN A NEW BARREL THAT COSTS ONLY $109.95 AND YOU DONT HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE, THE GUN WILL WORK PERFECTLY WITH THE .40 S&W BARREL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL,, YOU DO NOT EVEN HAVE TO CHANGE MAGAZINES, THE .357 SIG AND .40 S&W AMMO ARE SO MUCH ALIKE THE MAGAZINES ARE INTERCHANGABLE. THE GLOCK 33 HAS THE EXACT SAME DIMENSIONS AS THE POPULAR GLOCK 27 SUBCOMPACT .40 S&W PISTOL BOTH INSIDE AND OUT AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CHANGE THE BARREL WHICH TAKES LESS THAN 30 SECONDS AND YOU HAVE A .40 S&W AND A .357 SIG IN ONE GUN. THE G27 AND G33 ARE IDENTICAL AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE BARREL- WHEN GLOCK BUILDS THEM THEY USE THE EXACT SAME GUN AND JUST USE DIFFERENT BARRELS- THAT'S WHY THE .40 S&W CONVERSION IS SO POPULAR, YOU CAN BUY A FACTORY GLOCK 27 BARREL OR A BARREL FROM AN AFTERMARKET COMPANY LIKE LONE WOLF OR BARSTO, OR ONE OF THE MANY OTHER QUALITY BARREL MANUFACTURERS AND JUST SWAP BARRELS AND EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECT- THE SPRINGS, EXTRACTOR, EJECTOR, ALL INTERNAL PARTS, PLUS THE MAGAZINES/CLIPS AND EVERYTHING ELSE ARE 100% INTERCHANGABLE AND WHEN CONVERTED TO .40 S&W BY.CHANGING JUST THE BARREL THE GUN FUNCTIONS 100% RELIABLE WITH ABSOLUTELY Y PROBLEMS AT ALL, I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN THIS DONE AND THERE ARE LOTS OF ARTICLES ABOUT IT ONLINE AND YOUTUBE VIDEOS TO SHOW YOU THIS. THAT IS ALL GLOCK DOES WHEN BUILDING THEM AT THEIR FACTORY, THE GLOCK CATALOG EVEN LISTS THE .357 SIG AND .40 S&W BARRELS AS BEING INTERCHANGABLE. SO FOR JUST OVER $100 YOU CAN HAVE 2 GUNS IN ONE, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CHANGE THE BARREL WHICH CAN EASILY BE DONE IN UNDER 30 SECONDS-THE GLOCK PISTOL IS THE EASIEST PISTOL TO TAKE APART AND PUT BACK TOGETHER OUT OF ALL PISTOLS IVE EVER USED, THATS MY OPINION AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FEEL THE SAME WAY, IF YOU AREN'T FAMILIAR ILL SHOW YOU AND YOU'LL FEEL LIKE A PRO AFTER YOU DO IT A FEW TIMES!

It is a double tower small frame 4"" barrel in .32 Smith & Wesson. It is a ""third generation"" or ""third model"", with a serial number of J6015. The third model safety hammer ""J"" prefixes were manufactured from 1927 through 1940, though I haven't done the research to find out exactly what year this one was made. It does not fit my hand well at all, which is why I'm selling it. The bluing has definitely seen better days, but it functions quite well for its age. I fired 11 rounds through it, and had one problem. One round was a ""light strike"". I'm certainly no gunsmith, but I think it has a little too much play in the top latch, resulting in a hair too much distance between the firing pin and the primer of the cartridge. Maybe you can fix this, but I know I don't want to try. I just fire 'em. The cylinder timing works perfect, and the ejector works great as well. It comes with a box of Magtech ammo, 39 rounds left.

The Russian Saiga-308 Winchester features a heavy duty reinforced barrel trunion, thick wall premium receiver with side-rail installed, and a chrome lined bull barrel. From the custom fluted 16¼ inch barrel to the premium GUN-KOTE™ finish, this is a true professional tactical conversion. This is a unique custom built precision tactical weapon available only from Shooters Wholesale. Every detail has been carefully thought out before our craftsmen perform the professional conversion. We select premium components that complement the incredible reliability of the Russian Saiga AK47 design. We press out the barrel to start the process. The barrel is cut to 16¼ inches, crowned, and then the muzzle is turned down so we can install 14:1 metric left hand threads. Shooters Wholesale’ proprietary barrel fluting process is unique; we are the only company in the USA that custom flutes the SAIGA .308 Winchester barrel! Our proprietary barrel fluting adds rigidity for increased accuracy; increases surface area for improved heat dissipation; reduces overall weight; and adds a unique look found only on our custom SAIGA-XTR rifle. We locate the trigger guard next to the mag latch and install a customized G2 trigger group. The heavy duty muzzle break helps to reduce felt recoil a gives you better shooting control. We proudly feature GUN-KOTE™ premium firearms metal coating & finish on our SAIGA-XTR rifles. This $200 thermal cured hi-tech finish sets our custom SAIGA-XTR apart from factory and “air dried paint finishes”. Premium GUN-KOTE™ is superior to parkerized, blued, and paint finishes in both durability and performance. It was first specified by the U.S. Military for use on SOCOM Special Sniper Weapons (SPR’s) in 2003. GUN-KOTE™ satin matte black finish helps to protect metal parts from rust, corrosion, & scratches and will not break down, peel or dissolve. In fact, once applied and thermal-cured, the only way to remove it is through abrasive blasting. GUN-KOTE™ is resistant to all known gun solvents, oils, and thinners. GUN-KOTE™ is a highly specialized, hard, abrasion resistant coating that meets ALL MILITARY SPECIFICATIONS for protective metal coatings. GUN-KOTE™ is formulated to provide excellent impact resistance, lubricity (meets military dry firing specs), heat dissipation, chemical resistance, corrosion protection, durability, and scratch resistance. It is specially formulated for salt corrosion protection and meets the US Military requirements for ""Resistant to Chemicals"". The Israeli manufactured and patented FAB Defense GL-SHOCK™ butt stock system is the first functional recoil-reducing collapsible stock and features: 5 sling attachment points, storage compartment, and rubber buttpad. The reduction in felt recoil is dramatic and translates into much better control of the weapon. The cheek riser is fully adjustable to give you a perfect sight picture. The GL-SHOCK™ butt stock system is battle tested and proven! The aluminum quad-rail forearm is precision machined and custom fit to each SAIGA-XTR 308 rifle. It includes black rubber rail guards. The MonoGrip© US mfg. pistol grip has finger groves and is made from a recoil absorbing compound. PACKAGE INCLUDES: Two 24rd Promag polymer magazines; One Promag 10rd polymer mag; One factory original 8rd polymer mag; Dragon Claw barrel mount folding aluminum bipod with extendable legs; heavy duty quick detachable machined aluminum vertical foregrip; MaxOps A-tac single point sling with HK style hook and a quick detachable loop swivel; factory instruction manual.

Fully adjustable, supports handgun by trigger guard and bottom of frame at dust cover. Will fit SPS if holster is fit to trigger guard. Adjustable belt opening"
