Outstanding option for those that can't legally carry automatic knives, but want a fast deploying blade suitable for any emergency or crisis. The Propel is a tactical folder with assisted opening and a full-size blade that’s as easy to handle and carry as it is durable and capable in the line of duty or as part of your mild-mannered EDC items. Built using premium S30V steel to offer the most reliable edge possible. The partially serrated blade adds utility when cutting stubborn materials like stout nylon rope or tough plastics, but it’s the premium quality of the steel and durable nature of the G-10 composite handle that set this knife apart from others. The smooth pivot of Gerber’s Assisted Opening 2.0 mechanism offers seamless, one-handed opening, while the reliable plunge lock and safety switch secure the blade where you want it. Think easy, one-handed operation matched with a slim profile that sits comfortably in your pocket, whether you’re traveling for business or pleasure. The tanto-style blade’s matte-black oxide coating adds a stealth element where a stainless blade might give you away. Personal preference dictates how you carry your knife, so Gerber designed the Propel AO with a three-way adjustable clip to customize the knife’s orientation in your pocket or on your belt. You can set it for tip-up or tip-down storage and left-hand or right-hand bias. Gerber knows that to earn daily-use status since a folding tactical knife needs to fit your hand and pocket. The Propel’s composite maintains a slim profile that complements the knife’s balanced feel and still provides secure handling in all conditions. Ultimately what get is a full-size tactical knife that carries discreetly and comfortably on the job and off. $106, Ships free priority mail. Cash FTF, credit or debit shipped in the US only.

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match. It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace. There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. I am willing to part with the old dog for the right deal. I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

Ashthorpe of Severn Stoke, Worcester, and the seam is nearly invisible.  Approximate dimensions: 14"" LOP to front trigger, 1.5"" DAC, 2"" DAH, ~3/16"" cast off.  6lb. 7oz and very well balanced.  Features Lancaster's distinctive vine-leaf engraving.  Very good condition but does show a bit of bluing wear on the floor plate and muzzle.  Includes Jeff's Outfitters canvas and leather case with accessories and reproduction trade label.  I also have some assorted 2.5 inch shells which I can include at extra cost.  May consider trade for Darne slide action shotgun, or partial trade for Walther PPK or Colt New Frontier 22/22WMR convertible. Delivery to front range area sometimes possible.  Scammers and lowballers will be ignored.  While not as well known in America, Lancaster made guns of similar quality to Holland & Holland, Purdey, and Boss.  Annie Oakley owned four Lancasters.  The O-grade is a unique boxlock built on Frederick Beesley's patent self-opening mechanism, similar to Purdey's self opening sidelock which was also invented by Beesley.  Most London gunmakers outsourced production of their boxlocks to the bigger Birmingham firms; it has been suggested that Lancaster's O-grade was so named because it was built by Charles Osborne.  Many more photos available on request."

But this is what i was told about this one which is not much and i hope the pictures help if i miss some thing. The top hand guard was cut at the back of the hand guard ring to add a rail for a a4 clone if so desired which i have for it. The barrel is a 2 groove and marked RA 12-43 ( excellant bore ), there's no markings on the stock that i can see so it might be an after market stock. Other than that, that's about all i know about it. It does have a nice smooth action and cycles fine but i have not shot it....So that being said if you have any question i will do my best to answer them....email me with trade offers, I don't want any of the following SHOT GUNS, BLACK POWDERS, .22's and no .40 cal unless it's a SIG BLUELINE....Any Bull**** offers will be ignored....Thanks, Mark 989264five9four9"
