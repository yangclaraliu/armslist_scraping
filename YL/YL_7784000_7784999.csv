This is not the 63DS model. This has the milled reciever. Stock is solid and doesn’t wobble. Light use and in great shape. Saw two of these sell on gunbroker for 1200. Realistically with the market the way it is. I don’t expect to get that much. But I do know what this rifle is worth. I am open to trades. Nice handguns. H&K 45s, USP, other rifles."

The scope is a NightForce NXS 3.5-15x50.Ed Brown has created what he arguably feels is the perfect action. It features a cylindrical body for maximum rigidity and close-fitting bolts lapped to perfection with exact tolerances. The Model 702 action is machined from heat-treated barstock with solid carbide end mills to ensure absolute concentricity and alignment. This is the most expensive way to produce an action.The rear bridge is precision ground, not belt sanded, to assure a precise surface for attaching the rear scope base. The receiver is tapped for 8-40 screws for the strength required of today’s heavier optical sights. The scope-mount hole spacing is that of the Remington M700. The breech threads are cut with a CNC single-point carbide thread tool. The socket-head action screws are extremely durable. The Ed Brown Marine Sniper utilizes the short action with a four-round, 2.850-inch magazine box.The hand-fitted bolts, with welded-on handles, are machined from barstock, not cast. Unique spiral flutes on the bolt body distribute lubrication, enhance self-cleaning and permit a tighter-fitting bolt. The bolt’s locking lugs are hand lapped. There is a battle-proven M16-type extractor for reliable push-feed action. At .30 inch in thickness, the heavy-duty recoil lug is 60 percent thicker than standard.The machined and serrated three-position safety lever securely locks the bolt when engaged. The push-button bolt stop, outside the action and above the stock line, is easy to operate. The triggerguard and magazine floorplate are machined-steel components. The M700-type trigger is adjustable for pull weight and overtravel. Our test specimen had a very crisp trigger pull that broke at exactly three pounds. By any possible criteria, the Ed Brown M702 action qualifies as a true custom-made turn-bolt.The Ed Brown Marine Sniper has an overall length of approximately 43.5 inches. The Shilen six-groove barrel has a right-hand twist of one turn in 10 inches, and the crown has been recessed to preserve the system’s accuracy potential in harsh field environments. This 24-inch, match-grade tube features the well-known Remington Varmint exterior contour. Weight, without optics, is about 9.25 pounds, which is pretty much standard for modern sniper-weapon-system rifles. The barrel and receiver have been provided with a black oxide finish.Without doubt McMillan Fiberglass Stocks manufactures more stocks for military and law enforcement sniper weapon systems than anyone else. Its stocks are the standard by which all others must be judged. A McMillan General Purpose stock with a woodland camouflage pattern was selected for the Ed Brown Marine Sniper principally because it’s one of the lightest stocks McMillan makes. This is the same stock that has been used for years by the U.S. Marine Corps on its M40-series sniper rifles. The weight of the stock is two pounds."

I love the gun, and it has been a very reliable, consisent shooter for me. The gun is very clean with no blemishes and thoroughly cleaned after each range visit. The only reason I'm selling is that I've begun to carry a different pistol, and I have my eyes on something else to replace the LCP II. Also including 40 rounds of Federal Hydra-Shok JHP and 50 rounds of Blazer FMJ (both of which have run flawlessly through the gun) and a very comfortable kydex IWB holster and Ruger pocket holster. Comes with box and original contents. Price is very fair; no low-ball offers, please. Not interested in trades. Feel free to call or text REDACTED. Thanks."
