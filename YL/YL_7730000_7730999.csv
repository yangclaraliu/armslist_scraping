It is Serial#SM00390 which makes it the 390th fixed stock SA 85M imported by Kassnar. There were less than 3000 fixed stock guns imported before the 1989 import ban so they are pretty rare. This one has a matching numbered receiver, carrier, bolt, and receiver cover. The other parts on the gun are not numbered. The bore is mint. It will come with a Hungarian leather sling and 1 steel 30 round mag.
I believe that the unnumbered recoil spring, unnumbered gas tube, and the gas block are incorrect replacement parts and not original to the gun.  The correct parts are readily available on the internet.
This is for sell or trade,  FTF in the North Dallas area (I am in Plano) for much less than what I paid (it was sold to me as original). My cash price is $1300.  My trade price is $1400.  I can be reached via email thru Armslist or text me at 214-471-79four1"

I bought it new and I have barely used it. (Less than 50 pellets!) The unit is in perfect shape. All you need for hours of plinking fun. In an emergency, it could b used for taking small game for survival.

My only reason for selling is I just never found time to use it. But I am kind of a “maintenance geek” so I always kept it cleaned and oiled so you will not find a single flaw with it. This kit would make a perfect Christmas Gift for responsible kids of all ages* and it comes with the original owner’s manual and a tin of pellets to get you started.

I bought it about six months ago for a daily carry gun and it's been awesome for that. It's every bit as accurate as my full size 1911's, and gobbled up every bullet I loaded without a hiccup.

The stock magazine is 10 rounds with an option to upgrade to a 15 round. The AK22 is outfitted with a post front sight and an open U-notch with elevation adjustments. Very few in stock.  This is a cosmetic copy of the AK.  None of the parts are interchangable with a real AK.  They have been making pretty much this same gun for over 30 years.  It is very reliable.  You can find 25 round mags on the internet.  The gun is perfect.  The streaks shown on the metal are from the light coat of oil put on by the factory.  It wipes off.  Photos were literally taken right after the box was opened. Here is a link to a video I put together on this rifle and the very similar M1600.  I was having all types of problems with the camera, so please tolerate the amatuer nature of the video: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=rn8FqootQwI"

The Swiss made Sig P210 is considered by some to be THE most accurate 9mm production pistol ever made. I was not planning on selling this gun, but unfortunately a circumstance has arisen which warrants the sale. Be advised, this is not a fire sale. The original Sig box has some damage to the top and the interior foam has disintegrated and been disposed of. The pistol is in excellent condition with signs of little use and retains in my estimation 99% of the original finish, but look at the pictures and judge for yourself. All serial numbers match, the slide, frame and barrel. The slide bears the Rockwell hardness dimple. The lack of wear on the breech and the rails suggests that this pistol has been fired very little ex-factory. Inspections welcomed. Serious buyers should contact me with an email address for additional photos if need be. Test target dated 18 MRZ 1983. Sellers of similar guns on gunbroker are asking over $4,000, some don't even have the test target. Mine does. Asking $3,500 or best offer. Looking to sell. Willing to ship at buyers expense from my FFl to your FFl."
