It has an adjustable rear site and a fiber optic front site.The forged stainless frame has an undercut trigger guard to get the hand a little higher on the pistol and 25 LPI front strap checkering to hold it firmly in place without being too harsh. Flats on this pistol are soft brushed while the rounds are sandblasted, giving a nice contrast. Double diamond cocobolo grips finish it off.While I really like this gun, and it is more accurate than I am, I find myself not using it much as I generally practice with one of my carry pistols. This comes with 3 extra Vickers Steel Base Pad duty magazines ($59.95 each at Wilson Combat), 10 rounds each (plus 1 in the chamber) in addition to the 2 9 round magazines (plus 1 in the chamber) the gun came with. The gun is clean (I use SLP 2000 non-toxic cleaner/degreaser, bore cleaner, and EWL products) and well cared for.  It has never been dropped or abused and works flawlessly, so please don't ask if there is anything wrong with it. Some people were wondering based on the original photo if there was a scratch near the slide. As seen in the just added photo, taken under a very bright light and very detailed shot, there is the faintest of scratches by the slide release lever. This is from normal use and you will pay over $400 more for a new Pointman 9 with extra mags and ultimately end up with the same marks.Price is fair and firm.

The slide is extremely rare, it’s a 1943 Union Switch and Signal (for the war effort they only produced 1911’s for one year.) If this was a 100% U.S.&S. it would be valued between $5000-$6000. The frame is a 1944 Colt M1911A1 marked U.S. Army. The magazine is a WW2 era 1911 magazine stamped “R”, which is correct for a U.S.&S. gun. This is a arsenal rebuild, which explains the mixed parts.... unfortunately this was a common practice. But the one nice thing about it is this wasn’t a hack job, they are the real professionals and they did a great job parkerizing it. The roll marks and all the letters are crisp and deep. I can send more photos if needed.Extra’s included:It also comes with a U.S. marked 1943 leather holster, U.S. marked 1942 dual magazine pouch, Army issue belt, 2 Vietnam era magazines and a Vietnam era magazine pouch.$1750 cash or $2000 trade"

It comes with a replacement Timminy trigger installed and a $100 Warne one piece scope mount rail. I just never gotten around to shooting this gun much so letting it go. Its in perfect condition and has maybe 50 rounds thru it. Fifty rounds is definatly a upper end guesstimate on the round count. For those that dont know a VFS stands for V=Varmint barrel (bull barrel) F=Fluted Barrel and S=Stainless Steel action and barrel. I have a few rounds for the gun and willing to let a potential buyer shoot the gun before purchacing it if your willing to spend the time driving over to the MRPC club in Milford Ohio. I will take pictures of the gun and post them tomorrow. The picture added now is a stock picture I downloaded from the web. I will consider trades for some items. let me know what you got. I added a list of some random stuff that came to mind in the trade area below but I do like lots of diff stuff. Any rifle for trade would need to be a target model. Im not interested in Hunting model rifles.
