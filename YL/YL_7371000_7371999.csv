Designed under the direction of the Bone Collector Team, the Rebel features a traditional drop point folding blade on one side and a Havalon Quik-Change fitment on the other.   The fixed blade on the Rebel is the ideal do it all blade. Composed of premium AUS-8 stainless steel, the blade is then cryo-hardened and finished off with a black titanium coating to create a perfect balance of strength and sharpness. What sets the Rebel apart, is the Havalon Quik-Change replaceable blade system. The Quik-Change system ensures users always have the sharpest possible blade. As the blade begins to dull, it can be taken off and replaced with a new one in a matter of seconds. The Rebel comes with seven of our world famous 60A blades and two of our brand new gut hook blades. The ability to switch between the unmatched sharpness of a 60A blade and the functionality of a scalpel sharp gut hook creates versatility that has never been seen before on a hunting knife. The combination of a traditional fixed blade and an ultra-modern Havalon Quik-change fitment all on one handle, makes the Rebel an exceptional knife for hunting and everyday carry. ● 3 1/16” AUS-8 stainless steel blade with cryogenic edge hardening treatment and black Ti hard coating ● Fiberglass reinforced handle with injection molded nylon handle scales and rubber checkered grips ● Havalon Quik-Change replaceable blade system ● Includes 7 total 60A Blades and 2 gut hook blades ● Bone Collector Signature Zipper Holster"

These pistols are fairly scarce and are not seen for sale very often.This pistol has some aspects that the Colt 1911 A-1 does not have. This pistol doesn't have a grip safety, the cocking serrations are different and the grip screw placement is different than the Colt. The pistol uses standard 1911 magazines.Overall condition is about 65-70% and the downside is mainly cosmetic. I'm guessing that the pistol was made between the 1930's and 1960's.The bore looks nice, the mechanics work and the serial numbers all match. Sale price is $450 cash. Absolutely no trades or lowball offers.NOTE: Since Armslist doesn't list Hafdasa or Ballester Molina as the manufacturer, i used Colt."

Asking price is $750 with possible trades.  The Remington® VERSA MAX® Semi-Auto Shotgun uses the VersaPort™ gas operation system that vents gas from the shotgun's chamber to operate the action. It is a very simple system with few moving parts and no O-rings, gaskets, or seals to maintain. The system uses the length of the shotgun shell hull to regulate the amount of gas, allowing the gun to operate with every type of shotgun shell from light 2-3/4"" loads up to 3-1/2"" magnums without any shooter adjustments. The versatility of the rugged, value-priced VERSA MAX Sportsman makes it equally well suited for turkey and waterfowl hunting with magnum loads, as well as upland birds, and even pass shooting doves with light field loads. The VERSA MAX Sportsman semi-automatic shotgun has a weather resistant, black synthetic stock with textured panels on the fore-end and pistol grip that provide a solid hold in any environment. The barrel and receiver are finished in a non-reflective matte black that enhances concealment in most hunting environments. A molded in sling swivel stud on the butt-stock and a stud on the magazine cap allow the quick attachment of a sling. The self-cleaning, gas operation system of the Remington VERSA MAX Semi-Auto shotgun reduces recoil considerably, allowing the shooter to follow-up on missed birds or shoot multiple targets quickly. Comes with 1 Flush Mount Pro Bore™ choke tube (modified).VersaPort gas operation systemSelf-cleaning, gas operation system helps reduce recoilComes with 1 Flush Mount Pro Bore choke tube (modified)"

WWI military Lugers were produced by two companies, the Imperial Erfurt Armory and the Deutsche Waffen-ind Munitionsfabriken or DWM. DWM was the original producer of the Luger pistol and was a conglomerate of different factories producing ammunition, powered and firearms. At the end of WWI, with the punitive Versailles Treaty in place and the Inter Allied Military Control Commission established to administer the arms restrictions imposed by the treaty, the Imperial Erfurt Armory closed its doors for good. DWM, as the original Luger manufacturer and one of the largest producers of military weapons for the Germans during WWI, was penalized by the Control Commission in 1921 when the Commission selected the Simson firm based in Suhl to produce and rework all Luger pistols needed for the German police forces and the significantly smaller German Army.DWM was not forced out of business, however, but was restricted to producing Lugers only for the commercial market and then only with Lugers that had a maximum caliber of 7.65mm and a barrel length less than 100mm. Foreign sales to countries desiring 9mm Lugers imposed significant constraints on DWM, requiring them to send components to Vickers in England who then completed the weapon. So tainted had the DWM name become that the Board of Directors changed the name in 1922 to Berlin-Karlsruher Industrie-Werke or BKIW. BKIW eventually brought Gunther Quandt onboard as President of BKIW in 1928, and Quandt subsequently moved all small arms production from Berlin-Wittenau to the Mauser facilities located in Oberndorf since Mauser was a sister company of BKIW. This included DWM's/BKIW's Luger pistol production, which had already been halted before the move because of slumping sales. This transfer to Mauser put the last nail in DWM's coffin in terms of Luger production and one of DWM/BKIW's last Luger orders was on November 11, 1929, when the Dutch ordered 400 Dutch Navy Lugers, magazines and spare parts. Essentially, from that point forward, Mauser was responsible for Luger production in Germany.The Mauser Werke in Oberndorf received all of DWM/BKIW's Luger tooling and parts and assembled those parts into completed Lugers beginning in 1930. Within a few years, Mauser began producing its own manufactured Lugers, which actually competed with its own designs, but these Lugers were only for commercial sales in accordance with the original Control Commission order giving all military orders to Simson in Suhl. A year after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany the new Nazi government formally ended the contract with Simson & Company, which had been in place since 1924. Simson had only produced about 12,000 Lugers for the German Armed Forces during this period. The Nazi's move was not only a repudiations of Allied control of Germany and the Versailles Treaty, it was also a direct attack on the Simson Company, which was Jewish owned. German military Luger contracts were then given to Mauser in April 1934.The Nazi government gave Mauser the contract with several stipulations, however. While Hitler and the Nazis were gradually thumbing their noses at the Versailles Treaty and the Control Commission, Hitler did not want to completely lift the veil on his secret rearmament program until it was well established. One of the stipulations was that Mauser's name be concealed by using the ""S/42"" code on the toggle. It is believed by several Luger historians that the ""S"" was intended to deceive foreigners and the Control Commission into believing that it stood for Simson. This view is bolstered by the fact that the ""S"" was dropped from the ""S/42"" code in April 1939, which would have been the date when the original 15 year contract with Simson would have expired had the Nazis not cancelled it.Since the Versailles Treaty limited production of German small arms, the Nazis intended to not only hide the identity of the actual producer of new Lugers (Mauser), but also to conceal the year a particular Luger was manufactured. This deceit led to the letter-date Lugers, beginning with the ""K-Date"" Luger in 1934. The ""K-Date"" was followed by the ""G-Date"" Mauser Lugers in 1935. While the Nazis wanted to continue to conceal Mauser's production of the Luger, and the government's cancellation of the original contract with Simson, Mauser was ordered to continue to use the ""S"" code on the toggle, but they dropped the letter-dating protocol and began to stamp the chamber with the full year date beginning in 1936. As noted, the ""S"" code was maintained until 1939, when it was dropped and the manufacturer code was simply ""42"" on the toggle. The ""42"" code was maintained until early 1941. In mid 1940, the German military issued a directive to all military contractors ordering them to replace the numerical concealment codes with character codes beginning on January 1, 1941. Mauser was assigned the character code ""byf."" Mauser continued to use this code until it ended Luger production in 1942.This particular Luger is a ""42"" code Mauser Luger with ""1939"" chamber date. The serial number of this Luger is 9522r. The letter suffix on 42 Code Lugers is only found on the frame under the frame serial number. All other serial numbers are full serial numbers minus the suffix or partial serial numbers minus the suffix. The 1939 ""42"" Code Lugers were manufactured in 11 different suffix ranges and these run alphabetically from suffix ""p"" to suffix ""z."" The ""p"" suffix was a partial 10,000-suffix run since the transition from the 1939 S/42 Code to the 1939 42 Code occurred around the mid-""p"" suffix range. Each suffix, as noted, encompasses a maximum of 10,000 weapons, but this number is not the total number of weapons produced and accepted by the German military because many weapons were rejected by the military after final assembly. These weapons were then either parted out or used by the commercial division of Mauser to produce civilian Mauser ""banner"" models.It is estimated that 91,019 1939 ""42"" Code Lugers were manufactured but, again, this number is a theoretical maximum based on each suffix produced in 1939 with the ""42"" Code comprising 10,000 pistols, which clearly did not happen due to rejections although the 91,019 number is probably fairly close based on research published in Don R. Hallock's and Joop van de Kant's definitive work on Mauser Lugers, titled ""The Mauser Parabellum 1930-1946,"" HaKa Arms Publications Co, 2010.Of the theoretical 10,000 42 Code Lugers made in 1939, Hallock and van de Kant estimate that 6,321 went to the German Army and 3,679, or about 1/3rd of total production for suffix ""r"" went to the German Air Force or Luftwaffe. No surviving serial numbers are known that definitively identify which Lugers went to the Army and which went to the Air Force.The Frame on this Luger is the standard ""F-3"" model frame with the Mauser ""Hump"" on the rear of the Frame. This Frame has the correct dimples at the top of the stock lug rail on the rear grip strap. The complete serial number ""9522/r"" is stamped on the nose of the Frame. The left side, rear of the Frame has the ""GESICHERT"" stamp that is still highlighted with the original white paint, which is now turning a yellow color with age. The Safety Lever has the matching serial number ""22"" on the top, flat portion and it retains 99% of its original salt blue finish. The Safety Bar is serial number matching with ""22"" stamped on the face and visible when the Safety Lever is engaged and it remains in the white. There are numerous production marks on the Frame that are hidden when the Grip Panels are in place. These include a serif ""T"" stamp on the upper left side and a numeral ""7"" stamp on the upper right side of the frame. The interior front and rear magazine walls retain the majority of its original salt blue finish with minor wear from the magazine along the centerline of the walls. The Hold Open Latch is serial number matched with ""22"" stamped on the top surface and it retains 99% plus of its original salt blued finish. The Hold Open Latch Spring remains in the white.The Frame Backstrap retains the vast majority of its original salt blue finish with wear noted on the sharp edges along the shoulder stock lug. The balance of the backstrap retains 98% of the original salt blue finish. The Front Grip Strap is in very fine condition and retains approximately 98% of the original salt blue finish.

The Sear Bar retains approximately 99% of its original salt blued finish. The Sear Bar Spring retains approximately 99% of its dark blued finish, which was heat tempered. There is, correctly, no Sear Safety.The bottom of the Receiver just forward of the lug has numerous assembly and production marks, including a serif ""S"" stamp and sans serif “V” stamp. The Ejector exhibits a slightly faded plum finish with the interior arm portion of the injector in the white. The top of the Chamber has the correct and very crisp ""1939"" date stamp. The right side of the Receiver has the inspectors' acceptance stamps. The left-most stamp is the last acceptance mark and was applied after bluing and signified a complete and functional pistol. This acceptance mark is the Waffenamt eagle known as the ""stick eagle,"" for the straight lines of the outstretched wings over the assigned inspector's number, which is ""63."" The mark second from the left was stamped when the pistol was still in the white and signifies that all parts gauged correctly and that the pistol functions correctly and safely fired high pressure proof cartridges. This acceptance mark is also the stick eagle over the ""63"" inspector's number. The last mark on the Receiver is the Test Proof mark, indicating the pistol safely and satisfactorily fired the high-pressure proof cartridges. This mark is the third Test Proof Eagle, which is a straight, outstretched eagle with circled Swastika beneath the eagle. According to Hallock and van de Kant, Inspector ""63"" appeared up until around serial number the “w” suffix.The standard 4"" long, 9mm caliber Barrel on this Luger retains 98% of its original salt blue finish with the most pronounced wear located around the muzzle. The correct straight wing Test Proof eagle over a circled swastika is present on the right side forward of the Receiver acceptance and test proof marks. The upper left, rear portion of the Barrel has the correct stick wing eagle over ""63"" acceptance mark. The top portion of the correct rounded Barrel Band has the correct sight adjustment witness mark on the right side and the Front Sight Blade's witness mark aligns with the one on the Band. The Front Sight is the correct fourth type found on 42 Code Lugers with 6 horizontal anti-reflection serrations on the base and 13 serrations on the blade. The Front Sight and Base retain 99% of the original salt blue finish.The bottom of the Barrel has the full serial number ""9522"" without suffix and that mark is over the bore diameter stamp, which is ""8,82."" The bottom of the Barrel has the correct witness line that is aligned perfectly with the witness line on the bottom of the Receiver. The bullet feed ramp is smooth and in the white as is the face of the Breech end of the Barrel. The bore of the Barrel is still shiny the entire length of the Barrel on the lands with slight darkening in the grooves.The Breechblock is serial number matching with the serial number ""22"" on the left side, just below the straight wing test proof eagle over the circled Swastika. The Breechblock retains 99% of its original salt blued finish with wear noted on the side receiver rails. The Extractor is serial number matching with the number ""22"" stamped on top. The top portion of the Extractor retains 99% of the original salt blue finish. The sides of the Extractor are in the white and the left side has ""GELADEN"" stamped crisply, meaning loaded. The Breechblock Pin retains 99% of the original blue finish on the left and right ends. The Firing Pin is the correct fluted type with three flutes that extend towards the front.

The breach face is in very fine condition, retaining 98% of the original sale blue finish.The Center Toggle Link retains 99% of its original salt blued finish and his serial number matching with ""22"" stamped on the top portion. Centered on the top of the Center Toggle Link is the ""42"" stamp with the open top ""4."" The bottom of the Center Link has the stylized ""”R” inside “W” production stamp. The Rear Toggle Link retains 95% of its original salt blue finish with wear noted along both the right and left sides where the bluing is beginning to thin. The rear ramp of the Rear Toggle Link is serial number matching with ""22"" stamped on the sloped face. The Coupling Link correctly remains in the white. The bottom of the Rear Toggle Link has the stylized ”R” inside “W” production stamp, a sans serif “M” stamp and what appears to be a script “y” stamp.. The Rear Toggle Link Pin is serial number matching with ""22"" stamped on the left face and the pin retains 95% of its original salt blued finish.The Trigger is serial number matching with ""22"" stamped on the top left side. The Trigger retains 98% of its original salt blue finish with wear noted only on the sharp edges. The Trigger Spring remains in the white. The Side Plate is serial number matching to the pistol with ""22"" stamped on the outer surface of the Plate.The Side Plate retains 98% of its original salt blued finish with wear noted on the outer high points and on the front of the Plate arm that rests under the Takedown Lever. The Trigger Lever remains in the white.

The Magazine Catch is correctly unnumbered and retains 95% of the original salt blued finish with wear noted on the barrel where it slides into the frame. The Magazine Catch Retention Spring 99% of its original salt blued finish.The walnut Grip Panels are in fine condition with only moderate flattening to the checkering on the bottom edge of both Panels. There are no cracks or chips noted. Neither grip panel is serial numbered, which is not uncommon on 42 Code Lugers. The back of the left panel has a sans serif “V” stamp and the back of the right panel is completely unmarked. Both single-slot Grip Panel Screws retain 98% of their original blued finish and the slots have very minor marring.

The body of the magazine is correctly unmarked.

The Magazine retains 90% of its blued finish. There is a slight dent in the body on the lower, left side. The aluminum base has a slight ding on the left edge. The Follower is in the white and the Follower Spring is still very strong. The Magazine still functions perfectly.This is a very fine WWII Mauser 42 Code Luger manufactured and dated in 1939, the year WWII began with the German invasion of Poland in September.

Breech locks up tight! The length of pull is set at 14.25"". The Over/Under barrel set features a removable choke on the bottom barrel, a Full fixed choke on the top barrel, 2 3/4"" chamber, double bead (the second bead is missing but this should be an easy fix), and both barrels are ported.

The single barrel bore is clean and shiny! Other features include a simple yet elegantly engraved receiver, a Griggs buttpad, and no auto-safety!

The pics show Talon Grips but I am not trying to recover that expense. I slapped them on just to see if I could thicken it for my hands (it actually does make a difference in my opinion). 
Anyway, I bought this Walther PPS M2 last month and I'm only looking to sell it because my hands prefer larger guns (double stacks). Personally, if I have to choose between comfort and printing, I'll print! I've owned and carried a Walther PPS Classic, S&W M&P Shield, Glock 43, Springfield XDs, and now the PPS M2. By far, this is my favorite (and why I went back to Walther), but if I can unload it for a fair price given current marketing conditions I am willing to part with it to get a M&P40 2.0 Compact which I'm sure no one has for a trade yet.
Cash only, please, and you must be a resident of Ohio and legally allowed to purchase firearms. $300 is firm. I'm not trying to be rude, but I don't want to waste anyone's time (including my own). I've sold dozens of guns at this point, many of them on Armslist, and I am reasonable compared to what most people ask for up front. $300 is the lowest I'm willing to accept otherwise I will just wait. That is reasonable buyer's market price in my opinion, and the longer I sit on it the more I will get eventually. Anyone who knows their guns like I do understands this. It's an excellent price, so I'm making it easy for everyone involved because no haggling is necessary. I won't even respond to anything less. That said, if you're seriously interested, I look forward to hearing from you. 
Thanks,Brian"

Originally known as a “tube lock’ carbine, these short arms were altered to percussion after 1854 and many saw service early in the American Civil War as agents for both sides sought them in Europe for home use.It measures 30 inches overall length with a 14.5 inch round barrel. The lock is marked “852” or dated 1852 --- the Austrians did not put the numeral “1” in their dates. The lock still functions well on all positions remains crisp and mechanically fine.The bore has deep, sharp rifling, with twelve grooves; and has a huge .71 caliber barrel. Metal overall has a dark aged brown patina finish with traces of fine pitting. Never had a rear sight but retains its original front sight. Mechanics are strong and crisp; and all iron parts.The left side of the stock has the figure eight double ring on the sling bar. It has a heavy, one-piece stock, possibly sap wood, that exhibits some shrinkage near barrel tang and butt plate. There are no visible markings on the wood and it has a raised cheek piece on the left side. There are no repairs or breaks. Wood shows wear but is VG overall.An imported, hand-held cannon that saw service in the Civil War on both sides. This is a nice example of a devastating little muzzle loading carbine as used early in the war by both sides. A nice addition to your collection."
