This marker is in great shape but I haven't used it in over 4 years (stopped playing paintball). Now that I am moving, it's time to sell stuff that I don't need anymore. Great gun at a great price. Send me a message through Armslist and I'll get back with you. More pictures upon request.

I am also selling a second A-5. It is painted white and red. Does not come with a hopper or barrel. I will include it for 50 dollars or sell it by itself for 75. When I go to my parents home in a couple weeks, I can grab a hopper and probably a barrel for this. Comes with JT soft case.

I’ve had this for ~4 years now and have fired around 100 rounds down the pipe.  It has been cleaned after each range trip and periodically just for maintenance.  Included with the pistol are the OEM cleaning rod/tool (never used), manual, rubber grip as well as the original Bakelite grip and one factory magazine.  
Price paid and prevailing market price for this seem to remain around $300.  I also have replaced the recoil spring with the aftermarket Wolf Spring.  I still have both, they’re yours.  The Wolf makes it more ‘shootable’.
Along with pistol are:
6 Full boxes of Brown Bear FMJ, plus 1 box with 19 rds.
3 Full boxes of Silver Bear HP, plus 1 box with 43 rds.
For the Brown Bear FMJ, best I can find online is about $.30 per round.  I can’t find the Silver Bear HP on any of the online ammo finders, but assume it’s higher than FMJ.  I’m not trying to make a killing on the ammo or anything, just trying to unload something I no longer need as much as the money.    That said, ammo alone is close to $200 in value.  I’m asking $450 for the entire package.  I will entertain reasonable offers.  No nonsense, Ohio DL required for my protection.  Will meet in mutually agreeable place."

You can also ask for a custom holster for the same price. It can be made so it's all black or 2-tone like the one shown, black or nickle plated belt clip, and I can make the holsters to fit the firearm with a Crimson Trace Railmaster Universal laser. When the holster is made to accommodate that laser, the firearm is snug with or without it attached, guaranteed!"

The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free.

I went to a friend of mine at the show who repairs Glocks and he saw the crack in the rear of the slide right away. He recommended calling Glock in Georgia.

Glock said to send it back and they would replace it for $ 120.00. I am not sure this was the correct price for the slide. I have a call to that particular Glock service rep and he should call me back on Monday. I will not sell this gun until I am sure of the correct price for the slide from Glock.

This has left a bad taste in my mouth for this particular gun. If I get it repaired and keep it I will always remember how I bought it. If anyone is interested in this gun the price is $ 250.00. You can send it back and have a brand new slide and your total cost will be  $ 370.00. Gun comes with 2 hi cap mags, glock box, Glock loader, owners manual and cleaning tool.

Meet in Dayton area only. This is a good deal for someone willing to send the slide back to Glock. I am going out of my way to make known about this gun. I am not out to screw anyone."

These things are a blast to shoot (pun intended). For the price that some are asking for a used one, you can get a brand new model AND a threaded barrel for suppressed shooting fun or to just tame the fireball!!

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

Due to the unique locking action of the PMR-30 pistol and the lightweight slide and barrel, the use of a suppressor is not recommended as it will cause an increase in gas volume and pressure and the slide will likely unlock early. This will cause an increase in gases and residue that is ejected back towards the shooters face and could also cause a case rupture to occur. Any damage or injuries caused by the use of a suppressor or other heavy weight muzzle device attached to the PMR-30 pistol will not be covered by any Warranty. The thread pattern on the PMR-30 threaded barrel is 3/8” x 24.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. Two 20 round magazines are included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.

Since its introduction in 2009 the P238 has redefined the role of a .380 ACP caliber pistol for personal protection.

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches, a height of 3.96 inches, just over an inch thick, and weighing just under a pound, the Sig Sauer P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealable pistol. The P238 is built on an aluminum alloy beavertail-style frame with a black anodized finish.

This P238 has a natural finish Stainless Steel slide which is equipped with SigLite night sights for accurate shot placement in any lighting conditions. Comfortable stippled Hogue rubber grips are fitted. A Sig Sauer laser sight which wraps around the trigger guard is included, allowing extremely rapid, instinctual shooting.

This rifle currently has a 4-16x50mm Millet TRS-1 optic on it. It's functional, illuminated, mil-dot, and works just fine for me. I can include it or keep it. Doesn't matter. 

The last/best 3 shot group I've shot with Hornady 150gr SST ammo in this rifle measured 0.214 from the centers @ 100yrds - Red's Indoor range South. It basically fits under a nickel. The trigger is extremely crisp and breaks as nicely as any rifle I have shot. The decelerator pad works great. The bolt action is smooth and commensurate with comparable weapons in that range.  YES, I've felt a $3000 rifle, and it is tighter and smoother. But if you can shoot, this rifle will hit the target.

Why sell it? I'm a lefty! I'm left eye dominant, and I've decided it is time to own that. My ARs have mostly been converted to fully Ambi. My 1911's got Ambi safeties. This rifle is one of the last Righty only set ups I have.

I'll trade, I'll sell, I'll do partial in betweens. I figure I have $1250 or so into this guy BEFORE to putting glass on it. I listed a price because I hate it when that is blank and that seems like a fair range. Make me an offer... Let's chat about it.

In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

These Para's are incredibly accurate and very reliable.  I’ve fired probably 500-750 rounds through it.  Every time I’ve ever taken it to the range people are amazed at its accuracy.  This gun is more accurate than you are.  I’ve fired Les Baer and Wilson Combat and I’d be comfortable putting this up against either at the range.
I bought this new in 2002, (before Para moved).  It does have some minimal wear marks.  I’m kind of picky and I notice some imperfections.  It sat on a gun rag in my nightstand until the kids got too old and it had to be locked away, and has since been stored in the original box in a climate controlled space.  Function is flawless.  In all the rounds I’ve fired I had one jam from a failure to eject on local range reloads when it was being broken in.  Cause was probably dirt from reloads, never had an issue since.  Gun has been cleaned and oiled after each visit to the range and periodically regardless as part of standard maintenance.  I generally take it to the range at least once a year and fire off a mag or two just because it’s so sweet to fire.
Included are:
Para P14.45 Limited in Stainless (duh)
Factory 10rd Mag
After Market Hi-Cap mag
