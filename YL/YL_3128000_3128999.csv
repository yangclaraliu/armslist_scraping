 Description:The Tavor is a perfect fusion of an ordnance-grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer-forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users' body, allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full-length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous, allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles, and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines, but you can also use your own AR-15 style magazines.

If you don't know what a CS-1 2M is, just Google it. Tons of information on the Smith & Wesson Forum. It's believed that fewer than 1400 of the 3"" carried by plainclothes Customs officers exist today. When Clinton came into office, Janet Reno switched to semi-autos and canceled the civilian trade-in program. Some made it into the hands of various gun dealers but the rest were ordered destroyed. These are the finest 686's ever made. Even by todays Performance Center standards. All stainless with a bead blast finish and Pachmayr grips. Also included is the finger groove black pepper grips and the holster that came with it when I bought it 3 years ago. Not sure if the holster was what the agent carried it in but it's obviously been with the firearm for a long time. It's also a S&W stamped holster. The firearm is mechanically perfect (locks up tight!) showing only honest wear from carry and use. The trigger is amazing. Single action is maybe 2 oz and the double action is similar to a two stage match rifle trigger. No guessing when it goes bang! Breaks like a glass rod exactly when you want it to. When you research it, you'll understand why it's so unique and the tolerance tests it had to endure to be accepted for duty. Now, I'm trading this simply because I don't use it. The last time I had it at the range was maybe two years ago. Since then I've become more of a bench rest shooter. Mainly interested in high power, long range, big bore rifles. 338 Lapua, 338 RUM, 30 WSM, etc. Would also be interested in high powered handguns. Magnum Research BFR in 45-70, S&W 460 or possible Freedom Arms 454 Casull. Coonan Arms 357 Magnum 1911 or other full size, high quality 1911's in 45 ACP. I've been considering this for some time and my only hesitation with listing it was I don't really know what I want. I'm obviously in no hurry to trade so you may see this one on here for 2 weeks, 2 months or even 2 years! If this listing is up, the firearm is still available. I'll respond quickly to serious offers and/or offers I'm interested in. Low end items or silly responses will not be acknowledged. Would like to stay local but will possibly travel for the right trade. More pictures available. Thanks for your interest!"

It has been out to the range twice.  It comes with all paperwork, but no box.

""The Trijicon SRS (Sealed Reflex Sight) represents the highest level of performance from a sealed reflex-style sight. Because of its innovative design, the SRS takes up less rail space while maintaining the durability expected from Trijicon. The shorter housing eliminates the tube-effect typical of other sealed reflex sights. Featuring a large 28mm aperture, the Trijicon SRS provides a massive field of view for quicker target engagements. The 1.75 MOA dot is small enough for precision and with 10 brightness settings it can be bright enough for any speed. Finally, the Trijicon SRS features dual power sources — an innovative solar cell assisted by a single AA battery.""

When you need an affordable, rugged and accurate rifle for the youth shooter in your life, then you need the Remington Model 700 SPS Youth Bolt Action Rifle. The classic Remington 700 rifle was taken and shortened, both the stock and the barrel, to provide young hunters and smaller stature adults with a better fitting and easier handling version of our legendary model 700. Each model 700 SPS youth is fitted with a new, ergonomically designed synthetic stock featuring the R3 recoil pad, swivel studs, and a 12 3/8"" length of pull which is 1"" shorter than standard model 700 rifles. The hammer forged barrel comes without sights and drilled and tapped for scope mounts.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

Missing parts and beat up stock goes for the lower price range, good shape goes for the upper range.  Since parts for these guns are getting hard to come by, the gun must fire.  Light surface rust OK, but don't want a pitted gun.  E-Mail me and let me know what you have with description of condition.

Detailed description:

General
For sale is a like-new Kel-Tec KSG bullpup shotgun.  It's chambered in 12 gauge and holds up to 15 shells.  It was purchased about a year ago, has had less than 100 rounds fired through it, is in excellent shape with no damage or marks whatsoever, and functions perfectly.  The price I have listed is for the bare KSG only, but if you wanted to add any of the optional (but some almost necessary) accessories then see below.


Price
I'm aware that a new KSG can be found online for about just a bit more.  But considering you'll have to pay taxes, shipping, and FFL transfer fees for a new one, $800 for a practically new one is well-priced in my opinion. 


Upgrades Available
CAA vertical foregrip - $30  
KSG Kydex Cheek rest (official Kel-Tec) - $20 
Magpul Backup Sights (MBUS), both front and rear, NEW - $80
Troy Industries Folding Di-Optic Aperture Tritium Battle Sight Rear - $100
Troy Industries Front Folding HK Style Battle Sight - $70
Viridian C5L Universal Sub-Compact Green Laser/Light - $150
Hi-Tech Customs Defender Muzzle Brake (will include the barrel nut removal tool for free) - $40

Why I'm Selling
I'm currently building a high-end AR-15 and find myself spending more time shooting and upgrading that than I do my other guns.


Terms
I live in Chino, CA and require any interested buyers to be able to meet me here. There is a Turner Outdoorsman in Chino Hills where we can meet and you can inspect the gun first before agreeing to buy. If everything checks out then we can enter the store and start the transfer process. A few important things:

1. You'll have to provide a phone number that I can contact you at (and preferred calling time if you have one). I'll also be calling from my personal cell number. I won't sell to anyone who is not willing to speak over the phone first.
2. We must meet at the Turner Outdoorsman in Chino Hills. I've conducted a number of private-party gun transfers there before and know that it's a great and safe location to meet and conduct PPTs at.
3. You are responsible for all the private party transfer fees (which is still less than the average FFL transfer fee).
4. Face-to-face transactions only, no shipping.
5. Cash only, please! I will consider a trade-in for:

Gen4 Glock 19 ($600 off asking price)
Smith and Wesson Model 15 w/ 4"" barrel ($400 off asking price if great condition, $300 if fair)

...otherwise I'm NOT OPEN to any other trades and price is FIRM.

----------

I apologize for the strict terms but I've bought and sold enough guns online to know what people are capable of and just want to protect myself and any potential buyers.  Otherwise I consider myself a nice and trustworthy individual and only want to deal with others who are the same. 

If you've made it this far and are still interested, please send me a message with your name and phone number and I'll respond as soon as I can.  My name is An and let me know if you're interested or have any questions. :)"

----From Ruger:
The Ruger® New Model Blackhawk® is the most advanced single-action revolver ever made. While retaining the solid frame, feel and comfortable grip of the classic single-actions, they feature Ruger’s patented transfer bar ignition system with loading gate interlock, an all-coil spring mechanism, adjustable sights, and frame-mounted firing pin. New Model Blackhawk revolvers have earned a reputation as the best value on the market due to their durability and affordability.

Feature: Bisley-Style Grip
I added a Belt Mountain StainlessBase Pin with allen screw.
The objectives in replacing the pin are: to tighten up  the cylinder to base pin fit, making it's rotation closer to concentric and improving  chamber/bore alignment, to have a harder bearing surface for longer wear, and to make the  pin easier to remove and install. The factory pin is also included.

- 20"" Stainless Steel Bull Barrel
- ACE Skeleton Stock
- 2x-30 round magazines 

This rifle has had roughly 500 rounds through it. It is in superb condition, shoots quite accurately and flawlessly. It has never been ""mag dumped."" I shoot a 5 shot group and let the barrel cool before shooting another...Every. Single. Time. 

The group pictured is at 200 yards with American Eagle 55 grain FMJ. I've just decided that the AR-15 game is not for me, so I'm looking to go back to a bolt gun. 

I'm asking $1,100 for the bare rifle, or $1,400 as it sits with a Nikon Buckmasters 6-18x40 scope, Nikon mounts and the bipod. The rifle alone was right at $1,300. You'd be hard pressed to find a better AR-15 that shoots this accurately for the price. 

Please include what you have and how you value your gun in the first reply to save us both some time. Willing to add or accept cash or ammo where necessary. My very first priority is a bolt action rifle in 223 with a bull barrel. Not really looking for much else, but it doesn't hurt to try. 

Thanks for looking and God bless."

Rifle Description:
THE SIGM400 SERIES ENHANCED RIFLE, is designed for use in law enforcement, military operations, the sporting field, as well as competitive shooting. The SIGM400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle with unparalleled accuracy. A 16” Nitride treated barrel provides superior corrosion resistance, and a 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability that users come to expect from SIG SAUER. This ODG version with Black upper and lower receiver, OD Green polymer Magpul MOE forend, grip and collapsible stock.

Trijicon Description:
Trijicon TA11F ACOG 3.5x35 Scope with Chevron BAC Reticle includes Trijicon Flat Top Adapter TA51. The ranging reticle of the Trijicon Gunsight isimage calibrated for 5.56mm (.223 cal) flat-top rifles out to 800 meters. The chevron reticle is designed to be zeroed using the tip at 100 meters. The width of the chevron at the base is 5.53 MOA which is 19"" at 300 meters. This allows range estimation for silhouette targets. Trijicon TA11F-A 3.5 x 35mm ACOG Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights hit fast in any light. Trijicon ACOG 3.5 x 35 Riflescopes are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. Trijicon 3.5x35 ACOGs combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Although Trijicon ACOG 3.5 x 35 Rifle Scopes TA-11F have many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding. Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions - without failure-prone batteries.

 Surefire M925V LED light Description:
The M952V Millennium® Universal WeaponLight attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever™ rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. It utilizes one sealed LED unit to produce both brilliant white light and invisible infrared radiation for use with night vision devices. The white beam is configured for close- to medium-range applications. Changing back and forth from white output to infrared output is accomplished by a push/twist action on the M952V head, which self-locks into the selected output mode. The tailcap switch assembly features a momentary/constant-on pushbutton switch and a momentary-on tape switch (7-inch cable) that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Available in Black (BK) or Desert Tan (TN) body color."

22 magnum ammo
Hey all,
I got real lucky and just had a big order of mag ammo process and it is on its way at a really good price. As a result of it I can “shift” the price and average it to all of what I have 22 mag wise, which lowers the price that these cost me and thus what they’ll cost you! That being said, here is what I physically have on hand right now, and I will be getting a decent amount more in in the coming week or so. 

I'm selling it at cost to me with shipping and tax so price is for pick up in Norman only. Would also consider trades for certain pistols (derringers in bigger bores mainly), looking specially for a PF9 actually, and even trades for certain other ammunition. Would also consider trades for 45 auto ammo. (Probably a 1-1 ratio depending on the ammo) Here is what I have available as of now:

-20 boxes of 50 rounds of 40gr JHP Armscor precision 22mag-$16 per 50 rounds (1.350 rounds in total) 

-20 boxes of 50 rounds of 40gr JHP Fiocchi Performance 22mag-$16 per 50


I will break it up however you would like to buy it box wise or you can buy it all. It is all the same to me. It is not the best price in the world, but at least I found some I could get available to y'all. Shoot me a text at REDACTED if you would like to arrange a trade or pickup. Or just shoot me a PM on here. Thanks and happy hunting!"

A collaboration between Remington and S&W back in the 1960's. 4"", 6"" and the 8 3/8"". Was designed as a small game hunting and target grade revolver. Wildcats were all the rage back then! It failed to catch on due to the cases backing out if they had oil on them or in the chambers. I always swab the chambers with rubbing alcohol before a range session and I've never had one to back out. Even after shooting 24+ rounds in a row. I bought this from a collector in N. Augusta about 6 years ago. As much as I enjoy collecting, I prefer to shoot. If I own it, it won't sit in a safe. I really don't shoot this one often. Maybe it needs to go to someone who'll enjoy it more than me. As stated in another listing of mine, I'm getting away from hand-gunning in favor of bench rest. Anyway, this one is in outstanding original condition. Pictures don't come close to the true condition. Nothing to note except all the extras. Comes with the original factory box with matching SN, original Target grips, color case hardened target hammer and trigger(installed), color case hardened combat hammer and trigger (looks like they were never used/installed), matching 22 LR cylinder (optional), original spun steel 22 LR inserts (used with the 22 Rem Jet cylinder), original cleaning rod, original paperwork(slightly yellowed due to age), original jacket patch, elaborate SILE target grips in original box and paper (hard to find in this condition!), original Hunter holster - Let's talk about that for a minute; I opened that holster myself when I bought this package. It had never been opened and I personally removed the cellophane (which had yellowed significantly and is still in the box along with the original instruction sheet) and fully expected it to be dry rotted. It wasn't! Looks like new! Also, I know Hunter made ""universal"" holsters for all brand of firearm. This one is different. On the back of the box, there's only one firearm listed for use with the F-15 holster. You guessed it, the S&W Model 53 with 8 3/8 barrel! What a find this turned out to be. You'll likely never see another collection like this!
 Moving on to the other items. Approximately 750 Hornady 40 grain 22 Jet bullets, complete set of Redding 357 Magnum case reforming dies (Quick Change collars included), original set of RCBS loading dies (Quick Change collars included), Wilson 22 Jet case trimming holder and about 60 cases (some are original 22 Jet head stamped and primed). Everything you need (I'll give light, medium and heavy chronographed load data) to take to the range and enjoy. It's obviously extremely accurate and a lot of fun to shoot. Many will ask what it is as soon as you touch of that first round. It's loud but has very light recoil. You'll find these in varying condition and price. Common 6"" models in fair to good condition bring $600+ in todays market. That's usually without the box and extra cylinder. This isn't even in the same class as one of those. That being said, an item is only worth what a seller will take for it and a buyer will pay for it. Mainly interested in high power, long range, big bore rifles. 338 Lapua, 338 RUM, 30 WSM, etc. Would also be interested in high powered handguns. Magnum Research BFR in 45-70, S&W 460 or possible Freedom Arms 454 Casull. Coonan Arms 357 Magnum 1911 or other full size, high quality 1911's in 45 ACP. I'm obviously in no hurry to trade so you may see this one on here for 2 weeks, 2 months or even 2 years! If this listing is up, the firearm is still available. I'll respond quickly to serious offers and/or offers I'm interested in. Low end items or silly responses will not be acknowledged. Would like to stay local but will possibly travel for the right trade. More pictures available. Thanks for your interest!"

While the design theme is unique, performance is exactly what shooters expect from Kimber—unequaled.

Raptor .45 ACP pistols come in a variety of sizes and finishes, each loaded with Custom Shop features that ensure dependability and accuracy. Night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety, bumped and grooved grip safety and match grade barrel, chamber and trigger are standard. Ultra models have 3-inch barrels and aluminum frames, making them easy to carry and conceal. Larger models are available in either steel or stainless steel, making them ideal for everything from duty to competition and home defense. The quality of Kimber Custom Shop pistols is on par with that of America’s top pistolsmiths."
