Handcrafted with exacting detail, it is a spectacular firearm used by both Union and Confederate forces during the war.On the right side are the inscribed words from Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, delivered November 19, 1863 at the site of the battle – “We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.”The left side of the barrel bears the 24-karat gold inscription, “Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, July 1863.”On the cylinder, this highly detailed panoramic etching captures the drama of Pickett’s Charge. Note the detail in uniform and armament, and the Gettysburg farmhouse in the distance. With each rotation of the cylinder, another piece of the drama unfolds. A mounted officer falls to a rifleman’s shot. A Confederate infantryman swings his empty rifle at a sword-wielding Union soldier. On horseback, on foot, and down on the ground, the battle is waged with pistols, bayonets, and knives. All the excitement and fury of this moment are immortalized in this 24-karat gold panorama.To display and protect the Gettysburg 1863 Revolver, we have created this handsome display case. The lid, inset with leather, features the striking silhouette of a general at Gettysburg, stamped in gold above the title, “Gettysburg 1863.” Inside the case are a replica of the Gettysburg Address on parchment paper and two solid brass buckles, as worn by each army’s officers to secure their holsters and swords. The rectangular buckle bears the Union’s eagle and shield image; the circular buckle bears the initials of the Confederate States. In addition, each case features a brass plaque on the inside of the lid, “Gettysburg 1863 Revolver, United States Society of Arms & Armour.”"

I was looking for a Colt Wiley Clapp Commander and couldn't find one, so I bought this one. Right after I did, I found the one I was looking for.  I don't need both, so you will be getting a steal of a deal on a brand new pistol. I will even include the original sales receipt. You will get a new in the box Colt Lightweight Commander (O4840XE) .45 acp, anodized black aluminum alloy receiver, blued slide, 4-1/4"" barrel, 7-3/4"" overall length, aluminum 3 hole trigger, single action, Novak 3 dot carry sights, ,undercut trigger guard, upswept beaver tail grip safety, extended thumb safety,lowered and flared ejection port, dual spring recoil system, Colt branded G10 grips, two 8 rnd magazines, carry case and all documentation. This pistol gives you the ability to concealed carry a real 1911 platform pistol comfortably, with a shorter profile and lower weight than a traditional full size Government model. The undercut trigger guard and upswept beaver tail also allow shooters a higher grip for enhanced comfort and accuracy.  Buyer is responsible for transfer fees."

This gun probably has more than 50 percent bluing remaining.  It has lots of handling marks on the metal and wood, but looks really pretty good.  Rear of stock has some discoloration probably due to recoil pad.  Barrel is 30 inches.  Chamber is 2 3/4 only. Since it is Canadian, it has British proof marks. Rather unique in the US.  I had to list this under Winchester, but it is pre-Winchester. Apon request, I can send some additional photos of the roll marks on the receiver, only one photo allowed here. Maybe better as a unique wall hanger, but up to you. $90 cash to legal gun owners only please."

In fact if all you have is a box of parts that used to be a firearm thats ok tooCurrent needs. 2 Glock pistols. Can be in almost any shape as long as the serial number isnt compromised scratched off or altered in anyway. Dont care if they are broken, missing parts , old, new , painted pink and purple. Any calibers ok. Did you screw up that home stipple job ? Does it look like your dog chewed on the grip ? Thats OK 1  S&W M&P Pistols any caliber and any beat up condition ..(yes even that ugly one you tried to home cerakote and are too embarrased to take to the range) I also need a few SKS rifles (prefer Norinco). Again broken is ok.. Beat to heck is ok. Parts missing is ok, seized up ok, Bubba'd up all ok.. (JUST ADDED) Also need take off parts . Did you swap the stock and have a left over stock-left over wood?  I will also look at any firearm not listed on a case by case basis.

The Black Label 1911-30 Pro is a custom-grade pistol, straight from the factory.Size Matters. The Browning 1911-380 combines two of John M. Browning's most lasting innovations - the Model 1911 and the 380 ACP cartridge - into a modern, lightweight pistol. Unlike most of the modern ""pocket pistols"" that chamber the snappy 380 ACP cartridge, the 1911-380 is slightly larger to better manage recoil for improved control that makes follow-up shots faster and more accurate. The longer barrel increases bullet velocity for more downrange punch and improved accuracy. The grip is compact, yet is long and wide enough to allow the shooting hand full purchase for added shooting comfort.FRAME – Composite; Fully machined 7075 aluminum sub-frame and slide railsSLIDE – Blackened stainless steel; Matte black finishBARREL – Rust-resistant; Target crownACTION – Locked-breech action; Single action triggerGRIPS – Grooved G-10 compositeFEATURES – Two eight round magazines; Extended ambidextrous manual thumb safety; Extended slide release; Beavertail grip safety; Commander hammer; ABS carry case includedSIGHTS – Steel three-dot combat sightsRestricted in California and MassachusettsItem SelectorCaliberBarrel LengthMore Options3804 1/4""Item Number 051900492UPC REDACTED96Caliber 380Barrel Length 4 1/4""Overall Length 7 1/2""Weight 18 ozMagazine Capacity 8Sight Radius 5 3/8""Barrel Finish MatteReceiver Finish MatteFront Sight Combat White DotRear Sight Combat White DotBarrel Material SteelCheckering MoldedReceiver Material Black CompositeTrigger Finish Matte BlackTrigger Guard Finish Matte BlackMagazine Type Single StackTrigger Material AlloyTrigger Guard Material CompositeCase ABSMSRP $799.99"
