It has all the old military features like the gas shutoff/ grenade sight and the flip up night sights though they're deactivaded. The plastic handguard has been swapped out for original wood. The folding stock locks up very tight. Comes with the cleaning rod and 7 magazines and grenade launcher muzzle brake as well as the slant brake that's on it. These are built very well and are kind of hard to come by. This is not an npap which is an inferior ak. The m70ab2 and m70ab2t are built with military parts and are g2g. It is dated 1990 so this rifle probably saw use during the Yugoslav wars.

Early, Dulith finish. Serial # 971,896 with NO prefix rather than an underlined No. Although some publications list this serial number as March 1943 production, it may have been finished after production was started again in May-June ’43 (after shutdown in Feb.) with the new on site Ordnance inspector. He designated that new production pistols would have the NO prefix to distinguish newly produced pistols. Since old receivers were used up in new production a mix of NO and No can be found in serial number range 955,000 to 1,016,000. This pistol has the Du-lite finish with some blued parts. Regulations required the same finish on the receiver and slide but parts could be other finishes. Slide is type 2 with markings 1 3/8” long and ending in N.Y.U.S.A. Type 2 slides started about #935,000. Blued High Standard barrel. P stamped on the left side of the lug, HS on the right. Bore is mirror with a little micro erosion from firing. Feed ramp is bright with traces of finish, not polished. Recoil spring plug is blued. Remington narrow hammer. Finely checkered early Remington mainspring cover. Blued checkered slide stop (Colt). Blued safety checkered on top and bottom with no undercut (Colt). Colt supplied these parts to Remington until Remington could make them. Front sight has sloped serrated ramp on rear. Rounded cut on front of rear sight with squared aperture. Early Keyes grips without re-enforcing rings around screws. No hits, bangs or smashed checkering. Bluing on pistol is about 95%. There is some wear on the top of the barrel and on other moving parts. Du-lite was not as sturdy as Parkerizing. Heat treated area on end of the slide is very visible but there is none above the slide stop. The slide stop area was not included in heat treating until sometime after April 1943. Blued checkered magazine release. Magazine is General Shaver manufacturer with G on the toe, spot welded plate and welded seam on the back. An excellent early Remington with only slight handling wear."
