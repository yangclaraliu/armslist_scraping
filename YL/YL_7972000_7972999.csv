This provides flatter, clearer night vision images. The COREplatform offers ‘best in class’ resolution with up to 70 lp/mm, and increased photocathode sensitivity levels of upwards of 400µm/lm, providing image quality that rivals that of high-end Gen 2 image tubes, even in challenging ambient light conditions. The body of the unit is made from solid aluminum; the O-ring is sealed and rubber coated for further protection. Like all Armasight scopes, the Vampire is nitrogen-treated and comes complete with batteries, a soft carrying case, a user manual, and all necessary hardware for solid mounting to a standard 7/8” Picatinny or Weaver-style rail. The Vampire has multicoated all-glass lenses and a manually-adjustable fine reticle that makes precise shot placement incredibly easy. This Night Vision riflescope is also water, dust, and sand-proof for increased reliability. Complete with tactical rails for lasers or illuminators (the high-power IR illuminator is included standard), the Armasight Vampire is ideal for the predator hunter, tactical marksmen, or anyone looking for a compact, sturdy, lightweight night vision riflescope. Features: – CORE Techology – Shock protected, all-glass IR transmission multicoated optics – Illuminated reticle with brightness adjustment – Detachable long-range infrared illuminator – Water and fog resistant design – Low battery indicator – Quick release mount – Mounts to standard weaver rails"

But it fits pretty good in the RMR number 1 mos plate and holds zero and has me keeping a super tight group! Gun hasn’t had too much use as I’m the second owner and it had minimal usage before me and since I have had it only around 100-150 rounds have been put through it. Only little thing is a very small and barely noticeable spot of holster wear on the left side of the slide. Speaking of which I also have a FAB defense Scorpio’s covert IWB left handed holster for it if needed. I would really love to trade it for a Sig p320 RX compact, or P320 Carry Tacops. But I am also interested in a Sig P320 Compact or Carry in preferably 9mm. Only other trade im really interested in is for a CZ P-10 C. Thanks for looking and have a great day!"

This has been my career since the early 90s. I am also a father and husband who is beginning to get in to firearms and safety(resposnsibly) for my family.

I realize that what I do is not something that the every day Joe can just do on his own so I figure it's worth a shot.

Incredibly accurate rifle with only 40 rounds through it. I started the Savage recommended barrel break in, but didn't see any reason to continue the full break in procedure. The pictured target is a 1 inch square shot from a bench with bipod and rear hand bag only. No lead sled. This was at 100 yards with a full value wind sustained at 30 mph, with gusts to 40. Thing is, the wind blew the right side of the target off the staples, so with each gust the wind would double the target over onto itself, so each shot had to be timed. Great practice but this gun is even more precise in calm conditions. I'm hesitant to trade, but I don't have any place to stretch this rifle out as it deserves. Looking to trade the gun itself, or can trade with any combination of/or all of the additions. These include SWFA SS10 optic with Butler caps and SWFA sun shade, Leopold rings, bipod, hardcase, extra ammo (Hornady Precision Hunter ELD-X rounds) and the ZRO Delta muzzle brake.Will look at whatever gun you have or multi gun trades. Will also sell for cash. But the total needs to be equivalent to my value on this rifle. It's in like new condition. I value it at $1500 as it sits with everything included. Serious trades only, but that said, I won't bite so let's talk. The worst I can say is no. But I won't respond to lowball or ridiculous offers. Also, please don't bother asking if it's still for sale or trade. If you see this ad, I still have it.Trade or sale is open to Texas residents only who are legally capable of owning a firearm for face to face transactions, but I'll ship on your dime to your FFL once the monetary transaction has taken place.  Face to face transactions will happen in the Houston area.

Two new 10mm TRP™ Operator® models – one with a 5-inch barrel, and a longslide with a 6-inch barrel – deliver tactically proven engineering, greater terminal velocity and now more stopping power.The TRP™ (Tactical Response Pistol) line is based on the custom Professional Model™ that met the stringent specifications to win the FBI’s coveted HRT 1911 pistol contract. Until now, Springfield’s TRP Operator 1911s were available in .45 ACP only. Since its introduction, the TRP has become the standard for serious fighting handguns – a tradition the feature-rich 10mm models continue.Forged steel frames and slides are precision fitted to Match Grade stainless steel barrels with fully supported ramps. Frames and slides are coated in Black-T®, a self-lubricating, highly corrosion resistant finish that is engineered to shield the firearm from the heaviest use and toughest conditions. Integrated three-slot accessory rails allow rock-solid attachment of lights and lasers. Sights are 3-dot tritium nightsights, featuring a tactical-rack rear in the 5” version, and a fully adjustable rear in the 6” model.The Octo-Grip™ front strap and mainspring housing coupled with G10 VZ Grips® assure a confident hold. Once the ambidextrous safety lever is flipped, the Springfield Armory Gen 2 Speed Trigger, tuned to a crisp 4.5- to 5-pound pull, delivers custom-grade feel and performance. The 10mm recoil is tamed by properly balancing the recoil impulse with a heavier slide/barrel combination in conjunction with an optimized recoil spring making it an unbelievably soft-shooting pistol. Each 10mm TRP Operator is shipped with two 8-round magazines.The new 10mm TRP Operator models weigh in at 40 oz. (5-inch barrel) and 45 oz. (6-inch barrel), making these full-sized 1911 pistols soft-shooting and well-balanced options in a serious fighting handgun.Grip Type VZ® Alien, Dirty Olive G-10Length 8.6""Recoil System GI Style, 18.5 lb Recoil SpringWeight 40 oz.Sights SA Tactical Rack Rear, 3-Dot TritiumBarrel 5"" Stainless Steel Match Grade, Fully Supported Ramp w/ BushingsCome in and check it out in store at Gun Commanders on Cleveland Highway or visit online at www.guncommanders.com"

You can see the worst of it in the second picture, on the left side of the receiver above the trigger. I have fired 3"" slugs out of it recently so I am confident that it's in good working condition. The top of the receiver is not drilled for accessories, if that matters to you.BTW, if you're comparing this against a Shockwave, consider that the two weigh almost exactly the same unloaded, and while this one is only about 3"" longer overall, that gets you a better grip, two more rounds in the magazine, over 5½"" more barrel, and more than $100 off the price.Although not included for this price, I do have some accessories that could be added to the deal if desired: flashlight mount, side saddle shell holder, synthetic shoulder stock, sling studs, magazine limiter, scabbard case, etc.I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash in the NW San Antonio / Helotes / Leon Springs area, but I'm willing to ship to a FFL holder at buyer's expense.

Mostly this configuration was used by USAF EOD/Pararescue (military used Colts)...however if someone wants to make a BHD/Somalia era clone...all you need is a N1 Stock, 6-hole Colt Handguard and an Aimpoint 5000.This is a robust build with only 200 rounds fired for break in. The firearm is coated with enamel baked on paint that I did myself. Before painting, it was stripped down, degreased, sights taken off, painted and placed in oven at 265* for an hour.Factory RRA CAR A2 rifle was utilized (RRA only offers this configuration now to LE). Reason this platform was used is A) provides a matched upper and lower B) RRA uses a NM A2 rear sight with .250 moa adjustments vs .500 moa and it does not cant like other A2 sights C) They make one of the best A2 upper receivers other than Colt.The rifle has a true Colt 14.5 SOCOM barrel installed to be SOPMOD correct. A used Surefire SOCOM flash hider was pinned by ADCO (the flash hider was used on a previous rifle with a suppressor so it does have suppressor wear...no suppressor has been used on this build)...in case someone wants to run the correct suppressor.KAC RAS M4 Rail kit with VFG and CoversAmbi SafetyLMT Tactical Charging HandleB5 Enhanced SOPMOD StockStrike Industries Flat Wire Buffer SpringColt Tear Drop Forward AssistTangoDown Pistol Grip1-30rd USGI Mag included"

The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that’s why the SAINT™ AR15 features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won’t feel it. Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT™ AR15 includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance. An all new, exclusive Bravo Company PKMT KeyMod handguard packs heat shields and flexible attachment points into a slim and easy to handle form factor. The Bravo Company buttstock is rattle-free and complemented by a Bravo pistol grip designed to improve defensive performance.LOG:50610"
