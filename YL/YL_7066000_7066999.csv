(Please google images to see this original Megatron...)After carefully selecting which one I was going to use, (to make it even more unique)...I had to go with a P1 instead of a P38 because the P1 had the more world renowned last 3 digits.....Bond,... James BondBasically how that works is the Germans stamped the last 3 #'s of the full serial # separately on the barrel and slide....So (and yes, I know Bond carried a PPK...) it just seemed all that more cinematic/eccentric..... and made an even more powerful tribute to ""movies in general"" by having the slide with ""007"" stamped on the left side (and a Decepticon logo on the right)....I mean you look down and your legit, badass German made Walther and it has 007 on the side....thats just too cool.(Would love to know what guy has a PPK with 007 as the last 3....I bet he's happy...if they even did the 'last 3 thing' on those...not sure).So without further hesitation, up for sale is my beautiful, custom 9mm legacy that Ive had for many years...and now passing it on to the next guy whose just gotta have it-Date stamped 11/65, this P1 was sent out and fully stripped. Hard chromed and black cerekot on all parts that are shown black. Frame has been anodized. True full laser engraved Decepticon logo on right side of slide. Threaded barrel 1/2 x 28 (suppressor will not be sold with this pistol, instead you will get a 9mm flash hider (bird cage). This Walther has had basically zero rounds through it and still needs to be broken in. I did not have the top strap of the slide dove tailed with a front sight (I've seen it done, just never bothered) Was too excited to finally get it back, and didnt wanna send it back out again for several weeks.Will come with 4 Hard chrome factory mags to match, and an extra set of brand new grips as well as the new set the pistol has installed on it-This would be a real treat and one hell of a conversation piece for any movie/firearm enthusiest.

Sefried II the 9-shot Sentinel came about sometime in 1955. It was first introduced as the J. C. Higgins Model 88 by Sears Roebuck with a price tag of $37.50. Additional private label versions were produced for Western Auto and Col. Rex Applegate’s Mexican arms company, ARMAMEX.  it doesn’t appear to be a remarkable design. In fact, casting an eye on the black anodized, cast-aluminum frame of the 1956 era R-101 model Sentinel pictured here, it looks cheap. Cheap in price only. The devil is in the details. Notice that there are no visible screws holding it together, just like a classic Mauser ’96 Broomhandle. Actually, there is one. It’s the screw securing the grip to the frame, but otherwise, the whole gun is held together by the single, visible hammer pin, securing the triggerguard, fire control system and grip to the main frame. Notice the unusual cylinder ratchet Sefried designed. There are no conventional ratchet teeth in the early Sentinels. In their place are nine, recessed detents at the rear of the star extractor that are engaged by a conventional pawl. The rotation and alignment of the cylinder are precise, and by eliminating the conventional sharp teeth of the ratchet, wear is minimized in the innovative Sefried ratchet and pawl system, which extended life of the gun The grooved cylinder is counterbored to better support and encase the head of the rimfire cases. Since the hammer nose of the Sentinel is the firing pin, to prevent the hammer nose from striking the rear of the cylinder and possibly fracturing if dry fired, there is a relief groove milled at the 12 o’clock position on each chamber. The relief groove also serves as a positive channel for escaping gas should the case head rupture when struck by the hammer nose. The cylinder crane locking mechanism is unique. It consists of a spring-loaded cylindrical shoulder on the cylinder ejector rod which is pulled tightly into a locking recess milled into the frame. To unlock the cylinder, you simply pull forward on the ejector rod and swing it out.  Thanks to GUNS Magazine for the above info.Mechanically vg-exc, bluing shows age, this model did not have a return spring on the ejector, thus some scratching on left side of frame, grips Excellent."

Fits your M203 or M79 Thumper or any launcher that fits full 40mm bore rounds.  GOT A LAUNCHER slung under your AR? Or a multiple round launcher? or maybe vintage flare guns and launchers...these will work in all of them and if you collect vintage guns and launchers, this is THE ammo you want to display with it. The best part, you can reload them. Empty cases sell for $25 on Gunbroker so $10 more and you get a LIVE round. I have a few groups of 37mm flares, most dated 1963 or 1959 but the group from Harvell Kilgore are newer. They are likely 1970s or later but since the rest of the group are dated earlier, I will put 1960s just in case. The company changed names to Chemring Kilgore in 2000 as they now make aircraft countermeasures for the military. Flares and chaff and cool stuff. These were all stored for decades in ammo cans in a dry climate and I tested 2 so far and they worked like new. Obviously, I cant guarantee anything. I was told you could reload these and it makes sense as they use small rifle primers from the look. These are just under 3 7/8 inches long and all 3 have the red painted original tops and are 100% never fired original. BY THE WAY, what looks like a yellowish blob around the primer is a sealant. Looks like a lacquer type. ONLY $35 each.. More photos available including bottom and closeup of all writing MUST SHIP GROUND- Ships Fedex Ground for $10.95"

They are 7.5 inches long, or about double the regular flares as they have parachutes and lines in there. Both flares look like they are a year or 2 old as they were stored properly. About 60 years old and the one I fired worked like new These NEW OLD STOCK flares are labeled Merchant Vessel Distress 20,000 candlepower 30 second parachute flares. Made by Signal Pyrotechnics Co. from 1956 and 1959, these are live. I test fired 1 on July 4th (over water) and darned if it didnt light up the area. 20k candlepower doesnt seem like much with the new Cree bulbs you get on flashlights, but when its emitted in every direction and 100s of feet above you, its a LOT of ghostly red light. Of course, I can not guarantee every one, but almost all my ammo from the 1930s through 50s fires fine and these were stored in an ammo can in a dry area for decades. Primers should be fine and they are reloadable from what I read. Looks like Small Rifle Primers. I have many sets of meteor and single star flares to list as well plus 1 that says SOUND REPORT, which is like a flash bang I imagine or ""bird bombs"" as we used to call them. One of the 2 flares has the red cap off (they are soldered on at the factory) but the contents are intact and it is just like the one which I fired. These are 7.5 inches tall MUST SHIP GROUND-- 2 pounds Fedex Ground for $12.25 Listed at only $37.50 each.

I got it as a shooter that I wouldn't worry about it getting used in the woods or anything. It had some rust but I had it media blasted and Cerakoted, and I refinished the stock myself. Added a Limbsaver recoil pad for a little longer length of pull and put the Williams on it. The screw it's missing is the muzzle end barrel band screw. I believe it walked out and got lost last range trip when I was sighting in the Williams. Guess I hadn't tightened it down like I thought, oops. Screw is a couple bucks from Numrich gun parts online, I just haven't got around to it. It's a really good shooter, Hornady's Leverevolution flex tip surprised me out of it. I bought for $200, Rock City Guns in Roxboro charged $100 for Cerakote, and there's a little over $100 in the Williams sight Limbsaver and stock refinishing. So I've got a shade over 400 in it, can't go any less than $350, trade value would be for what I have in it at $400. May trade for Marlin 30-30, a 38/357 or 22 lr/mag snub, or a decent 243. Be happy to send more pictures. Not looking to trade, prefer cash but may trade. Thanks."

I've carried it in a DeSantis Nemesis pocket holster ( which will be included)  in my front pocket a few times, and you hardly notice it there. Like I said, it's new out of the box, so I haven't even cleaned or field stripped it yet. This particular model is getting harder to find, and it is a beautiful pistol.  G10 grips and Sig Night sights two.  Has one flush mount mag and one extended with extra round and a pinky rest. Only reason for selling is trying to come up with the money for a metal carport for my boat. My asking price is the winning bid off gunbroker back in May of this year. May work on price just a little.  Call or text for any questions. Thanks. 4057778twotwo1. not interested in any trades"
