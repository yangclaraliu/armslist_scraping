Yugo M-44 Mauser, 
This is NOT a Yugoslavian rifle, They BECAME Yugoslav rifles!!!

 What they actually are is GERMAN Kar98k rifles captured as the German army retreated and units surrendered at the end of WWII, the Yugo's arsenaled them, repaired them where necessary, buffed off the German markings on the receiver rings and stamped them with a Yugoslav crest instead and placed them in war reserve for over 60 years.  ""Preduce 44"" stamped on them to tell them apart from Yugoslavian produced Mausers, and shoot extremely well. They aren't really a Yugoslav Mauser, they are German Mauser wearing Yugoslav markings.

Also the marking on stock ""1.TRZ""
Yugoslavian 1.TRZ
1 Tehnicki Remontni Zavod
 ""1"" stands for Cacak, Serbia
 ""TRZ"" translates to ""technical repair facility""
 refurbishment mark

I have a Mauser K98, Mod 98, 8mm. This gun is still in cosmoline, basically new/old gun...I believe it is 1943, but not a mauser expert...But here is what I do know about it....

 Yugo M-44 Mauser, 
 This is NOT a Yugoslavian rifle, They BECAME Yugoslav rifles!!!

 What they actually are is GERMAN Kar98k rifles captured as the German army retreated and units surrendered at the end of WWII, the Yugo's arsenaled them, repaired them where necessary, buffed off the German markings on the receiver rings and stamped them with a Yugoslav crest instead and placed them in war reserve for over 60 years. ""Preduce 44"" stamped on them to tell them apart from Yugoslavian produced Mausers, and shoot extremely well. They aren't really a Yugoslav Mauser, they are German Mauser wearing Yugoslav markings.

 Also the marking on stock ""1.TRZ""
 Yugoslavian 1.TRZ
 1 Tehnicki Remontni Zavod
 ""1"" stands for Cacak, Serbia
 ""TRZ"" translates to ""technical repair facility""
 refurbishment mark
 Soviet M44 Stock

After having upgraded to a LnL I've decided to sell my Lee Classic Turret since I will probably never use it again and could use the money to go towards a case feeder for the LnL. The lot has the following included

(1) Classic Turret Press. The press is in pretty good condition as I like to take care of my items. It is a little dirty now, but will be cleaned before being shipped out.

(6) Quick change turrets. 1 is brand new only out of the box for shipping. the other 5 are used, but look great. They may have a few scratches on them from tightening down the lock rings on the dies.

(3) Normal powder dispensers. These are all in great condition.

(1) Powder dispenser for rifles. This one is set up for double disk kit for larger powder throws.

(1) Small primer attachment.

(1) Large primer attachment. (no the primers are not included).

Both small and large primer rams

(2) Risers for the powder dispensers. One is one the rifle powder dispenser, the other is used.

(20) Autodiscs. I'm positive there are duplicates in here.

(1) Extra hopper. This was found at a garage sale so I got it.

(1) Chain part kit for the rifle powder dispenser

(1) Rifle charge die

(5) Charge Bars



Going just by Amazon prices this would cost around 425$ new before shipping costs. I would like to get 325 for everything shipped via UPS. I prefer USPS Money Order as I do not do PayPal. I would do discreet cash if necessary.

This is also posted on other sites, so first 'I'll Take It' gets it.

This is the brightest light you have ever seen mounted to a weapon. It will make you see spots during the day and at night forget about seeing again if you get hit with it. Its sitting in a Elzetta ZSM mount with optional side rail. The best part of this awesome rifle was sent to me by a close friend who is a SFO serving in Afghanistan. Its a AIMSHOT LS8300. They are only sold to SOCOM and other elite SFU on military POs only. You can verify by calling Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta. They will not sell these to LE Agency's any longer. This laser has the brightest beam and dot you have ever seen. You can clearly see the beam even in day light and at night it looks like something from STAR WARS! Yes it will light a match. This laser is not like the other crap out on the market it makes those look like something from a cracker jack box. Comes with two tail caps and zero tool one click and one pressure. WILL DEFINTLEY GET YOU IN TROUBLE VERY FAST! The rifle is all new in boxes with paper work never fired. Thanks so much for looking and have a happy and safe fourth.

I promise you wont find one this clean anywhere, especially with such a nice scope on it!.
I have a ""Hunter""Super Blackhawk in .44 Rem Mag , grey laminate grips (RARE) with a Leupold 2x m8 long eye relief scope, this gun has provided me with several deer these past two years, but Im moving to a new state where I can use big bore rifles so Ill have no use for this pistol there. It has been fired approx. 20 times and is in perfect condition with no cosmetic or mechanical issues at all. I do have the original box with manual, it is a 1990 year pistol, there isnt one of these of gunbroker & there probably wont be, most guys that get these keep them. I also have a nice uncle mikes shoulder holster Ill throw in with it. It has a 7.5"" barrell and is accurate out to 85 yards that I have proven, but Im sure it would drop a deer at 100 yards no problem. I paid over $900 for the gun and over $300 for the scope so Im asking $950 obo for the package. Now is the time to get you a good deer gun for Indiana and this is it & I promise you wont find this gun in a store anywhere especially in this area of the country!

I bought it earlier this year with all intentions of adding performance parts to it and using it as a daily driver in nice weather, but since I have realized I really don't want to deal with all the work. That said it is a great moped.

 When I bought it, the original owner had just replaced the magneto and cleaned the fuel lines. Engine runs like a champ. All lights and horn work. The speedometer did not work so I removed it. Tires are also relatively new with only about 300 miles on them. The turn signals were a little bent up, but work fine. Also, the bracket on the seat could use a spot weld to hold it back in place. I can do that before the bike is sold.

 Since I have had it, I have driven it less than 60 miles. I removed the front wind screen and side covers because they were broken and repaired with the world's worst fiberglass job. I also replaced the original handlebars with a straight handlebar that gives the bike a little more aggressive look and more motorcycle like feel. I still have the original handlebars if they are desired. Unfortunately someone has knocked it over in the parking lot, which broke the tail light housing (light still works) and tore the grips. I have bought new grips for it and they will be installed before the bike is sold. I am listing these issues so you know I am honest and not trying to sell you a junker, because there are a lot of those out there. Other than those cosmetic issues, the moped is solid. The A-35 engine runs great and usually only takes one kick to start if it is run often. It will definitely hit 30-35 on a flat surface and more on a downward slope. The two-stroke oil is fed from a separate tank, so there is no mixing of fuel and oil to do. Gas tank is full and the oil is topped off. You can also have the rest of the oil. Also has valid plates, so you can drive it til they expire on Nov 9, 2014, then you will have to re-register it.

 Bought it just a few months ago in April for $550. Considering the work I did to it and damages to it, I would like about $500 for it, but price is negotiable. Email or text me at 4one2-4nine8-5zero4zero.  Also considering gun trades.  I'm looking for specific stuff, but let me know anything you have to trade"

He has had his first and second round boosters and has been dewormed. He is partially house trained. He is good with cats and other dogs. The problem is that the week after we got him I totaled my car and then we just found out that my wife is pregnant. We would love to keep him, but we already have two dogs and two cats. We simply don't have the time or money to train and play with him enough. I know your family will love him, so please text me at 574-742-5071 and I will send you pictures of him. Thank you."

This rifle handles both .223 and .556 rounds flawlessly.  The gun has had about 250 rounds put through it for sighting in the scope, etc.  The gun has been well maintained and stored in it's case in a smoke-free, climate-controlled, low-humidity environment.  What you see in the pictures is what you get.  Plus a couple of AR-15 specific cleaning tools that are not pictured.  Your gun purchase comes with the gun, a standard BSA scope, and the factory stock.  The tube and stock are NOT ""mil-spec"" however.  Not an issue unless you are wanting to put a custom stock on that requires a ""mil-spec"" tube.  In that case, just get one and plug and play.  :)  The receiver is aluminum along with the upper and lower.  (you can refer to the spec sheet link for any more specifics.  

The extras with the gun are @570 rounds of .556 (green tipped) ammo, @550 rounds of .223 ammo, 9 metal 30-round clips and 2 polymer 30-round clips.  (5 clips already come pre-loaded with .556 and the other 6 come pre-loaded with .223).  Also, the rounds of .556 ammo come pre-loaded on stripper clips for easy loading and also a strip-lula is included.  

This gun is a smooth shooter and I have zero complaints.  I found the gun on sale back before Christmas of 2013 at Larry's Pistol and Pawn over in Huntsville.  I was so happy with the deal, but sadly, I have to part with it at this time.  Some financial needs have come up and so other needs take precedence over having an extra gun.  Price is somewhat negotiable and I'm willing to break down the listing into separate parts (i.e. price just for the gun, or the ammo, or magazines, etc.)  All serious offers will be considered.

The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G19 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

The line on the reel has never been in water, and there is about half a spool (?) of line left. I want to say the line is 120 lb. test but honestly I have forgotten (surgery Will do that to you, that’s also why I’m selling the bow).

Five (5) of these arrows are used, they are XX 75 – 2215 Autumn Hunters shafts. 
These five arrows have fletching’s and nocs installed, come with field tips, and 
measure appx. 32 & 1/8 inches  from tip to tip.

Twelve (12) of these arrows are full length XX75 – 2512 Autumn Orange shafts. 
Nocs have been installed on these twelve shafts and they measure 35 inches from 
tip to nock. 

These also come with 12 plastic glue-in broadhead inserts and an unopened pack of 100 purple  Easton plastic vanes.  The package of vanes is unopened, but I did make a small slit in the package to let air escape so I could fold it up and put in a tube for shipping.

This is enough vanes for 25 arrows if you use 4 fletchings or 33 arrows (with a couple of fletchings  left over) if you use 3 fletchings.

I also have these listed on eBay so, The 12 uncut shafts have been wrapped in tissue paper and put in the tube for mailing.  The 5 used arrows were then slid into the tube on the outside of the 12 wrapped shafts. The 12 inserts and pack of vanes are packed on top of this and then a two inch piece of foam installed into each end of the tube and taped in place.

If you are interested and I have no bid on eBay, I will cancel the auction.

I have a Burris Eliminator 3.5-10x magnification laser scope for sale or trade. I am not much of a distance shooter, and doubt I will ever need this. I believe these run about $600 new, and this one is in excellent condition. Glass is perfect; there is one nick on top from being in safe, and small marks on rail from being mounted. No box or manual, but you can download the manual .pdf on their site for free. 

Asking $400 or best offer. 

I am open to all reasonable cash and/or trade offers. Feel free to text or PM with any offers, questions, or pic requests. I'm currently in Moore, OK, but can ship. Thank you!
