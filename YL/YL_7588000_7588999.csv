Very smooth, serial number is only 4 digits long...original used period correct sling. Never wanted to sell this collectors items but priorities come along. Very clean, clear serial, build and inspection stamps all over the rifle. Looking for a collector to appreciate and hang this up. I paid 425 for this in its condition about a year ago which I know is a lot for a mosin. Still, 5 inch group at 120 yards, and judging by how beautiful the rifling grooves are, I've put the most ammo thru it in its life. (60 rds) guessing it was made and not used as russia was mass developing the PPSH-41 for its front line troops at this point during WW2. I have around 1200 rounds 7.62x54 if you'd like any included with sale. Email me for details ETC."

Accurate little gun with less than 4 or 5 boxes of shells though it.  It 'was' a collectors item, now it's just a show piece shooter. ;)  The gun includes everything from the factory, plus Bobby's Certificate of Authenticity.  It'll never be a million dollar gun but it was worth every penny of the original selling price of $600.   Everyone that's seen it in person have oooh and ahhhh'd about it.  If you buy/trade into it you will almost be obligated to get #146 of the matching Vaquero. Lol. I like cash, but I'm stuck where I'm at. I believe it to be worth more than that but that's for you to decide.  I am interested in 327 Magnum, 357 mag, 44 special. And revolvers that shoot semi-auto cartridges. I much prefer Email until we are ready to meet. Low balls will not be answered. If the ads up the gun is available. I will not answer, ""is it still available"" emails."

272,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7588272,For Sale:   UNION SWITCH & SIGNAL / US&S ~ 1911A1 U.S. ARMY -- Nice Shape w/ Original Dulite Finish..,"Illinois, Illinois, United States","$ 2,250","Listed On: Friday, November 17, 2017",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Pistol,"Here's one of the harder to find WWII .45 automatics. This 1911A1 was manufactured by Union Switch & Signal in the autumn of 1943. Of the nearly 2-million 1911A1's manufactured during the Second World War, only 55,000 were manufactured by US&S. As manufacturers of 1911A1's go, only the fabled Singer is rarer. This pistol is in fine shape and appears to be all original. The frame is properly marked with the circled RCD acceptance found only on the US&S production. Both the frame and the slide are marked with the ""P"" proof which is correct for the later US&S pistols. The ""P"" proof on the slide is centered ahead of the rear sight...this is normally found on just slightly later production US&S pistols...but the internal & external wear patterns between slide, frame & barrel indicate these parts are original to one another. The other various parts are also correct for a US&S including the coarse checkered hammer, knurled mainspring housing, blued trigger, ""concentric circle"" barrel bushing, HS barrel, etc. The original Dulite blue finish is fully original and in very good overall condition with some normal expected handling & holster wear. There is thinning to the finish on the mainspring housing as well as a small amount of surface patina to the left front of the slide. There is a ding to the rear sight but no significant pitting anywhere. The frame's bullet ramp is milled in the white, as is correct for an original finish pistol. I'd grade the original finish at about 85-90% overall. The original Keyes Fibre grips are in very good shape although there is a small chip missing from the rear/bottom corner of the left panel. The mechanics are in perfect working order with everything working properly. The bore is less than ideal and while it shows strong rifling and is perfectly shootable, it exhibits the effects of corrosive ammo with light to moderate pitting throughout. This pistol comes with one original, good condition WWII M.S. Little Mfg. Co. contract magazine. This is a highly collectible 1911A1 and one of the most desirable of all WWII pistols."

This is a quick detach suppressor, so I will be including 4 muzzle brakes for it (2 are for .308s and 2 are for 5.56 - use the suppressor on all 4 rifles) - these are $80 each if you buy them separate.30 caliber, full auto rated (will shoot anything up to 300 win mag). About a 35-40 db reduction - I shot ARs and 308s without ear-pro just fine. I have the box and paperwork on it. Lifetime warranty.  It gets sort of tricky since I cannot physically transfer the suppressor to you until I receive the stamp back in the mail (right now it's about 3 months).  I will have the form 4 already printed out with my information and the suppressor's. All you will have to do is fill out your portion (which I will explain - it's the same as buying a firearm from a dealer).  I work for a class 3 dealer and do these all the time. This suppressor is out of my personal collection.I will give you all 4 brakes, the box, and a bill of sale. The only piece you wont receive in the suppressor itself.  These are $789 from Yankee Hill with 1 muzzle brake. Text me at (417) 872 - 916two"

I probably put in half a quart per month. It needs new pulleys for the power steering and ac. When the motor mounts broke, the broke those pulleys too. Lack of power steering didn't bother me so I have been driving it like that for two months. It could use an allignment. Tires have about 1/3 tread on them. It has a dent in the driver side front fender. Ive priced it accordingly.

Prices are FTF in Wheaton/Glen Ellyn area.  Beyond that, it needs to be very convenient.For the folks who think they are world class negotiators (and the cheap dumb-asses in the crowd) -""What's your best price"" is not going to get a response that includes a price any different than I have posted.  I may be an idiot, but I'm not going to preemptively negotiate against myself.  My ""best price"" is posted in my asking price.  If you think that's too high or can only afford a portion of my asking price, FEEL FREE TO MAKE AN OFFER!  I will either accept your offer, make a counter offer or say ""No thanks"" if I think your offer is too far apart from my ask to find middle ground.  If you think you risk leaving big money on the table by making an offer against my asking price you are probably too stupid to own a gun.  I'm not broke, destitute, unemployed, desperate or upside down on my mortgage so ridiculous offers might get a funny response.For normal people who enjoy shooting and other fun activities-
