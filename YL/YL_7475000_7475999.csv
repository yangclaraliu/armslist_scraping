Also included is an A2 flash hider and jam nut that I never installed. All parts pictured are included except for the magazine (I can’t sell a 30 round magazine in Colorado and I only have the one anyway).I’ve put maybe a couple hundred rounds through it in the 20+ years I’ve owned it. I never had a single malfunction. It’s been kept regularly cleaned and lubed, but otherwise it just sits in my locker.These rifles have something of a cult following given their adjustable gas piston design at a very reasonable price and their limited availability. Very accurate for a service rifle and extremely reliable.Looking around on armslist and gunbroker, it looks like the average asking price is $1050 without the upgrades I have (which cost a couple hundred dollars), so I’m setting the price at $850 to hopefully be very competitive.Local sale only. Cash/PayPal/Venmo only. Legal FFL transfers only. You pay your own transfer and background check fees. I will meet you at a gun shop of your choosing and we can do the transfer there.Thanks for looking!"

The pic is one I pulled off the net and not of the actual shotgun. I can send pics to interested parties. Looking for rifles in 762x39, 308, etc. Arsenal AK. I will not trade for your SKS unless you add alot of cash or it is Albanian or takes AK mags. Also pistols of all sorts. If you send me a ridiculous offer, please do not expect a reply.  TRADE ONLY"

With that in mind, I am mainly looking for an AR trade. Things like ammo/accessories will increase the odds I will accept the trade. Mine comes with ammo and accessories like mags, case etc. I'm not asking for a $2500 rifle/ar. I'm simply asking for something that is equal in value. New this was almost 900 dollars which it isn't and it does have a scuff on one side which I am taking into consideration. I am not looking for a $300 home built AR either though. Things I find appealing on the AR platform I am so anxiously trying to get into are, scope, some sort or bipod setup and most importantly a case that can be locked. Thank you for reading."
