When I acquired this rifle, the wood stock was is pitiful condition and had ripples in the woods from the original manufacturer. The barrel and other metal parts has some rust and spots of missing bluing and much wear. 

So, I completely sanded and reshaped the stock then finished it with a nice walnut stain and several hand-rubbed layers of gun stock oil to a brilliant shine.  I also completely stripped the metal parts of existing finish and recoated them with 5 coats of matte black duracoat so it will never wear, or rust again.

I hate to get rid of it, but bills need to be paid. Price is negotiable."

I'm selling my pistol gun case. Bought this to put my Concealed carry and my GF's carry pistols in, so it would not be a hassle and time consuming to put them away or get them out. We have a large safe with our long guns and other handguns in, which had a combination lock on it. I've recently upgraded to a larger safe which has a electronic key pad for easier access and we decided to put our CCW firearms in there as well. So now I have no use for this particular safe. I purchased this about 2 years ago and it has not had a problem yet. Comes with 1 back up key, the cable tie down, the safe itself, batteries, the plastic and foam that was in the box when it was new, owner's manual, and the original box. I see them go for $85-100 on line, so I'm asking $50, No trades please.

This gun is big and beautiful, a real eye catcher, when my friends see it,  they all wants their picture taken holding it. My collection no longer comes even close to fitting in my gun safe,  I need to make more room, so I'm looking to sell the Raging Hornet. It's by far the most accurate handgun I've come across.  The gun is in great condition, barrel is bright and tight, rifling is sharp and no crud or pockmarks, lock up is tight and positive, trigger is excellent. There is no wear and tear from  travel or carry, it only went from the safe to my home range and back to the safe. 

The Raging Hornet is an 8 shot, DA/SA revolver in .22 Hornet. It has adjustable front and rear sights and a dove 

tail for mounting optics. The cylinder uses a double lock at the front and the rear of the cylinder, providing a really solid lock up. The full length extractor ejects the cases. 

Sale includes the Taurus Raging Hornet, matching scope mount, matching scope 1.5-4x, the original box, keys, manual, and about 75 rounds of ammo. Also included is a mint copy of Guns & Ammo featuring the Raging Hornet on the cover, as well as a sweet Raging Hornet lapel pin.

The thing I love about the Raging Hornet is the caliber.22 Hornet, it's more powerful than I realized. It holds 8 rounds in the cylinder and the trigger is beautiful for both single and double action.  It shoots flat and hits hard, it's a handgun a sniper would love. A word of caution, on my range the Raging Hornet puts a massive dent in the metal targets I use for handguns.

The serial number is 130-02678, indicating it was manufactured in 1971. Currently there are Williams Aperature sights on the rifle, however it has a bridge for scope rings. There are front and rear points for a sling. There is a spacer between the recoil pad and the stock. The barrel is 22"".

Overall the rifle is in excellent visual conditional and excellent mechanical condition. I consider the wood to be 95%, meaning if you look hard you can find a couple of light nicks and scratches. The bluing is still in great shape, but a little faded on the ejector handle. The action feels flawless, it is smooth and tight. I really love the trigger - no creep, just a light, crisp break. The bore is bright and shiny, like it's brand new.

This is an excellent long range rifle, the .22-250 round is blazing fast - 3500-4000 FPS muzzle velocity depending on the grain and brand of round. It has much less drop at long ranges (300 yards+) than the more popular .308, .270 or 30-06.

Martini-International MKII .22LR match rifle. This is the heavy version, featuring a 29"" barrel and an overall length of 44"". It comes with the original Parker-Hale 25B (PH25B) Aperature Rearsight (8 clicks to the minute) and a Parker-Hale (PH1) Tunnel Foresight. It has a three way adjustable trigger for drag, backlash and weight. The rifle currently has two removeable spacers between the recoil pad and the stock. Also included are several different foresight inserts. The trigger group serial numbers match the barrel (UE5851X).

Overall I consider the rifle to be in good to fair visual conditional and excellent mechanical condition. The wood shows its age with numerous small nicks and scratches. The bluing is thin on the metal edges and basically worn off on the cocking / ejector lever. However the action feels flawless, it is smooth and tight. The trigger is the finest I have ever pulled - no creep, just a light, crisp break. The bore is bright and shiny, like it's brand new.

Chambered for the .30-06 Springfield cartridge, the gas-operated Garand is fed via an 8-shot spring steel en-bloc clip. This rifle wears the original 10-44 dated Springfield barrel and nearly all of the parts are WWII Springfield manufacture from the late war period. The safety lever dates from about 1942. The rear sight is the correct long pinion with type III square-end lock bar. The curved-side op rod is uncut. This rifle is in overall good condition with normal wear from military service. It appears the metal finish was likely reparked as the barrel breech face is not bright, but there is no chrome on the barrel gas port. The stock shows a few dings and dents but there are no cracks. A very faint small crossed cannons cartouche is visible on the left side of the stock. There is a single ""P"" proof on the grip and there is an ""A4"" stamped on the left side of the butt. The mechanics appear to be in good working order. The bore rates very good with bright, sharp rifling that shows some slight frost in the grooves but good solid muzzle and throat erosion readings. There are NO import markings on this rifle"

Trigger was only dry fired about 20 times. 

The Geissele Super Dynamic - 3 Gun (SD-3G) trigger is a semi-automatic-only derivative of the two-stage Super Select-Fire (SSF) combat trigger that Geissele Automatics produces for customers in the U.S. Special Operations Community. The SD-3G was developed to combine the SSF combat trigger’s match-grade semi-automatic performance with its smooth single-stage full-automatic feel to make a fast, smooth, and robust trigger ideal for 3 Gun competition shooting. The new Geissele Super Dynamic - 3 Gun trigger has a super short trigger pull and a short reset so that rounds can be sent
downrange as quickly as possible while still maintaining superb accuracy. 

The Super Dynamic Triggers are rugged, non-adjustable combat triggers with a sear design that provides a wide margin of safety against unintentional discharges yet still gives the operator a sharp, repeatable trigger release. The exclusive, flat trigger bow, patterned after the trigger of an M1911 pistol, reduces the perceived pull weight of the triggers and gives outstanding tactile feedback and trigger control."

Caliber: 308 Winchester / 7.62 NATO. Barrel length: 18"". Overall length: 26"". Capacity: 20+1. Magzines included: 01 FAL Poly. Weight: 8.1 lbs unloaded. Action: Semi-automatic. Sights: To be provided by the buyer. Safety: Lever. Stock: Synthetic / Tan in color. Metal Finish: Black. Muzzle: A2 Flash Hider. Practical rang: 600 meters. Factory description: The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action.

The JP Silent Captured Recoil spring assembly is a self-contained unit that replaces the standard buffer and spring. The components of the assembly are highly polished for extremely smooth and quiet operation. The system is optimized for use with a JP Low mass bolt carrier and adjustable gas system, but also works with standard weight components. The system is designed to work with a carbine length buffer tube, and includes a spacer for use in A1/ A2 fixed stocks. The spring is also removable for custom tuning for your rifle. This captured recoil spring assembly is designed to eliminate the noise and vibration of the standard buffer, spring, and buffer tube. When used with a tuned gas system, this captured spring and buffer dramatically reduce the feel of the mechanical recoil of a standard system, making it feel more like a bolt gun."

The barrel has some black marks inside, apparently you really have to scrub them because of how powerful they are. I usually just use a snake in my others, but I guess it wasn't enough for this monster lol. Anyways, I have both the .44 mag (10"") and the .50 AE (Stock 6"" barrel), hogue grip DE hard case and manual. The only thing I don't have is the little $5 tool, I never needed it  and don't even know what it is for.  You can order them from DE for a few buck if you need it. I also have 2 boxes of .50 AE ammo (40) and a box of .44 mag ammo (50). This is the nicer mark XIX (19) back when they were made in Israel. Comes with 3 mags, 2 .50 cal and 1, .44 mag.

Then he sent it off to Weatherby to have an excellent skip line checkering pattern done. (shallow enough to be removed by a restoration expert).

This model has the reinforced receiver, much like your average O-PAP rifle. The receiver is 1.5mm thick, and has a bulged RPK trunnion. On the gas tube is a grenade launching sight, so if you have some dummy rifle grenades and some blanks, your buddies can take turns ""going long"" and catching a 2 pound metal Nerf Vortex look-alike. Just kidding, don't do that, that's stupid. 

This rifle has your standard polished bolt assembly as all Serbian AKs do. The barrel is thicker than your standard AK's as well, which if you're trigger happy, means it won't heat up as fast. It came from Classic Firearms with the correct Yugo pistol grip, not the finger groove one you see anymore, so if you're a history nerd like I am, you can make yourself a rifle that looks like it was right out of Behind Enemy Lines. The stock folds under the rifle, but locks up nice and tight, with nary a wobble to be found. Very smooth action and trigger pull. 


With it comes everything it did from the factory, and the box and papers. I have three mags with it, two european steel mags and a tapco mag. 


Priced at 575.00, haven't shot it, I just decided I want to save my pennies for an Arsenal. Not willing to budge on that number too far. 


As for coming and getting the gun, I work all week until atleast 6pm. As such, I don't want to drive to mansfield after work. If you want it, please come to me."

This barrel would add beauty and give a choice of chokes to an older Remington Wing Master.

Did not know the ammo was corrosive first time out and learned the hard way.  Damage was not severe, but it was enough to pit a new barrel.

It still shoots accurately even with pitting.  Was able to reach out and nail 5 gallon propane tanks from 500 yards with ease last time to the range years ago.   Willing to let it go for $950 OBO.

Selling/trading as a lot.  Here are most of the items, will throw in anything else I come across that I no longer have need of.

*1 can of Sterno stove fuel, and a pack of solid stove tabs
*Blizzard survival blanket
*1 pair of Ballistic Goggles.  Clear and dark lenses.  Have substantial wear, and lenses have some scratches, but you can still see out of them just fine, and they offer ballistic protection.
*2x 2-qt collapsible canteens
*Military-issue strap cutter w/ case and spare blade
*4x chemical lights, red and orange
*Military flashlight w/ multi-colored lenses
*A couple small sewing kits
*4 packets of water purification powder.  Each packet treats 2.5 gallons.
*Really comfortable Camelback kidney pad, that will fit most full-sized packs with minor modification
*Random ACU-pattern shoulder strap
*Partial roll of yellow caution tape; good for tying stuff, because it cuts easy, holds up very well, and is really tough to break through
*Pair of cheap binos w/ case.  They work, but the eye-pieces need glued back in

Would take $30.00 for the lot.  Price is based on the goggles, canteens, and blanket.  The goggles were around $90.00 new, and the blanket is fairly pricey...not one of the $0.75 ""survival blankets"" you find on amazon.

Note: Items included are listed in description, unless I find a few more things to throw in, and forget to add to the list.  DO NOT GO OFF OF THE PICTURE, as a couple items got pulled (a camp stove, and 2x Combat Shirts).  If you need stuff shipped, you pay shipping.  Might not be able to mail the camp stove fuel, though; I'll ask USPS."
