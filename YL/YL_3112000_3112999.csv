The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever(installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry"

Countless law enforcement units swear by the G21SF pistol, and that's why this powerful, lightweight, all climate workhorse is standard issue from the North to South Poles.

The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately. The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

The wood is in excellent condition except for one dent from where I accidentally set it down on a spent casing. I polyurethaned the wood when I got it. I put 3 coats on it. 

The Zastava M70's are built like tanks. The build quality on this AK is excellent with tight fits where it counts. It has very very little mag wobble.

This is a really neat package- and easy! With two barrels, you can cover all your bases-- hunting, sport and home defense. One shotgun, two barrels. With a simple twist of the front cap, you can change out barrels. Pull the shotgun out of the closet for a Saturday dove hunt- just drop in the long barrel. When you get home, change the barrel and load it up with some home protection rounds and you''re prepared for any situation that may endanger your family

Since 1919, O.F. Mossberg & Sons has produced weapons that all levels of gun users – including novices – continue to operate today. In fact, Mossberg was the first long-gun manufacturer in the U.S. to achieve ISO 9001 certification, which sets the standard on manufacturing and quality control procedures. The Mossberg 500, which was first produced in 1961, continues to be one of its most popular shotguns for sale on the market, and it’s currently used by the United States and allied armed forces, as well as by police and civilian gun owners. The Mossberg 500 also makes for an excellent field weapon, and is often used as a trap and skeet gun.

I bought it to do a review on it, and it far exceeded my expectations. While it is a straight blow-back pistol, it reliably fires any factory ammo I've fed it without issue. With factory reloads it can be a bit picky, but that's to be expected. In terms of features, it has a classic HK-style lower and rear drum sight. The front sight is a hybrid AR15/HK sight that uses standard an AR sight post, so you can drop in aftermarket night sights if you want. Overall, I rate it a solid 8 out of 10. The review hasn't been published yet, but it will be soon. Included with the pistol is one 32rd mag, and the original box/paperwork/gun lock. $600"

It's functional, but could use a little work, the blueing is very faded and is stripped off on the mag tube and on the bottom of the receiver. There is some pitting on the left side of the barrel, and some light rust spots on the receiver sides.
It fires and cycles fine but the action sticks when it isn't loaded and I pump the slide.
I have no idea what is causing this but any gunsmith ought to be able to figure it out.
It's a full choke and the barrel has been shortened to 24 inches from its original 28.
Otherwise it's pretty solid, the stocks are in good shape, the bore is clean and the internals aren't rusted.
This would be a pretty easy restoration project.

I made a different stock for it. It's lighter and takes up less space, and has 50ft of para chord wrapped on it. I know the original stock is waterproof and floats. But if your backpack falls in the water, the stock won't float if it's in the pack. So what's the point. Might as well make it smaller and lighter as far as I'm concerned. Plus this way you can pack it with the scope attached. 

The extra stock and the scope are included. I'm asking $350, but if you are local, I might be able to do better on the price since I don't have to ship it. And I will only transfer this legally. If you are in NY, we have to do a NICS, If you are out of state, we'll follow your states rules."

 Designed for discreet concealment, the LC9 can serve either as a primary citizen-carry tool or a full-power backup for off-duty law enforcement officers. In most respects it is simply a slightly larger single-column twin to the .380 LCP. It’s larger because it has to be, both because the 9mm cartridge is slightly longer than the .380 Auto and requires a deeper grip frame and action cycle and because the 9mm’s increased recoil requires more grasping surface (and weight) for controllability.  The somewhat larger LC9 goes naturally into my hand and is a true grab-and-shoot gun. In size it comes about midway between the LCP and the midsize double-column Ruger SR9 Compact (but it’s closer to the LCP).

The LC9 has a 3.1-inch barrel and is only six inches long and 41/2 inches tall, making for a very compact 9mm. With a width of a mere .90 inch, it’s one of the slimmest-profile 9mms on the market. It weighs only 17.1 ounces with an empty magazine.

The glass-filled nylon black polymer grip frame with blued alloy-steel slide and barrel utilizes an aluminum locking block insert. Each gun comes with one seven-round, single-column magazine with a standard flat floorplate for maximum concealability.

I was robbed last year coming out of a walgreens and decided to take shooting lessons and purchase a weapon. I completed my CPL training and waiting on Macomb country to issue my CPL. I am looking to trade for this hand gun. I sell and fix computers for a living from my own home. I have new and used laptops. Ranging from $100 to $2000. I had the oppurtunity to shoot many different model hand guns. I like a full steel hand gun because I will not be carrying on my waistband. So the weight is really not an issue for me. My ideal weapon of choice would be a CZ-75B. However, any good reliable hand gun will work for me. I plan on going to the range and practicing so I'd like to get a compact or full size hand gun. i hope some out there can help me. thanks"

Barrel is chrome lined Israeli dated 1970. Wood furniture is new. Manganese phosphate parkerizing. Recever was engraved with the IDF crest and other manufacturer marking to mimic an original. Does not appear to have been fired much since it was built. I estimate this rifle was built in 2008. This rifle was part of Pat Jones personal collection and was the first to feature the Israeli engraving he offered.  I believe this rifle to be almost unfired since it was built. There is no brass in the action from rounds feeding, no copper on the feed ramps, no carbon on the bolt face. There is no carbon around the gas plug or gas block. No carbon on the flashider, and no brass kisses on the side of the receiver or on the ejector. This rifle has a good Entreprise receiver, with NO evidence of porous casting or any other flaws. It was custom serialized at Entreprise, so the upper and lower SNs match. This rifle also comes with 3 Hebrew marked magazines.  I will ship IN OHIO ONLY on this rifle, as there is no law prohibiting me from transferring a firearm to someone in state by mail.  Outside of Ohio it must go to an FFL.  Shipping is $50 on this item.  Go here to view the photobucket album on this rifle.  http://s260.photobucket.com/user/adam762/library/Pats%20personal%20collection/Izzy%20HB?sort=3&page=1"

From Ruger with the following: wooden laminate stock with ambidexterous thumbhole, heavy 22"" barrel with harmonic tuner. You can adjust the rifle to shoot better groups with whatever choice of ammo you use. Great videos on Youtube about this being done and how accurate this gun is.  

Also has three interchangeable butt-plates for LOP adjustment, and stainless scope rings from Ruger. Chrome lined barrel and I'm pretty sure its 1:9 twist. Barely used and it shows it.  Scope is a decent $149.99 Bushnell Trophy and included in price.  Also have a box of shells for it.  Note, this mini, according to Ruger only is supposed to use .223 rounds.  I've read about people using NATO rounds, but Ruger says not to on their website and in the manual. Again, this gun takes .223 even though the only choice below is 223/5.56 NATO. I have a box of shells that is included.

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."
