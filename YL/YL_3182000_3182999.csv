Mag as it has become more of an ornament lately than a rifle. I've hunted deer and pigs with this but have purchased other rifles that have taken it's place. The gun is very beautiful. Maybe 4 boxes have passed through this since I had it in Alaska. I've hunted everything with this rifle and it has been superior. The scope and gun have been well taken care of and the added muzzle brake makes it look even more sweet. The rifle and scope combined was around $1400 brand new. Make me an offer as I am open to discussing price but will not accept cheap offers. This gun will do you well in any hunting situation and any weather.

It is no longer in production, so they are harder to find, but it is a well-crafted, well-balanced weapon. Many models were sold during production, but they are fast disappearing into collector's hands. Currently, and even though this weapon is in perfect working order, parts are still plentiful, and inexpensive. Speaking of which, the mechanical parts are in excellent working condition, the nylon crosshatch grips are in good shape, and there is virtually no wear to be found at all. In its entire life, this weapon has only had, perhaps, less than 200 rounds through it at the target range. It is a collector's item, and it has remained that way. Other than very regular cleanings, this weapon remains in its protective case for the most part. There are also two magazines that are in excellent working condition, one being an 8-round clip, and the other being a 9-round clip that I am offering for free with this weapon.

Great rifles, but I never shoot it as much as my other ARs

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.
Optics - on top is a Vortex Viper HS 2.5-10x44 with the Dead Hold BDC reticle & 30mm tube. This scope has an unconditional lifetime warranty that is transferable, and not limited to the original owner. It is sighted in dead on at 200yds. It comes with a screw on sunshade (not shown in picture), and I still have the original box it came in. The scope is mounted in Warne all steel 30mm rings. Warne makes all of their rings in the USA.

Price: $1450 Or make an offer

___________________________________________________

Bottom Rifle: This rifle is a great optics ready carbine. The upper is a Bushmaster factory upper with 16"" chrome lined barrel and lightweight profile. It has a fixed mil-spec front sight on it, and I swapped the furniture out for some Magpul furniture and vertical pistol grip. I have a Diamond rear sight that is on at 100yds. The lower is a DPMS lower with mil-spec trigger and some more Magpul furniture including pistol grip with storage, enhanced trigger guard for shooting with gloves, and lightweight 6 position buttstock.

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.
The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips.

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail."

This is the earlier version of the soft case with the smaller clear plastic manual pocket. The later version of these particular cases are identical, except having a larger plastic manual pocket. This change was made to accommodate the newer user manuals that were and still remain larger in size. This is the first and one of the rarer colors produced out of the five Eagle cases made for HK. Around 2004-2005 HK stopped selling the USP in soft cases and started sending them in the cheap plastic clam shell design witch still resides today. Finding them in any condition is quit a challenge. A must have for die hard USP owners and HK collectors.

This was at a shooting range. I love this and would 100% love to keep it. It was kind of a splurge buy. I already have another I use for protection so there's no need to have multiple at this time. I have had this less than a year. Have original box, manual, the keys, warranty card. Etc. everything will be shown in pictures. This has 5 rounds. When I bought if there was an all black one, exact same model but I chose to go with the stainless steel because it looks so nice. The look is a lot better. This is a strong guy. I was shocked with how much power this actually has... Very, very powerful. More powerful than models a lot larger than I've fired. Anyway brand new this is going for 600.00+ tax so I feel the value is still very high. Can include a box of ammunition never used. You will be receiving a great firearm, great in size, quality and great looking! Thanks for reading. Below is some extra information on the model. Will accept offers but not going to much lower than the posting price.

Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
