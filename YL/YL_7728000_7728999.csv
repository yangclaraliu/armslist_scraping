Just installed a new set of HI-VIZ handgun sights. This Glock is listed as used although it has only been fired a few times. Included is the factory box and all paperwork. Here is an article that does an excellent job of explaining the 17L's details. GLOCK 17L REVIEW The GLOCK 17L (and the GLOCK 24 in .40) were the original competition long-slide pistols by GLOCK. However, they were later replaced by the GLOCK 34 (9x19mm) and GLOCK 35 (.40) in order to comply with competition size limits (such as with IDPA). The GLOCK 17L and 24 are still in limited production, however. The long-slide Glocks have a slide length of 8.85 inches and a barrel length of 6.02 inches. The ""Tactical/Practical"" models (the 34 and 35) have an 8.15-inch slide (a difference of 0.7 inches) and 5.32-inch barrel (also a difference of 0.7 inches). While the difference may not seem extreme, inches count quite a bit in handguns (remember the difference between a GLOCK 17 and 26 slide is only 1.03 inches, and there's only a 0.47-inch difference between a 17 and 19). So there's definitely a noticeably larger slide, barrel, and sight radius with the long-slide models. The frames, however, are the same (the GLOCK 17, 17L, 22, 24, 34, and 35 all share the same size frame). Also, just as the slide for the 34 and 35 have been cut some to reduce the weight of the slide (to allow for better reliability), the same has been done for the 17L and 24 to a larger extent. Another note: the GLOCK 34 and 35 have never received compensated models. The GLOCK 17L Gen1 models (which there are very few of) were compensated; the GLOCK 24, however, is offered in both non-compensated and compensated (24C) models. G17L Specifications: Slide Length: 8.85” Height w/Magazine: 5.43” Width: 1.18” Sight Radius: 8.07” Barrel Length: 6.02” (versus 4.49” for the G17 and 5.32” for the G34) Weight (empty, but with magazine in place): 26.38” Trigger-pull: 4.5-lbs.

I purchased this ammunition new from Palmetto State Armory, back in 2014.  I have been the sole owner of it since then.   It has spent the overwhelming majority of its time, since I owned it, in sealed containers, or at a minimum, in climate controlled environment.   It has not been chambered in firearms, loaded into magazines, carried around in backpacks in the rain or snow or any other such shenanigans.
What I have remaining for sale is 1,020 rounds (51 boxes of 20)Price is $1 per round.  Minimum purchase of 40 rounds if we meet in person.  Minimum purchase of 80 rounds if I ship this ammunition.The corrugated cardboard boxes, sized perfectly to hold 10 boxes of 20 rounds of FGMM measure 6.5 x 6.5 x 7.25 inches, external dimensions, and weigh 13 pounds.  3 packages like this already prepared are 39 pounds total.
A plastic-wrapped bundle of 4 boxes of 20 rounds of FGMM weighs 5 pounds, 1.1 ounces, before being packaged in cardboard.   So all 9 bundles of 4 boxes each weigh in at 45 pounds, 9.9 ounces, before being packed in cardboard for shipping. 
So just in this picture of all that's available there's 84 pounds, 9.9 ounces of product.    
If we meet for exchange, I'll accept cash ONLY for payment.
If I ship it, I can do USPS money order, or Square Cash (""the Cash App"" I've heard it called).   I am working on getting Paypal up and running.  With USPS money order, I need to have received the money order slip in hand, AND turned it into real cash money before I ship to a total stranger.  Sorry that it's extra time delay and hassle.
For rifle ammunition, buyer needs to be 18 years of age and I want to see some form of government-issued ID with a photo and a date of birth (driver's license, passport, passport card, concealed carry permit from a state that actually makes it like an ID card all come to mind); only so I can do my due-diligence to ensure I'm not selling pistol ammunition to someone below age 21, or any ammunition to a minor.  I want to match the picture of your face to your face (if we are meeting in person and its not just an email conversation and then I ship it to you), and see a birth date.  You are more than welcome to tape over any and all other personal information.  I don't need, or want, to know your address.
I will not ship ammunition to PO Boxes, nor via USPS.  I will not ship ammunition to California, Connecticut, Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, or Washington D.C.
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order."

The P229 in DA/SA include a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. designed P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most."

I will ship through my FFL. Fees are $40 + actual shipping costs.
These firearms I have for sale are from the estate of my father Jerry, who recently passed away. He was a lifelong gun owner, reloader, and champion target marksman, dating back to the 1950s. As agreed between my father and I, 100% of the proceeds of these sales will be used to send my son to a university one day. Thank-you for your consideration!"

Hammer fired, Double-Single action trigger, the Beretta has an ambidextrous safety with automatic decocking and an ambidextrous slide catch. Previous owner installed an extended mag release.This gun is a true pleasure to shoot, hardly any recoil and easy to hold on target. Because of the recoil characteristics, it's easy to hold tight groupings even at ranges beyond 25 yards despite the fact that the barrel is only 3.2 inches long. You will find a natural adjustment to the travel in the trigger pull that will bring out double-taps and rapid fire sequences with intuitive reflex. Everyone who's carried this pistol knows why it surpasses the Glock 19 on just about every basis for CCW. I'm also including 57 rounds of Hollowpoint for good measure. I'll even throw in my Sticky IWB holster if you want it. Don't miss this Beretta. You'll need an Ohio ID to make the purchase."
