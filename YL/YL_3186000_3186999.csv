First $750 cash, picked up in Hartford (early morning or evening), or can meet in Sussex. Send me an email and I'll respond promptly. Full or partial handgun trade considered.

Up for sale is my Gen 4 Glock 19. I am the original owner. Purchased in 10/2013. It has always been treated like a baby, always clean and lubed properly and 100% reliable just as a Glock should be. I just don't take her out and shoot her anymore like I should and she deserves better. I added a G17 to my collection and seem to always end up taking the G26 or G17 to the range. This Gen 4 Glock 19 has Talon Rubber Grips that were installed less than a month ago and can they easily be removed. Also has upgraded sights. Front is Glock OEM night sight and rear is Glock OEM steel factory sight. The internals of this gun are stock from the factory. I did polish the slide stop to try and give the gun a little character but this is only cosmetic. All original paperwork, Box, (3) 15 round Mags, Lock, Mag Loader and back straps included. Also can include an Inside the Waistband Hybrid leather/kydex holster if wanted. $500 No trades for long guns. Prefer cash sale but may consider smaller pistols + cash for the right deal.

This gun is new in box and will come with everything that it ships from the factory with. Below are some specs from the DD website-
The new Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, V9  Strength to Weight was designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications.  The DDM4v9 S2W is equipped with an 18” S2W profile Cold Hammer Forged barrel, covered by the DDM4 Rail™ 15.0, gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing overtravel when swinging between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick but precise rapid fire.  The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

Has wood grips in flawless condition.  Blueing is in excellent condition (90-95%)with no real wear and not a spec of rust or pitting anywhere.  Bore is fully intact.  I have fired under 100 rounds through it and it sat on a shelf for years and years before i got it.  Serial number is N28XXX, which puts it being made in 1970-71.  
The gun is pinned and recessed and sports a 4"" barrel.  DA/SA hammer with hammer firing pin. 
I have 100+ rounds of FMJ wadcutter target rounds, a plastic gun case and a speedloader to go with it. 

I primarily want to trade.  If i sell it, i would need enough to fund a base AR build, around 5-600.   I absolutely love this gun, but find myself shooting rifles far more often, so I want to trade for an AR or an AK.  Open to other rifle trades as well.  I do not want to trade this + $500 for your sporterized whatever.  I would prefer a straight trade for something basic, but can throw in minimal cash (or other ammo, i have many calibers) if the trade is right. There are several model 28-2's on gunbroker and similar sites in way worse condition than mine going for $500-700 so that can be something you base the value of our trade on.  

I have another pistol (berretta bobcat 21A .25ACP) i am selling, which i know if a shot in the dark, but if you are looking for something massive (revolver) and something tiny (bobcat), then maybe we can work out a deal.
I also do not want crappy branded guns. 
I do not need to get rid of this, and will just keep the revolver if i cannot find a trade so no ridiculous offers please

With all that said, send me info and pics of what you have!"

I am selling my used WASR 10/63 only because I am in need of funds so sorry not interested in trades right now.    

This rifle has served me very well in my training and in introducing new people to “scary” looking firearms.  She has had under 2000 rounds so she is just broken in.   I have had no problems with her and with irons she has  printed 3-4moa with everything I have tried and 2-3 with match.  This is not the mythical 1 MOA ak that others are trying to sell on here nor is it the 12 moa I have seen, this is just a bit better than average mostly because of the crown and trigger.  Before I had the work done to it the best I got was 5 moa with wolf and after I recowned it and had the trigger worked on it was 3 moa.  3 moa means head shots at 200 yards and body shots at 500 yards so acceptable for the cartridge.   Matching serial numbers minus the safety.  Comes with 180 rounds of Yugo M67(corrosive but awesome), 7 European steel 30rd mags and 1 75 rd Romanian drum and original accessories, cleaning kit, bayonet, original furniture.    I have not used the drum at full capacity but downloaded it only hiccupped once in a while.   

It has the following upgrades
Tuned tapco G2 trigger, two stage not to light not to heavy, crisp break at second stage
Hammer and trigger pin retention plate
Wolf extra power recoil spring
ACE adjustable stock with hinge and adapter block so the tang is still intact
Re-crowned the chrome lined barrel
UTG quad rail
Adjusted safety for ease of use
Refinished original furniture.

My wife really wanted this gun, so I bought it for her a few weeks ago. After putting only a couple hundred rounds through it she's decided she wants a striker fire instead of a DA/SA. Lesson learned on that one. It's a sweet gun because it has Sig's newer Short Reset Trigger in it. The reset is incredibly short at 1/10 of an inch. And the trigger pull is really smooth. I'm a striker fire guy, but would love to keep this gun. Being that my wife will be wanting another gun, we can't keep them all right now and stay within our budget. The stock Double Action is rated at 10 lbs but we had a gunsmith put an 8 lb spring in it. We still have the 10 lb spring to go with the gun. Also, there is a minor blemish on the handle from a ring my wife was wearing as shown in the pics. This comes with original Sig night sights, two 15 round mags and the original box.

These classics were made between 1946-1955 and are collectors. This gun has feeding issues and I am pretty sure it just needs a new magazine. I am not positive that is the issue but wanted to be upfront. It will fire a few rounds without a problem but then it won't feed. I picked the gun up in a trade and haven't shot it very much. I know you can buy aftermarket magazines for around $50. The gun is in great shape cosmetically and I would rate it between 90-95 percent. It is in really good shape for a gun made 60 plus years ago. There is no pitting or rusting of any kind. The gun comes with one magazine and a nice holster. I am asking $460 OBO due to the feeding issues. I know these guns are climbing in value and going for $700 plus on Gunbroker. I maybe interested in trades for other semi auto handguns or revolvers. I am located in Lewisville.

In 1871, Colt employee Charles Richards was awarded a patent for converting Colt percussion models to breech loading cartridge revolvers. The Richards cartridge conversion was an instant success. On July 2, 1872, William Mason, another Colt employee, was awarded a patent for an improvement to the Richards model. Conversion models remained popular with cowboys (many originals will be found with imprints of fence staples on the butt) even after the introduction of the 1873 Colt®. This was due to the low cost of conversion models.

The LG-452 takes the brilliant low-light sighting capabilities of red laser sights to a new level.  The human eye detects green more than any other color and Crimson Trace builds the brightest green laser available, making the LG-452 a versatile laser sighting system for all lighting conditions.

Providing over two hours of run time on a single (1) CR2 lithium battery, the green laser sight market has never seen such incredible battery life.  Additionally, the LG-452 Laserguard platform is the most lightweight and compact green laser sight available for GLOCK pistols.  The Laserguard is quickly and easily user-installed in minutes with zero alterations to the firearm.

In addition to the vibrant green laser, superb battery life, lightweight and compact engineering, the LG-452 features windage and elevation adjustments (with provided wrenches), and a Master On/Off switch which allows the shooter to completely power down the unit.

As with all Crimson Trace Laserguard models, the LG-452 features patented Instinctive Activation™ - a Crimson Trace exclusive.  Instinctive Activation allows the operator to activate the laser by simply holding the firearm with a normal shooting grip.  No one else can claim that.  No one else builds them close.

I am selling these guns together as a single lot for $800. I would alternatively sell everything but the M1895 revolver for $650.

The Breakdown:

(Top)

All matching 1938 Tula Arsenal M91/30 Mosin Nagant imported by CAI, unfired, still in the cosmoline. This gun was specially hand picked out of a lot and is of above average fit and finish. Includes bayonet, sling, mag pouches, cleaning and tool kit and two packages of collectible 7.62 x 54R wrapped in paper and twine (warning, corrosive!).

(Middle) 

Pre-ban 1979 dated Chinese Type 56 Simonov Carbine (SKS), marked as being made at factory 366. Not a Russian SKS, but this particular gun is actually made better. It was made to the same specs as the Chinese Security Forces guns intended for the state run private police force. As such, it is one of the highest quality and finest SKS variants ever made. It was imported by Keng's Firearm Specialties before importation of Chinese arms was banned. Keng's imported mostly Chinese Security Forces guns but this one isn't marked with the Security Forces mark which is odd. What I do know is that it is NOT a Norinco. Who knows what group sold it to Keng's or if it was officially sanctioned by the Chinese Goverment or sold to the US market out the back door. One never knows with the Chicoms. It was imported at a time when it was still a practically brand new gun. The gun is all matching except for the 10 round fixed magazine. Importer information is discreetly and professionally engraved (as opposed to crudely electropenciled) under the barrel below the gas tube and is hidden by the cleaning rod and bayonet so you don't see it unless you know where to look, (unlike most other SKS carbines). Includes sling, spike-type bayonet, mag pouches, 30 round detachable mag, 100 rounds of 7.62 x 39 on 10 round stripper clips, a spare 20 round box 7.62 x 39 and cleaning kit (stored inside stock).

Like this: http://www.troupsystems.com/akpics/vepr1.jpg  but I decided to focus  on ARs for now.

 First up is my American Classic Commander. This gun came out of the box as one of my favorite 1911s. No it's no kimber but but it's every bit as tight and accurate as it's high dollar counter parts. It came factory with almost all the bells and whistles and I filled in the blanks after that. Please take a moment to do a google search and see all the features this pistol comes with straight from the factory. On top of that I have hand polished all the internals not with a dremmel but hand polished all the internals to no more than -.040 off the factory original finish for a smooth as glass trigger and nearly no felt guide rod spring travel, as well as a smooth return for the follow up that the highest priced 1911 will be envious of. I finished the exterior of this sturdy pistol with Brownells Teflon/Molly Gunkote for a long lasting lube free corrosion proof finish that will last well past your grandchildren and all they can throw at it.  And I didn't stop there. This classic hand cannon sports Houge grip panels and a Pearce wrap around grip for the best possible positive grip on a 1911 you can get while maintaining the classic look that should accompany a 1911. Also installed is the hand polished Ed Brown two piece guide rod for a guaranteed no bind spring carrier as well as some added muzzle weight to help with those split second follow up shots whether it be on the competition range or that shady spot you thought you would never be in. This gun handles like a dream and hits like a nightmare.  And looks pretty cool either way (I'd hate for my adversary to die looking down the barrel of a thug wheeling a glock, everyone has to die, might as well give them the class they didn't afford you) .   I can also include some quality brass cased re loadable ammo for average store shelf price, I'm by no means dieing to let go of my ammo, in most cases I'll have to die to give up my ammo, but theres something out there I really want to feel the recoil from. It,the 1911, will come in the factory case with one magazine and the factory guide rod and spring retainer. And just in case you couldn't tell by the pictures this isn't some cobbled up shade tree job with painted sites and a home cut barrel. This has been hand crafted by a pro not some shade tree so low ballers will be ignored.

 Next up is my used off the shelf Taurus Circuit Judge. Like I said it's a used off the shelf gun nothing all that special, but a ton of fun to shoot. These aren't available with a ""Taurus"" stamp any longer but thats about all that sets it apart from the rest on the firing line. Maybe in twenty years that might mean something but for now I enjoy shooting it so as mentioned earlier I'm not looking to give it away. If we can make terms it will include both choke tubes it came with as well as the optic rail and lock key."

I have been told that this rifle is an interwar British, German, or Belgian rework of a military action. No matter the origins, it is well done. Bluing strog throughout. Only rust present is under the barrel sling swivel. I don't believe it's the barrel itself, rather the solder from the swivel. Either way, it's negligible. The stock it is wearing has a very comfortable cheek piece that allows a strong cheek weld for the fixed iron sights. It shows signs of honest use, but not abuse (scratches in varnish). I will also include an extra wood stock. It is a converted military model, complete with a schnabel forend, pancake cheek piece, and plugged bolt take down hole.

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.
Optics - on top is a Vortex Viper HS 2.5-10x44 with the Dead Hold BDC reticle & 30mm tube. This scope has an unconditional lifetime warranty that is transferable, and not limited to the original owner. It is sighted in dead on at 200yds. It comes with a screw on sunshade (not shown in picture), and I still have the original box it came in. The scope is mounted in Warne all steel 30mm rings. Warne makes all of their rings in the USA.

Bottom Rifle: This rifle is a great optics ready carbine. The upper is a Bushmaster factory upper with 16"" chrome lined barrel and lightweight profile.

-Single shot, 22"" barrel, 37"" overall length
-.45-70- Great big game cartridge with loads of power!
-Scope mount and hammer spur included!
-Versatility- interchangeable barrels and stocks available from H&R- Convertible to other calibers, plus  muzzleloader or shotgun!
-Compact- great for easy carry through thick Western WA brush/forest!
Selling my H&R .45-70 single shot!  I've had the gun for about 5 years, and have fired around 60-75 rounds out of it.  All ammo put through it has been quality new production (no handloads or black powder).  I bought the gun for deer/elk/bear hunting, but have since switched to archery.  I've cared for it very well, ensuring the barrel was cleaned after each shooting session, making use of a bore cleaning guide to prevent erosion of the chamber throat and the muzzle crown from the cleaning rod.  This gun has Williams adjustable open sights, with a post in front (painted orange by me with fishing jig paint-easily removable) and notch in rear.  The notch can be removed and replaced with a ghost ring/peep assembly to suit the user (NOT included- can be found at Brownell's or Midway USA).  H&R scope mount and hammer extension are included.  This gun is accurate and easy to shoot, and with a scope, becomes even more so! Common commercial loadings range from 300-400 grain bullets, with specialty loads available from 250 to 600 grains!  If you handload, the possibilities expand even further!  If you are looking for a cost-effective and versatile ""brush gun"" for hogs, deer, elk, and bear out to 150 yards (or longer, depending on shooter, optics, load chosen, and conditions of course!) this H&R .45-70 is the ticket!  Additionally, through H&R's Barrel Accessory Program one can purchase rifle, muzzle loader, and shotgun barrels to increase the versatility of the rifle!  Barrels are offered in almost all common calibers from .22 Hornet to .30-06 to 500 S&W, as well as most common shotgun gauges!  Interchangeable stock sets are also available to change comb height, length of pull, or stock material (laminate, hardwood, or synthetic)!  In all, a great, accurate rifle for the hunter who wants performance that is easy on the wallet! Thank you for taking the time to look!

Comes with Magpul furniture, Primary Weapons Systems flash suppressing compensator, Daniel Defense rear sight aperture and Magpul B.A.D lever. This is the perfect fix of all the AR's short falls- the lack of knockdown power with the standard 5.56 or .223, the reliability issues with the standard gas impingment design. So you get the best of both worlds, rugged AK like reliability and 7.62 like knockdown power with AR adaptability and world renowned accuracy. Oh and the undiniable sexiness of the black gun. Only shot two mag loads and she is dead on the money every shot. Text for faster response at REDACTED thank you.

•	Lightest most durable composite polymer lower on the market today
•	Low maintenance / easy cleaning / scratch resistant
•	Accepts all standard MIL SPEC uppers and lower parts
•	Features the accu-group composite fire control system with 4.5lb trigger pull
•	Can accommodate any brand MIL SPEC LPK upgrade

mill spec. buffer tube, buffer, buffer spring, and six position M4 style stock
*NOTE:  Some .22LR, 9mm and other blowback style uppers use a groove in their BCG that is too narrow for the polymer hammer of the LW-15.  In these cases you will need to switch to a blowback style hammer also available in this product category.  The blowback style hammer, once installed, will run all rimfire and pistol uppers, and still work fine with standard mil-spec rifle uppers.

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.
The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional. LNIB with all factory papers, test casing, bushing wrench etc. serious inquiries only, no trades.
