The scope and rings ran me a little over $400. So I'm saving you some cash here as they've only seen about 30-40 rounds. It's a really nice setup, no it's not a Leupold but I do like it over the vortex scopes I had on this gun in the past. Serious inquiries only, this gun is in great shape and I expect the other party's gun to be the same. I have two mags with mine, a Harris 6-9 bipod and a higher end cabelas caliber specific magnitude series 6-18x42 scope on Burris rings. Tac driver? Check. Now, where are those FN SCARS?"

It does have some holster wear but nothing terrible. Very clean otherwise and shoots great but I doesn't fit my body very good which is a bummer cuz I love how the gun shoots. It has 3 mags and the case, papers, and I can throw in a little ammo if needed. I only want to deal with CCW holders. Looking for a Glock 26, I will consider a Glock 43 or a shield but I would need some cash yet if it's the 43 or shield(for sure the shield). Only other trades I'd consider is a new bow preferrably the Matthews halon or a Hoyt or a Kimber micro 9. I also have a AR-15 223/5.56 that I will sell only. Pics upon request. Would really like to sell outright on the Glock but like I said trades are an option. Quicker response if you txt REDACTED."

Using special colorants added to the frame during the molding process, the new VP9 (9 mm) and VP40 (.40 S&W) OD Green models have all of the highly regarded VP features. The frame’s vibrant color is indestructible and permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change. In development for more than four years, the VP series debuted in 2014 and is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP line, but the VP series breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “precise pull”trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker-fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels—accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK’s patented charging supports—simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating VP pistols easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols use the proven P30 steel magazine (15-round for 9 mm, 13-round for .40 S&W; and 10-round capacity were required by law). The VP series has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel —made from canon grade steel —ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment (black) finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP series are a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And the VP is remarkably value priced."

Using special colorants added to the frame during the molding process, the new VP9 (9 mm) and VP40 (.40 S&W) OD Green models have all of the highly regarded VP features. The frame’s vibrant color is indestructible and permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change. In development for more than four years, the VP series debuted in 2014 and is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP line, but the VP series breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “precise pull”trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker-fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels—accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK’s patented charging supports—simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating VP pistols easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols use the proven P30 steel magazine (15-round for 9 mm, 13-round for .40 S&W; and 10-round capacity were required by law). The VP series has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel —made from canon grade steel —ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment (black) finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP series are a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And the VP is remarkably value priced. Heckler & Koch VP9 OD Green M700009GR-A5"

In USPSA Production Division, CZ pistols are now used by twice as many top-level competitors than any other maker. Given that popularity, it was high time to up the ante. Starting from scratch, CZUB engineers took the best features of the original Shadow and improved upon them. More than two years later, we’re seeing the fruits of their efforts. With a higher beavertail and undercut trigger guard, the shooter’s hand is able to be as close to the bore axis as possible. With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. Increased weight at the dust cover/rail also helps keep the muzzle down. The Shadow 2’s swappable mag release has an adjustable, extended button with three settings to allow shooters to set it in the spot most comfortable for them. Best of all, new trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset. A hardy nitride finish coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion. Thin blue aluminum grips have healthy checkering to match the fine front and backstrap checkering of the pistol itself. Sitting atop the slide are a set of target sights — fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage).

The business has been in Fircrest, WA since the early 1970’s and is known largely for its fast, caring, and personal service. This enterprise, which started as a part-time hobby, has grown over the years into a small business that consists of the sale of selected quality firearms purchased largely from estates, custom orders, firearm appraisals and, increasingly, the transfer of incoming firearms purchased by local clients on the Internet. Included in the sale are:* Paper and digital data bases of well over 500 clients, carefully assembled over a 45-year period, and located largely in the cities of Tacoma, Fircrest, and University Place. Included are names, addresses, contact information, and recent transactions.*  A digital data base of almost 8,000 transactions completed over the life of this hobby/business, mimicking the BATF-mandated Bound Book, and documenting the sale/purchase history of the firm's clients. * The referrals of my clients to you and your business as they contact me for services at my long-established phone number, email address, or website. *  Numerous crates of various used scopes, scope mounts, factory ammo, mags, ammo boxes. holsters, slings, tools, grips, shipping supplies, books, and miscellaneous gun-related accessories. Way too much to itemize. With a concerted effort on the buyer’s part, the asking price for this business, $20,000, could easily be recouped in the first year of operation.  All interested buyers will be asked to furnish written character references. I will not refer long-term or prospective clients to you unless I can be assured you’ll be running this (my) business in an ethical, legal, and professional manner. Other factors that I’ll be considering are the location where you would be setting up the business, your hours of availability to the general public, and how much you'll be charging for Internet transfers. My intent is to leave the business in good hands, thereby protecting my hard-earned reputation and the goodwill that I've established with my clients over these many years. Not included in the sale are the various business and firearm licenses and permits required to conduct a firearm business in a legal manner, nor the registered business name Yankee Trader, LLC.Please contact me for additional information; serious inquiries only, please.Thanks.Norm Dion253 five-six-five 2753"

Product Description
The criteria for the gun:
To achieve this, the gun was designed from its inception to be small, roughly 5.2 "" x 3.7""; to weigh a mere 13.5 oz; to be slim and smooth, devoid of any sharp edges or protrusions; and to have no external levers or controls to be manipulated. To get into action, one simply has to pull the trigger, which is a double-action only. The Rohrbaugh R9 is manufactured with space-age technology, using state-of-the-art CNC machining, which keeps tolerances to a minimum, thereby maintaining complete consistency in functioning. It is ergonomically designed to work seamlessly with the human body to point naturally and keeping the wrist and forearm in line. The design of the grip is also designed to push the recoil to the center of the palm, thereby reducing felt recoil.
State of the Art:
Rohrbaugh firearms are designed with the use of CAD/CAM programs. CNC machines perform the manufacturing. Then each gun is then hand fitted and assembled in our state of the art facility. The materials used are of the highest grade, including quality stainless steel, 7075 aircraft aluminum, G-10 grips and Wolff springs.
The R9 Steath is another version of the award-winning Rohrbaugh 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The R9 Stealth slides are coated with Titan Kote C12, which reduces friction, increases wear resistance and has anti-galling properties.
