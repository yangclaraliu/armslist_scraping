Trigger is also slightly undercut. Backstrap installed and stippled is new, the reason its still nice and shiny, and is a medium. It is the only backstrap included with the gun.Gun has very, very light holster wear, mostly on the controls and really none on the slide. Overall in really good condition for what it is.Included is the gun, 2 - 17 round mags, and all the other factory stuff except the small and large backstrap. A gently used Streamlight TLR-3 with a new battery $70. 3 holsters, a kydex IWB that I made myself (adjustable cant and retention), a Foxx hybrid leather/kydex IWB $40, and a Texas Concealment Systems kydex OWB $60. And as a consolidation prize, Ill throw in a used Bushnell Sportsman 3x9 scope for free if you want it, no box or rings, (it's just been sitting in the safe for like a year taking up space).  Total around $650 value not including scope.Basically giving this gun away, everything in the post included for $450. Trade value is Higher. Just looking for something different. Great gun for someone who cares more about function than form.

I bought it a couple of years ago for use as a small carry pistol, but I haven't used this as my carry weapon for a while, and I need to free up some space for other firearms. If you're unfamiliar with this pistol, Browning scaled down a full sized 1911 to approximately 80% and chambered it in .380 ACP, making it a perfect size for a small carry pistol or a handgun for someone who favors minimal recoil. This is one of the more feature-packed models and has factory tritium night sights, G10 grips, and an accessory rail on the frame for a weapon mounted light. Included with it is a Crossbreed Freedom Carry holster, a tuckable IWB hybrid holster, along with 2 magazines, the original case, and the various manuals originally included.       The pistol is in very good condition with the sole exception of under the trigger guard. When I originally bought the pistol, in a foolish decision, I decided to attempt to put an ""undercut"" in the trigger guard which is a common ""tactical"" frame modification to Glocks and the like. Fortunately, I stopped before I ruined anything, but there is a small depression on the bottom of the trigger guard. As you can tell from the profile pictures, it's invisible and unnoticeable until you turn the gun upside down. Also noticeable in the pictures, on the left side of the gun towards the bottom of the grip there is some slight discoloration. I honestly had never noticed it until I took the pictures here. Other than that, the pistol is in immpecable shape and has had approximately 200-300 rounds through it with zero issues.       This is a great little pistol if a little pistol is what you're looking for. All of the ergonomics and comfort of a venerable 1911 in a small, easy-to-use, and easy-to-conceal package. I'm sure I will regret selling it in a year or two. I hope you enjoy shooting it as much as I have.The usual disclaimer: Please inquire only if interested in purchasing this, no scams (as if that will stop anyone), and et cetera. I strongly prefer face-to-face transactions where we can say our hellos, conduct the transaction, exchange good old fashioned cash, shake hands, and part as friends. If you're interested, please feel free to ask me any questions you have or want to make an offer. Thank you for your time, and good shooting."

I bought this rifle sometime back in 2010, and I've enjoyed it immensely since then, but I need to free up some money for other things. This is DPMS' version of an AR, but upsized and chambered for .308, one of my favorite calibers. DPMS doesn't always have the best reputation, but this particular rifle has served me admirably and is a tack driver. With most loads, I see 1 MOA groups, but I had a lot of 220gr Hornady bullets (stupid heavy for .308, I know) that punched one ragged hole at a 100 yards. If you're looking for precision, this rifle has it.The rifle has been upgraded from its original configuration. The simplest upgrade is the addition of a thick recoil pad on the stock that does a fantastic job of turning the regular somewhat harsh recoil into a softer thump. The charging handle was replaced with a PRI Gasbuster, added a ERGO pistol grip, and I installed a free floating quad rail handguard along with a low profile gas block. You may also notice that I did a ""color fill"" on the lower receiver's engraving because I thought it looked neat.I'm unsure of how many rounds I've put through this rifle, but I would guess around 400. Being a .308 AR, this is a relatively heavy rifle, but the weight tames the recoil and a sling obviously helps too. The rifle is in great condition and has only minimal external wear. Included are 4 DPMS 20 round magazines.I've had a lot of fun with this rifle over the years, and I hope you do too.The usual disclaimer: Please inquire only if interested in purchasing this, no scams (as if that will stop anyone), and et cetera. I strongly prefer face-to-face transactions if at all possible, but I will consider shipping if necessary. If you're interested, please feel free to ask me any questions you have or want to make an offer. Thank you for your time, and good shooting."

As is typical for tactical friction folders, this rendition has a free-floating blade withoutlock. The blade tang is used to secure the blade with the clenching hand, but is also ground to a chisel shape for use as a scraper or lever. The grip consists of G-10 (front scale) and titanium (back scale and spacer) and provides a rock-solid feel. The hollow chisel grind gives the blade strength and effectiveness. The knife is not designed to be carried clipped to the pocket. The clip is strictly used for carrying, e.g. on equipment. 440C blade steel.  3 1/2″ closed. 2″ free floating 440C stainless blade.

It was going to be my first AR, as I was quite new in the game. Well, as I learned more and experienced even more, the vision of what I wanted changed. Too bad I had already purchased this extra fancy complete upper. Long story short, I can’t afford 300AAC BLACKOUT, and I don’t reload yet. The Daniel Defense MK18 300AAC complete upper features a 10.3 inch barrel, with a 1/8 twist, and pistol length gas system. The bolt carrier is melinited, the charging handle is standard, both the receiver and handguard are T-marked, and Daniel Defense’s enhanced flash hider does a great job. I have run a box of 100 rounds through this upper, with the only issue being the cost. For now, I will be sticking with 223/556, although I have been tempted to just replace the barrel with Daniel Defense’s 10.3” 556 barrel. If if you are looking to get a 300 BLACKOUT setup going, this is a premium, and highly sought after complete upper."

It has the Brass reciever and everything else you expect from a Henry. Just looking for something different but I also need the money right now. It's almost 1.5 years old right now, but it's been in my gun safe 98% of it's life. I bet it's had less than 100 rounds down range. Shoots very well at 200 Yds. Great Deer Rifle if used. I am a long distance shooter myself and with open sights it shoots very well. If you put a scope on it, it would be even better if you are into scopes.Either way there is nothing wrong with it. I am asking $625 OBO. I spent almost $850 on it through MC Sports when I first bought it (even if you go on Gunbroker these are still going for $750+). I don't need to sell it so please don't low ball me or waste my time with nonsense offers or comments. I really don't want to trade (I mean you can ask and all but I will not put any money towards it as an FYI). I may decide to trade but I would prefer cash.You can call or Text me at 419-890-690seven or just respond to this posting. Although text or calling will be faster."
