This is one of the cleanest I have picked up in a long time. Truly new. Still has the factory white grease on the slide. Comes in the original Sig hardcase with 2 7 round mags, papers, lock, etc.... Even the receipt. I’m asking $850. I’m also interested in trade offers as well. The best way to contact me is by text at REDACTED. My #1 interest is a Sig 229 w/ a rail in 9mm or a 220 Compact w/ rail in 9mm. If the value isn’t of equal or greater value please don’t ask unless your willing to add cash or others on top. Thanks. I have looked on all the trusted gun websites I use and the cheapest I have found the C3 is $879, so basically $950 or more after tax, plus shipping, FFL transfer fees and all that. Plus the wait. This gun is in identical condition as a gun you would receive new from any gun store."

Don't be confused by the humpback receiver profile, this isn't your grandpa's Auto-5. But the long sighting plane will give you the same sighting advantage the first Auto 5s were famous for. This time in a high-performance shotgun design that uses inertia to perfect autoloader reliability.Guaranteed. The Browning A5 is sure to become a classic in its own right, with a short-recoil operated action that is so reliable we back it with a 5 year/100,000 round guarantee — come hell or high water. The Kinematic Drive™. In its simplest term, kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The new Browning A5 makes better use of kinetic energy with its powerful, short recoil-operated Kinematic Drive System. Kinematic Drive harnesses recoil energy and converts it into the mechanical motion needed to operate the action. This concept is tried and true, and now perfected by the company that broke ground first with autoloading shotguns. The beauty of Kinematic Drive is the simplicity of design for consistent, reliable function with any load and under the full extremes of weather, temperature, moisture and grime. This gun is designed to work, come hell or high water. Operation is clean because gases are sent out the barrel and away from the action. There’s also extreme load versatility. The extensively tested Kinematic Drive offers reliable performance with virtually all loads down to 1-ounce field loads with no adjustments."

No better warning than the first “Rack” of the pump and certainly no better family safety weapon than a 12ga! These classic shotguns have been out of production for some time now and are becoming very collectable. I’m only selling this one because while helping out a friend I wound up with two. I’ll NOT be selling the other one…Prefer e-mail contact or Text REDACTED. Thanks for looking.

I will let you test fire it if serious buyer to prove how good the function of the rifle is. Here’s the build: The bolt & barrel are by Deadshot Barrels. Deadshot Barrels primarily make Barrels for Scar rifles ($325). They aren’t a cheap quality barrel. The forend is an ALG modular rail v3 free float handguard ($155). I’ve added a second m-lok QD Mount ($20). Has a custom built muzzlebrake by GLFA ($57). Upper Receiver is a KM Tactical with a .50 Beowulf oversized ejection port door ($100). (The Rifle was originally a .50 Beowulf, but I wasn’t satisfied with overall performance so i changed to the .450 Bushmaster). Nickel boron bolt carrier group ($100). Oversized BCM charging handle ($50). Lower receiver is a Ruger 556 lower with the Elite 4.5lbs trigger, magpul furniture ($275). This trigger is good for the money. Of course if you want a better trigger I will put one in it. Included will be Approx 48 rounds of Hornady 250 grain FTX ($75). Lancer L5 AWM mag and one ASC mag ($25). Low pro gas block w/ gas tube ($45). These prices are just retails prices to show overall price of rifle. $1227. TRADE: I’m looking for a 6.5 Creedmoor bolt action rifle. I will consider a .260 or a .308 bolt action like a Kimber Hunter, Remington BDL, Bergara, or Browning or any other lightweight bolt gun. i will also consider a handgun like a Glock with cash. I may consider a 12 gauge over/under or semi auto in wood. I will travel for the right deal. Don’t offer a $600 rifle as an even trade, please. Also if you have a Bergara 6.5 I will take a loss on my gun to trade but that’s the only one."

It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/11/17 to 12/15/17 in the store and what pistols we bring with us at the C&E Gun show this weekend 12/16/17 and 12/17/18. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we can't replace or can't replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesn't have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and don't forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior.

This really Cool Carbine Rifle is previously owned but still unfired and New in Box. It is the Beretta ARX-160 Tactical 22LR. The ARX-160 is a .22 LR tactical training rifle that looks, feels and handles like its full-size counterpart, the ARX-100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle. But aside from the caliber, this .22 LR carbine is virtually identical to the centerfire version as far as operations, controls, accessorization and customization options. The stock is collapsible, and folds onto the right side of the receiver, where it locks securely. One of the nicest aspects of the gun is its ambidexterity. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand and improve your skills for only the cost of 22LR ammo. The charging handle can easily be reversed, And the ejector can be relocated so it spits brass out the left side of the gun instead of the right. The safety is already ambidextrous, as is the magazine drop. Please do not bid if the firearm does not comply with your Local Gun Laws. Please feel free to email me with any questions."
