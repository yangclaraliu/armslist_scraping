And my bills were more than I'd expected so...

It has a cross-bar safety, a blued finish, the standard walnut stock, a hammer extension I see no need to remove, and a Micro-Groove barrel. (Wikipedia says ""in the mid-1990s, Marlin changed the .357 and .44 barrels from 12-groove-or-more 'Micro-Groove' rifling to 6-groove 'Ballard' style rifling."") The only things wrong with this gun are that the folding leaf rear sight is broken off, and now there are a couple ugly but not fatal scratches on/near the sight base from where I tried and failed to install a replacement (see second photo). I figured out how to avoid scratching it again but not how to get the flimsy little plastic thing on without breaking it; then again the forums tell me a lot of folks install a scope or buy yourselves niftier sights anyway, so instead of doing that again I'm just asking a bit less.

This is the missing piece: http://www.midwayusa.com/product/218149/marlin-rear-sight-folding-leaf-marlin-336-30-30-winchester-35-remington-1894-all-models-blue -- only $6.29 plus $3.99 S&H. (I still have the little elevator thing that goes with it and it ain't broke at all.) If I buy this doohickey it'll take a week to get here and I hope to sell the rifle by then, and anyway you could look around Midway for an even better sight. (A bullseye rear and ""fiber optic"" front combination should be awesome.)

I won't be taking checks, credit cards, first-born sons, suckling goats, etc., and you'll need to show me your valid KY driver's license or state ID, with a photocopy for my records; if you want I'll do the same. A CCDW would also help by establishing you're legally allowed to own a gun (but that's optional; I don't have one yet). And yes I'll consider a partial-value trade, but still there has to be enough cash involved."

""Almost"" BNIB, but BETTER it has been nicely upgraded. No quad-rails filled with flash lights, and other tactical gadgetry here. Just a nice simple shooter. Gun retails new for $869.99.

I have a M&P 15 Carbine in 5.56, 16"" barrel 1/8 5R twist. This specific rifle also has an M4 feed ramp which you wont find in other ""Money Saver"" A4 style AR rifles. Yet this is a true A4 upper.

MODS:
It has a Hogue grip, a Yankee Hill Front gas block with a flip up front sight so you dont have the A2 front sight post (when using optics), and a Matech rear Mil spec peep sight, plus 7 mags.

The barrels are impeccable, and the action/firing pins are in really, really good shape which leads me to think it isn't very heavily used despite it's age.

This Adams Arms AR-15 A3 Base Mid Gas Piston Upper Assembly is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and comes ready to fire right out of the box after installation onto any standard AR-15 lower receiver. This Base Mid upper comes equipped with a 16"" melonite-finished barrel, A2 flash hider, bolt carrier group, charging handle, picatinny rail gas block, delta ring assembly and a set of polymer 2-piece handguards. Additional features include a forged A3 flat-top configuration that's ready to accept the shooter's choice of optic and/or rear iron sight, M4 feed ramps to help ensure reliable feeding and functioning during rapid strings of fire, and a mid length gas system for a smoother recoil impulse and longer sight radius.

The upper's barrel has been finished inside and out with Adams Arms' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered with it due to the uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel.

All Adams Arms uppers feature a short stroke gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. To ensure that damage doesn't occur to the buffer tube from carrier tilt, the bolt carrier is equipped with enlarged ""skis"" to help guide it into the receiver extension. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to guarantee integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. All piston components are finished in QPQ Melonite for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning/maintenance.

It is a Smith & Wesson build licensed under Walther, as per normal. It is chambered in .380 ACP. 

I currently use this pistol as my concealed carry gun, so it does have some wear marks, but nothing a blue stick couldn't fix if you're a purist. Round count is extremely low. I would estimate it under 50. I purchased this gun new from a fellow BS member several months ago. 

The reasons I am looking to sell is that I am considering a Glock 19 to purchase, and I am not a fan of this particular pistol's trigger. It definitely requires a heavy pull, one that I don't feel is practical as a self defense use. But that's apples and oranges depending on the user. All in all I have no complaints with this pistol, it has done me no wrong. No misfires, fail to fires, grouping is what you would expect from a small barreled handgun. It's definitely an up close and personal type, excellent for self defense and home protection. 

Did I mention it's the primary choice of gun for James Bond? 

In addition to the pistol itself I am including two six round magazines, the original case, and 152rds of ammunition including self defense rounds. The box still has original paperwork, gun lock, etc. This is an excellent gun for the experienced shooter looking for a compact concealed carry firearm, or someone who wants a portable and easy to manage firearm for home defense.

I am asking for $425, very firm on the price given what is included. If you would like to purchase it, you must be a Louisiana resident 21 years of age or older. You must be willing to meet face to face to sign a bill of sale upon presentation of a valid state ID which will be recorded on the bill of sale. I will meet you at an FFL should you feel more comfortable in doing that, however you will pay for the FFL transfer.

I'm willing to travel throughout St. Tammany Parish, and outlying areas but not much further. Will not ship. 

I am open to very strict trades. You can offer me a Glock 19 provided it's relatively new, preferably a Gen 4. However if you feel you have a sweet offer, by all means offer. Worst I will do is say no thanks.

Anyway, enjoy the photos below. They aren't the best quality so if you'd like specific shots, or have questions or offers, send me a message. Thanks for looking!"

This is a Colt manufactured Government Model that was sold to the Argentine Navy in 1941. There were just 500 of these pistols in the contract and they were purchased from Colt's commercial ""off the shelf"" inventory. They are exactly like any other commercial Government Model from the period with two exceptions: the Argentine National crest is roll-marked across the top of the slide and the right side of the slide is pantograph engraved ""REPUBLICA ARGENTINA/ARMADA NACIONAL - 1941"". This pistol is extra interesting in that it has the somewhat scarce Swartz safety mechanism still intact (this was an early firing pin safety which locked the firing pin unless the grip safety was squeezed). This pistol is all original in both finish and all components. The slide is factory serial numbered to match the frame. The barrel is correctly marked ""COLT 45 AUTO"" on the left underside of the chamber, and ""S"" for commercial Sales ahead of the lugs. The chamber of the barrel also carries a very small import marking, the only such marking on the pistol. Overall condition is quite good and the pistol retains about 92-93% of the original polished blue factory finish. There is some sharp edge wear, numerous light handling marks, and a few minor scattered freckles. There is no significant pitting. The original full checkered walnut stocks are in very good shape with light wear but no cracks or chips. The mechanics are in perfect working order (including the Swartz safety) and the bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. It comes with one correct/original prewar full blue magazine with pinned base that is marked ""COLT 45 AUTO."". This is not one of the ""Model 1927"" contract pistols, nor an Argentine made pistol...it is far less common and will not be found listed in your Blue Book of Gun Values. This is a scarce Colt that is seldom encountered in original condition."

Description:
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand.

The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, Novak® night sights, integral accessory rail, ambedextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

it comes in the factory box with 2 factory magazines, all paperwork, lock, disassembly tool, a fobus holster, and  a leather shoulder holster. it has trijicon night sights on it. 

the pistol has some light signs of normal use. like rub marks from the holster and marks where moving parts get marked from normal use. dont expect a perfect pistol, but its not far from it. 

this is a very nice pistol. i do not have to sell it, so dont bother with low ball offers. their is one on gunbroker right now for $1,100 just for the pistol. here you get all the extras that would cost you atleast $100.
