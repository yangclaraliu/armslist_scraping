It's one of my most fun guns to shoot that I own and a fantastically trustworthy woods packer loaded with +P+ gold dots so it is honestly worth more to me than I think it is probably worth on the market in cash, so I'm not really looking for cash offers at the moment. However, since I have two Speed Sixes now I would be willing to pass this one on in trade for something equally interesting that I don't already have. The shooter in me would rather keep it but the collector in me is willing to let it go.It's a Ruger Speed Six in the very rare 9mm Para chambering. It uses full moon clips. How you feel about that is up to you. It's a bit of an inconvenience as far as high volume shooting since getting the spent shells out of the clips can be slow but in just about all other ways, it is an advantage. You can dump and load a fresh moon clip in this revolver faster than just about any speed loader making it an exceptionally good choice among revolvers for a defensive arm. Speed Sixes in 9mm are kind of a collectible that can fetch prices which sort of ruin it for this purpose, however. That's a way in which all the negatives about this example can be seen as positives. Its finish is quite ruined and was when I got it. I think someone stored it in a holster and while all traces of rust were scrubbed away, a light pitting remained. A distinguished whale colored gray patina filled it where the finish was missing like a poor man's parkerization.The good news is that the gun was utterly unnaffected mechanically, as were the very decent Sambar stag grips which are probably worth a good chunk of its value in themselves. The trigger is smooth as I think a Ruger can probably get. A Ruger is overbuilt like a tank and as far as function it as good as new if not better for being broken in compared to a brand new Ruger which takes a lot of trigger pulls to eliminate that factory crunch we all know. I actually quite like the way this gun looks from a utilitarian standpoint and unlike a pretty one in 9mm, you can kick it all around and not feel bad about it. Like I said it's probably my favorite shooter and knockaround revolver and I'll probably only let it go for a tempting trade. I'd estimate the monetary value somewhere south of $400 but for that much I'd as soon hold onto it, but again there are interesting trades in the same ballpark I'm sure I'd consider."

This Carbine was manufactured sometime between the early 1880s and early 1890s given the proofmarks. This Rifle retains 90% plus case color on the receiver, buttplate, and lever and 95% bluing on the barrel. The case colors are beginning to fade at the breech, top of the receiver, and buttplate, but remain very bright and vibrant on the rest of the parts. The stock has very nice figure and appears to be deluxe wood and still has sharp checkering. The forearm checkering is worn which is to be expected from a firearm of this age as thats where it would be handled the most and the tip of the forearm appears to be made from horn. The bore has sharp rifling and shows shine. Although I don’t see any definitive manufactures markings other than many proof markings and a W on the receiver after the research I’ve done I believe this Carbine was manufactured by Westley Richards because of the W on the receiver and there is also a W.R. Stamped into the forearm. The receiver is also marked on the side for .577/.450 Case And Carbine Charge on top of the barrel directly ahead of th receiver. This is exactly how Westley Richards marked their firearms with both the case to be used and the charge. Those of you who know the prices on these fine English Sporting Rifles of the late 1800s know how valuable they can be as most start out around $2000 in much lesser condition than this example so you will see my price is very fair.  I will be including a box of .577/.450 paper patched black powder rounds custom loaded specifically to carbine charge specs for this Rifle. This is an antique manufactured before 1898 and therefore can be shipped directly to you. Will ship anywhere in the lower 48. Shipping will be anfixed $35. PayPal payment preferred if shipping is required. I have over 100 pictures of this Rifle so feel free to contact me if you need more. Email, Call, or text REDACTED"

This rifle is New Old Stock. Original box not included since it was pretty beat up. Never been fired before. Field strips exactly like a real AK. Even uses real AK parts. I can confirm that the dust cover, RSB, and recoil spring fit onto my 1969 Tula AKM with no issues and are authentic AK parts. All of the proof marks on the front trunnion are clearly visible and have unique serial numbers. All the riveting is done correctly and in the correct spots. Definitely as real as it gets!!! This isn’t your cheap plastic Chinese airsoft Rifle...this is an authentic collectible that was manufactured in the USSR.I was told that these rifles were once training aids for students in Russia and were used in order to familiarize themselves with the Kalashnikov rifle in case shit were to happen. Gun shoots in semi auto only. 12g co2 cartridge is inserted in the pistol grip. Magazine is located under the recoil spring. Gun normally came with a dummy magazine. This one unfortunately doesn’t. However, I have confirmed that any real steel AK74 mag should fit and lock in the magazine well with no issues. This air gun was selling for $1200 at a local gun show in 2006. It will only get more rare and increase in value, especially due to the Kalashnikov ban in the US.In Europe, where these guns are still sold legally sell for approx 780US each before shipping and VAT. However, these CANNOT be shipped to the US any longer. I’m asking $850 shipped for each rifle, which I think is a fair price, considering the $1200 price tag was more than 12 years ago. Item will ship via UPS Ground for free in the lower 48 states. Add $40 for Hawaii and Alaska.

The newly made PKS-01, the farther of the well-known PK-AS.This scope was designed specifically for the combat operations of the Russian Special Forces. You still find it on the elite units of the Russian MVD; police, Spetznaz, OMON and others. State-of-the-art technology makes it the premier collimator optic in the Russian arsenal. It not only fills the role of the traditional red dot as a CQB short range/fast acquisition sight, but also has unique features designed specifically for longer range combat shooting. It boasts a unique ability to facilitate single shot kills out to 400 meters when used with the AK-74. It is rare that such advanced technology is available to civilians, especially to foreigners. Using the newest machining techniques, the quality of this amazing sight is equal to US military optics. Its fully coated prismatic lens system provides a remarkable, high contrast, wide angle field of view allowing for fast acquisition of moving and spaced targets. Its most unique feature is its state-of-the-art black dot-red dot operation. Under normal daylight conditions, a precise 1 MOA black dot enclosed in a simple elliptical range-finding circle (170 MOA) is always visible without the use of the battery. When needed, a flip of the switch activates a 1.5 MOA red dot. This flexibility allows the PKS-01 round the clock effectiveness in all environments. This dual sighting functionality is available in no other collimator sight. Another great feature is the exceeding ease of making alignment adjustments using its indexed ballistic cam. The thumb-wheel style range turret is calibrated for the AK-74 (5.45×39mm cartridge) and lets you set the scope to fire in the 25 - 200 meter range easily. Zeroing the scope is via a cam wheel with 5 cm at 100 m clicks. The 1x non-magnification design allows for both-eyes-open shooting eliminating eyestrain. You have an unlimited field of view and maximum ability to register incoming targets. The precision dot system combined with the striking field of view produced by the high quality lens system provides far superior accuracy at distances equal to and exceeding those capable with iron sights. The advanced elliptical range finder accurately quotes distance. The PKS-01 universal AK/SKS/SVD Version mounting clamp is capable of fitting properly to almost any AK, SKS or SVD Russian side rail. It has a special stop pin system which allows you to quickly adjust the mount for proper eye relief and increased aiming comfort. It is very light weight while being battle-field tough.

Afer all, why shouldn't gays be as miserable as the rest of us.  With both a .22lr and .22 magnum cylinder, its like having two guns in one. Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version. The Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting. Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. PROUDLY MADE IN OUR USA. All Heritage revolvers combine quality and affordability ... an American tradition. This has consistantly been one of the top selling handguns in the United States for the last 2 decades. They look great, they work great and they are at a great price. This is the perfect glove box or field carry revolver and just tons of fun to shoot. It's affordable to own and inexpensive to shoot. If you prefer, if requested via email, I will gladly swap out white or other grips."

The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine, and a low capacity-compliant version is available with two 10 round magazines. With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.
