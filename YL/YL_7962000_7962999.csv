Vol 2 is where both the K-14 and K-15 rifles are dissected and a full report given, including a detailed history. KDF was incorporated in 1970 in Seguin, TX after Bob Kleinguenther convinced Voere in Vohrenenbach, Germany that their rifle model, the Shikar, was not going to be successful and that both he and they should set about designing a new rifle to be marketed by KDF in the U.S. In 1972, the design was approved and sent to production with a model number of K-14 for Kleinguenther project number 14. In Europe, it was referred to as M2145. About 7,000 rifles were produced between 1973 and 1977 with final sales taking place as late as 1978. Robert Kleinguenther's years as a chief designer and engineer for Weatherby are apparent in his designs.These were produced with a 0.5 MOA guarantee from Kleinguenther at a time when Weatherby could only guarantee 1.5MOA. They’re known as the most accurate hunting rifle you could buy. I would rate this rifle as Very Good. The trigger is phenomenal and the action is smoother than a silk scarf gliding over polished marble. 26” barrel with strong, sharp rifling. There is a small amount of typical finish wear at the muzzle and very slight wear on the top of the barrel just forward of the scope. The stock retains its excellent shine, and has a few superficial handling marks that don’t break through the clear coat (which has no bubbling/cracking, very unusual for these guns). Putting it up to test the waters—did a search and couldn’t find one ever posted on NW Firearms for sale.Scope is not included in sale. The rare, highly-praised and period-correct Buehler rings/mounts are included in the sale.$1500. Will ship on your dime."

The receiver and barrel were squared and head spaced. I also free floated the barrel in the factory stock. Also comes with stainless Ruger scope rings.
It shoots well, definitely better than it did originally. I haven't spent a lot of time finding the best factory ammo, nor have I done any reloading for it. But so far it seems to like factory Hornady GMX loads the best. (The attached picture is those at 100 yards, Orange dot is 3/4"") I have the dies to reload this caliber with a neck sizer. I'm willing to add them and the brass I have accumulated for another $100. I know I have about 70 pieces of brass, maybe a little more. Its a good rifle, I just use other rifles more and it spends its time just sitting."

It looked like the top of the mag was not right (like it has been dropped).  I adjusted the magazine lips and it now fires and feeds just fine.  I shot 12 rounds with no issues, worked perfectly.  However the magazine is not pretty.  If you buy this gun, please buy it as if you have to purchase a new magazine.  That is why the price has been lowered.

The Overwatch Precision BRZ Trigger is a flat-faced, direct drop-in replacement for your XDS OEM trigger. Each trigger shoe and trigger safety tab is machined in the USA out of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy, and Type II and III anodized. The hybrid flat curved form allows a uniquely self-correcting, straight rearward press, combined with noticeable comfort. Pre-travel has been reduced as much as possible without compromising firearm safety features, and the result is a clean, crisp break, reduced overtravel, and a tactile reset.
 
For the best possible trigger feel, we recommend installing this trigger in conjunction with the Powder River Precision Trigger spring and sear kit.

The ergonomic shape and proportioned finger grooves position the hand consistently every time and are designed for optimum pointing characteristics. These features enhance accuracy by helping the shooter acquire a target faster and more consistently, shot after shot. Our exclusive molding process gives these grips a comfortable soft recoil absorbing feel that is non-slip. Hogue rubber grips hold securely in cold, wet or sweating hands. Monogrips are made by OverMolding our soft rubber over a hard inner skeleton or “insert”. Because the rubber we use chemically bonds to the insert it provides an extremely durable grip that will not delaminate or come apart. The molded insert allows us to maintain exacting tolerances, assuring a proper fit and a grip that will function flawlessly. Monogrips are fully relieved for speedloaders and are securely attached to your gun in seconds using your stock screw.
