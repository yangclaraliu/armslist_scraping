I would trust this gun with protecting me and my family any day! If you are curious about why I'm choosing to sell this awesome thing, it's ONLY because I have ""backup"" guns that I would be willing to use for home defense in the case that I come across a situation in life where the money becomes more important than when I originally decided to make this dream gun build. That's currently the situation that I'm in.NOT ACCEPTING TRADE OFFERS!"

267,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7337267,For Sale:  Remington Eye Ball R1 Throwable Camera System for High-Risk Mil/LE Tactical Ops,"Virginia Beach, Hampton Roads, Virginia","$ 3,000","Listed On: Sunday, September 17, 2017",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Includes:x3 Eyeball Cameras (usually around $1500 each)x1 PDUInstruction and quick use manualsSling strap for PDUCharging cords + ExtraExtra Field pouchRemington’s Eye Ball R1 offers 360° vision for Homeland Security, SWAT, Narcotics, SPECOPS, EOD... virtually any tactical team.Remington's Eye Ball R1 is a compact wireless 360° mobile display system, designed to be used in tactical operations where law enforcement personnel need to see the situation before entering a building, floor or room. The Eye Ball R1 is rugged allowing officers to roll, toss, lower or throw it as applications demand: • Entry Teams • Search & Rescue • Surveillance Operations • Ceiling & Attic Investigation • Corner, Stairwell & Hallway Clearing The following from DefenseReview.com:""Criminals, insurgents, and terrorists beware. The Eye Ball R1 remote-controlled 360-degree spherical camera system, or ""mobile display system"", originally designed and developed by O.D.F. Optronics, Ltd., out of Tel-Aviv, Israel, will now be manufactured and marketed in the U.S. by Remington Technologies, a division of Remington Arms Company, Ltd., through a licensing agreement.Compact, lightweight, and ruggedized, the EyeBall R1 was designed and developed to be deployed/employed for…military Special Operations (SPECOPS), law enforcement SWAT/SRT operations, anti-terrorism/counterterrorism operations, hostage rescue operations, and just about any and all other types of tactical operations for which a small, rugged, lightweight wireless audio device/video camera can come in handy. According to the company, potential applications for the technology include (but are not limited to) Dynamic Entry/High-Risk Entry Operations (including room clearing and stairwell clearing), ceiling and attic Investigation, surveillance operations, and search and rescue operations.Due to its ruggedized construction, the Remington Technologies Eye Ball R1 can be rolled, tossed, or thrown wherever necessary. Once deployed, the system can capture video out to 25 yards away and audio up to a distance of 5 yards, and then broadcast both up to 200 yards wirelessly back to a large remote control device called a Personal Display Unit (PDU), operated by the tactical operator. The PDU can communicate with two Eye Ball R1’s simultaneously. The PDU’s color video screen is 6.4"".The EyeBall R1’s omni-directional camera can rotate at 4 rpm until a target is identified, and then give the operator a 55-degree horizontal and 41-degree vertical field of view, as well as near-infrared (IR) spectrum night vision capability for low-light deployment/night operations. You can stick the Eye Ball R1 on a mobile robot, remote-viewing, pole, or any other relevant tactical device, even a remote-control car (which has apparently already been done). Once the device is tossed/thrown, it remains static after landing. Only the camera rotates. If the Eye Ball R1 lands upside down, the operator can flip the video feed in order to view things right-side-up. By the way, it’s been reported that the EyeBall R1 can survive a two-story drop.DefenseReview finds the Eye Ball R1 technology interesting. To be honest, we always enjoy tactically-relevant telepresence technology, here at DefRev. The overall package here looks pretty slick. What can we say, the Israelis keep coming up with new and innovative tactical technologies. Frankly, we like any technology that can potentially enable military SPECOPS, LE SWAT, and anti-terrorism/counterterrorism operators to perform their missions more safely, effectively, and efficiently. It would appear that the Eye Ball R1 can do that, but we’ll just have to wait and see.For military Special Operations and anti-terrorism/counterterrorism operations, it would be interesting to see if it would be possible to create a specialized version of EyeBall R1 outfitted internally with plastic explosives (like C4, for instance) and concentrically-arranged ball bearings, so operators can remotely detonate it, and thus remotely terminate the hostile threat(s) immediately, right then and there, once the target(s) is/are located and identified. This could only be done if capture and interrogation are unnecessary for gathering intel and the team is either sure that no non-targeted personnel are present, or collateral damage is deemed acceptable. Think of it as a smart grenade (defensive grenade). Deploy, locate, identify, detonate. It’s that easy. Sure, it’ll be a little larger and heavier in weight, and a good bit more costly than a standard fragmention grenade (defensive grenade). However, as long as it’s well-balanced (for accurate throwing) and the target(s) is/are important enough, who cares? Of course, it would be much less expensive to just throw in one or two standard frag grenades or flood the room (CQB engagement) after you’ve identified the target(s) with a standard-version Eye Ball R1, but this method would take extra time and increase the chances of the target(s) escaping or responding with force (due to the extra time involved), putting the team and the public at large at greater risk. If you wanna’ go less-lethal, just make a specialized flash-bang (pyrotechnic) version of the EyeBall R1, so you can stun ’em before you flood the room. Actually, the latter is probably much easier said than done. For that, you’d have to make all of the Eye Ball R1’s components rugged enough to handle the pyrotechnic blast, in order to be reusable. This might not be possible.Defense Review has actually been following the technology for awhile now, ever since O.D.F. Optronics Ltd. first released information about it. We just never quite got around to writing about it. O.D.F. Optronics is a research and development firm that specializes in ""vision-based products for defense and security applications"". Co-founded by two computer-vision engineers named Ehud Gal and Natan Merom, O.D.F Optronics designs, develops, and markets electro-optic systems, omni-directional imaging systems, omni-directional optics, and image processing and image understanding software. Development of the Eye Ball R1 was handled by O.D.F. Optronics’ defense division.A few more specs:The Eye Ball R1 transmits audio and video at 2.4 GHz. The control unit transmits at 902-928 MHz. The Eye Ball R1 is battery powered, and can operate for 2 hours. The PDU can operate for 3 hours."""

Extra mags & trituim sights cost $144 extra, FWIW, and are included. I paid over $3200 total, w/ tax.FTF BUYERS CAN COME TO MY OFFICE IN NEW ALBANY, ONLY, and must be have Ohio DL or CCW license and be able to own and buy a gun. Can ship to your FFL, but will hold any money orders/cashiers checks until they clear my bank -- had two fakes so far. Shipping is actual UPS cost, usually $30 or so. If your FFL won't take shipments from individuals, which are totally lawful, my FFL charges an extra $70 to put pistols on their FFL and ship, and that cost will be passed on to the buyer.SPECS:High-Capacity Compact Size Aluminum X-Frame with Reliability Enhanced Frame RailsUnique X-TAC Frontstrap/Mainspring Housing TreatmentConcealment Bullet Proof® HammerBullet Proof® Thumb Safety3 ½# – 4 ½# Crisp Trigger Pull with Medium Length PadBullet Proof® Magazine ReleaseBlack G10 Aggressive Starburst Grips with Pewter Medallions4” Stainless Steel Tri-Top Slide with External ExtractorUnique X-TAC Rear & Front Cocking Serration Treatment on SlideHeavy Machine Chamfer on Bottom of SlideElevation Adjustable Tactical Battlesight with Tritium front4” Stainless Cone Barrel with Reliability Enhancing Lock-up, Flush Cut Reverse CrownFluted ChamberFluted Barrel30 LPI Slide Top Serrations40 LPI Serrated Rear of SlideCarry Cuts/Ball Endmill Cuts5 15-Round Capacity Magazines"

If I can't sell at this price, I'll just take it to a shop for trade-in value. 
I am the original owner of this pistol and purchased it around March of 2015 when I returned from overseas duty. It has less than 200 rounds down the barrel and has been carried more than it has been fired. 
This first generation Smith & Wesson Shield 9mm is the factory ""no thumb safety"" model and has experienced no damage or modifications save for a little silver and black sharpie on the front sight. This is apparent in the photos and can be removed with rubbing alcohol if you like. If you buy my gun, I'll personally clean and lube the internals with high-quality products before it changes hands. The controls and sights show a slight bit of wear from being carried and run through drills. 
The gun will include the original box along with one 7-round magazine and three 8-round magazines which are all loaded with 115-grain or 124-grain hollow points from Federal and Hornady. I'll also include 100 rounds of 124-grain FMJ ammo from Freedom Munitions for your practice use. I have all three extension sleeves for the 8-round magazines in the box. 
Three holsters which have all been used and tested to safely cover the trigger guard will come with the gun and are all pictured: 
1 - IWB holster and mag pouch from 805 Kydex (no longer in business), both colored tan. I've used these the most as they are very secure and go on & off easily. -  http://bit.ly/2haHvrm
2 - IWB Stealth holster from Q-Series with two clips, black & brown, paracord loop, and original packaging. A minimalist holster that's great for discreet business wear. - http://bit.ly/2fsKPOi  & http://bit.ly/2hbmZqt  
3 - Kydex Trigger Guard holster with paracord loops that I used for vehicle safety. I don't remember the manufacturer.
 
No trades but I'll receive reasonable offers. I can travel midway if there's distance between us. 
I prefer to meet face to face and would like to see a TN Handgun Carry Permit or Driver's License. If you are buying from another state, please email me and we'll negotiate pricing without the ammo and exchange FFL information. I will accept cash face to face or electronic transfer and checks for out-of-state. 
 
Thank you for your reading my ad, please contact me with any questions. Email is the best way to reach me."
