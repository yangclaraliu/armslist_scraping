I've added the bolt and hand guard, which means it was not put togeather by Bannermans this way.  These were made for the countless private military schools in the New York city area for young men to do military drills and not shoot each other.  The barrels were not seated all the way into the receiver, so that a bolt with an extractor could not turn down,  this is a collectors item in the configuration that it is in. $285.00 + shipping.

There are no Springfield proof marks meaning that Springfield never assembled it and only the drawing number, date and steel batch code are SA. This surprised us and after a few phone calls to elderly collectors and authorities on the Garand we were assured that although unusual and very rare this is a product of sharing or loaning of parts to keep production output unbroken by delays. Parts sharing or use of other manufacturers parts was more common place than most people think but was very poorly documented and it is likely that only a few hundred at the most may have been built this way and even fewer would have survived post war rebuilds. The bore has strong lands and grooves and has been through the rebuild process as there is hard chrome around the gas port ."

There are no Springfield proof marks meaning that Springfield never assembled it and only the drawing number, date and steel batch code are SA. This surprised us and after a few phone calls to elderly collectors and authorities on the Garand we were assured that although unusual and very rare this is a product of sharing or loaning of parts to keep production output unbroken by delays. Parts sharing or use of other manufacturers parts was more common place than most people think but was very poorly documented and it is likely that only a few hundred at the most may have been built this way and even fewer would have survived post war rebuildsThe bore has strong lands and grooves and has been through the rebuild process as there is hard chrome around the gas port .The Gas Plug is a single slot type which is period correct and is most likely a replacement as the blued finish is almost 100%."

This handgun has never been fired other than the single round used at the factory. I'm going to give somebody a great deal on this package. Retail on both of these is over $600 so First person with $450 cash gets it. I'm firm on the price since I'm already selling at a discount. I would consider partial trades 4 a Ruger SR22 or Smith & Wesson 22 compact or Walther P22. I would take any one of those three plus $200 cash. Buyer must have a CHL and only willing to meet within 30 minutes of West Carrollton Ohio. Email or text work. 937**260**5002

Never had a gun-related malfunction and love shooting it. If you don't know a lot about these, it is the size of a compact Glock with great capacity and uses the same polymer design. It packs the .40 punch with the percieved kick of a Glock 17. Once you fire one of these you realize why they are $1000 new. I personally like this gun way more than glocks I have had, but since I got it my lifestyle has changed and it is no longer convenient to carry even this compact handgun, so I find myself carrying less and less and I would like to not do that. This pistol will come with the hard case and 1 assault-weapon-ban era extended magazine. you will need to either get an x-grip for the magazine or a regular magazine, as without the x-grip, the extended magazine falls out of the weapon every once in a while while shooting."

Low serial #19xxx on breech. During 1883 Hartley and Graham bought surplus Trapdoor rifles from the U.S. Government and had them converted (possibly by Whitney) into beautiful sporting rifles to satisfy demand from the Western Buffalo Trade. A new heavy barrel, blued and octagonal (approximately #4 size and weight). Barrel length 30” and mounted with a Buckhorn/Ladder rear sight and Rocky Mountain German silver front sight. The original U.S. stock was reworked producing a Schnable forend with a black buffalo horn insert. The stock was checkered. Butt plate has the compartment for cleaning rods. Note: There is a faint U.S. Inspectors cartouche remaining on the stock. These guns were retailed by E.C. Meacham of St. Louis, N. Curry & Bro. San Francisco, John P. Lovell of Boston. This was the perfect big bore, big barrel rifle for Western big game. True fact: more buffalo were killed with Trapdoors than any other rifle! This beautiful rifle has 95-96% original barrel blue. Receiver has 98% bright original case colors as does the lock. Checkering is excellent. Great example of a buffalo hunter’s heavy barrel rifle and in great condition.Any questions?

Used this year for 3/4 of a season of trap. Has not been hunted with. A little too light for me for trap. Shoots very well though. Very minor blemishes in wood. Metal in great condition. Gun is a single trigger, selectable barrel. has shell ejectors. Action locks up tight. Pretty gun. Not very common, check out going rates on gunbroker.Also including:Beretta Soft Case for an over/under shotgunBeretta Shell Case (holds 4 boxes i believe)Browning XXL Trap Shooting Vest. Gray, Black and Blue. Was almost 100 new. Nice shape.3/4 of a case of shells. Some new fiochi target shells. Some vintage shells, not shooters, collectors.Speed Choke Wrench12 gauge Bore SnakeI am asking $1000 for everything or $750 just for gun with chokes. Any of the other stuff can be negotiated. There is probably close to $400 in extras. The cheapest i see it on gunbroker for is $1168 buy it now, without shipping or transfer fees. I will post pictures later or can send via text. Located in Eau Claire, can meet within reasonable distance. Might consider partial trade with majority cash on this guy. Email or text REDACTED"

It's less than two months old. Barely used, Low round count, and in like new condition. I had a Zev technologies ultimate trigger installed in the pistol when I purchased it. It's a $255 upgrade. The trigger kit includes the complete drop in flat faced aluminum trigger, skeletonized stainless steel light weight high volecity striker, stainless steel safey plunger and spring, all stainless connector bars. Comes with 2.5lbs spring and a 3.5 lbs spring. The trigger is also adjustable for pretravel and reset. It's currently in the factory set point. And in my opinion, doesn't need any adjustment. But that's shooter preference. The cerakoting is Flat Dark Earth and is factory from Glock.  It's too my understanding this color is somewhat rare. I have  just over $1050 into this pistol. Being that it's so new I'd like to get $925. I'll take the $125 hit for you. The only reason I want too sell it... I'm a lefty and Glock just released a left handed Gen 5.

This is an original Vaquero single-action revolver that is chambered for the .40 S&W cartridge. The story behind these is rather interesting and can be read about here: Vaquero .40 S&W San Diego Sheriff Commemorative. In a nutshell, just over 1000 of these revolvers were special ordered from Ruger to be used to make up a special engraved police commemorative revolver. A relative handful (fewer than 200) were never engraved and these are now highly sought after by collectors. This is one of those scarce Vaqueros, Ruger catalog number KBNV-404SW. It is constructed of polished stainless steel and wears the short 4-5/8"" barrel with fixed sights. Condition is excellent and although the gun has been fired, it has not seen much use. The stainless finish shows only a few very light handling marks that could easily be polished out if desired. There is no rust or pitting. I'd grade this revolver at 98% overall. The original wood grips are excellent also, free of cracks, chips, or dings. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent. This hard-to-find Ruger comes in the original plastic case which numbers to the gun. The owner's manual, miscellaneous paperwork, and small safety lock are included. Manufactured back in 2000, this is a unique variation of the original Vaquero.Buyer pays $20.00 shipping."
