When I got it there was a spacer that i believe was glued in and i didn't even notice at first. After a few years the spacer fell out and now the top cover doesn't properly fit. The gun would need a small shim tack welded in and it would work perfectly again. that would be the easy fix. It would also make great parts for a full rebuild.

The mainspring housing has been upgraded from the stock cheap polymer to an alloy Fusion chainlink housing. It’s an excellent quality part and matches the pistol very nicely. I’ve also added the Hogue grips as can be seen from the photos.

Proper conversion from ""sporting import version"" with US parts.  Compare my photographs with others on Armslist is their's the version you want?  If so great buy it for a lower price, if not you will have to pay a gunsmith for conversion.

Aftermarket adjustable 4 position gas system, this makes my gun reliable with different 12 gauge loads.  Semi-Automatic Saiga 12 gauge shotguns are finicky.  If your gun is not reliable with different loads do you trust it?  You can have the gunsmith install this when he converts your gun from the sporting import configuration.

Multiple picatinny rails, kinda necessary for adding a red dot, lights, lasers, vertical grip....etc.

I understand these can be had cheaper through a dealer, but I'm not requiring a BG check or trying to make money. I'm simply trying to recoop what I can out of this outstanding piece of equipment that I must unfortunately part with due to unforeseen circumstances. So if the price isn't in your ballpark, please refrain from contacting me just to tell me I'm an asshole for the price and that they can be had for cheaper.

Cheap .22 long-rifle caliber rifle rounds and 9mm pistol ammunition are both said to have more than tripled in price over the past five years, while .40 Smith & Wesson rounds have doubled and .45 ACP costs nearly twice what it did five years ago.

Scarcity
In short, prices have gone through the roof -- if you're lucky. If you're not lucky, you may have trouble finding ammunition for sale at all. Bare shelves are a common encounter at ammo retailers these days. The situation has gotten so bad that Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT  ) , one of the cheapest sources of ammunition, instituted a policy early last year limiting customers to buying no more than three boxes of ammo per person, per day.
And this is your first clue to why prices have been shooting up. If prices are sky-high, yet shoppers are still buying -- and not just buying, but sweeping the shelves clean, there's only one logical conclusion:
Hoarding
Credit is due to the National Rifle Association for debunking conspiracy theories about ""the government"" causing this crisis. Last month's issue of American Rifleman, the ""official journal of the NRA,"" lays out the case for why American gun owners have only themselves to blame for the steep rise in ammunition prices (and the steep fall in ammunition supply).
From 2000 to 2012, the NRA reported, excise taxes received by the federal government on ammunition sales (a proxy for ammo sales per se) roughly tripled in size. The dollar value of actual ammunition sales increased nearly 100% from 2007 to 2012. In real life, the NRA explained this means that ammunition sales ""started to climb fast as gun sales began surging"" in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election.
High prices, low supply
Conspiracy theorists will dispute this simple explanation, no doubt. But it jibes with what manufacturers of ammunition are saying. ATK (NYSE: ATK  ) subsidiary Federal Cartridge, for example, has a statement on its website advising, ""We are currently experiencing high demand for our products."" In an interview with American Rifleman, Federal confirmed, too, that ""the current increase in demand,"" (and by implication, the increase in prices) ""is attributed to the civilian market"" (this means you).
Olin's  (NYSE: OLN  ) Winchester Ammunition said on its website it is also ""experiencing an extremely high demand."" And privately held Freedom Group, which manufactures Remington cartridges, said ""it's clear to us that any lack of supply in the marketplace has been from consumer demand.""
Probably the clearest explanation of what's going on, though, comes from privately held Hornady Manufacturing, where President Steve Hornady painted this picture: ""People walk into the store, they don't see as much as they want so they take everything they can get. The next guy who comes in can't get anything, so he panics."" 
Note that at no point does price even become a consideration here. And if price is no object -- then yes, of course, these companies are going to raise prices to maximize profits."

Keep in mind the ammo value alone is $130. You must have a valid NH drivers license. The first 670  takes everything. This is a firm take it or leave it cash price. This is my second and final price reduction. This is also a limited time offer. I will take it off the market and keeping it if I am not able to sell it at it's current rock bottom price.

This rifle is equipped with a 14.5 inch barrel with a permanent izzy flash hider and muzzle break. Also included, is a Trijicon reflex II with a 4 MOA dot sight with the A2 carry handle mount; a 5.11 TPT L2 LED flashlight with mount; and 3 rail attachments including a duel angle mount and a magpul pmag gen 2 with countdown window. Comes in the original bushmaster hard plastic case. I purchased this rifle new 7 years ago and have put about 1500 rounds through it. I bought it as a personal rifle to practice qualifications for a former job. It has never had any real field time, mostly safe time. I really like this rifle because it is shorter than most ar15 (non SBR) variants on the civilian market. The izzy flash hider/break really inhibits muzzle climb, and is noticeable compared to the standard A2 flash hider. I have only shot quality brass ammunition out of this rifle, and cleaned it with a quality bore snake. I bought the Trijicon reflex sight in 2006. It is a great sight that never needs batteries, and works great outdoors in any light condition. However, when observed in low light conditions INDOORS, especially when used with a flashlight, the red dot can appear dim and tends to “washout.” It always did this, even when it was newer I thought (I believe it is the most common criticism of the sight). However, the sight co-witnesses with the A2 sights perfect so it was never an issue for me.

Must be legally able to own this rifle.  WI Drivers License or CCL required.  Sorry about that.  I am asking $950 for entire package, but I will sell this for $750 if you have a WI CCL."

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever(installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a sleek slide profile reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

Beretta arx 160 22 lr 

Beretta USA is well known for designing and manufacturing some of the most durable and reliable firearms for law enforcement, military, hunting, personal defense, and concealed carry. Beretta has a history steeped in tradition with their Competition Shotguns like the Beretta 692 and DT11, and Field Shotguns like their Beretta 686 and SV10. They also offer modern day firearms like their innovative and exciting Cx4 Storm Rifle, ARX Series Rifles, and their famous Beretta M92/96, and Nano. Beretta USA has something to offer every shooter on the planet regardless of skill level or venue. After all, everyone should own at least 1 Beretta in their collection.

Finally, a training rifle in .22 caliber that looks, feels and shoots like Beretta's heralded ARX160 military assault rifle. Just like the military version, the ARX160 .22 LR is lightweight, user friendly, and an ergonomic masterpiece. This is a rifle full of cool features that will be a thrill to put its paces at the range. Beyond its striking physical and working similarities to the combat version, it also shares its ambidextrous advantages. The two-position safety, magazine release, and cocking handle can all be set to the right or left hand preference. Picatinny rails allow the user to build on anything they can dream, the rifle can be dissembled for cleaning easily without tools, allowing access to clean the barrel from the back round. There is also easy access to the bolt and trigger system, just like with a .223 Rem rifle. Constructed of reinforced polymer with flip up sights, the ARX160 .22 LR gives shooters the experience of shooting the world's preeminent military rifle at a price they can afford.

  Century K100 Mk7 Semi Auto Handgun 9mm 

Made in the Slovak Republic by Grand Power, the K100 Mk7 is a modern, fully ambidextrous 9mm semi automatic pistol that features an external hammer and interchangeable grip panels. The frame is made from steel reinforced GF-30 polymer which reduces the overall weight of the gun without compromising strength, function or reliability. Grand Power pistols are all made on 4140 steel reinforced polymer frames with a significant design emphasis on ergonomics and ease of function. Each pistol has an integral Picatinny rail in the frame and comes with four interchangeable backstraps.

Each pistol is fully ambidextrous, the slide lock, mag. release and safety are fully functional on both sides of the frame. All of the barrels are high quality stainless steel and use a patented rotating lock, rather than tilting, during cycling for super smooth work at the range. The trigger has a very short reset, so accurate and fast follow up shots are a breeze. The slide and the steel reinforcing in the frame is finished by nitrocarburizing.

The tritium night sight paired with the dual color fiber optic sight allows for excellent target acquisition at all light levels. The shorter length of pull stock helps pull the firearm in for a tighter bond and faster swing, providing for better maneuvering around corners. This posting is for sale of all of the parts together; not individually. More pictures: http://imgur.com/a/7emee#0

What is included:
-18.5"" 12GA 2.75"" & 3"" Blue Cylinder Bore Barrel. Light use at range.
-Meprolight (ML-34044) Mossberg Tru-Dot Tritium Bead Night Sight for M500 5-40 installed on rib of barrel. (Purchased 2013. 15 year useful life)
-TruGlo Glo-Dot Shotgun Sight Universal Dual Color TG90D installed immediately before night sight. 
-Hogue Mossberg 500 OverMolded Shotgun Stock - 12"" L.O.P. 05030.

There are several cosmetic issues that should be noted:
-The barrel was originally 28"" in length and at the time of modification an 18"" barrel was impossible to find in stock. Barrel was cut, flattened at the face, lightly crowned with a ball bearing, and finally blued. The front of the rib was also drilled and threaded for the Meprolight front sight. Because of this, the original threaded rear sight hole is present and slightly visible just before the dual color fiber optic. The hole has been filled with black steel epoxy since it is unnecessary.
-The stock has two holes on the left which are filled with black steel epoxy. These were for testing placement of sling swivels, but were found to be dangerously close to teeth during recoil. Electrical tape can be seen wrapped around the rubber recoil pad of the stock, this is simply to reduce friction against clothing so the stock does not snag during shouldering.
-The dual color fiber optic has a factory blemish seen only from the outside of the tube just near the tip mating with the Meprolight."

NO NYC. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. The Kel-Tec PF-9 pistols are the optimal combination of lightness, thinness, compactness, and most important, reliability. One reason Kel-Tecs are so reliable are their magazines. These are not marked like the smaller guns are, but from their looks they’re either Mec Gar or ACT-Mag, both fine Italian made magazines. Here is a factory blue steel magazine for the Kel-Tec PF-9 family of pistols, holds 7 rounds of any 9mm ammo. It is written somewhere, Thou Shalt Have Six Magazines for Each of Thy autos, three loaded and three empty, and rotate them every six months, sound doctrine in anyone’s book. Photo shows also the accessory finger rest that’s available each for only $ 10.00 extra, no extra shipping charges. Our Single Mag price is $35.00. We’re offering these fine Factory Kel-Tec 7 Shot magazines, however in lots of 3 at only $26 each. Own 3 for only $ 78.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10.
