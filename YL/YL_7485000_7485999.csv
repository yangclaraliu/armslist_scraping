However, because this is a budget priced LPEG airsoft gun, most of the features found on the real AK-12, such as a retractable stock and multiple setting selector switch, are not functional on this model. That being said, if you are a huge fan of the AK-12, this low-cost airsoft rifle is a great addition to your arsenal!"

Nickel outside is pitted up of course for a hundred year old revolver but still looks great and rifling is good. Made off the Smith model 1 it has the free spinning cylinder.  (Meaning cylinders on these do not fully lock and will spin one way when cocked which is why gun shops don't recommend shooting them)Breaks open with a simple lever push and ejects spent casings very easy and fast to reload.Ejector works amazing and has good trigger pull in single action when cocking hammer and smooth easy pull in double action then push trigger forward if you pull it in double action to reset it.Gun does shoot and actually pretty accurate at 25 yards but for the age of course gun shops don't recommend you shooting them and because of it being the free spinning cylinder model.  Great conversation piece or great display item or get it out every now an then an shoot just be careful.

Aluminum alloy construction for easy maintenance and durability.The Rhino is the most innovative development in revolver technology in decades, if not since the creation of the revolver itself. Refusing to be constrained by tradition and previous design limitations, the Rhino has improvements that move the revolver forward into the 21st century. Unconventional in appearance and superior by performance, the Rhino fires from the bottom of the cylinder rather than the top. This dramatically reduces muzzle rise and recoil felt by lowering the axis of the bore almost to the palm of the shooters hand. An aluminum alloy frame and barrel shroud make the Rhino lightweight and easy to carry. Accessory rails on the bottom of the barrel shroud on the 40ds barrel models easily allow mounting lights or lasers. The 6â€ barrel models come with both rails on top and bottom to easily mount optics as well as lights or lasers.The snag resistant â€œhammerâ€ is actually a cocking device because of the Rhinoâ€™s innovative completely enclosed firing mechanism which can be fired either single or double action. A cocked indicator is clearly visible to indicate the internal hammer status. Another innovation is the hexagonal cylinder which keeps the revolverâ€™s width to a minimum. Available in 2â€, 4â€, 5â€ and 6â€ barrel models in black or stainless finishes, all Rhino revolvers feature an easy to see fiber optic front sight. Mn buyer needs state photo ID and permit.Out of state buyer pays $30 shipping to local FFL."

The end of the 1890s and early 1900s saw great international military interest in semiautomatic weapons, particularly handguns. The famous Borchardt design and the Mauser C96 pistol are both examples of this interest at the turn of the century. The German Army expressed interest in a pistol-carbine for artillery use in 1907 and several designs were submitted, including the Borchardt, the C96 by Mauser and others but none were considered satisfactory. The next year, the German Army adopted the new semi-automatic design that was called the Pistole 08 or P08, which is the classic Luger design. The German War Ministry then decided to raise the issue of the pistol-carbine for artillery use again with a view towards creating a design based on the P08 design. Captain Adolf Fischer of the German Army led a team that worked with Deutsche Waffen-und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) to develop a Luger pistol-carbine for German Army artillery units. The Luger had been around for several years prior to the German Army's adoption of the P08 and, in fact, long-barreled versions had been available in the South American market since 1900. The Imperial German Navy even beat the German Army to the punch with the adoption of their pistol-carbine, the Selbstladepistolen 04 in 1904. Captain Fischer was able to use these designs as a starting point in the development of a pistol-carbine for artillery use. Within a short period of time, Captain Fischer and his team from DWM settled on the standard Luger frame with an 8-inch barrel and an adjustable rear sight calibrated out to 800 meters with a shoulder stock and holster. These first Army qualification trial pistols were made by DWM between 1912 and 1913 and totaled only about 50 pistols. These early weapons had a prototype stock similar to the shoulder stock used on the C96, wherein the pistol itself could be stored. This stock was not retained for the final, accepted version. Ultimately, the design was finalized and the Kaiser himself, Wilhelm II, approved what became the Lange Pistole 08 on June 3, 1913. But because the new weapon was initially developed for Imperial German Artillery units, it has been commonly called the Artillery Luger ever since even though its more technical name is simply Long Pistol 08. After the new weapon was accepted, production was assigned to DWM and to the Royal Arsenal at Erfurt. Erfurt only produced the new Artillery Luger for one year, 1914. DWM, on the other hand, produced the Artillery Luger from 1914 until the end of WWI in 1918. While the German Army's artillery units were the first units to receive the new Lange Pistole or Long Pistol 08, other units quickly adopted it such as the Sturmtruppen, Imperial Navy boat units and new Imperial German aviation units. The Sturmtruppen or Storm Troop units capitalized on the relatively greater accuracy and muzzle velocity caused by the longer barrel, as well as the Trommelmagazine or snail drum magazine that carried 32 rounds to engage in trench raids, and obtained as many of these weapons as they could get their hands on. The Artillery Lugers became very popular with all sorts of Imperial Army soldiers and they found their way into the hands of Infantry, Engineer, Machine Gun and other units during the war as well. The longer barrel of the Artillery Luger, coupled possibly with the very aggressive use of these weapons in the trenches by the Sturmtruppen, gave the weapon a sinister reputation. This reputation, led at the conclusion of hostilities, to the Artillery Luger being specifically banned by the Versailles Treaty from being produced or issued again by German forces. This ban led to a great many of the Artillery Lugers being confiscated and destroyed after WWI. Many others were reworked and had a shorter barrel installed. This has led to the great scarcity of these weapons today.This particular DWM pistol is in excellent condition with 90 % plus original finish intact. The bore is shiny with strong rifling. It retains the original 8 inch barrel. The Chamber Date is crisply marked ""1917,"" and the face of the chamber is very clean. The Ejector retains 75% of its straw finish and the spring is still very strong. The right side of the Frame has all of the correct proof marks crisply marked. The reciever, sear bar,side plate,  rear toggle link, trigger, extractor and magazine are all matching numbered. The pistol appears to be all matching numbers gun.The Rear Sight with Fine-Tune Adjustment screw and sight leaf marked in increments up to 800 meters has all matching numbers including the Elevation Slide, the Rear Sight Fixed Base, the Elevation Leaf (which is correctly polished in the white) and the Rear Windage Adjustable Aperture, all with """" stamped on them. The Slide and Binding Button operate and slide smoothly and there is no play in the leaf when fully elevated. The Rear Sight Assembly is in fine condition and retains 95% of its blued finish.The Magazine is a correct WWI wrap-around, tin-plated magazine with the correct wood base with correct matching numbers. Grip straps show some blueing loss and a silvering patina.This is a rare and fine condition WWI DWM Artillery Luger from 1917 that functions perfectly. I have test fired this pistol and she loaded, fired, ejected and recycled perfectly.

There is an area on the right side of the barrel pretty close to the muzzle where the blue is worn off. It's small but it is visible - see second photo, above the reflection of the light, the spot near the sight. The gun is otherwise pristine. It shoots fine. The rifling in the barrel looks good. I don't know the gun's history, but it looks to me like it time-traveled in a safe and hasn't been shot or handled all that much. If not for that one area of worn blueing, it would look almost new (the cylinder does have a normal drag line).Be aware of the features of a Lawman Mk III before contacting me, it's easy to look up. If the ad is up, it's still available. My ""lowest price I'll take"" is what I listed, if you want to make an offer, go ahead. I will negotiate with you but I'm not going to negotiate with myself."
