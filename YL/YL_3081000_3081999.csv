Action - Schmidt-Rubin Straight Pull 
Caliber - 7.5x55 Swiss (GP11) 
Capacity - 6 round detachable box magazine 
Sights - Tangent-leaf sight graduated to 2000m 
Total Production : 135,770 
Bayonet: Models 1889,1899 & 1906 

As early as 1903 there discussion about the adoption of a lighter, easier to handle rifle, with increased velocity cartridges. It had been determined that there were severe ballistic shortcomings to the 89/96 action /GP90 cartridge combination. In late 1907, the Swiss Rifle Commission gave permission to Waffenfabrik Bern to create 200 rifles for testing purposes. The rifle were built with the following configurations:

fifty rifles with 1889/96 Barrels firing GP90 cartridges, 
fifty rifles with 1889/96 Barrels firing GP90 cartridges, and re-milled cartridge chamber, fifty rifles with 1889/96 Barrels and new cartridges and re-milled cartridge chamber, 
fifty rifles with new barrels and new cartridges

Other modifications included the removal of the magazine cut-off, improved sights, and an integral rifle rest. While the integral rifle rest was discarded as superfluous, the testing otherwise proved successful.. This led to the authorization of the creation of 900 Rifles and 100 Carbines, for the purposed of testing the new GP08 (later redesignated GP11) cartridge. The 1908 Rifles and Carbines were fitted with Model 1889/1900 style 6 round magazines, and improved sights. The 1908s also had several unique features, not found in other Schmidt-Rubin models. The locking lug sleeve of the 1908’s bolt had three circular holes, presumably for weight savings purposes. In addition, the relief cuts on the top of 1908s receiver were of different length, with the longer cut set along the center of the receiver, with the shorter cut off to the side. On all other Schmidt-Rubins, the relief cuts were of equal length, and both cuts were equally offset from the centerline of the receiver.

By around 1907, the Swiss knew the old GP90 cartridge was inferior to those being adopted by their neighbors. So they started testing a new round. They built the 1908 series for this purpose. The 1908 has some unique feature, not seen in other Schmidt-Rubins, including three holes in the bolt. Testing showed the VGP08 cartridge produced significantly better results than the GP90 cartridge. Consequently, the VGP08 cartridge was adopted as the GP11 cartridge.

It was determined that the 89/96 could easily be converted (Model 1889s could not) to handle the new cartridge by re-barreling the rifle.

1889/96s were converted to 1896.11s buy replacing or modifying the following:

A new barrel was added. 
Already fitted the the barrel were new front and rear sights.
A pistol grip was grafted onto the stock of the rifle.
The new rifles were also fitted with 6rd magazines, similar to the 1889/1900 pattern magazine, minus the reinforcing ridge, although the magazine did include a bolt hold-open feature for when the magazine was empty.
A new trigger-guard was fitted to accommodate the new magazine. 

However, it took several years for all the 89/96s to be converted to 96/11 and 1911 Rifle production continued until 1918. Rather than leave large numbers of troops unarmed while the rifles were shipped off for conversion, they were re-issued Model 1889s. (Troops with Model 89/00 Short Rifles and 05 Carbines were re-issued 1893 Carbines).

Swiss soldiers are roughly classified into two categories, elite and reserve. Elites are under the age of 30, reserves are over the age of 30. Any trooper reaching reserve status, whom had a 89/96 during the changeover period was issued a Model 1889, and kept it for the remaining term of his service. Raw recruits, were issued Model 1889s as well at this point in time, and were later issued 96/11s or 1911s.

The various Canton Arsenals were given different priorities regarding when they were re-equipped. However, I'm not sure what those priorities were."

This gun is as close as you can get to the Mark 23 without paying $2000.  It features a Match grade trigger with an adjustable trigger stop, high profile adjustable target sights for windage/elevation, a threaded barrel for a suppressor, the o-ring barrel, and HK's ""Hostile Environment"" blued finish among other features.

This particular gun is in great working condition.  The slide looks fantastic.  No scratches or dings on the slide and does not look like it has been holstered.  The threading on the barrel is untouched, as far as I can tell.  The only condition issue are as seen in one of the pictures on the back of the polymer grip where it looks like someone gouged the bottom of the grip a bit.  Needless to say, that does not affect the precision or functionality of the gun and is purely cosmetic.  Besides those cosmetic issues on the back of the grip, the gun is in good overall condition.

I also have available an optional original Eagle Industries black tactical case.  When Eagle Industries stopped making these cases for Heckler and Koch, the prices skyrocketed on them.  For a period of time, these were the standard issue cases for all Tactical's and Mk23 pistols.  Currently, this case alone sells for between $100-150 (this is not the cheaper aftermarket cases being made and sold now).  The case is in good overall condition with light signs of use but I believe is missing the suppressor pouch. Other than that, it is a great useable example of these cases.

The pistol comes with 1 ten round magazine with an upgraded magazine spring - a Wolff +10 spring!

The price shown is for the pistol and magazine only.  If you're interested in the Eagle Industries case, I can include that for an additional $100.  As it is, under $800 for a USP Tactical in this good of condition is a steal.

Feel free to call, text, or email.  Nine 20- Four70-1275.  I prefer a local CC permit holder sale in the Appleton area.  

Thanks for looking.

Quality AK 47 & 74's are also something I'm looking for. Just let me know what you have and we can go from there.  The only hunting rifles I will consider are quality setups in 25-06, .260 and .270. I may also consider a nice O/U shotgun. If you have any questions or something else that might grab my attention please let me know. You can text 903-272-05one4 or respond to the ad. I also have 320rds of .45 ammo that I can add for the right deal. Thanks for looking.

Glocks are like McDonald's cheeseburgers. It doesn't matter if you add extra ketchup and another razor-thin pickle slice, it's still a 99 cent cheeseburger. I knew the G19 was not an heirloom-quality firearm when I bought it (although I'm sure that it will last that long). So, in spite of the fact that it has VERY COOL, precision, after-market sights, and a VERY NICE Ghost 3.5 lb connector and spring upgrade, AND I can punch out 3-inch groups at 15 yards (and yes, I know you can do better!) I have come to the realization that you, my friends, DON'T CARE! Well, maybe you care a just little bit. So in light of my enlightenment, I will offer to you one slightly used cheeseburger (G19 Gen4) with the following:

Glock 19 Gen4, Ghost 3.5 trigger and spring upgrade and Speed sights (www.speedsights.com). 

This G19 was purchased in December 2013 from a local retailer and was used as a range gun. It includes 3 15-round mags, 4 backstraps, case and docs as purchased. Approximately 500 rounds fired. It is in excellent condition.

Lastly, I DO NOT NEED TO SELL THIS. I would *like* to sell it to add cash to the kitty for the next project. I am firm on the price and if it does not sell, so be it!

Addendum:
Note that I live on the Kitsap peninsula. I am willing to meet on my side of the water 
near the ferry terminals, or as far south as Gorst. If you don't know where Gorst is, GOOD FOR YOU!

Shows your normal CZ82 surplus finish wear, but mechanically perfect. New Wolff 16lb recoil spring. Comes with unused 14.5lb (factory weight) and 18lb springs. New firing pin spring plus spares included. New CZ factory grips installed.

Comes with three 12 round factory magazines, as well as about 48 rounds of Hornady FTX in 9mm Mak. This was my carry round of choice, and it feeds and functions in this 82 just fine. Also comes with a Gould and Goodrich OWB holster that conceals nicely.

A great, reliable, durable and highly accurate pistol. Excellent trigger. I'm selling it because it's the only pistol I have chambered in 9mm Mak, and I just can't justify feeding it when I need other calibers more. 

Priced very fairly at 300.00.

I have 250 rounds of steel case 9mm Mak FMJ I will sell to the buyer for an additional $50.00 if interested. That's .20 cents a round."

This rifle is import stamped.  It has also been recrowned--but this typically helps accuracy.  I have no doubt this has been arsenal refurbished at some point as a result, but I cannot say for sure one way or the other.  The bore looks very good, and the stock has the dings and what not you'd expect from a rifle like this.  Good shape though."

""The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. The P239 is available in three calibers – 9mm, .357SIG or .40S&W – offering you the choice that’s right for you.""

•	I HAVE ALL ORIGINAL RECEIPTS for all original equipment and extras you’re welcome to have. (I purchased new)
•	THIS PISTOL IS EXTREMELY ACCURATE AND RELIABLE. It even shoots/feeds semi-wad cutters with never a problem.
•	THIS PISTOLS DESIGN AND CUSTOM WORK is setup for Competition, but it’s not so “over the top” that it can’t function easily for target or self defense weapon too, especially being its frame is also railed. If the mag well is too big for your needs... just take it off. Everything then ""looks"" the same... as if it was just stock. It's a hotrod under the hood.

This rifle is an older PTR clone that runs excellently and eats any type of ammunition that you can throw at it. It is not plagues with some of the issues that the later rifles had, and has been upgraded pretty extensively as well. 

I have the G3-A3 paratrooper stock with a heavy buffer along with the standard HK fixed stock with the standard buffer. It also sports the very sought after HK 'fat' handgaurds with the BI-pod mount and cut outs. Also has the H&K navy grip/trigger housing. 

As for upgrades, this rifle sports the 18.5in Wilson heavy match barrel with an A2 style flash hider, this barrel has the proper mil-spec chamber flutes cut to the proper depth. This means that this gun will run any surplus or tar sealed ammunition that would cause many of the other clones to choke up. This gun delivers 3/4 MOA groups at 100 yards using federal gold match .308 and excellent accuracy even with military ball (1 1/4 MOA) 

The internals have been upgraded to Rheinmetall components including the one piece bolt carrier assembly with the tungsten strike plate and the bolt head. It has standard rollers in it and the bolt gap is .014 which is right in the optimal range (.010-.018). 

It also has a Stanag quick release claw mount with a redfield (made by Leupold) 3x9x40 scope that is sighted in
13 magazines, 10 steel and 3 aluminum G3 magazines. 

For the right offer I have about 400 rounds of 7.62x51 ammunition along with almost everytnkng you would need to start reloading .308 along with a decent amount of brass and projectiles to get you started. 

There is a lot of time and money in this rifle, so please be serious in your offers and don't waste my time or yours with lowballs or junk offers. As for a cash value,  as I have received alot of emails asking what I value it at would be around $1,600. There is about $ 2,000 invested with ammo, optics, stocks and upgrades.

It is a Remington 700 action with a 26"" bull barrel cambered in 7mm-08. The 7mm-08 is a cartridge born from the 308 necked down to .284. There are a few great advantages to this the bullets used will have a higher BC( ballistic coefficient ). Which means the bullet flies farther, straighter, truer, greater velocity, high energy, and less recoil. It is ballistically far superior to the .308. I was able to shoot 3/4 moa with un-tuned loads very easily this is a 1/2 moa gun at 100 yards easily. It is set in a bell and Carlson A5 completely adjustable stock comb height, length of pull, and cant. Red hawk also installed a badger ordinance enlarged bolt knob, a talley 20 moa picatinny scope mount, lapped the bolt lugs, and tuned the trigger. This action is slick has been well taken care has only had 200 down the pipe. It comes with 1lb of imr4350, 40 rds of ammo, a set of RCBS dies, and assorted bullets"

additional mags available (4) for $15 ea. with pistol purchase - sorry no pics but it's black and looks like a Glock. You've prolly seen one or two.


CZ-85 Combat model -  Like the CZ-75 except The rare CZ 85 Combat adds a fully adjustable rear sight, extended magazine release, drop-free magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. The Combat designation comes from the lack of a firing pin block safety, allowing the replacement of the firing pin without tools. 

Ambidextrous features include safety levers, slide stop levers and a reversible magazine release. The lack of a firing pin safety gives the 85 Combat a slight advantage in the trigger pull department, making it a long-time favorite of competition shooters. 

This pistol has an amazing crisp 3 lb. trigger and will outshoot just about any 9mm pistol you'll find in this price range. I've added a fiber optic front sight (currently green) and you'll also get 7 magazines, a Safariland competition mag pouch, custom Kydex holster, and a bag full of extra parts, springs, etc.  Pistol can be converted to S/A only (pic 1) with the included parts or can be run as a DA/SA or carried cocked & locked with this trigger (pic 2).  

The CZ-85 Combat trigger is the one most guys buy from the CZ custom shop because it has the shortest reach. The hammer and sear have been tuned to provide a light no-creep crisp trigger.  This pistol is all steel and makes shooting 9mm ammo a pleasure. 

Package deal for everything CZ - $600.

Need ammo? - Federal, Remington, Winchester, PMC, S&B, and more brass cased 9mm ammo - $15. box or $280. per 1K rd. case (save $20.) (about 4K available)
Tulammo - $12. box (about 2600 rds available) - wanna sell pistols first and give buyers ammo purchase option before selling ammo only to interested buyers - but text me your name & number and I'll start a list if all the ammo doesn't go with the pistols - thanks
