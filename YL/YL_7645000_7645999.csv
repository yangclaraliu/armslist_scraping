It was wartime and the United States stood divided. During a period of rapid industrial innovation, the firearms industry was one of the hottest. The war drove a huge market and many different makers, designs and patents appeared in a very short amount of time. Some of Colt’s most coveted patents expired in 1857, opening opportunity, but Smith & Wesson purchased the Rollin White Patent in the late 1850s, enabling them to control the market on what virtually became the “modern” revolver. Overall condition is good. The metal surfaces are dark with age. The grips are in good condition. The bore is well-rifled. The action is strong.Own the original! This is a legitimate antique and not a reproduction. Very Fast.

There are really no distinctive markings as to who the original manufacture was as they have been removed some time in the past. I have shot it on various occasions and havent had any issues.

This big service pistol is the spitting image of the Beretta Model 92FS (with a few improvements) and sells for $100 to $150 less than the glamorous Italian’s price tag. Cheap is good, but only when it’s actually ‘good.’ In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols. Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked and locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever."

This magazine is dated 06/16/17 meaning that it was manufactured on 17 JUN 2016… Two years after Surefire Identified and fixed the feeding issue they were experiencing with some of these magazines… The problem was pinpointed insult well before this magazine was ever born. It is as reliable as any standard 30 round magazine and MORE reliable than the GI ones I was supplied for my M4 with the tan (singlenaprong) follower. Each round free it’s exactly the same… And feels exactly the same… From the first round to the 60th one. And very easy to load... no more presssure required than when loading the standard 30 rounder. Again there are no feeding issues whatsoever with this magazine… You can safely trust you I flipped it… No need for dry lubricant graphite as needed with drum magazines. Just load it and go. The occasional cleaning (as suggested with any magazine is all that’s required). That’s it.Currently priced at $134 at Brownell’s.com and $129 plus shipping at Midway USA.com - scratch that MidWay just ran out of stock … Essentially $135-$140 each  from the cheapest places online.

Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. In addition, the gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, limiting the amount of gas escaping and maximizing the amount of propellent gases inside the barrel. Effectively, the maximization of gases in the barrel increases the velocity as much as possible within the respective barrel length. The longer the barrel, the higher the velocity and accuracy. This Python’s bore looks like it left the factory yesterday and as such, its accuracy should be phenomenal. The bluing is 99-100 percent. The action is as crisp as you would expect a Python to be and timing is perfect."
