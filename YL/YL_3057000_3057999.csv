Since 1919, O.F. Mossberg & Sons has produced weapons that all levels of gun users – including novices – continue to operate today. In fact, Mossberg was the first long-gun manufacturer in the U.S. to achieve ISO 9001 certification, which sets the standard on manufacturing and quality control procedures. The Mossberg 500, which was first produced in 1961, continues to be one of its most popular shotguns for sale on the market, and it’s currently used by the United States and allied armed forces, as well as by police and civilian gun owners. The Mossberg 500 also makes for an excellent field weapon, and is often used as a trap and skeet gun.

This isn’t a CZ75, but it’s awfully close. Where the CZ75 is all steel and pretty heavy, This L120’s alloy frame renders the gross vehicle weight down from the CZ’s 34 ounces, to 28 ounces empty. Turkish guns are here to stay, and this one is remarkably well executed. It will be a strong, perhaps even fatal, competitor to EAA’s Witness series, because the Witnesses we’ve had will not accept CZ75 magazines. Its price competition to both Baby Eagles and parent CZs themselves will at least make ripples in the market. Design, of course, descends from John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Manufacturer is Samsun Yurt Savunma Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., simply SYS, of Canik, or Janik, Republic of Turkey. Importer is Tri Star of North KC, MO. Type is traditional single and double action blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts all on a lightweight alloy frame. Barrel is 4 1/2 inch 6 groove, with pressed in barrel bushing. Slide to frame fit is excellent, with full contact rail that runs the length of the frame. Sights are classic CZ style three dot configuration, dovetailed rear sight and rivet secured modified partridge front, 6 1/2 inch sight radius with serrated rib on the slide. Hammer is .212 serrated skeleton Commander type, with .312 smooth face combat trigger. Double action pull is hitchy from a resting hammer, but smooth and consistent from the half cock position. Single action pull on the photo specimen measured 6 pounds with moderate felt creep. This pistol has a firing pin safety and main safety for right handed shooters. Lever safety will engage in all three hammer positions: full rest, half cock, and fully cocked for secure carry and single action cocked-and-locked readiness. Trigger guard configuration is SP01 type square serrated front face, and the grip frame is serrated fore and aft. Grip panels are hard grainy polymer with the T Tri Star logo. Magazines furnished are Mec-Gar CZ7517B, not catalogued but produced for Tri-Star exclusively in a bright blue finish. This is an excellent pistol. Fit and finish are excellent. Similar pistols from the parent CZ manufacturer command pricing upwards of $700 apiece. While we expect substantial price increases, we’re nevertheless offering the Tri Star / Canik 55 L120 in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 319.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, Maryland, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 17 round magazines are restricted, we will sub 10 round Baby Eagle [or used 15 round CZ75] magazines for $10 per mag extra, $20 extra for 2 mag sub, or $30 off with no magazines.

This isn’t a CZ75, but it’s awfully close. Where the CZ75 is all steel and pretty heavy, This L120’s alloy frame renders the gross vehicle weight down from the CZ’s 34 ounces, to 28 ounces empty. Turkish guns are here to stay, and this one is remarkably well executed. It will be a strong, perhaps even fatal, competitor to EAA’s Witness series, because the Witnesses we’ve had will not accept CZ75 magazines. Its price competition to both Baby Eagles and parent CZs themselves will at least make ripples in the market. Design, of course, descends from John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Manufacturer is Samsun Yurt Savunma Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., simply SYS, of Canik, or Janik, Republic of Turkey. Importer is Tri Star of North KC, MO. Type is traditional single and double action blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts all on a lightweight alloy frame. Finish is attractive, durable Hard Chrome. Barrel is 4 1/2 inch 6 groove, with pressed in barrel bushing. Slide to frame fit is excellent, with full contact rail that runs the length of the frame. Sights are classic CZ style three dot configuration, dovetailed rear sight and rivet secured modified partridge front, 6 1/2 inch sight radius with serrated rib on the slide. Hammer is .212 serrated skeleton Commander type, with .312 smooth face combat trigger. Double action pull is hitchy from a resting hammer, but smooth and consistent from the half cock position. Single action pull on the photo specimen measured 6 pounds with moderate felt creep. This pistol has a firing pin safety and main safety for right handed shooters. Lever safety will engage in all three hammer positions: full rest, half cock, and fully cocked for secure carry and single action cocked-and-locked readiness. Trigger guard configuration is SP01 type square serrated front face, and the grip frame is serrated fore and aft. Grip panels are hard grainy polymer with the T Tri Star logo. Magazines furnished are Mec-Gar CZ7517B, not catalogued but produced for Tri-Star exclusively in a bright blue finish. This is an excellent pistol. Fit and finish are excellent. Similar pistols from the parent CZ manufacturer command pricing upwards of $700 apiece. While we expect substantial price increases, we’re nevertheless offering the Tri Star / Canik 55 L120 in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 359.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, Maryland, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 17 round magazines are restricted, we will sub 10 round Baby Eagle [or used 15 round CZ75] magazines for $10 per mag extra, $20 extra for 2 mag sub, or $30 off with no magazines. Affected jurisdictions include Aurora IL, Chicago Cook County IL, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and South Bend, IN.

This isn’t a CZ75 Compact. Where the CZ75 is all steel and pretty heavy, This T100’s alloy frame renders the gross vehicle weight down from a full size CZ’s 34 ounces, to 25 3/8 ounces empty. Turkish guns are here to stay, and this one is remarkably well executed. It will be a strong, perhaps even fatal, competitor to EAA’s Witness series, because the Witnesses we’ve had will not accept CZ75 magazines. Its price competition to both Baby Eagles and parent CZs themselves will at least make ripples in the market. Design, of course, descends from John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Manufacturer is Samsun Yurt Savunma Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., simply SYS, of Canik, or Janik, Republic of Turkey. Importer is Tri Star of North KC, MO. Type is traditional single and double action blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts all on a lightweight alloy frame. Finish is Hard Chrome, very much like a Satin Nickel finish. Barrel is 3 7/8 inch 6 groove, with full length steel guide rod and pressed in barrel bushing. Slide to frame fit is excellent, with full contact rail that runs the length of the frame. Sights are Italian LPA combat three dot configuration, dovetailed rear sight and rivet secured modified partridge front, 5 1/4 inch sight radius with serrated rib on the slide. Hammer is .212 black matte steel serrated skeleton Commander type, with .312 smooth face matching combat trigger. Double action pull is hitchy from a resting hammer, but smooth and consistent from the half cock position. Single action pull on the photo specimen measured 6 pounds with moderate felt creep. This pistol has a firing pin safety and main safety for right handed shooters. Lever safety will engage in all three hammer positions: full rest, half cock, and fully cocked for secure carry and single action cocked-and-locked readiness. Trigger guard configuration is SP01 type square serrated front face, and the grip frame is serrated fore and aft. Grip panels are hard grainy polymer with the T Tri Star logo. Magazines furnished are Mec-Gar CZ7515B, not catalogued but produced for Tri-Star exclusively in a bright blue finish. This is an excellent pistol. Fit and finish are excellent. Similar pistols from the parent CZ manufacturer command pricing upwards of $700 apiece. While we expect substantial price increases, we’re nevertheless offering the Tri Star / Canik 55 T100 in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 369.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, Maryland, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 15 round magazines are restricted, we will sub 10 round Baby Eagle Compact magazines for $10 per mag extra, $20 extra for 2 mag sub, or $30 off with no magazines. Affected jurisdictions include Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, Hawaii, and New York.

All numbers matching. Not many of these mak-90's made it through with the pistol grip and underfolder. I have owned this gun for over 10 years and have only shot in once, fired 1 30 round mag through it. It is like new in near perfect condition. Has nickel played bolt & carrier and trigger group. Has the thicker 1.5 mm receiver. This is nothing like the wasr underfolders or pretty much any ak, the gun is blued vs being parkerized. Has factory muzzle break and threads(most of these had threads removed or welded because it was considered a evil feature from the ban). A lot of them had threads removed before they were able to be passed through customs. Has the polytech pistol grip and very nice wood. Has 2 Chinese factory 5 round mags and 2 factory Chinese 30 round mags(chrome springs and very rare & they are blued). The 30 rounders are hard to find and expensive. Has heavier cold hammer forged thicker barrel and real chrome lined barrel unlike the thin coated us ak barrels that are made very cheaply. If u know about this gun and mags u will know what I'm offering. Its the same thing as the type 56-1 minus the bayonet lug. I thought about putting a type 56 bayonet lug on it. I found them for $30. 

Asking $1000 Obo. Cash only might take partial trade from a run of the mil 1911. Nothing to nice please. I also have 60 rounds of silver box pre ban norinco ammo im letting go with the gun.

If you were looking specifically for this gun, then you already know what it is and I don't have to talk it up.  Bought this new in 2005 locally. In very good condition, with two slight marks from occasional carry. All stock from the factory, haven't changed a thing on it. Just a light cleaning and lube after a couple of range days.   Estimated 400 to 450 rounds through it.  

Everything included that came from the factory. Includes the gun, tupperwear box, factory box, manual, lock, mag loader, and pick/tool.   Also includes a total of 4 high cap mags (2 with pinky finger bit and 2 with flat metal baseplates).   

This gun has never given me a FTE or FTF on any type of ammo I've ever fed it.  Completely reliable, incredibly easy to point, and very comfortable in the hand.  These are hard to find and cheapest I can find locally (in stock) is $627+tax, which only includes 2 mags.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9.The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Product Information, Features, and Specifications:

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

This listing is for One grip assembly. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-grip price and with no additional shipping charges. Here are factory Smith & Wesson replacement grips to fit sub compact single stacked metal frame Smith & Wesson Third Generation Compact Pistols chambered in 9mm caliber. Models included are 3913, 3914, 3953, 908, and 908S. Manufacturer is Smith & Wesson of Springfield, Massachusetts; construction is high impact polymer, one piece. These grips will Not fit full sized models 3906, or a 6906, or a 1947 John Deere Manure Spreader Dump Lever. These came to us from a Smith & Wesson Bulk Parts shipment and have never been individually packaged. They were never put on a pistol, either; the St. George’s Maryland model 3953 showing in some of our photos is simply for illustration. These are relatively easy to install, simply by removing the Hogue Grips’s Screws or by pushing out the original retaining pin, and a pin will be required and that is not something that we stock, for any buyers who want to replace their Hogues. The Hogue screws will Not work on these. We’re offering these new and unissued factory Smith & Wesson grips, one of the specimens in the photos or its identical mates, each for only $ 35.00.

12g includes the full setup including large and small containers for shot/powder (not the 2 small ones in the picture), primer drop and catch tray, upgraded this model to the newer clip-on pre-crimps (includes both 6 and 8 point) as a 1 1/8oz charge bar. Has the original steel crimp (and I believe I still have the older metal pre-crimp too, just can find it right now) - can't get these anymore!
Also have 3 charge bushings I will include with it.

This unit does need a new resize collet as one wing broke on it - it does still work, but without the resizing function (about $50.00 from MEC)

I have switched out the factory 3 dot Tritium night sights with XS Sight Systems Big Dot Express Tritium night sights. The old night sights are included so if you want to switch back you can.
I also replaced the factory guide rod with a 3 piece Wolff guide rod and plug set. Plus I have an extra Wolff firing pin spring that is factory standard. The current spring is fine was just getting an extra for the future.
I also had 2 extra sets of grips made by Tillanders Custom Grips. So you have 3 sets of grips to switch between. One is the factory black one is wood colored and the last one is black with grey streaks. 

This pistol was made to be a concealed carry gun which is a role it fits perfect. I have too many 9mm so I need room in my safe which is why I'm letting this pistol go. It is in perfect condition fired very little and was never carried. Asking $625 no trades please. Only sell to CCW or permit to purchase."

Beretta CX4 Storm 8045 .45 acp Carbine w/ 16.6″ Barrel, Two 8rd Magazines, Top and Bottom Accessory Rail – JX48520

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

The CX4 Storm 8045 Carbine includes Two .45 acp 8-round magazines. The barrel is 16.6″ and has a black synthetic CX4 stock.

Models included are 4506 4566 4576 4586 and the same numbered TSW Variants; and 1006, 1066, and 1086 - so long as the pistol has a full size grip frame and 8 shot magazine capacity for .45 ACP or 9 shot for 10mm caliber. Manufacturer is Smith & Wesson of Springfield, Massachusetts; construction is high impact polymer, one piece. These grips will Not fit compact models 4516, 4513, 4013, 457, or a Colt 1911, or a 1959 Edsel Gear Shift Lever. These came to us from a Smith & Wesson Bulk Parts shipment and have never been individually packaged. They were never put on a pistol, either; the 4506 grip frame showing has one that we put on it. This is the Curved variant, curved backstrap area that contains the Pistol’s Mainspring. These are relatively easy to install, simply by removing the Hogue Grips’s Screws or by pushing out the original retaining pin, and a pin will be required and that is not something that we stock, for any buyers who want to replace their Hogues. The Hogue screws will Not work on these. We’re offering these new and unissued factory Smith & Wesson grips, one of the specimens in the photos or its identical mates, each for only $ 35.00.

Springfield Armory SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

I have my eyes set on something, I am dropping the cash price to $675 from $815 for this week only.  Contact me quick if you are interested, it wont be around long.

I have only put one box of high quality ammo through this rifle (20 Rounds), four shots to sight it in the rest were play.  If you haven't looked much into this round you should. It is a joy to shoot, and could make quick work of any small game/varmint. The heavy (40/45gr) rounds travel at 3900+ FPS, and the lighter (30/35gr) rounds travel above 4150 FPS.  This leads to extremely flat, predictable, and accurate travel.  This is one of the easiest rifles to shoot accurately out to 400+ yards.  After that wind starts to take greater effect on the light weight round.  In my honest opinion there is no better rifle for coyotes and the like.  Also great for fun at the range, the ammo is usually stocked at BassPro and it is pretty inexpensive.

I purchased this rifle new for $815+tax, then the Nikon for $189, and the rings for $90.  The Bipod I have had for about a year, but it is in great shape and does everything you would want and more. I've got right at $1200 into the setup, it is like new.  

The Nikon is 3-9x40, perfect for this round and its range capability.  Extremely clear view, and good sight picture. 

I am looking into getting a high capacity 9mm (XDM 5.25, or CZ P09.) and I would like to sell this to purchase that and ammo.  Those two firearms are about all I am interested in trade wise, but feel free to offer up other high quality hand guns and cash.

Here are long discontinued Factory Grips for two and only two very popular variants of the Smith & Wesson Mini Series 9mm Compact Pistols, models 469 and 669. Manufacturer was Smith & Wesson of Springfield, MA. We have arbitrarily assigned an educated guess as to these grips’s sku; the checkered finish variants were 165390000, so we put 165380000 on these. Construction is molded hard black polymer. Finish is stippled or pebbled type, perhaps not as good looking as the checkered ones, but surer gripping. Factory logo is molded into the upper portion of each panel, as the photos show. The Smith & Wesson model 469 was manufactured from 1983 until 1988; and its companion stainless 669 only from 1985 until 1988. These grips will not fit any other pistol besides a Smith & Wesson model 469 or model 669, chambered in 9mm. Installation requires removal of the mainspring housing off the back of the grip frame, careful insertion, and reinstallation of the housing. Thanks to Mr. Lawrence Furlette for his 2010 you tube video of the process, that one’s easy to find. If you’re not sure how to do it, don’t be a dumbkopf like our photographer, who once broke the grip frame of a 6946 forcing its housing pin back into place. Watch Mr. Furlette’s video. These grips are not easy to find. We have never had more than 20 pair at one time, ever. These are long discontinued. As the old song goes, that’s all there is and there ain’t no more. We’re offering the grips in the photos, or their identical mates from the same batch, each pair for only $ 49.00.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

I have SIX of these in stock, and have them priced to sell for only $325.00 each (cash price).


Ruger 11112 10/22 Takedown .22lr Rifle, Threaded Barrel with Flash Suppressor, Black Synthetic Stock, Blued Finish, 10-Round Magazine

Readily separated into two halves, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate as every Ruger 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy.
The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly.

Despite the ease of assembly and reassembly, the lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero – even when receiver mounted optics are used. 
The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachments points for the padded, single-shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

The 4.67 pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37” long when assembled; each half is less than 20-1/4” when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action, and provided with one ten-round rotary magazine, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a new compact and portable package.

1911R-45-TACOPS DESCRIPTION BELOW

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

1911R-45-TACOPS DESCRIPTION BELOW

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

The 3 bayonets date back to WW2 or just post WW2.  I believe the MK2 KaBar is also from that period but I cannot say for sure, and I am uncertain of the Camillus's age.  

Os so here we go:

The top knife is a very well used Camillus fighting knife.  Stamped US and Camillus underneath.

Underneath is another fighting knife.  Stamped KaBar on one side of the hilt, and MK2 on the other.  Comes in a leather sheath.  Based on what I could find about MK2 knives I believe this to be WW2 era.

M4 Bayonet with sheath marked USM4 PAL.  If you look up the markings these are quite rare and go for quite a bit of money.  This one is in good condition and comes with it's sheath.

M4 Bayonet with sheath marked Kiffe Japan.  This is another somewhat rare bayonet, as it was made for the M1 but was not issued to US troops.  Again a quick search will turn up that these go for a good chunk of change and are collectable.  This one again is in good condition with its sheath.

The last bayonet is an M5 marked USM5 Imperial.  I believe this one dates to sometime in the 50's but I am not certain.  Bayonet is in good shape, comes with the sheath.  

Any questions feel free to ask.  Armslist only allows me to put up 3 pics, if you want a pic of anything specific just let me know.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

1911R-45-TACOPS DESCRIPTION BELOW

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.
