I'll get straight to the point: These are USGI M1 Carbine magazines. They aren't in the best of condition cosmetically. When I got them, the bluing was pretty much nonexistent. They are pitted from rusting. I did not alter the magazines in any way except for wiping them down with oil. They do function beautifully however. Me and my father ran the magazines through our M1s and we had no failures of any kind. There seems to be no bends in the bodies or feed lips, however on a couple of them there are some slight bends on the front of the floor plate. This can be easily fixed with a flat surface and a few taps with a hammer, as I have had to do that to a couple of my carbine magazines before. These magazines would be ideal for shooters, or if one wanted to, they could clean them up as much as they could. The manufacturer markings are written on the little pieces of paper directly below each magazine. I am asking $20 a piece for each magazine, or $80 full sale. If one decides to purchase all of them for $80 or best offer, I will also include two stripper clips with guides for .30 carbine ammunition, and three rubber magazine covers. The covers will need to be stretched to fit as they are NOS. The stripper clip guides are in functional order. I accept payments by cash FTF or USPS MOs. 
 
If you are having trouble reading the paper (sorry in advance!), the magazine markings are as follows (in no particular order):UN, UQ, U, BW, SW, IA, SLThanks for looking!"

Has a 20 in bull barrel and adjustable trigger, im not sure of the lbs but its light and very crisp.  Package now includes what all you see. I've added an BSA 3x9 that isnt anything special but now its being included at the same price so cant beat free! also found a bit more ammo so now includes 50 rounds total of a random mix to get you started. includes bipod and plastic case as well.  have all the paperwork for the rifle but not the original box. stock has been painted and looks ok but is flaking in spots but paint can be easily removed if you like and i can even remove it before purchase if preferred  really just wanting to get into nfa so need some free money.  Will also look at 9mm glock packages, AR15's, aks in 7.62, possibly an lc9s plus cash. Maybe others so just feel free to offer.  will also look at some ar parts plus cash. im diong a retro build right now and need a lower, preferablly an anderson and parts kit, need an a1 grip, a c.a.r. stock kick and 6 hole carbine handguards"

Shipping costs vary with how much ammo is purchased but to give a ballpark number the estimate for an 8 pound package from here (Dekalb, Il, near Chicago) to Seattle is only $15. With less weight or less distance it will actually cost less. Wherever you ship, buying more boxes is more efficient per dollar spent shipping so help me sell this ammo quickly and buy a lot.
