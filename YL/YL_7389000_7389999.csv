The Benelli Nova® is an innovatively designed Pump-Action Shotgun made from hi-tech materials. The Nova is an ultra reliable, nearly indestructible pump shotgun that's ideal for all-round rugged use. This Nova is finished with the Realtree MAX-4® camo pattern, designed specifically for waterfowl hunting. Filled with cattails, swamp grasses, and cane, MAX-4 blends in with marshlands as well as corn stubble and other agricultural cropland. Benelli constructs the Nova with corrosion-proof polymer over-molded on a skeleton framework to form single-piece receiver and buttstock for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. The polymer forearm pushes a rotary-head bolt back with dual-action bars. Aggressive ribbing on the pistol grip and forearm provide a secure hold on the gun under any circumstances. A magazine disconnect button on the bottom of the forearm allows user to quickly unload the chamber without releasing another round from the magazine to quickly load another round via the ejection port in the event that a different shooting situation suddenly presents itself. The matte finished steel barrel features ventilated stepped rib with a mid bead and red-bar front sight. The Nova utilizes a magazine cap that doubles as a tool for pushing out the single pin that holds the trigger assembly in place, making fieldstripping fast and easy. The 12 gauge Nova has a 3-1/2"" chamber. The Benelli Nova Pump-Action Shotgun comes with 3 standard screw-in choke tubes (F, M, IC), and choke tool.Realtree MAX-4 finish matches waterfowl habitatInnovatively designed with hi-tech materials1-piece receiver and buttstockRotating bolt headDual-action barsMagazine disconnect buttonStepped vent rib barrelSimple fieldstripping"

Shoots .38 special or .357 magnum.This handgun is near perfect, but I cannot call it new, it has been fired six rounds, then put in the safe.I would have to say it is better than 98% condition. You have to see this handgun up close to believe it.Simply the best hand tuned action you will find on a revolver.Asking $3300 which is well below current blue book value.

But I didn't want the mag-tube sticking out all the way to the end (shorter ones handle better). The answer to this was the Nordic Components upgrades. -- I also wanted it to be 100% RELIABLE with low-recoil 00-Buck and low-recoil 000-Buck. I wanted to even be able to cycle reliable with low-recoil loads while not pulled fully into my shoulder. The answer to this was OR3GUN's products.MODIFICATIONS:1) Nordic Components -- MXT Shotgun Magazine Extension Kit +2 since the OEM extension is known to hang up. (cost $75.50)2) Nordic Components -- Shotgun Barrel Clamp with Tac Rail, since I wanted a place to mount a light (cost $52.74)3) OR3GUN upgrade kit -- I got the CSP/ASR Set - Competition (Polished), Marine Spacer Tube - Competition (Marine Blue), Competition Forearm Retainer - FIELD Fit (Pitch Black), the Enhanced Bolt Release - Tactile (Pitch Black), and the enhanced reliability follower. The CSP/ASR set and MST help it feed low-recoil with 100% accuracy, and everything else is just a nice upgrade. (cost $165.50)4) 8 nice dummy rounds ($15), installed a sight rail ($15), and a butt-stock shell holder ($10).5) I smoothed out and polished the edges of the carrier latch to a mirror finish (this makes it feed much more smoothly, and eliminates any chance of feeding issues).TOTAL SPENT -- $718.74 (plus $50-75 other stuff)...so I have over $750 in the gun making it as handy and reliable as possible. I've only shot 10rds of the lowest recoiling and lightest slugs I could find, and 25rds of birdshot through it. Everything cycled perfectly EVEN when I held the gun away from my body to see if it might short-stroke (limp-wrist)."

You’ll especially like the Glock trigger...it’s a sweet shooter and VERY accurate.This one comes in the original factory box with all paperwork and all other factory stuff (backstraps/beavertails, speed-loader, rod, brush), 4 factory mags, childproof lock w/two keys and a very nice kydex holster.  It also has a new set of TruGlo TFX Pro night sights (original factory sights also included) and Talon grips on it (easily removed if you don't like them).

However if I shop this to a FFL, I'll need a copy of their license and there WILL BE a $25 shipping fee since I'm going through a FFL to ship. I WILL NOT ship this to a C&R FFL and I ONLY TAKE postal money order, nothing else.   Finally if you're interested in this weapon, I require your to see your Indiana state issued id and your gun permit as well. Nothing will be recorded however for my convenience I still want to see them.

This is a 1988 Taurus model 66, 4 inch barrel, 6 shot, 357 magnum revolver. It is a hand cannon. The gun is chambered for 357, so it also shoots 38 special and 38 special +p without any problems. The gun is tight and operationally perfect. I literally picked it up on Friday, September 8th 2017 from the gunsmith where he applied a hot satin blue finish and installed a new firing pin. So the gun is good to go. It is missing the rear sight however as i just haven’t taken the time to get one for it. There is some pitting that the gun smith wasn’t able to remove before he blued it, but it does not effect the operation or safety of this gun in any way. This gun does come with a Folbus paddle holster as well. This particular gun is very well known as one of Taurus best revolvers. I highly encourage you to look it up for yourself. I am in Maryville and will only meet in Maryville due to transportation complications. Must be willing to sign a non- invasive bill of sale for both of our records and safety. By non invasive, I mean we both sigh our names and DL numbers and what we each traded to the other along with the date. Nothing more needed. Thank you."
