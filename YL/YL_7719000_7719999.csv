Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/cold-steel-viking-axe-89va-52-overall-hickory-handle/ Description The Cold Steel Viking Axe’s long blade is not a wood chopping tool, but rather it is a thin, fully polished and hand sharpened combative – style blade with a sharp edge that would be easily at home on a custom bowie knife! Its 10″ wide cutting surface terminates in two sharp “horns”. Traditionally, the longer top point was used for stabbing or parrying, while the slightly shorter bottom point was used by the Vikings to hook an opponent’s shield or limbs. Our Viking Axe is equipped with a very strong American hickory haft.     Cold Steel has been a long time believer in the ferocious cutting power of a well-designed Viking Axe. Until recently, we lacked the technical ability to make one to our satisfaction. However, with our new state-of-the-art forging facility, we can offer our customers something truly exceptional. Our Viking Axe’s formidably long, thin blade is fully polished and hand sharpened to a bone-splitting, shield shattering edge. It comes with a robust 10” cutting surface that terminates in two sharp horns or points. Traditionally, the longer top point was used for stabbing, gouging, or parrying, while the slightly shorter bottom point was used to capture an opponent’s shield or to hook and immobilize his neck, arms, or legs. To maximize leverage, strength, and dexterity of movement, the Viking Axe is equipped with a very strong, resilient haft. Made in Maine from the best hickory available, it enhances and amplifies our Viking Axe’s lethal potential as a cutting, chopping and stabbing weapon.        long, thin blade         blade is fully polished and hand sharpened to a bone-splitting, shield shattering edge         comes with a robust 10 inch cutting surface that terminates in two sharp horns or points         equipped with very strong, resilient haft         made in Maine from the best hickory available  Additional Information    Part # 89VA   Weight 1.0906   Thickness No   Head 9 5/8″   Hammer Face No   Primary Edge 10″   Hawk Length No   Height No   Blade Length No   Handle 48″ Long Hickory Shaft   Steel / Material 1055 Carbon   Overall 52″"

I've put less than 500 rounds through it and have cleaned+lubed it after every range day, leaving it in excellent condition. While you might be able to find this rifle for a comparable price online, this AK is different in the fact that it has a Matte Black Duracoat job which, in my opinion, makes the rifle look much cleaner than the standard AK. It also has a polished bolt carrier, NEW UPGRADED wood furniture, and an AR-style muzzle comp/flash hider. These upgrades alone will run you much higher than what I'm asking.As far as the quality of the rifle is concerned, it's quite excellent. The sights are aligned perfectly, the rivets are straight, and it has been extremely reliable. It comes with a steel mag (which is duracoated in the same matte black color as the rifle), TWO 30-rd pmags, a trigger group retaining plate (that I've yet to upgrade), AND a hard-shell case for the rifle. I'm asking $700 for the rifle, which, in my opinion, is a fair price considering the work and money that I've put in the rifle. I'm not looking for trades and, for now, the price is firm. If you want to see more pics or are interested in purchasing it, shoot me a text at 904-866-9956."

I've put less than 500 rounds through it and have cleaned+lubed it after every range day, leaving it in excellent condition. While you might be able to find this rifle for a comparable price online, this AK is different in the fact that it has a Matte Black Duracoat job which, in my opinion, makes the rifle look much cleaner than the standard AK. It also has a polished bolt carrier, NEW UPGRADED wood furniture, and an AR-style muzzle comp/flash hider. These upgrades alone will run you much higher than what I'm asking.As far as the quality of the rifle is concerned, it's quite excellent. The sights are aligned perfectly, the rivets are straight, and it has been extremely reliable. It comes with a steel mag (which is duracoated in the same matte black color as the rifle), TWO 30-rd pmags, a trigger group retaining plate (that I've yet to upgrade), AND a hard-shell case for the rifle. I'm asking $600 for the rifle, which, in my opinion, is a fair price considering the work and money that I've put in the rifle.

I've installed a Dragonov polymer stock ,Tapco muzzle brake, Tapco double hook trigger, and optional a Russian POSP 8x 42 sniper sight (side Mount) . The Rifle has ben fired about 500 rounds down range. Higher velocity than standard AK 47 s because of the longer barrel. With Golden Tiger rounds the bullets were timed at 2550ft per sec verses 2350 out of my 16"" AK47. Its a pretty accurate rifle for and AK47 3 inch circle at 100yards (with me shooting ,a better shot could do better). I really like the rifle and am not desperate to part with it. $800 firm without scope and $1000 with scope. 20 inch barrels are rare in AK 47 ,only Russian Veprs or Chinese Norrinco s come with the 20"" option. Its not incumbering in any way,just higher velocity. Its damn near 308 speed, just 150 feet per second slower ,but it shoots cheap Russian ammo which makes a day at the range less costly.  I'm looking for a GOOD 5.45 x 39 AK74 to trade .
