THis is most likely a reported or an activist working on the Democratic National Committee / George Soros / Bloomberg project trying to show that legitimate gun-owners are irresponsbile and will sell guns to anyone. My first question is always ""do you have a CWP? Typically that ends the conversation. I only sell to CWP holders, and I suggesst strongly that everyone who enjoys Armslist and their ability to sell firearms in private sales PAY ATTENTION and use the full protection of selling only to responsible people you know and to CWP holders.

Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise."

This allows you to run your firearm with less oil/lube, and makes cleaning much easier. Another plus with Titanium Nitride is that the average coating adds only 3 micrometers of thickness, so it will enhance the function and look of your firearm.  Comes in I s original box with all original accessories and two 15 round magazines.  There's not another one anywhere around and this is better than new and never been fired!Please ask any questions via email or call/text REDACTED before 8pm.

This gun has 7 special order features which include an extra light barrel which tappers down to about the size of a pen, a checkered pistol grip stock, 1/2 magazine, shotgun butt with rubber, takedown, and oil finish. It also has the rare Lyman 21 sight which is aged to the gun. The wood is in really nice shape for the age and so is the rest of the gun. There are some traces of bluing left on the receiver and quite a bit remaining on the barrel. There are a few light scratches on the stock and on the metal of the barrel/ receiver which are all shown in the pictures but are small in nature considering the age of the firearm. The takedown of the firearm can be done with no issues. The gun functions flawlessly and for the age is a great specimen. There is nice rifling left in the barrel. Please refer to the pictures for final descriptions as they can show better than I can describe. It will be extremely hard to find another verified antique 1894 with this many special order features as only roughly 55,000 1894s were made prior to 1898. Only reason I am selling is I am looking to buy a newer bass boat. I may also trade for an ATV. If your trade doesn' equal my value you will need to ad cash to make it even. This gun is also listed on gunbroker"
