I am selling it for $300 cash PLUS a trade.  Meanining... I need $300 in cash AND a decent trade.  Now don't get me wrong - I'm realistic.  I know I'm not going to score $300 cash plus some awesome firearm.  But... I will probably get some offers for $300 cash PLUS a Ruger 10/22 or $300 PLUS a crap load of .223 ammo.  I do NOT have a ""full cash price"" amount on this.  I need $300 PLUS/AND a cool trade.  So... please help me out here.  It's not about the money.  It's about making my wife happy ---AND I get something new out of this deal.  Don't worry about the logic of all this.  If logic doesn't matter to my wife, then logic should not matter to you either.  Because she knows everything.  She's told me as much.  Please message me with realistic offers.  And have charity.  Because it's lacking in my house right now.  Thanks in advance!"

At any rate, my whale hunting days are over, and it time to pass this gem along. Comes with the original box and paperwork.
