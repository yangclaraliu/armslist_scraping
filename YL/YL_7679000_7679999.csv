I am selling my brand new (only been shot once) Springfield M1A .308. One thing you should know. I do not want to sell this gun. As I write this i am weeping. (And not a manly cry. We are talking a full blown teenage girl watching the Notebook, eating a tub of breakup brownie chunk ice cream type of sobbing). I love this rifle. She is my baby and I am emotionally wrecked selling her. She’s an amazing girl and with open sights will hit the target from 100 yards like a big girl. You may ask, “Well why the heck are you selling her then?” Here’s the thing. She’s a big girl and I’m a full grown little man. She’s too long for me to haul into the woods for deer hunting and she deserves better than collecting dust in my safe. So I’m adopting her out. She needs a good home. Lots of love and attention. Treat her well and keep her cleaned and oiled. I also have a scope mount for her I can throw in. May have some deer rounds too. Also have a leather replica sling for her. To all those who have offered trades; Thank You, but I am not interested in trading at this time!"

We don’t know when it was converted to percussion, but it was probably in the 1841-1842 time frame when the original percussion models were being built.Caliber: .52 Caliber Cap and BallAction Type: Single Shot Breechloading Rifle, with Breechblock That Rotates Up for LoadingMarkings: The top of the breechblock is marked “J. H. HALL / H. FERRY / U S / 1831”.Barrel Length: The barrel is 32 ¾” in length.Sights / Optics: The front sight is a stubby bead fixed to the top of the barrel. The rear sight is a “U” notched leaf sight dovetailed into the top of the barrel at the rear. The sights are offset to the left of the centerline of the barrel to clear the hammer and nipple shield.Stock Configuration & Condition: The stock is a one-piece walnut with a straight grip and a long forend that runs almost to the end of the barrel. The butt has a flat steel shotgun style buttplate, and the forend is held with two barrel bands and has a nosecap with two integral barrel bands. The nosecap has a hole through it and the underside of the forend is grooved for storage of a cleaning rod. There is a sling swivel mounted at the front of the trigger guard and another on the mid barrel band. The stock is finished with a reddish-brown stain. The wood is dark with oil staining and shows multiple small dings, bruises and drag lines, but is free of cracks and chips. The wood to metal fit is excellent. The LOP measures about 14 ¼” from the front of the trigger to the back of the buttplate. The buttplate appears to be coated with the same finish as the wood. It has developed a thick dark patina with thin solid erosion. The buttplate is in about Good condition. The stock rates in about Very Good condition. Type of Finish: According to Flayderman’s, the original finish on the barrel and receiver was a brown lacquer. The sides of the breechblock are blued. The barrel and receiver have been refinished with what looks like the same reddish-brown lacquer used to finish the stock. Finish Originality: We can’t tell if the breechblock has been refinished or not. We think the barrel, receiver and trigger guard were refinished.Bore Condition: The bore is smooth bored from the muzzle back about 1 ½”. The remainder of the bore is bright with pronounced sharp rifling. There is light erosion in the grooves at the front of the bore.Overall Condition: The barrel and receiver have a plum coloring that we think is lacquer, applied over a finish which was cleaned. There are small marks and wire wheel marks under the lacquer. The last several inches of the barrel in front of the rear barrel band, the receiver and the breechblock have developed a thick patina’d coating of solid erosion in spots, which is thickest at the back of the breechblock and receiver, and on the sides of the breechblock. The hammer knurling is relatively sharp. A few of the screw heads show light marks from a screwdriver and the remainder are sharp. The markings on the breechblock are clear. Overall, this rifle rates in about Good condition.Mechanics: The action functions correctly$20 for shipping. There is a lever on the underside of the stock, which when pulled to the rear releases the front of the breechblock to pivot upwards. The hammer has a half-cock safety. We did not fire this rifle. As with all used firearms, a thorough cleaning may be necessary to meet your maintenance requirements.Box, Paperwork & Accessories: There is a cleaning rod with a button tip stored under the barrel. The rod exposed front section of the rod has developed a thick brown patina and the remainder appears to be finished in the white. There are a few spots of dark erosion in the rod. We could not pull the rod out from under the barrel and we couldn’t grasp it firmly enough with our fingers to turn it, and we didn’t want to damage the rod with pliers. Otherwise, the rod is in Good to Very Good condition.Buyer will  pay  $20"

Judging by its date of manufacture and overall condition, it undoubtedly saw action in the Malayan Emergency, which started in 1948. This gun is marked June of 1947 and has some very attractive battle wear.
The rifle has the proper lightening cuts that indicate it is not a Santa Fe knock off, as can be seen in the pictures. The receiver, stock and barrel are all serial numbered “AB 180.” This is not a mismatch monster, as was common with these when they were imported into the States. The R.F.I. bayonet shown in the pictures will come with the gun, along with a Huber anti-friction Ball trigger (a $150 item.)
If you’re looking for a cool piece of British history this holiday season that you can shoot, look no further! This gun is priced to sell at just $650 and will shoot like a dream with the aftermarket trigger.

Hornady began with a bullet legendary in its accuracy - the Hornady XTP - and redesigned it as the perfect competition projectile. While the XTP uses folds and a cannelure to aid in expansion and increase terminal performance, expansion is meaningless in competition. So, the folds and cannelure are gone from the HAP (Hornady Action Pistol) bullet. Because jamming can cost a competitive shooter the match, Hornady placed the HAP's pure lead core inside a copper jacket that protects the nose, ensuring smooth feeding. And like the XTP, the core of the HAP bullet is cold swaged from pure lead to give it amazing consistence, balance and stability in flight. This is not loaded ammunition.QTY 500 = $50.00QTY 1,000 = $90.00"
