The grips were changed to Springfield Professional cocobolo grips with Ed Brown torx head screws. It has Novak style night sights. This pistol was built from the ground up to be bomb proof. The trigger is a super smooth 3.5 pounds and it shoots amazing. I have put 200ish flawless rounds through it. I’m sure I have forgotten something so please ask any questions. It comes in the Springfield box with both the factory mags. I am not looking for any trades and I am pretty firm on price.
