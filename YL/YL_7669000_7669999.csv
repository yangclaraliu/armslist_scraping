Colt 1/7 Heavy SOCOM profile barrel with SOPMOD Certified MATECH rear sight. Colt ""C""marked bolt carrier, upper receiver, barrel, and front sight post. Front sight post is ""F""-Marked, bolt is ""MPC"" marked, upper is ""T-Marked"". Handguard is genuine Knight's Armament RAS handguard, I have taken it off to show the Heavier profile SOCOM barrel, and so people can see that the handguard is indeed a KAC part and NOT the Troy Industries model that some SOCOM's came with. Comes with a variety of KAC rail covers as well as the vertical foregrip. This is NOT a firearm and does not need any paperwork. I WILL ship but buyer pay's actual shipping cost.
