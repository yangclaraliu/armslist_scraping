The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design. Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

We are told there could be ammo as old as 2006 in the shipment, of course this stuff basically lasts forever and is as good as new for many decades yet to come. This is the real deal, true M193 mil-spec surplus made by CBC and sold by Magtech to foreign government / military. This ammo was neatly packed in 50 round boxes, 200 round plastic sealed sleeves, 5 sleeves packed in an M2A1 reusable metal ammo can. It has been stored its whole life in government owned climate controlled facilities and looks like new ammo. This Magtech military surplus 5.56 M193 ammo has a brass case, boxer non-corrosive primer, a boat tail 55 grain copper jacket lead core non-magnetic projectile, black lucas type case mouth sealant, lacquer sealed primer pockets and uses ball type gun powder. The story is that the foreign government that bought this ammo when it was brand new is required to cycle out old stock after a certain time period and they traded in the is ammo to Magtech as a partial credit towards new ammo to be made by CBC. This ammo looks very impressive and is true mil-spec M193 ammo originally certified to meet all conditions of mil-spec200 OBOCan text at REDACTED or reply to this ad."

The Weatherby Vanguard Sub-MOA (Minute of Angle) Matte is a bolt-action rifle chambered in 15 calibers. It is one of 11 models in Weatherby’s Vanguard series, but what makes it unique is that it features a pillar-bedded Fiberguard brand composite stock. Pillar bedded stocks use aluminum or metal sleeves against which the action screws can be tightened, providing an overall tighter fit between the stock and the action–similar to fastening a screw into a plastic wall anchor rather than directly into a wooden board. The Sub-MOA also features a raised cheekpiece and all metalwork is finished in matte black. The Sub-MOA Matte also includes a Pachmayr Decelerator brand recoil pad.
Vanguard rifles share a number of common characteristics including a fully adjustable trigger that is initially factory-tuned to 3.5 pounds. It has a fluted bolt body that reduces surface area and weight. The rifle has a cocking indicator that visually indicates whether the it’s uncocked or cocked. Along with a hinged floorplate, all Vanguard models have a cold hammer forged barrel, meaning a machine carefully pushed a mandrel through it to rifle the bore.
Weatherby says the Vanguard Sub-MOA Matte is guaranteed to fire a 3-shot group of 0.99″ or less when used with specified ammunition. The Sub-MOA also includes a factory shot electronic target.
Weatherby recommends the Vanguard Sub-MOA Matte for precision shooting"

It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels. It also has molded finger grooves for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model comes with 3-Dot sights, and includes two (2), 15-round magazines.

Glock 19 Generation 3 Gun has less then 2,500 rounds through it I am orignal owner and a Glock armorer
For you to understand my pricing
G19 with two OEM mags and  with brand new XS big dots 525$ seems pretty fair to me
Four extra OEM 15 round Glock mags 70$ thats 17.50 a mag all in great condition
Two brand new unused Glock OEM recoil springs ( change every 5,000 rounds ) 15$ each
Glock 17 Smooth face trigger the 19's come serrated I dislike this and throw out the serrated trigger all it does is give it a smooth face as shown in picture
 
This gun has typical carry wear and I will only sell or trade this as a package for 610$ for everything or without the mag for 540$
If you ask me retarded shit like ""still for sale or Best price today"" you are to dumb to own a firearm and I will not sell you one
You will show OHIO I.D that says you are 21 or older people with carry permits or LEO cred get first dibs I am a CHL holder myself if you'd like a bill of sale i'll gladly provide one but I honestly don't care

NIB Armscor M-16 Style .22lr Semi-automatic rifle with 10rd mag w/Lifetime Warranty. From the same manufacturer that brought us the Rock Island 1911. The M1600 is a .22 Long Rifle equipped with an 18.25 inch barrel and black finished wood stock and pistol grip. 39 inches overall length. The stock magazine is 10 rounds with an option to upgrade to a 15 round. The M1600 is outfitted with a post front sight and an open U-notch with elevation adjustments. Includes sling.  Very few in stock.  This is a cosmetic copy of the M16.  None of the parts are interchangable with a real M16.  They have been making pretty much this same gun for over 30 years. I actually own one of these from the 70's and it still works great (Bingham Squire was the name of the manufacter back then) It is very reliable and simple.  You can find 25 round mags on the internet.  The gun is perfect.  The streaks shown on the firearm are from the light coat of oil put on by the factory.  It wipes off.  Photos were literally taken right after the box was opened.  The rifle and magazine were in a plastic sealed bag.  I had to open it.  If you get the one that was used to take pictures then know that is why they were opened.   Here is a link to a video I put together on this rifle and the very similar Mak22.  I was having all types of problems with the camera, so please tolerate the amatuer nature of the video: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=rn8FqootQwI"
