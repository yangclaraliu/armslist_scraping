Model: 148 Type: AR Trigger The Echo AR-II Trigger is a trigger for many but not all AR-15 platforms.   The Echo AR-II trigger NO LONGER comes with a stripped carrier with gas key because it is no longer needed.  You will use the M16 bolt carrier group already inside your weapon.  If you do not have a full auto carrier group in your weapon you will need to obtain a full auto carrier in order for the Echo AR-II trigger to function.   If you have any questions about the difference between a full auto carrier and a semi-automatic carrier please see our instruction manual that shows the illustration.  You can also find this information at www.echoquestions.com. The Echo AR-II Trigger is a ground breaking drop in design that is approved by the ATF. The Echo AR-II Trigger allows the shooter to select from 3 different settings: ~ Safe Mode: Firearm will not fire. ~ Semi-Automatic Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled. ~ Echo Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled and also when trigger is released. The Echo AR-II Trigger is designed with safety being the utmost priority. When the shooter is in the Echo Mode and depresses the trigger one round is fired, if the target moves, the shooter can move the selector to the safe position and a second round will not fire upon release. The Echo AR-II Trigger has several distinct features:~ PATENTED Design that gained ATF Approval (Patent # US 8,820,211 B1)~ Technology licensed through HIPERFIRE inside the Echo AR-II Trigger~ Light, clean, and crisp pull in Semi-Automatic Mode~ The Echo AR-II Trigger is packed full of cutting edge technology~ Reliable function in Echo Mode"

I do not want to sell this gun, but I feel I have to make a choice between this and the SIG Sauer P229 Enhanced Elite in .357 SIG I just purchased. The trigger on this M&P is OUTSTANDING! It blows away all of the Glocks and S&W M&P's I've owned (about ten). All things considered, in my opinion, it is the best production concealed carry striker-fired handgun made today. It is exteremely accurate, soft-shooting, and it comes with five (5) magazines so you're ready to preload for the range (four 15-round magazines, one 17-rounder, and two extension sleeves). The two 15 rounders in the picture have never been used (they just arrived today).
It also comes with S&W OEM frame plugs that I ordered if you want to remove the manual safety (they've never been used). $500, cash only, you must have a valid state ID, and you must be legal to purchase firearms privately in the state of Ohio. I will bring two copies of a following CYA form I highly recommend both parties keep: http://www.defensivestrategies.org/downloads/PrivateTransferForm.pdf"
