Aqui esta un revolver excelente, la modelo Astra Police. From its E2 Spanish date code, it was manufactured in 1985. Manufacturer was Astra Unceta y Compania de Guernica (de España). Importer markings are inconspicuous on the barrel shroud bottom, and Astra .38 Spl. on one cylinder chamber. Other markings are original Spanish proofs and date code. Type is traditional double and single action swing out cylinder revolver. Frame is Large N size, .655 lateral thickness with 1.773 cylinder length and 1.571 cyl. diameter, amply strong enough to withstand pressure from +P ammunition. Grip frame is square butt with radiused back strap. Construction is entirely steel metal and Spanish walnut grips. Chambering is .38 Smith & Wesson Special, with 6 round cylinder capacity. Barrel is one piece 3 inch medium with integral pin shroud, pinned into the frame, with right hand 1:16 rifling. Front sight is steel step blade, double pinned onto solid serrated rib, with frame integral fixed notch rear sight. Cylinder capacity is 6 rounds. Ignition is .475 long serrated spur flat face hammer against floating firing pin, with a .350 smooth faced combat trigger. Frame is distinctive Astra five screw, with yoke retention screw and four screw side plate. Overall length is 8 3/8 inches by 5 1/4 inches height. Weight empty is 37 1/2 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger. Finish is blued steel, with worn case colored hammer and trigger. Grips are Jordan type, press checkered lateral walnut, with nickel plated factory medallions, and with worn semi gloss finish. They will accommodate a 10A or 586A Speedloader well enough. Surface detractions on this Astra Police model are minimal to moderate, principally edge wear and finish wear to the right grip panel. We rate it as Very Good, 75 to 80 percent vicinity by my estimate. Bore, cylinder chambers and mechanism are all bright and clean. Blast effect to the top strap underside above the forcing cone is minimal, and cylinder face carbon is minimal. Cylinder times correctly in all six positions both double and single action, with hammer movement to spare. It has no lateral play whatsoever with the trigger fully depressed. Cylinder face to forcing cone gap measures .005 to .006. Double action trigger pull is smooth 11 pound vicinity, with crisp 4 pound vicinity single action pull. I estimate this revolver has been fired fewer than 500 times, no rounds at all for an Astra. From its PMV Marking, this Astra served with Airport Security at the Margarita Airport in Venezuela."
