Better than my Anschutz, Hammerli and walther rifles! This is very rare find. Finding a genuine US property marked Winchester 52C in good shape is hard enough, but this is a GENUINE BULL BARREL GUN. Why do I emphasize that? Because, an actual factory bull is very rare and very low numbers. Most people who think they have a BULL, actually have a ""Heavy Barrel"" model. They are often mislabeled because people see a thick barrel and think Bull. Not the case. The winchester 52C actually came in 4 barrel profiles. The Sporter, Heavy sporter, Heavy Barrel and Bull Barrel. The latter is very seldom seen and labeled correctly! Most of them on gunbroker called ""Bull Barrels"" are actually Heavy barrel models. So this is the real thing. How do you prove you have the real thing? Simple. Put a caliper on the receiver and the barrel. If it reads 1.35"" on the receiver and 1.125 on the barrel where it meets the receiver it's the real thing. The Heavy Barrel models only read .92"" at the receiver. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL! I have only seen two other models sell in the last ten years that were all original and correct. One at the Rock Island Auction sold for $3700 and one on Gunbroker sold for $2900. I am asking FAR LESS!The other great thing about my model is it's condition. Many consumer models can be found still in great cosmetic condition, but the US property models, usually sold off later through the CMP program are usually beat to death as they were army trainer and competition guns typically. This one is in great shape! Sure there are scratches and small nicks, but nothing major. No cracks in the wood. All original everything and un-messed with. Original gorgeous walnut stock, buttplate, FACTORY INSTALLED Redfield Olympic sights and factory single shot adapter. This can be removed to use a magazine although I don't have a mag for it. In it's current configuration, single shot is the correct setup for it anyhow. The action is smooth as glass and the trigger will remind you of your best tuned 1911 trigger! Amazingly nice. Very, very, very accurate. Has the correct Electropenciled US Property marking on the side of the receiver and the cartouche stamping on the bottom of the pistol grip of the stock.Will come in a standard soft case. I am asking at least $1000 less than it's worth and at least $700 less than the exact same guns have (seldom) sold for!$1900 CashTEXT OR CALL FOR MORE PICTURES.

The all new Talo Exclusive Tungsten Gray CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an ideal combination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability to conceal comfortably. The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster.This CCP comes in stylish Cerakote® black with a tungsten grey frame, and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation.This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface.Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide.  Features:Front Sight with White DotPicatinny RailSmooth TriggerReversible Magazine ReleaseThe CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.

I am the second owner of this weapon I purchased it a few years ago and have shot it less than 10 times and I would like to sell it to pay sole bills there is nothing wrong with this gun and it works perfectly. The extractor will rip the bottom off of aluminum ammunition and the case will be stuck in the chamber and will cause a double feed. I have only shot brass through this gun because of that reason. I have some ammunition including some tracer rounds to throw in with the gun and some cheek peaces that clip to the adjustable stock. This gun also comes with a detachable rail that has a rear sight post on it if you wish to take off the red dot or scop and shoot with iron sights.
