It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/11/17 to 12/15/17 in the store and what pistols we bring with us at the C&E Gun show this weekend 12/16/17 and 12/17/18. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we can't replace or can't replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesn't have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and don't forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior. God Bless.

It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/11/17 to 12/15/17 in the store and what pistols we bring with us at the C&E Gun show this weekend 12/16/17 and 12/17/18. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we can't replace or can't replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesnt have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and don't forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior. God Bless.

Its downward shell ejection system eliminates the side ejection disadvantage of ordinary bullpups. The result is casings that eject out of your line of sight and a truly ambidextrous, high performance rifle. The RDB is also adjustable for a wide variety of ammunition. It’s definitely the bullpup done right.Comes with original magazine, box and papers. About 200 rounds through this rifle. Very accurate and operates perfectly, just need to downsize the collection a bit. Firm on price for the rifle, these are tough to get and price is very fair. Also have an ACOG available for it, TA33G open to offers for the package deal.https://www.keltecweapons.com/rifles/rdb"

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 models now feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability. The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws."

A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools. The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa. The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before."

A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools.
The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa.
The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before."

Do not contact me with a Glock and expect me to do a fair trade with those two guns. I do not want another gun worth 5 or $600 less than mine INCLUDING MAGS... and then have to turn around and sell that and make less money. lol if you want my gun for trade value in cash instead of just paying all cash which $850 plus all my magazines for a gun that's all alloyed with the stainless steel slide in the entire thing is cerakoted with a Trijicon sights and $300 in magazines G I don't know maybe a fair trade would be a Glock with about three or four hundred dollars in cash and that still is a gimme for you. Or a Springfield or something to that effect I'm open to other weapons but something plus cash would be good or all cash would be even more in your favor.
