This is NOT a reproduction.

Gun is over 150 years old and functions.

Pistol is marked with the name of the maker, street and city (Robert Jones of  Howard street, Liverpool). Gun is also marked with the Birmingham proof/inspection mark used between 1812-1904.

Robert jones' firearms company was active from 1827-1917 in Liverpool. He is is well known maker of shotguns. This is the first dueling pistol I have seen of his.

This was made prior to the American civil war.

Gun cocks and trigger works. Ram rod is on a swing arm and functions appropriately.

Most every part of this gun has hand engraving. It's truly a work of art. Handle, barrel, trigger guard, hammer, base plate. This would have taken a master craftsman a good deal of time.

As the gun is original, it has wear. Dings here and there. There's one mark on the bottom of the barrel which I think might be a hallmark, but can't tell. Could be a small pit. Base plate of the handle has at some point been used like a hammer and has dings as a result. Hammer bell where it would land on a cap has a a split from being dry fired too much. Please see pictures.

I'm willing to trade for working modern firearms. But prefer cash. I do not need any more antiques.

I do not accept checks and you are not ""test firing"" this pistol. Dry fire fine. I do not ship guns either. Serious offers only.

This helmet was purchased from an antique store in the 1980s and has been in room temperature storage since that time.

The M1940 helmet first appeared in March 1940 following a redesign of the manufacturing process which now incorporated more automated stamping techniques.  The first helmets issued received only one decal on the left side of the helmet.  In 1943 this factory applied decal was discontinued in order to comply with orders issued by the Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht.  Helmets of this type are characteristic of having rolled edges and stamped air vents that are embossed directly into the steel shell.  Paint finishes range from medium to very dark blue-grey in overall tone with semi-rough to rough outer texture. 

The helmet has a decal of a bird carrying a symbol in its left talon that is standard for this period Luftwaffe helmet.

The Gen 4 has an initially smaller grip than the Gen3, and comes with two different backstraps to adjust the grip to your liking. Most seem to prefer no backstraps. The 1st backstrap makes the grip the same size as a Gen 3 gun and the second one makes it a bit larger. This is the one I actually prefer on my G17 so far. 

Next, the recoil spring has gone from a single spring to a dual spring setup to lessen the felt recoil and to reduce stress on the frames in .40 guns and above. Theoretically, Glock .40 pistols were guns adapted from 9mm. Now the theory is the Gen4's were designed more around the .40 cartridge. This originally caused issues with the new 9mm variations of the Gen 4's due to the fact that they tried to use the same spring for both, making the 9mm's only truly reliable with the higher energy 9mm rounds out there and made them highly susceptible to limp-wristing. 

Another change is the grip surface. It has a new, more aggressive gripping surface to make the guns easier to hold onto with sweaty hands or worse. It works quite well but can be a bit abrasive if you use an IWB holster. I also believe the finger grooves are a little less aggressive than the original finger grooves. 

Last but not least, Gen4's have a larger mag release that is now also reversible.

I do not need anything in trade right now, but will trade if it makes sense on my end, no hurry to move this set-up.  If you offer something of less value and do not mention adding cash or other to the deal, I will assume you want a straight trade and pass.  Same on your end, if you have something of higher value let me know what you are looking for on top.

Description:
The Extended Bolt Release v2/308 (EBRv2/308)™ was designed to be used on the LR 308 DPMS type and similar weapon systems. It has no backing plates or screws to obstruct its ability to fit just about any DPMS type 308 combination of lower and upper receivers.
The demand for speed did not stop at the AR-15. The EBRv2/308™ gives the operator the advantageous ability to reload quicker, clear jams in a more efficient way and eliminate unnecessary hand movements during various operations. This allows the operator to get back into the fight faster and be more effective.
The monolithic EBRv2/308™ is constructed to be lightweight and super strong, going through a stringent 9 stage manufacturing process to ensure dependability.

THIS IS AMAZING AMMUNITION - These are nothing like those PMC X-TAC ""light armor piercing"" green tip rounds... these are PENETRATOR rounds and have unbelievable accuracy and destruction.  This same ammo has been manufactured and sold to the U.S. and foreign Governments for use in combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other foreign theaters of war.

This ammunition is powerful enough to penetrate up to 3mm (0.12 in) of steel at 600 meters & up to 12mm (0.47 in) of RHA steel at 100 meters. 

These rounds are not cheap range fodder.  These are battle rounds that are moisture sealed to military specifications for long term storage.

If you reload your ammunition, after you fire off these rounds you will find the brass some of the best you can use for reloading.

I'd like to trade this for a subcompact or pocket sized handgun in 9mm or .40. Primarily interested in a Ruger SR40c or sr9c, or newer model Beretta Nano. No Tauruses or calibers aside from 9mm or .40 please. 

Prefer to trade, but I'll sell it for $350 if wanting to buy.

Section 1:
The reasons you need this fine American firearm, most of these are obvious, but I wanted to spell them out just in case..
•	The trigger pull is as smooth as the taste of a freshly cracked open can of Natural Ice
•	You hate terrorist organizations and WMD’s that aren’t possessed by the USA
•	Much like nature’s number 1 predators, It’s been factory coated with camouflage to make it incredibly stealthy in any surrounding.
•	It’s the perfect firearm to perform your duties as a man which are to protect yourself and your family from terrorists.
•	Have you heard the sound of a pump shotgun? This is no snotty over under or sissy semi auto. Much like a finely tuned diesel truck, this is gun should only be operated by real men.
•	Chuck Norris, Burt Reynolds, Dale Earnhardt and the duck commander himself would have all hunted with this shotgun had they been given the chance..
•	I personally ensure the action and barrel are always coated in deer antler spray. HGH, and a personally concocted blend of topical anabolic steroids, which ensures a much more testosterone laden payload with absolutely no pellet or pattern deformation
•	This is the perfect firearm for hunting a taking any game found in the United States of America, including terrorists
•	The gun is cleaner than your first car and tighter than your first girlfriend
•	The barrel isn’t overcompensating with needless length and girth, making you look foolish in the duck blind, no stuffing socks here, this is 20 inches of pure fowl and turkey crushing goodness. But I hunt squirrels and rabbits you say? I can kill a squirrel with a .22 you say?  My grandfather killed ducks with two and three quarter loads you say? Go drink your Mikes Hard on the beach with Kenny Chesney and read section below.
•	Toby Keith chose this gun in his continued fight of global terrorism and the spread of patriotic goodness throughout the world, had he been given the chance..
•	It shoots three and one half inch magnum loads of goose slaughtering non-toxic shot or extremely dense lead turkey pounding goodness. You don’t need a 3.5” load to kill these animals? The recoil isn’t manageable? Please enjoy sipping appletinis with Elton John and read section below.
•	It has an insanely accurate red dot scope. The true to life war and marksmanship simulator known as Call of Duty has taught us that only attachment you’ll ever need on any firearm, and makes it far more lethal in the woods.
•	No rice burning, pinky up Italian snobbery, Chinese patent rip-offs, or Turkish aluminum foil “steel”  to be found here folks. This gun is as American as terrible reality TV shows, Dale Earnhardt Sr/Jr, and Hank Williams, and was 100% manufactured by an American owned company right here in the United States of America.

Section 2:
Should any of the following apply to you.. you do not need this firearm..
•	You can’t grow a beard by noon
•	You can’t fit this gun in your hybrid
•	You don’t wish to be more desirable to women in the 7-10 range
•	You’re Nick Saban
•	You can’t make fire
•	You’re Urban Myer
•	You use product in your hair
•	You own Birkenstock’s
•	You call soccer football
•	You’re Lane Kiffin
•	You ‘ve ever been accused of “short stroking”
•	You spend time alone with Kenny Chesney or Elton John
•	You ride a Chinese made bike on the road and feel you have a right away over American made muscle from hard working men and women in Detroit, why do you hate America?
•	You don’t drink whiskey or the king of beers (Natural Ice)
•	You like Kyle Bush or Jeff Gordon (RIP Dale)
•	You’re in any terrorist organization
•	You’re currently in or have previously been in a boy band

These statements, while humorous, are in no way shape or form made in any manner other than humorous and satirical; however, if they offend you or if you’re still reading and haven’t contacted me to purchase this shotgun, you’re probably a terrorist (that’s also a joke).

Very nice revolver that does not appear to even have been fired. Does not include factory box or paperwork but does include a Plano hard case and gun lock.

If you purchase at the shop we will throw in a 50rd box of 44 mag ammo FREE!!!!

The differences between the standard Super Blackhawk and the Bisley include changes to the grip, trigger and hammer design. The Bisley's grip frame is elongated with a less pronounced flair at the base in order to provide the shooter with a more comfortable and manageable hold. Not only is there plenty of room for a full three-finger grip, the grip frame provides more space for the revolver to roll back in the shooting hand to help mitigate magnum-level recoil. The Bisley hammer spur has been lowered and elongated to facilitate easier cocking and the smooth-faced trigger, housed in a rounded trigger guard, is more generously curved, making it very comfortable to work with.

They are no longer sold to the public or even LE. They are only sold to Elite military forces on official PO letterheads only. Contact Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta if you need verification. This one was sent from Afghanistan by aclose friend who is a SFO. Its the brightest laser you have ever seen you can follow the beam even before dark and after that it looks like something from STAR WARS. It will definitely get you thrown in jail. Comes with zero tool and 2 different tail caps. I have only seen one other of these and it sold on GB about a month ago for 859$ and there were 30 or so people fighting over it. Yes it will start a fire and light a match very easily!  Before you make a offer price everything out and then good luck finding the LS8300!
