1) 1 piece Teknic Superbike Race Leathers with matching gloves. These leathers and gloves are about 10 years old. I paid about $1600 for them new. Size 45-56 and gloves are large. They have NEVER been in any type of accident or bad weather (rain or snow) and have always been cleaned and conditioned with leather cleaner after being used. They are made by one of the BEST companies in the business. If you want a set of leathers you don't have to worry about if they will protect you or not, these are the ones. CE-approved Kevlar elbow, knee and shoulder protectors are fitted into the shell of the suit. Racing cut pre-curved knees and elbows with forward rotated arms and hips. Teknic Advanced Seam Construction- Advanced multi-row stitching provides maximum seam strength. Zip out lining is washable and moisture wicking. All zippers are genuine YKK zippers. Fully perforated for maximum airflow and removable knee sliders offer maximum feel. 
2) SIDI Vertigo Air Boots, These boots have two riding seasons at the track on them. I paid over $300 for them new. They are in great shape. Size 11.5 US.
3) Arai all mat black full face with air vents and chin spoiler helmet. I bought it new in ""02"" as a spare/ex-gf helmet. It might have been worn 15 times on 30 minute rides. It didn't spend much time if any strapped on the back. It was always kept at home in it's felt bag when it wasn't used. 
4) Dainese BAP1 Back Protection. I paid about $125. It was used for two full seasons at the track and a couple long distance rides across Europe. Offers some protection against hyperextending your spine in the wrong direction in addition to great impact and abrasion protection. Fits perfect under a riding gear and covers all of the spine for full protection. Double-velcro kidney belts are 100% solid and give great support.

I sold my bike when I got back to the states in ""07"". I had high hopes of getting a new bike but a daughter and then orders to Alaska changed all that. I am pretty firm with the price. You will never find a deal like this again. Call Terry if you're interested @ nine07-7five0-4seven40"

This rifle is chambered in 7mm-08 which if you know these guns, you know that is a rare caliber to find. On top is a 4x scope and it has one magazine with it.
If you don't know, the 788s were produced as a ""more economical"" rifle than the 700s. It turned out that they ended up being tack drivers and were only made for 15 years, (67-83). 
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles. The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The bolt pictured is a pre-1975 locking model from a .308 Winchester caliber rifle. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged. The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well. When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength. These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter. A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.

INFORMATION FROM WEBSITE:
 ""The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."""

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour  16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations.

This REPR Sniper Features:

- 20 inch threaded barrel

As of late, many of us listing have been getting emails from a guy who calls himself ""Edgar Hoover"". He says he is contacting BATF for us listing illegally. Below is an example of his emails.

Nobody wants a douched S&W POS Glock copy! Grow up little man! Reported to the BATF for ILLEGAL gun running and stolen gun dealing.

This is his email address: REDACTED 

If you have received similar threats….Don't be afraid of this punk. Just an unhappy anti-gunner who has too much time in his hands. Who knows, maybe Bloomberg throws a few coins his way. The ATF and Marshals are already aware of this moron. We are not doing anything illegal, so….carry on.



UPDATE.  I sent him a nasty email to ruffle up his feathers, and here are some of the replies I got. 




""You are not going to do anything except to shit and fall back in it you Baptist fucking liar. We have a Constitution in this country that guarantees freedom of speech you uneducated piece of shit. There would be nothing I would like more than for you to hunt me down. I work at Bass Pro at exit 407 on I-40  and not in hiding like you COWARD!

I am a registered republican and voted for McCain and Romney. I just don't like slimy Tennessee Baptist Bastards like you that are illegal gun runners making it difficult for legal gun owners rights, that are also guaranteed in our Constitution

Come get me Tennessee Scum Bag.....I FUCKING DARE YOU!""


Here is another one

""I have a law degree and have passed the Tennessee Bar you Baptist moron! I am now retired and work for Bass Pro just for something to do cunt face. I pissed on better than you in Iraq after I blew it's fuck brains out too. COME and GET ME COWARD.....I will make you cry like the cunt coward you really are little boy!""

And another one:

""I plan to keep flagging and reporting ALL the constant ILLEGAL gun runners on this site and there is not a fucking thing you can do about it Tennessee Baptist Bastard Scumbag!

Now let me give you a law lesson cunt face......If you make 10 cents profit on a gun sale you need to be an FFL.  Buying and reselling or FLIPPING as it is known is against Federal Law......so come get me little man. I will make you famous and make you cry you ignorant asshole COWARD!

​
Did you know that Beretta is moving to Tennessee and we must clean up you scum to get the jobs they will offer. ""

And guess he is racist also.

""Hey pal.......any nigger in Knoxville can buy and sell you COWARD! Come see me.......are you SCARED......give me your phone number I will call you right now COWARD Baptist Cunt!"""

It is currently set up for musket caps, but have the conversion kits to use percussion or 209 primers as well. Has tru-glo ""iron"" sights. Purchased new around 8 years ago, but still in good condition. It is older technology, but accurate nonetheless. BEST OF ALL, IT HAS A TIMNEY TRIGGER. Does well with 100gr of 777 powder sticks and 240gr Hornady XTP bullets. I did a camo paint job on it because I didn't like the all black, but no working parts were painted and it hasn't showed any wear.

Early in 1969 the Model 60 was given its own serial number range by adding an R prefix. Serial numbers started at R1.

This revolver has no end shake, no rotation issues, no flame cutting, no case marks on the recoil shield, and the timing and lockup are spot on with no play. The bore and cylinder chambers are absolutely pristine. If you're a fan of S&W J-frame revolvers, you won't be disappointed with this one. Sadly, I do not have the box, original grips, original paperwork, VPI paper, or tool kit.

It has never been carried and is absolutely clean and like new.  The laser is factory supplied and the gun alone sold for $559.00.  The Crimson Trace laser is grip pressure activated, no switch to turn on. Comes with all original accessories including pistol rug, lock, and documentation.  Additionally will throw in 3 additional magazines (7 rd), all with pinky extenders, and a custom IWB leather holster.

I paid $559 for the pistol, and #38.99 for each additional magazine.  The holster was custom made and I paid $49.95 for it.  The total value of this package is $725.92 not including tax.  I'll let it go for $450.00 cash in Oldsmar area.  I will require a signed bill of sale to someone of legal age with a Florida Drivers license.  FL CWP would be nice as well.

My preference for trade would be for a Sig Sauer P238 0r 938,  but other equal trades will be seriously considered."

The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 3.8” Full-Size is the perfect pistol for those who want full-size performance in a slightly shorter package.
The XD(M)® 3.8″ Full-Size mates a 3.8″ barrel with a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and capacity you’d expect from a standard sized pistol, but with a shorter top end for easier carry. The XD(M)® is packed with features. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See what you’re missing and pick up an XD(M)® 3.8” Full-Size. It redefines what a polymer pistol can be.
