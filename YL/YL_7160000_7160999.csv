Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition."

If you live in the Stanford/Danville area, you can go to the dealer and do the 4473 and have it transferred directly to you. I work in NKY, and could meet you somewhere up here if you want me to pick it up and do it that way. Attached are stock photos of the gun from Sig. It will stay new in box until it's sold. MSRP on the gun is $772. The websites I can find it on are selling the gun for $650. I'm asking $600 cash. Not really interested in any trades at the moment. It would have to be heavily in my favor. Also, if we do a face to face transaction - I'll require a bill of sale with your drivers license info and chances are pretty good I'll show up in a marked state police cruiser so, if you're a felon, please don't offer to buy it. It didn't work out so well for the last guy. Thanks for looking. Feel free to ask any questions."

These are some of the first “Made in America” that were both single action and double action. A live round can be carried in the chamber with the safety on (the hammer is blocked) and all that is required to fire is flip the safety up and pull the trigger. This 9MM has a double stack magazine (1 supplied) that holds 14 rounds. Since it is all steel, there is much less felt recoil than some of today’s polymer framed pistols. The ambidextrous safety is supplied for either right or left hand shooters. I have added the Rosewood grips, standard plastic grips are included. There are some light scratches from holster wear over the past 20+ years but does not affect the operation of the pistol. This is one outstanding pistol to add to your collection."
