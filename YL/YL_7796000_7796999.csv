Metal finish is about 85% and its a good shooter with good rifling in the barrel. It also comes with a bayonet. The ammo is 500 rounds of russian surplus ball ammo in a 50 cal ammo can. Pricing is as follows:I will sell the entire lot for $500I will sell either rifle with half the ammo for $300 (no ammo can)I will sell either rifle alone for $250I will sell the ammo alone for $175AND FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME ANY EMAILS ASKING IF THE ITEMS ARE STILL AVAILABLE AS THESE WILL BE IGNORED AND IMMEDIATELY DELETED
