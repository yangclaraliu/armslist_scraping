It is fully rifled barrel and it ported towards the muzzle. Excellent shooting gun, with the scope it shoots 1/2"" group at 100yards.  I've owned it since I bought it new at gander mountain 10 years or so ago. I bring it out every fall and shoot a couple rounds to make sure it's still dialed in and oil it after the season and back in the safe it goes. I am asking $300 for the gun or if you want the scope it has on it currently it would be $375. It has a $200 Nikon either 2-7-32 or it's 3-7-30, I can't remember but I'll get it out and update this post  I'll also be adding pictures soon. The only thing I've done to this gun is I put on a paint job on the stock a few years ago instead of having just the black grayish stock that came with it. It is still a great shooter and for the past 3 years I've gotten deer with it from anywhere between 50 out to 150 yards.  Email me if you have any questions or you can text me at REDACTED  my name is Patrick, thanks for your time and interest."

The barrel break in procedure was strictly followed, and only Hornady 123 grain A-max and SST ammo was used. The weapon easily shoots sub MOA, with my best grouping about 0.76 MOA, but I believe it could be smaller if I was a better shot. I spent just shy of $2000 in the build. If you have any additional questions please feel free to ask!   Parts List: 1. Magpul enlarged trigger guard in stealth gray 2. Magpul PRS Gen 3 stock in stealth gray 3.

You can buy this complete package from me with only 50 rounds through it for $350.I am offering this excellent condition Springfield XD-S 9mm and the entire package shown in the picture as I move to keeping my older S&W revolvers as my carry conceal guns. I bought this XD-S in May of this year and didn't take it out to the range until August. I took it out one day when I was shooting my Kahr and put 50 rounds (25 Federal and 25 Hornady XTP self defense) through it for comparison purposes. They are both great shooters and reliable, with the XD-S having the advantage from a capacity aspect.This package includes the XD-S 9mm pistol and six stainless steel factory magazines (one 7 round, three 8 round, and two 9 round.) The 7 round and one of the 8 round magazines were used when I test fired the gun, but the two other 8 round and the two 9 round magazines have never been used.

The only marks are the standard wear on the top of the barrel hood, but that is something every Springfield (and Glock) I have seen show after the first dozen rounds.This XD-S came with a red tinted locking pin block. I thought it might have been a special model as the red tint looks pretty cool, but since my first XD-S didn't have this color I sent pics in an email to the Springfield factory. They indicated the red tint sometimes can occur during the bluing process, but they sent me a new one anyway. I had no reason to change it since it looks good and performs as it should so it comes in this package deal.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.

The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings.

All original.The Winchester Model 1897, also known as the Model 97, M97, or Trench Gun, was a pump-action shotgun with an external hammer and tube magazine manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.
The Model 1897 was an evolution of the Winchester Model 1893 designed by John Browning.
From 1897 until 1957, over one million of these shotguns were produced.
The Model 1897 was offered in numerous barrel lengths and grades, chambered in 12 and 16 gauge, and as a solid frame or takedown.
The 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of 28 inches, while 12-gauge guns were furnished with 30-inch length barrels.
Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as 20 inches, and as long as 36 inches.
Since the time the Model 1897 was first manufactured it has been used by American soldiers, police departments, and hunters."

The officer owned a huge collection of various type guns, so none of them saw much use. This particular revolver was fired on a few special outings, but never carried, and was eventually stored in a protective gun rug until it was sold.The serial number indicates this gun to be of late 1976-early 1977 vintage. It is a S&W factory nickel plated steel .38 Special with a 2"" pinned barrel, shrouded hammer, and five shot capacity. The gun is striking to admire, but it is also a wonderful shooter. I took it out to the gun range and put 25 rounds through it (have to shoot all of the vintage guns!) I was so impressed with both the single and double action trigger pull and accuracy. I can see why these Model 49's with the shrouded hammer were such popular carry conceal weapons by law enforcement officers.As was the case with many officer owned revolvers back then, this gun had its original grips taken off at initial purchase at an officer-frequented gun shop, discarded as many thousands were, and replaced with different grips. Those custom grips eventually found their way to a different revolver owned by the officer and another set of wood grips were put on this gun. I thought those grips were functional but not attractive, so I replaced them with some S&W grips I purchased so it now has the grips you see in the attached pictures that are nice but not numbered to the gun.This gun is in very nice condition. As with any nickel plated gun that has been shot or stored, there are a few handling marks on the gun but none that take away from its brilliant shine and eye appeal. The bore and chambers are bright, shiny, and clean. It is much too pretty for me to carry conceal, so I will carry a couple of S&W revolvers that have ""more character"" and won't mind a few more carry marks. In fact, I bought a blued and much less pristine condition Model 49 to use as part of my S&W revolver conceal carry rotation. This Model 49 will come enclosed in its very own Bore Stores fitted and treated gun rug.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.

T3x lite combines high performance with lightweight ease. The Lite models are equipped with the T3x synthetic stock and all new modular features. These models come with the classic low-angled grip. The classic T3x Lite has a blued barrel and all-black stock. Modular Stock T3x has a new modular synthetic stock that has interchangeable pistol grips, making it possible to modify the angle of the grip. This allows for multiple shooting positions. Additional grips are sold separately. The T3x synthetic stock also has an additional attachment point which allows you to change the width of the stock’s fore-end.   Improved grip A grip that never slips. The T3x synthetic stock has a new asymmetrical grip pattern and shape that has been specifically designed to give a solid grip in all conditions. New Recoil Pad T3x models come with a new recoil pad technology that reduces the impact of recoil on the shooter. The new robust pad allows you to fully concentrate on the accuracy of your shots.   Stock Noise Reduction Be as silent as the forest. T3x synthetic stocks now have a foam insert within the interior of the rear stock – this lowers the stock-generated noise and can help you keep your target in sight. Not available for models with an adjustable cheek piece.   Redesigned Ejection Port The new T3x receiver introduces a widened angular ejection port that makes it easier to feed one cartridge at a time.   Improved Rail Attachment Always keep the target in your sight. The T3x models have extra screw placements on top of the receiver so that you can robustly attach a picatinny rail – even when using larger scopes.   Metallic Bolt Shroud Robustness and quality go hand in hand. Metallic bolt shroud covers and shields the rear of the bolt body and the firing pin.   Steel Recoil Lug This extra-strong lug has minimal deformation – even with larger calibers. Compared to aluminium, the steel lug doesn't have strong imprinting qualities that would cause deformation when larger calibers are used."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

I took it out one day when I was shooting my Kahr and put 50 rounds (25 Federal and 25 Hornady XTP self defense) through it for comparison purposes. They are both great shooters and reliable, with the XD-S having the advantage from a capacity aspect.This package includes the XD-S 9mm pistol and six stainless steel factory magazines (one 7 round, three 8 round, and two 9 round.) The 7 round and one of the 8 round magazines were used when I test fired the gun, but the two other 8 round and the two 9 round magazines have never been used. This also comes with two interchangeable back-straps that allow you to custom fit your grip, a cable lock, and a bore brush, all inside of a lockable hard case. Caliber: 9mmWeight: 23 oz.Barrel: Melonite®; Fully Supported RampSights: Steel Dovetail Rear; Fiber Optic FrontSlide: Forged Steel, Melonite FinishFrame: Black PolymerOverall Height with Magazine: 4.4”Overall Length: 6.3”Overall Width: .9”This gun is in excellent condition, having been only fired one day before being cleaned and stored ever since in a treated gun rug. The only marks are the standard wear on the top of the barrel hood, but that is something every Springfield (and Glock) I have seen show after the first dozen rounds.This XD-S came with a red tinted locking pin block. I thought it might have been a special model as the red tint looks pretty cool, but since my first XD-S didn't have this color I sent pics in an email to the Springfield factory. They indicated the red tint sometimes can occur during the bluing process, but they sent me a new one anyway. I had no reason to change it since it looks good and performs as it should so it comes in this package deal.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.

You can buy this complete package from me with only the 200 break-in rounds through it for $250.I bought this Kahr CM in July of this year intending to make it my carry conceal gun. I bought an additional magazine (it is still new in package) and used the one that came with it and the additional one Kahr was offering. I also purchased and installed a new Hogue Handall Jr. rubber grip sleeve for the Kahr.This Kahr is in excellent condition and, while not new, is as nice as you will find in a used gun. Over the summer I put the suggested 200 break-in rounds through it (150 rounds of store bought Federal 9mm and 50 rounds of Hornady 9mm XTP hollow points) without a single issue and have stored it ever since.I have decided to carry my older S&W Model 49 and 36 S&W revolvers so I am offering this Kahr and a Springfield XD-S for sale.

The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine.The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate.

The officer owned a huge collection of various type guns, so none of them saw much use. This particular revolver was fired on a few special outings, but never carried, and was eventually stored in a protective gun rug until it was sold.The serial number indicates this gun to be of late 1976-early 1977 vintage. It is a S&W factory nickel plated steel .38 Special with a 2"" pinned barrel, shrouded hammer, and five shot capacity. The gun is striking to admire, but it is also a wonderful shooter. I took it out to the gun range and put 25 rounds through it (have to shoot all of the vintage guns!) I was so impressed with both the single and double action trigger pull and accuracy. I can see why these Model 49's with the shrouded hammer were such popular carry conceal weapons by law enforcement officers.As was the case with many officer owned revolvers back then, this gun had its original grips taken off at initial purchase at an officer-frequented gun shop, discarded as many thousands were, and replaced with different grips. Those custom grips eventually found their way to a different revolver owned by the officer and another set of wood grips were put on this gun. I thought those grips were functional but not attractive, so I replaced them with some S&W grips I purchased so it now has the grips you see in the attached pictures that are nice but not numbered to the gun.This gun is in very nice condition. As with any nickel plated gun that has been shot or stored, there are a few handling marks on the gun but none that take away from its brilliant shine and eye appeal. The bore and chambers are bright, shiny, and clean. It is much too pretty for me to carry conceal, so I will carry a couple of S&W revolvers that have ""more character"" and won't mind a few more carry marks. In fact, I bought a blued and much less pristine condition Model 49 to use as part of my S&W revolver conceal carry rotation. This Model 49 will come enclosed in its very own Bore Stores fitted and treated gun rug.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.

Available in a choice of the widely used caliber sizes of .308 Winchester or 300 Winchester Magnum, this platform provides high-precision performance and proven reliability. The .308 Winchester magazine holds 10 rounds and is available in either a 23.6-inch Heavy Barrel version or a 20-inch heavy barrel compact version. Both options feature a muzzle brake as well as a durable synthetic stock with an adjustable length-of-pull-- via stackable buttplate inserts-- and an adjustable cheek piece.As in other Steyr high-performance bolt-action rifles, the SSG 04 is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety's release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position. The receiver is topped with a Picatinny rail for optics mounting.Another feature in the SSG 04 is the 2-stage magazine securing mechanism that uses a first stage to lock the magazine in but allows the bolt to be operated without feeding rounds in the magazine, thereby providing the user with the options of dry-firing or loading individual rounds by hand while maintaining a full magazine at the ready. Simply pressing up on the bottom of the magazine seats it in the second stage, which is ready for auto-loading.The SSG 04 A1 is also available by special order. The SSG 04 A1 replaces the standard Picatinny rail with a shroud that is attached to the receiver and covers the barrel for the length of the forend. The shroud is topped with a full-length Picatinny rail, and two short rail segments are attached on the side of the shroud for mounting of accessories such as lights and or lasers.

Product Details:
The new 3x25 compact tactical scope is IOR's first scope model designed for AR-15 series weapons. Its integral flat-top mount, offers out-of-the-box compatibility with Civilian A3 and M4 carbines, and it attaches directly to any 1913 Picatinny rail for use on a variety of other systems as well. The 3x25 tactical scope has a new .223 62 gr. BDC Knob from 100 to 500 yds. with 50 yds. fine adjustment clicks; windage knob has 1/4 moa finger adjustments and provides precise corrections on small arms in most sizes and calibers, for various ranges. The illuminated center dot is extremely accurate for long range applications and the MIL lines under the center dot could be used by experienced shooters, as fast bullet drop compensating marks or for quick ranging. All of these features make this compact CQB-type tactical scope significantly superior to any red dot or EOtech type scopes, especially at long range, due to its higher magnification, incomparable image quality, field of view, adjustable reticule image and reliability. This scope will function perfectly even with a dead battery. When the illumination is off, all the reticule lines appear in standard black and are razor sharp. Also, our scope can be used with both eyes open, with reticule illumination ""ON"" and front lens cap closed. The 3x25 tactical scope features a fully-illuminated reticule w/7 brightness levels for day/night use as well as a unique, 3-position, detachable Picatinny accessory collar for mounting lights, lasers and other accessories. Battery type - 2032. Lifetime on battery=38 hours continuous use on level 7. Regular use = approx.. 2 years.

It kills me to sell I planned much more fun with this rifle but need to cover my ridiculous auto insurance price. The reddish marking you see above the grip is where I wrote on it with a marker and began removing but decided to let you finish so I don't remove the finish. I stained the stock and put a few fun stickers and hand wrapping on handle for laughs which I will let you remove as well in case I end up keeping it. Internals and bolt have been polished, this is an incredibly smooth and well made WASR completely strait and ridiculously accurate with the iron sights. It has the original mag as well as the tapco it came with. If I can find the little cleaning kit I will obviously give with it. Local pickup only prefer txt as I work/sleep odd hours or can call REDACTED. If I don't answer give it a bit and continue trying. I will remove post when sold."

This firearm was only manufactured in 1940/1941,with a grand total of 900 being made. Most went to the British Navy. However, I do know that some of these rare firearms are located here,in the United States. I had a very good friend that owned (2) of these,a few years ago. He lived here in Indiana and sold them to someone from around Indiana,before he passed away. I got this magazine from the previous owner. I don't believe it's ever been inserted into a weapon.
