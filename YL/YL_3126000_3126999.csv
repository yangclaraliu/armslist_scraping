Round count is around 120. I don't use it as much as I thought I would. It is easily capable of sub-moa groups. I'm sure it could be dialed in even better with hand-loads. 

Includes: 
-Savage Hog hunter rifle
-SWFA SS 6x42 mil/mil scope
-Sunshade
-Butler creek scope caps
-Weaver 20 moa scope base
-A2 style .308 flash hider and lock nut
-Harris lightweight 9-13"" bipod
-Sling
-Cheek rest
-160 rounds of 180 gr. federal fusion
-190 rounds of Fiocchi 180 gr. soft points
-40 rounds of 180 gr Winchester soft points
-40 rounds of Herter's 150 gr fmj (I haven't shot any of these through this rifle, but I have them)   


This setup has been put together and maintained with extreme care. All screws have been torqued down evenly and blue locktite was used. The scope, base and level have been checked and are perfectly level.  

The 6x42 SWFA scope is a very tough and reliable with excellent light transmission. It is the 6x version of a military 10x scope. I prefer the 6x for the wider field of view and adequate magnification out to any distance that the .308 is still useful.

The savage hog hunter is a great, handy platform with an excellent trigger. It features a medium profile barrel and a tight 1/10 twist rate that does well with heavier projectiles.     

I put this together to be a sort of middle ground between a scout rifle and a sniper rifle. It can do anything you would want a bolt gun to do out to 1000 yards. 

This setup would run about $1450 to put together (including the ammo).
I'm asking $1,150 cash or $1,250 trade value. 

I may concider selling the rifle and the ammo seperatly. Just ask.

The shelves are adjustable, you can shelf the whole thing or shelf one side and put rifles in the other. Or... use both sides for rifles. One side is shaped like a u to where it is easier to get to rifles that are used more often, the other is in rows with one row in front of the other.

Lol, plus it was made the same year Stalin died. 1953.

The ammunition for these is available at Ron Peterson Guns among other places. I saw they had at least 50 boxes of it on Thursday. Ammo resupply is not a problem. This is a hot round and shoots very fast. below I am providing a couple of links in case you don't know this round. this pistol is the last of my Tokarev collection. They are known to be reliable, accurate, and extremely powerful. 

Condition on this one is great.

Contact me through Armslist with your phone number and we can arrange to meet here in Santa Fe so you can see it. these guns are a lot of fun, and very flat. You can get holsters for them very cheap, or any military Colt 1911 holster will also work.

Both shoot 7.62x39.I took it all apart and had all the metal pieces plated except the bolt and the inside of the barrel. It was plugged with rubber plugs to prevent any plating from getting inside. The gas tube was disassembled and plated black nickel to give it a two tone look. The trigger assembly is 24ct gold plated over nickel. The 30 rd mag was taken apart and nickel plated, oiled and put back together. The receiver, barrel, sights, bolt carrier, carrier cover and even flash suppressor was nickel plated then oiled and reassembled. Everything is super clean and oiled like new and nickel plating will last a lot longer than any bluing would and makes the action smoother with less friction.
Has an adjustable Tapco two tone dark earth synthetic stock with picitinny rails on top and bottom which has a sure fire flashlight mounted to it for display. $100 extra if you wanted it. It was over $200 new and is way cool. Has 4 mags 1- 30 rd metal and 3 - 20 rd dark earth tapco 2 brand new in package that match the stock. It says lifetime warranty on the packages. These are all included. 2 nickel plated stripper clips filled with hollow points and the hard case also included. I have more ammo on nickel stripper clips available also.

The rifle is a very nice shooter, although I have not shot it much because ammo is hard to find. The rifle has a nice boar with strong rifling. The rifle has a beautiful mum which adds to value significantly. The rifle was produced at the Tokyo Arsenal, and is one of the finest examples of a type 38 I have ever seen.

None of this ammo is easy to find anymore:   

40 rounds Hungarian Silver/Yellow tip. This ammo has a 182 grain steel core bullet.    
It hits much harder than the light ball that's currently available, and it penetrates like crazy.   
It also shoots a good deal more accurately in my Mosins.   

40 rounds Russian 7N1 Sniper. This ammo was developed by the Russian Military to have a much more accurate round for their snipers. Ammo loaded with a special 152 grain FMJ boat tail bullet. Bullet has a steel core, then an empty air space followed by a lead knocker in the base. Upon impact the lead knocker moves forward destabilizing the bullet causing a very severe wound. This ammo shoots significantly tighter groups in all my rifles including the bolt actions. The paper outer wrapper is stamped with the Cyrillic word for Sniper.   

20 rounds East German M39 ammo. This ammo has an all black color 124 grain steel jacketed, steel core bullet. It was originally designed as practice ammo for their machine guns. The concept was that the lighter bullet would travel less far. It is however a full power round and will penetrate 1/4"" steel plate at 100 yards. Recoil is greatly reduced due to the lighter bullet making it perfect for anyone who is sensitive to recoil.    

20 rounds Bulgarian brass case with a 149 grain magnetic bullet. Ammo is from the mid 50's but looks like it was made yesterday. It's super clean ammo and I've always felt brass cased ammo operated more smoothly than the steel case stuff.   

$100 picked up in the Brandon area. Buyer must be at least 18 to purchase this ammo. I can ship this vis UPS ground at buyers expense."

It's a left-handed model, and comes with the 22"" non-threaded barrel.  I have installed a Yo Dave trigger shim kit, and mounted a Mueller 4x14 mil dot scope.  When fed properly (Wolf or SK ammo), this rimfire has been an MOA shooter (sometimes better, provided the nut behind the bolt can do their part)!  These guns will keep up with the big dogs (Anshutz, for example), and cost a fraction of the price!  Also, this will come with 1 5rd magazine (just like from the factory).  The only reason I am selling is to fund the purchase of a CZ 452 Lux (left handed, of course).  I would be open to trade for a lefty Lux in .22lr if you have one!  Let me know if you have any questions.

It has been properly cleaned after firing, and kept in a humidity controlled safe.  
It has Tru Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Night Sights and an extended mag release installed in it now, with the original parts included in the box if you want to return it to stock:
Here are links to the upgraded parts currently installed on the gun:
Tru Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Night Sights

TangoDown Vickers Extended Mag Release
http://www.brownells.com/handgun-parts/frame-parts/magazine-release-parts/magazine-releases/vickers-extended-mag-release-for-glock--prod25364.aspx
I chose this extended mag release because it is just a tiny bit longer than stock, so it doesn’t stick out and get in the way like most of the other extended magazines do, and is nicely rounded off so there are no sharp edges.
Sale also Includes the Original Glock Tupperware Case, and a copy of the original sales receipt from West Coast Armory in Bellevue WA,dated 12/30/2012.

3 – 9 Round Factory Glock 27 Magazines (2 of which are still in the original packaging) 
Since I only fired about 400 rounds in total, they are as good as new, just like the gun)


If you were to buy this package at the store, you would pay approximately:
Gun: 525.00
Night Sights: 89.99
Extended Magazine Release: 16.99 =631.98
And you would have to add on 9.5% Tax (About 60.00)
The total to buy this would be $691.98 at the gun store, so you'll save almost 200.00!


500.00 Cash only, FIRM.   This is a GREAT deal, and you won’t find a better used G27 than this one.
It has great upgrades, so it is ready to go right now!

I setup the rifle for my fiance ,but she decided she wanted a tavor instead. There has been no rounds fired besides the bullets fired for factory testing. I bought this upper specifically because they can eat any ammo. they are test fired at the Black rifle arms with wolf steel ammo. I own another upper just like it and it loves anything you feed into it. They best part about it is the short stroke piston makes for easy cleanup at the end of the day.

These are going new at Academy for 319.99 and new at Bass Pro Shop for 339.99. Selling this one for $310.00 no tax and it will come with 2 partial boxes of shells. I have Hornady Super Performance 130 grain SST quantity 8 and Winchester Super X 130 grain Quantity 12, so 20 rounds in all. I also have the original box, plastic, gun lock, and paperwork for this rifle.

It is in great condition with a few small scratches, but nothing that is noticeable or bad. It's a small cosmetic damage for normal wear. You won't even notice it unless you are looking for it. It has been shot, and has had around 800 rounds through it."

Comes with two front ballistic inserts and two back ballistic inserts for added protection. Although it looks like it could hold a common pistol round such as a 9mm it is not NI of Justice rated and I do not recommend relying solely on this vest to stop a round. ""The CVC Body armor was mostly issued to Tank and Bradly crews It is for framentation protection and is not rated to stop bullets. The CVC Armor (Combat Vehicle Crewman) was nice from a Mobility standpoint in regards to being inside the tight Turret of an M1 tank. But most crews switched to PASGT and then the later issued Interceptor to get greater coverage. The current conflict like all past conflict's is inflicting the greatest amount of injuries by fragmentation thru RPG,s IEDs Mortars, etc only a smaller percentage are getting shot with rifle rounds. Armor crewman don't need SAPI/Rifle protection as they are riding in it so they were issued these CVC vests."""

I bought this sight unseen ""as is"" 2 years ago  and was told it just needed the cord replaced. It ended up being the entire pull starter assembly, $43 worth of parts plus shipping from generatorguru.com 

http://generatorguru.com/recoil-pull-starter-assembly-REDACTED95/

I ended up just buying a new generator on sale last winter and had forgotten about this one until recently. 

I'd like my money back out of this and hopefully someone who might have a compatible  pullstarter assembly could use this. I'm selling it ""as is"" since I've never started it or been able to use it since it's missing the entire pull start assembly. 

Open to firearm trades, I can add cash if your trade is worth more then my project generator. Let me know what you have to trade ."

I have a Weber Beartooth (traditional) A-style mandolin for trade. This was made in 2003 and was the top of the line Weber A-style mandolin when it was being built. It was the precursor to their current Fern A-style and is essentially the same mandolin. This is a extremely high quality professional grade mandolin. There are a couple small nicks (in lacquer only) by the treble f-hole.....other then that it is close to perfect. Frets are in great shape and it sounds and plays awesome! I am setting trade value at 1500.00 (it is actually worth more then that) I can send more pics upon request.

Iit comes with two 16 round magazines, the original box, paperwork, test fired shell & red lock.

Background:  My buddy bought this new before Christmas 2013 for $350.  Life happens, he fell on hard times in March so I bought the SD9 from him  for $300 with the understanding he could buy it back any time before June for the same money.

Its now June, he still doesn't have any money & I'm more of a Glock or old wheel gun guy. Essentially looking to get my money back - $300.  New they're still running $350 + tax.  Over the web is cheaper but shipping and FFL fees put you back to the same money. My price is basically a $75 savings over new.

Not really interested in trades but might consider it if you have a cool old wheel gun or something decent.  No JUNK though.  

Oh for the scammers and spammers, I wont ship, only sell face to face in the daylight at a public place with a bill of sale or can go through a FFL if you want but you're paying the fee's."
