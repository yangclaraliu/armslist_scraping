The circle is 1/2 in in diameter, two touching in the bullseye with the other 1/2 inch off; not bad for a soft point bullet.  The scope is a brand new Leupold VX3i 4.5-14x40mm.  This scope is amazing!  Killed a nice 4x3 at dusk this year at 230 yards in November.  I don't have to sell the gun, but my dad gave me a classic for Christmas and I want to stick with one big game gun.  Sighted in at 150 years.  Ready to hunt.  Will sell without the scope for $425 Text me at REDACTED."

The stock is constructed from rugged composite in Flat Dark Earth, with grooves and texturizing on the pistol grip and fore-end, which provide a solid, non-slip grip in any environment. The stock features molded-in Power Bedding® recoil/bedding blocks to rigidly attach the barreled action to the stock and free-float the barrel. A rubber recoil pad absorbs recoil considerably. The Ranch model features a shorter barrel to aid in quick handling, and comes threaded (11/16""-24) with a factory mounted Ruger muzzle brake. The barrel is cold hammer-forged, resulting in ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy. A 3-lug bolt design with a 70° lift provides plenty of clearance between the bolt handle and the riflescope. A 2-position tang safety is easily accessible and quick to operate by both right- and left-handed shooters; the bolt can be cycled for loading and unloading the rifle with the safety engaged. A cocking indicator at the end of the bolt can be seen and felt. A detachable, single-column box magazine aids in rapid reloading. The American Rifle Ranch Bolt-Action Rifle comes with a drilled and tapped receiver, mounted with a Picatinny rail.  Ruger American Ranch Great Condition Caliber: 450 Bushmaster Bolt Action"

The lower or frame is a aftermarket stainless steel frame with Wilson Combat parts. The trigger is nice and smooth. Full length s.s guide rod. The only reason I have it listed is because I found another one I want in 45acp. I just like the 45acp round better than the 9mm. The grips are Magpul if you don't like them I have other grips I can swap out for you. I would like to deal with ccw holders but you must atleast show me a valid Ohio I.D and be of legal age. All laws apply. I can send more pics if interested thank you.

It comes with 4 Ruger 15 round magazines, original case and equipment as well as a Uncle Mikes OWB Holster. I'm asking $300 firm for this and won't go lower. I can be reached via cell  : REDACTED"

It launches perfectly straight and predictable - you can either overpower the tires all the way up or learn how to launch it for almost wheels up weight transfer traction. It foot brakes to about 2500, converter comes in all the way around 3500, and the shift light is set for 5700 - all of that happens very quickly with only a couple seconds in first 2 gears (often less in first) and top end in another 5-7 seconds. Have dyno video with 400 RWH with way more advance to go which is at the most conservative a mere 6.7 lbs per hp - that is pretty darn goodIt has excellent 4 wheel disc brakes and stops hard and steers and corners firmly with big 16 inch performance tires on the front and 275/16 M&H Dragmaster Drag Radials out backIt drives extremely well with all new suspension pieces and large 16 in wheels and tires and has plenty of power. It doesn't smoke or overheat - you can sit in traffic or cruises and it never gets past the 180s on the temp gauge - it is a very reliable driver and a serious drag truck for not a lot of money. It has 3.73 gears so you are not killing the motor on the street and it has a suprising 60 foot time and quick top out in each gear with that ratio.An important point - Most vehicles like this have gone through dozens of high school graduating classes and have been wrecked, painted and repainted numerous times over shoddy bodywork and in the hands of novice mechanics and abusive drivers over the last 32 years - not this one - this truck was pro built with a complete frame off restoration and modification build and adult owned since completed - We have pictures of the truck before it was touched and it was definitely in survivor condition. Most of these type trucks are cobbled together sketchy builds typically sourcing a worn out truck and combining it with a worn out stock V8 engine - not this one - if that is the price point you are looking for then I'm sure you will find one that needs tons of work and will likely cost more in the long runThe total cost to date is well over the sale price offered here - Anyone with a Summit or Jegs catalog can walk around this truck and easily add up over $30,000 worth of speed parts alone. Just the Billet Holley Double Pumper, braided fuel lines, liquid filled Fuel Pressure Gauge and throttle return springs was a $1000. Just the aftermarket things you see in the cab, the AutoMeter Speedo, Shift Light Tach, Instruments, Grant GT Steering Wheel and Hurst QuarterStick was over a $1100 - the list goes on and on....The asking price is cheap compared to just the labor put in on this build - No matter what this sale is a give away - you could not build this car for what I am asking even if someone gave you a clean S-10 to start with for free!The truck is a turn key running, driving, licensed vehicle - Please only respond if you are familiar with this type of vehicle and know what you are looking at I will only reply to messages with a phone number so please include one - I have a full website with details and tons of pictures for people we speak with on the phone so I can go over everything in detail - Thanks"
