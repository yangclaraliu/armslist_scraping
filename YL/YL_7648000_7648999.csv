It's had approximately 300 rounds fired from it. The blueing is in good condition and it's been oiled and cleaned every 4 months while in storage. This gun is made for competition and is a joy to shoot.The rifle comes with a 3-9x40 scope, it isn't the stock scope. I'd say it's slightly better than the original, I paid about $45 for it. It also comes with a bipod that I paid about $40 for. Ill also throw in 100 rounds of .22lr.The barrel has a recessed crown to protect it from damage and the fluting looks phenomenal. It has the acutrigger which can easily be adjusted down to 2.5 pounds, very crisp trigger.At 100 yards I usually have groups about 1.5 inches, at 50 yards I have 5 round groups that make one ragged hole rather routinely.  This will depend on your shooting skills of course but its deadly accurate.Im sad to see this go but I have other hobbies that need funding."

168,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7648168,For Sale:  NAVY ARMS GIBBS SUMMIT .45-70,"Blacksburg, Roanoke, Virginia",$ 900,"Listed On: Friday, December 1, 2017",Rifles,no type,45-70 Government                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"As I close in on the end of my seventh decade I continue to ""thin the herd"" of my collection. The next item on the block is a near-new Gibbs Rifle Company (Navy Arms) ""Summit"" carbine in caliber .45-70.  This gun is the subject of an essay and review I wrote for “Magnum Magazine” (South Africa) a few years ago: you can read the article here: http://www.nrvoutdoors.com/GIBBS/GIBBS%20SUMMIT.htm It is in fact ""The Ultimate Lee-Enfield.""  What Navy did was take old No. 4 Mark I actions and rehab them into functional rifles, chambered for the .45-70, and came up with a winner.  Alas they ran out of actions to rebuild and the ""Summit"" was only made for a short time.  They are quite scarce today: only a few hundred were made according to what Gibbs told me. The “Frontier” carbine was made on the weaker #1 Mark III action but the Summit is built on a No. 4 Mark I action, far and away the strongest of the Lee-Enfield series: much stronger than the #1 Mark III's.  No. 4's were successfully adapted to .308 Winchester after World War Two, and are amply strong for anything in the .45-70 line. This rifle is a real bruiser, and there is nothing in North America (and precious little in Africa) you can't kill with it.   It will stand up to loads that are in the .450 Marlin's territory: my reloads fired a 350-grain JSP bullet at 1950+ FPS.  Stuff that would wreck a Trapdoor Springfield are not a problem for it: the No. 4 action is intended for ammunition developing 45,000+ PSI. Any commercial .45-70 ammunition, including the hot stuff Buffalo makes, is suitable.With the rifle comes a set of Lee reloading dies, and an RCBS trim die to maintain case length. There is a good bit of loaded ammunition (some of it fairly hot loads as described) and a bunch of cast bullets.  There are 33 500-grain and 54 350-grain bullets (both intended to use gas checks). Some once-fired .45-70 brass is included the mix:  32 once-fired cases and 34 NEW cases by Starline, plus 9 once fired R-P cases. Just add some primers and powder and you're set. The Summit was sold with a decent set of open sights, but my eyes aren’t up to open sights anymore, so they have been replaced with a fully adjustable Williams rear peep sight and a ""Firesight"" front. I also have a scope mount for it.  I have hunted with this gun and it kills whitetails like a lightning bolt.  It would knock the snot out of a feral hog. If you have a trip to Alaska planned, this is what you want for those moose or brown bears! Even if you just have the odd buffalo or bear wandering around your property and leaving droppings on your lawn...this rifle will solve your problem. I really don't want to sell it but I've had my fun with it and it needs to go to a good home. This is a fairly rare rifle, and in general bolt action .45-70's are very desirable items.  Now for the conditions of the sale: I have unfortunately had people try to scam me with fake “cashier’s checks,” or checks for more than the sale price. So the ONLY acceptable method of payment is a US Postal Money Order. No personal or certifed checks, no other forms of money order, no cashier’s checks. I can ship it, but it will have to go to an FFL licensed dealer: a C&R license won’t do. I must have a paper copy of the FFL, signed in ink, and it will be verified with BATF befor e shipping. I WILL ONLY SHIP TO THE DEALER’S LICENSED PREMISES. I don’t make money on shipping: I will give as good an estimate of shipping cost as I can once I have your FFL holder’s address, and you will pay actual costs."

I already have a P-01 which is the same size but without the steel frame. At 5″ tall with a barrel length of just under 4″, the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4″ off the length and about 1/2″ off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line. More pics available...

Has LPS 4x6 TIP2 scope with Dragunov range finding reticle- will do 1300 meters. Very accurate- I've plinked softball sized AR500 discs at 500 meters with it. Has 5 10-rd magazines and mag pouch that holds 4 of them, scope cover, sling, and about a half a Spam Can of the appropriate ammo- Russian Silver tipped armor piercing steel core- steel cased non corrosive primed. Do your research- these rifles are no longer being imported and are getting harder to find- and when you do- good luck finding spare mags. REALLY hate to sell, as this is one of my ""dream guns"" but my truck took a dump and I need wheels. 2200 firm for all. Scope is mounted and currently zeroed for 500 meters. If you're not familiar, I can show you how to zero it for any distance you like. I'm not interested in any trades and I will not ship it- not even to your out of state FFL. No paypal. No scams. And don't waste me time lowballing- Everything together is worth 2500 or better and again- they're no longer being imported.Don't ask me about how many rounds have been through it- I've put abount half a spam can through it. Having a gun and not shooting it because you want to keep the round count low is like not taking your ol' lady to bed because you wanna keep her fresh for the next guy. We can meet at a range for a demonstration if you're that picky. Better make it a long range- I'm not screwing up my zero for window shoppers & time wasters. Everything is original, the scope is true & retains the zero through multiple shots, and the wood furniture is flawless. She went from my safe to my dragbag to the range and right back in the dragbag to go home, get cleaned, and go back in the safe every week for a year when I lived in Arizona and had access to a 1000m range. Now she rests in my climate controlled safe. Iron sights under the scope for anything 300m & closer. If you're wanting to break into long range shooting, this is a great start. Again- 1900 firm gets it all. Face to face transfer only in public. Will gladly meet at an FFL and/or range. Bring ID and cash. CHL and/or military ID preferred. Willing to meet in/around Austin, San Antonio, or Houston areas. I'm not driving to Dallas, El Paso, Lubbock, etc."

The original owner was a family friend who shot the gun maybe three times at the range, 50 or so rounds in total. He purchased the gun in his 60s to ""collect"", so it stayed stored for many years. I bought it about five years ago because he was selling off his collection, but I have never fired it. He had a Thompson/Center Arms 3-9x scope professionally mounted and zeroed. The scope model number is 8626 and it has a lighted duplex reticle (illuminated crosshair). The rifle includes a total of six Browning brand magazines (as rare now as the gun). Three are the standard 5-round magazines and three are 15-round magazines. I also have the original boxes for both the rifle and the scope.
I will do a local sale only, too much to pack & ship. We can arrange to meet at a local gun dealer if you want to examine the rifle. Note that I don't check email every minute so please don't send requests to meet ""tomorrow"", as it's usually already tomorrow before I red the email.Thanks!"

I have shot it and it shoots like a dream. Has the smoothest trigger i have ever felt on any AK. The front sight block has been replaced with a polytech Chinese imported spiker assembley. This is NOT a polytech made in the USA sold today. The Chinese did not drill oit the detent pin hole on there exported spiker assemblies. They also use a lot more sand in there castings resulting in a grainy finished product. The stock set is a polytech Chinese Chu-wood for the 56 spiker. There is not a scratch or ding anywhere. The barrel was not turned down like on most mak 90s but threaded to accept the correct polytech muzzle nut. You want find a nicer MAK 90 anywhere or one that has been converted to 56 spiker with all the correct parts. Comes with 2 30 round china stamped magazines and one polytech 3 witness hole chrome follower poly china magazine. Also one 40 round NOS stamped made in China magazine. If you know anything about AK mags you know what the poly mags sell for and its never been inserted in a rifle. It is NOS. If you want to try it before you trade no problem just bring your own ammo and have at it. Thanks for lookiing.

Most all of these guns were made in the 4"" Barrel Length- (probably due to their popularity with Law Enforcement of the day), while others were manufactured in the 2.5"" 'Snubby' version. It's pretty uncommon to find Model 19's with a 6"" Barrel- and most all of those I've seen have the squared off Patridge Style Front Sights, while this All Original example has the Baughman no snag 'Quick Draw' Front Sight usually reserved for the shorter Barrel Lengths. It also has the White Outline Rear Sight, and the easy to see Red Ramp Insert in the Front Sight. The Grips are extra nice Goncalo Alves Wood; and everything is proper to the gun. This one has a Nicely Polished Deep Bluing that is only thinning on a little on a few of the high spots, and is completely free of rust or pitting. Hammer and Trigger are Case Hardened as they should be, and both the Single/Double Actions are Silky Smooth...even among other S and W's of this Vintage. The Six Inch Heavy Barrel adds just the right balance to the S and W 'K' Frame Revolvers, along with a little extra 'oomph' to the velocity and accuracy. I once saw a poor Jack Rabbit scampering across the Texas Panhandle at about 100 yds. while I had this pistol with me, and wondered if I could hit it. Poor bunny never had a chance. Now I almost feel sorry; as I don't see any Jack Rabbits around anymore. This would make an excellent Hunting Revolver or Long Range Plinker as it loves both .38 Specials and 'reasonably' loaded .357 Magnum Ammo.These long discontinued Smith and Wesson Model 19s are True American Classic that hold their own, (as well as their Value) against anything made in recent years. This one is in Excellent Mechanical and Condition, with Super Tight Lock-Up. Asking $675 Cash, and I'll throw on a very nice Vintage Lined Holster made by Ross Leather of Capetown, South Africa made for this gun."

Also has Extended Mag and slide release, with the Detroit Tigers logo on the cover plate. The gun has a bit of holster wear in the front.
