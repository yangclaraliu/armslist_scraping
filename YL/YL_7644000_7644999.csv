The result is a compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight. Let's play who is the moron.  Here are your options:1. the idiot that lists on Armslist a used version of this firearm for $$$$ more than what I am asking for BNIB;2. the guy that pays that for the used one; or3. me for selling brand new fireams at such incredibly low prices.My wife picks #3 (but for totally unrelated reasons)."

The wife really liked the feel of this gun. Short, light and compact. Thought she wanted a .30 cal. All until she fired the first shot out of it, HA HA!!! She is use to shooting bigger guns but the recoil on it is a little sharper than she expected. I though about keeping it for myself to shoot lions or bears but decided I perfer a lever gun or pistol for that. What I'm getting at is that this rifle was brand new never fired until she shot the first shot out of it. Only had 1 round down the barrel. I don't have the box or anything for it. Will throw in a box of ammo which isnt expensive at all at 30-40 bucks and its ballistic compare to a .300 wsm or a .300 magnum. Not a single scratch, ding or anything. Oh, and photo is a stock photo. I'm not always around my email so text if you are interested. REDACTED.........................600 obo"

It was produced by Star Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A. in Spain. Although it looks like the classic M1911, its design is different in several respects. For example, the Star does not have the 1911's grip safety. In addition, the thumb safety on the Star disengages the sear, whereas it blocks the motion of the sear on a 1911. The pistol is fed by an 8-round detachable box magazine.  Includes factory box (may or may not # match to pistol - all boxes are pretty rough shape anyway), 1 eight round mag, manual in (spanish), and cleaning rod.  Finish is about 85% on all. At the time of this listing, I have three of them.  All were believed to be made in 1977. Mechanics look excellent in all, and all appear to function well.  Although I am not sure, I think they are surplus Spanish law enforcement pistols.  Most of the production was for law enforcement and military (used in Spain, Rhodesia, and other Countries).  I actually cleaned and took one to the range a few times.  Works great.  They came with the magazine safety, which means the pistol will not fire with out the magazine loaded.  In the one I used, I disconnected that feature, and if requested, can re-engage it.  I found that feature to offer little to nothing in added safety, and to be annoying.  Combat tested design.  Small enough for conceal carry."

I disputed purchase and received some credit back.WILL I TRADE? Trades will unlikely be considered. However, if you wish to make an offer, do so in your initial communication. Understand that I prefer the cash.PRICING: Pricing is firm. The price is VERY reasonable - almost half the actual retail cost of the firearm.

This is an excellent, heavy duty rifle scope that is sadly no longer produced by Leupold. It is the perfect accessory to an AR-15 (Or even a tactical shotgun), and was designed by Leupold for close quarters engagements. Also included is a LaRue Tactical LT106 Quick Detach mount that allows the optic to be removed and replaced extremely quickly and with no impact on your zero. The CQ/T also features an illuminated reticle that's powered by a AA battery, making replacements very easy to find. I've owned this scope for around 7 years, and it is still in practically new condition. Unfortunately, I don't have a rifle to put it on at the moment, and I'm sure someone else can find great use out of it for one of theirs. This scope is built like a tank and will serve you well for years to come.The usual disclaimer: Please inquire only if interested in purchasing this, no scams (as if that will stop anyone), and et cetera.

In the third picture, you can see the original configuration of the rifle and compare to see the upgrades I've performed to it. The rifle features a Midwest Industries free float MLOK handguard, Faxon industries Low Profile Gas Block, Strike Industries Viper Mod-1 Stock (With rubber buttpad), UTG Pro Mil-spec 6-position buffer tube, Bravo Company GunFighter Charging handle (Medium latch), Bravo Company Gunfighter pistol grip, and Troy Industries QD Sling swivel endplate. All items were carefully installed per manufacturer specifications and, if applicable, at recommended torque values. Additionally, during the installation of the low-pro gas block, the barrel was dimpled by a professional machinist in order to prevent the gas block from twisting or becoming unaligned.As with all well-built AR-15's, this rifle shoots minute of angle or sub minute of angle depending on the quality of the ammunition used. I have fired approximately 700 rounds through this rifle with no malfunctions, the last 400 of which occured after all upgrades were installed. This is an excellent AR that features all of the modern upgrades you might want, including a surprisingly nice two-stage trigger from the factory. This slick looking rifle is everything I want in an AR-15, but in my constant quest to spend more money, I've decided I want to build a rifle from scratch. Take advantage of that, and get an excellent rifle that features several hundred dollars worth of upgrades.Included is the factory rear flip up sight (I do not have a front sight to go with it, as the rifle's original front sight was part of the factory gas block), two 30 round Magpul PMAGS, and the factory hard plastic case with foam lining.The usual disclaimer: Please inquire only if interested, no scams (as if that will stop anyone), and et cetera. I strongly prefer face-to-face transactions if at all possible, but I am willing to consider shipping if necessary. If you're interested, please feel free to ask me any questions you have or want to make an offer. Thank you for your time, and good shooting."
