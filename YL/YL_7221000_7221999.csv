BOTH Cartridge & Percussion Pistol!
 
Here we present an antique Williamson Deringer, made circa 1866 in Brooklyn, New York. David Williamson was the inventor of this unique design that was meant to be the stopgap between a time when the benefits of cartridge pistols were obvious and desirable, but ammunition supply in certain places was questionable. He chambered his Deringer for the .41 rimfire cartridge, but included a small adapter that allowed the user to use it as a percussion pistol as well. The hammer was such that it would strike the percussion cap if the adapter was being used (see the hole in the center of the breech face), but also had a rimfire striker when that ammunition was used. Fewer than 10,000 of these were made between the Moore’s Patent Fire Arm Company and National Fire Arm Company. Per Flayderman, many are believed to have been thrown away based on the inherent weakness in the curve of the walnut stock.
 
This specimen is in overall good condition. The barrel has a dark patina. The markings are clear. Serial numbers match. The Williamson is known for a weakness in the curve of the stock. This one has been repaired. The bore is in good condition. The action is fair.
 
This is a legitimate antique and not a reproduction.
 
Barrel is 2-1/2 inches in length.
 
Caliber: .41 rimfire AND .41 percussion
 
Bore is in good condition. The firing mechanism is fair.
 
Overall condition as seen in photos.
 
This pistol is in form much like the percussion Deringers that Henry Deringer himself made, but the technology was changing and Williamson was there to bridge the gap.

Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.The receiver is also coated with Teflon™ for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.  The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics."

Please read the description of each that you are interested in. 1. Vortex Viper PST 4-16x50mm FFP(First Focal Plane) Gen 1 with illuminated RETICLE, EBR1 MOA SCOPE. if you have questions about the features/details of the scope, the PN is PST-416F1-A. You can Google any questions you might have as you will probably find a better answer there. This scope is in excellent condition, there is not a scratch on it and it functions flawlessly. I have only had it mounted to a 223 for Prarie dog hunting. I bought a new scope and no longer need this one so I am selling it. I am not in a hurry to sell so all low ball offers will be ignored, I am pretty firm on the price. And, it's a vortex so if there is ever anything wrong with it, it'll be taken care of by there amazing warranty. I also have vortex flip up lens covers which were an extra 40-50 bucks, those will be included and the attachment on the zoom ring is a coaster for rapid zoom changes if needed, it works great but you can take it off if you don't like it. I have all of the original packaging and accessories as well. I am asking $750 for the scope, if you want the Burris QD PEPR mount, it will be an extra $1002. Sightmark Ultrashot Pro - This red dot is in good to excellent condition, there are a couple of dings but nothing very noticeable. Everything on this red dot works great, I just upgraded to a nicer optic so I don't need this one. Asking $75. 3. NC STAR 6-24 X 50 scope. This scope is in excellent condition. Just don't need it anymore. Asking $504. Older Simmons spotting scope, works fine in fair to good condition, small rattle inside but again, works like it should. - $305. Red Dot magnifier with mount. - El cheapo, but still works, I had it on my 16"" coyote gun and it worked fine, you could modify the mount or put the optic on a better mount and you would be pretty happy, the mount is the weakest link. - $30If you are emailing about a particular item, please put that item in the subject line. Thanks"

Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application. If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series. https://youtu.be/jC6tvynBN90   Specs   Caliber .45ACP Recoil System 2 Piece N.M.
