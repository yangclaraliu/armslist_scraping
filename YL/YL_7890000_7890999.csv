With 12 meals per case, at this price, it is only $6.25 a meal for food that you can take anywhere with no refrigeration and still have a hot meal with loads of accessories such as crackers/bread, cheese/jelly spread, coffee, sugar, creamer, gum, Tabasco sauce, matches, and even toilet paper! These come with a water-activated heater for the entree, and detailed directions on how to use it (basically, just pour water into the bag and wait a few minutes). I also have spare heaters that I can provide so that you can heat up accessories as well. The dates on the boxes are the Inspection Date, not the expiration date.Here is a guide to the date codes on the cases:  The first line is the date it was manufactured. The number before the dash is a combination of the last digit of the year of manufacture and the Julian date of that year.  The number after the dash is the lot number of that date that the case belongs to.  So for the case in the picture, it was manufactured in 2015 on June 4th, and was part of the first lot produced that day.  The second line is the Inspect/Test date.  The number before the dash is the last two digits of the year, and the number after the dash is the month after which it is supposed to be tested/inspected before being consumed.  For the case in the picture, the inspect/test date is June of 2018 (three years after manufacture).  You can check this for yourself here: http://www.mreinfo.com/mres/mre-date-converter/As you can see in the pictures, these cases haven't even reached their first inspection date yet!THESE ARE LEGAL TO OWN, so please don't be an internet lawyer and try to enforce a law that doesn't exist."
