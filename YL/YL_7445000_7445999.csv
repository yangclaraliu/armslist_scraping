They took already existing SKS parts from the existing factories and basically put together rifles. They have only a serial number, no factory markings and have all the late aspects of a late build. In this case, there is no indication of a manufacturer BUT has all the late features of a Chinese Type-56. Very few of these parts guns were assembled by Norinco and fewer are here in the US. This is a good build considering it has a long barrel lug, but features a spike bayonet. Very odd and unique. (Later Chinese usually feature a short barrel lug, or none at all with a simple barrel pin sort of like the AKM)I’ve fired less than 150 rounds through it. All matching serials (00026)."

Rifle features a threaded barrel, scope mounts and detachable mag. Comes with .30 bore snake, gun lock, all in-box paperwork and original packaging.more images - https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzmIkbstHAJDN2lHZnFPLVlDRFUThis rifle is NEW in box, NEVER fired! I cleaned and oiled it after purchasing but never got around to buying ammo for it. For those who are unfamiliar with the brand (I was before purchasing), Thompson Center is owned by Smith and Wesson. S&W makes the barrel and T/C makes the rest of the rifle. Up for sale is my T/C Compass bolt action rilfe chambered in 300 Win Mag. I bought this rifle about a month and a half ago on sale from Woodbury Outfitters. It was an impulse buy. I ended up realizing that 300 Win Mag is a little too expensive for just plinking. If I was a hunter then I might keep it. If I were a bit better off finanically then maybe I wouldn't mind spending $35 for 20 rounds. However I just enjoy target shooting and my .223 bolt action rifle I have better suits this purpose. Cool things about this rifle - 24in threaded barrel, includes scope mounts (pre-installed), detachable mag, and has a nice weight to it despite the composite stock. The finish is also very nice. All you need to do is slap your scope and scope rings on this rifle (and a suppressor, if you have one) and you're good to go. This model features a four round detachable magazine. I also have a .30 bore snake I will include that I used for the initial cleaning, since I won't have a use for it anymore. The rifle also came with a T/C keychain, T/C sticker, and of course a gun lock - all of which are included. This is the price I paid for the rifle. I can provide an invoice from Woodbury to confirm. I'm not looking to make any money here, I just want to recoup some of my loss. I'm eating the $40 transfer fee my FFL charged me for online orders. My dumb desicion could land you a nice rifle at a good price! Since this is a long arm, we don't necessarily have to go through an FFL/4473 ONLY IF you are a PA resident. You will need to show me your valid PA ID so that I can confirm you are a current PA resident. If you have a LTCF as a secondary ID that would be helpful as well. In return you will of course be able to see my PA ID and LTCF. I will take an image of your ID to protect myself, and you may also take an image of mine. If you do not wish to provide me your ID then I will assume it is because you're a prohibited person (or just a non-PA resident), and I will not sell the rifle to you. If you want to meet at an FFL and do a transfer that's also fine (and also the ONLY way I'll sell it to you if you don't want to show me your ID, or if you're a non-PA resident). The transfer fee for private sales is $25 at my FFL in South Philly (Philadelphia Training Academy - formerly Philadelphia Archery and Gun Club). Since I'm a member there, you'll receive the discounted transfer fee, making this rifle $260 for you OTD (MSRP for this rifle is $399).In short this is a really nice rifle at a great price. I wish I had bought it in .223 because then I would have kept it (especially because of that threaded barrel). I have more images of the rifle in a Google Drive folder - I'm more than happy to share these images with you, and I do apologize for using a stock image for this listing. I'm more than happy to answer any questions you might have about the rifle as well."

L-3 is proud to introduce high resolution digital thermal imaging device -Thermal-Eye X100. This compact and lightweight thermal viewer is a revolutionary thermal imaging camera designed for public safety departments, law enforcement professionals and military use. Setting the standard for durability and compactness in thermal imaging cameras, the Thermal Eye X100 is an ideal addition to any department‘s arsenal and has been battle-tested.
The affordable Raytheon Thermal-Eye X100 provides the user with the ability to see in complete darkness whether on a routine patrol, locating a lost child or tracking a fugitive. Developed with L3‘s advanced amorphous silicon micro bolometer detector, the X100 delivers the ultimate in true infrared technology, as no lighting is required. 

The Thermal-Eye X100 thermal imaging camera sets the standard for durability and compactness in portable infrared cameras. Weighing in at only 13 ounces with its unique design, the X100xp operates simply with one-button on/off operation. This thermal imaging monocular is designed for the rigors of outdoor use, it features a rubberized slip-resistant casing and can withstand shock and vibration.

This handheld X100 unit is pocket-sized innovation also exceeds waterproof standards and conveniently operates on standard AA batteries. Other features include a protective lens cap, tripod mount for stationary use and camera strap for the officer on the go.

There are 4 models of L3 Thermal Eye... the X50, X100, X150, and X200
The differences between them will be the Resolution, the Field of View, and the Detection Range.

Resolution will be how detailed the image is.
The X50 uses a smaller 100 x 80 pixel resolution. The others use 160 x 120, and this puts the X50 off my personal list.

The Field of View will determine how much area you see in the screen. The less you have, the more 'tunnel vision' you get. This is where the X200 fails against the X100... the FOV for the 200 is over 35% less... you see over 1/3rd less of the area you view in the screen. You either must pan back and forth and up and down to see the same amount, or miss the image. The greater the FOV, the more you see without needing to pan and tilt.

For example: If you are watching a building and the FOV is great enough, you can see both the left and right sides of the building, as well as the ground in front of the building, and the balcony or roofline of the same building. With less FOV, you may be forced to choose between watching the left or the right, but not both at the same time. Same with the ground in front, and the balcony on top, you might not see both, and will have to make a choice on which to watch.

The X200 has a smaller FOV, over 35% less when compared to the X100 or X150. The X200 has a FOV of only 11° x 8°, compared to 17° x 12° for the X100 and X150 models. The X50 with the poor resolution shares the same FOV with the X200. Because of the vastly decreased FOV, I can mark the X200 from my list.

The Detection Range is 1000 feet or 305 Meters for the X50, X100, and X150. The X200 is greater at 1500 feet or 450 Meters. This explains the decreased FOV of the X200 compared to X100 and X150 when using the same 160 x 120 Resolution.

While it would be nice to get the extra 500 feet of Detection Range, I personally have never had a need for over 1000 feet of range (and it will go out a little further than that!), and I do not wish to trade off FOV for increased range at all... it is more important to get a thermal image of more area to me... I don't need to know if the guy has bad circulation at 1300 feet, I'd rather not miss his buddies walking around out of my field of view! I must not be alone in thinking this way, the X200 can be had for less money than the X100 or X150, and is near or LESS than the price of the cheapest X50 unit!

That leaves the X100 and X150 remaining. The X150 replaced the X100 model, and beyond that, they are the same if you don't look at the price tags. The X150 is about $150 more than the X100.

L-3 is proud to introduce high resolution digital thermal imaging device -Thermal-Eye X100. This compact and lightweight thermal viewer is a revolutionary thermal imaging camera designed for public safety departments, law enforcement professionals and military use. Setting the standard for durability and compactness in thermal imaging cameras, the Thermal Eye X100 is an ideal addition to any department‘s arsenal and has been battle-tested.
The affordable Raytheon Thermal-Eye X100 provides the user with the ability to see in complete darkness whether on a routine patrol, locating a lost child or tracking a fugitive. Developed with L3‘s advanced amorphous silicon micro bolometer detector, the X100 delivers the ultimate in true infrared technology, as no lighting is required. 

The Thermal-Eye X100 thermal imaging camera sets the standard for durability and compactness in portable infrared cameras. Weighing in at only 13 ounces with its unique design, the X100xp operates simply with one-button on/off operation. This thermal imaging monocular is designed for the rigors of outdoor use, it features a rubberized slip-resistant casing and can withstand shock and vibration.

This handheld X100 unit is pocket-sized innovation also exceeds waterproof standards and conveniently operates on standard AA batteries. Other features include a protective lens cap, tripod mount for stationary use and camera strap for the officer on the go.

There are 4 models of L3 Thermal Eye... the X50, X100, X150, and X200
The differences between them will be the Resolution, the Field of View, and the Detection Range.

Resolution will be how detailed the image is.
The X50 uses a smaller 100 x 80 pixel resolution. The others use 160 x 120, and this puts the X50 off my personal list.

The Field of View will determine how much area you see in the screen. The less you have, the more 'tunnel vision' you get. This is where the X200 fails against the X100... the FOV for the 200 is over 35% less... you see over 1/3rd less of the area you view in the screen. You either must pan back and forth and up and down to see the same amount, or miss the image. The greater the FOV, the more you see without needing to pan and tilt.

For example: If you are watching a building and the FOV is great enough, you can see both the left and right sides of the building, as well as the ground in front of the building, and the balcony or roofline of the same building. With less FOV, you may be forced to choose between watching the left or the right, but not both at the same time. Same with the ground in front, and the balcony on top, you might not see both, and will have to make a choice on which to watch.

The X200 has a smaller FOV, over 35% less when compared to the X100 or X150. The X200 has a FOV of only 11° x 8°, compared to 17° x 12° for the X100 and X150 models. The X50 with the poor resolution shares the same FOV with the X200. Because of the vastly decreased FOV, I can mark the X200 from my list.

The Detection Range is 1000 feet or 305 Meters for the X50, X100, and X150. The X200 is greater at 1500 feet or 450 Meters. This explains the decreased FOV of the X200 compared to X100 and X150 when using the same 160 x 120 Resolution.

While it would be nice to get the extra 500 feet of Detection Range, I personally have never had a need for over 1000 feet of range (and it will go out a little further than that!), and I do not wish to trade off FOV for increased range at all... it is more important to get a thermal image of more area to me... I don't need to know if the guy has bad circulation at 1300 feet, I'd rather not miss his buddies walking around out of my field of view! I must not be alone in thinking this way, the X200 can be had for less money than the X100 or X150, and is near or LESS than the price of the cheapest X50 unit!

That leaves the X100 and X150 remaining. The X150 replaced the X100 model, and beyond that, they are the same if you don't look at the price tags. The X150 is about $150 more than the X100.

This handheld X100 unit is pocket-sized innovation also exceeds waterproof standards and conveniently operates on standard AA batteries. Other features include a protective lens cap, tripod mount for stationary use and camera strap for the officer on the go.

There are 4 models of L3 Thermal Eye... the X50, X100, X150, and X200
The differences between them will be the Resolution, the Field of View, and the Detection Range.

Resolution will be how detailed the image is.
The X50 uses a smaller 100 x 80 pixel resolution. The others use 160 x 120, and this puts the X50 off my personal list.

The Field of View will determine how much area you see in the screen. The less you have, the more 'tunnel vision' you get. This is where the X200 fails against the X100... the FOV for the 200 is over 35% less... you see over 1/3rd less of the area you view in the screen. You either must pan back and forth and up and down to see the same amount, or miss the image. The greater the FOV, the more you see without needing to pan and tilt.

For example: If you are watching a building and the FOV is great enough, you can see both the left and right sides of the building, as well as the ground in front of the building, and the balcony or roofline of the same building. With less FOV, you may be forced to choose between watching the left or the right, but not both at the same time. Same with the ground in front, and the balcony on top, you might not see both, and will have to make a choice on which to watch.

The X200 has a smaller FOV, over 35% less when compared to the X100 or X150. The X200 has a FOV of only 11° x 8°, compared to 17° x 12° for the X100 and X150 models. The X50 with the poor resolution shares the same FOV with the X200. Because of the vastly decreased FOV, I can mark the X200 from my list.

The Detection Range is 1000 feet or 305 Meters for the X50, X100, and X150. The X200 is greater at 1500 feet or 450 Meters. This explains the decreased FOV of the X200 compared to X100 and X150 when using the same 160 x 120 Resolution.

While it would be nice to get the extra 500 feet of Detection Range, I personally have never had a need for over 1000 feet of range (and it will go out a little further than that!), and I do not wish to trade off FOV for increased range at all... it is more important to get a thermal image of more area to me... I don't need to know if the guy has bad circulation at 1300 feet, I'd rather not miss his buddies walking around out of my field of view! I must not be alone in thinking this way, the X200 can be had for less money than the X100 or X150, and is near or LESS than the price of the cheapest X50 unit!

That leaves the X100 and X150 remaining. The X150 replaced the X100 model, and beyond that, they are the same if you don't look at the price tags. The X150 is about $150 more than the X100.

New this pistol retails for $1,500 by itself and that does not include a stock (brace), sights, BCM Gun Fighter angled grip, or any type of case. As you can see from the below picture, I have installed a Vortex Sparc AR Optic, a BCM Gunfighter angled grip, an SB Tactical PDW 3 adjustment brace, and I will also be including a FDE Draco rifle case as well as roughly 75 rounds of Fiocchi FMJ ammo.

I am the original owner and purchaser of this item and have only shot 20-25 rounds through it total. I rarely get to the range anymore so I have no use for this particular item.

This sale is for just the frame, (which is considered the firearm) no slide assembly. It has all original Glock parts in it and has never been modified. This frame is ready for any full-size slide assembly; just slide it on and it's good to go. You can use this lower for anything from .22LR and 9mm up to .40 and .357 Sig. You could also use this for use in a MechTech, or a dedicated training pistol with a .22LR conversion kit.Originally I was going to use this lower and a .22LR kit as a dedicated .22LR pistol but have shifted gears towards other projects so I have to sell. This frame is used but saw less than 100 rounds through it while I've owned it. It was used before I bought it but is in excellent shape. This would be perfect for a custom stipple job if you don't want to modify your brand new Glock lower. With one complete upper you can switch between lowers with ease. For example, take your G17, G22, G31, G34 or G35 Gen 3 or aftermarket slide assembly (slide, barrel and recoil spring) and simply put it on this lower. You could also make this into a competition lower and replace the trigger and other internals, while keeping your new Glock lower completely stock for carry (many people don't advise carrying a firearm with a modified trigger, especially if it's been modified specifically for competition shooting). **We must meet at a gun store (FFL). We must meet at a gun store in PA. Absolutely no exceptions. Do not waste your time or mine trying to convince me to sell this to you without a transfer. This is considered a handgun and must be transferred by an FFL. If you are a NJ resident, make sure you have all that you need in order to legally take possession of this firearm. It is your responsibility to make sure you can legally purchase and own this firearm (from what I understand, NJ residents must apply for a purchasing license and have a license to own each individual firearm). I will not travel to NJ. If you're a NJ resident you must travel to PA to compete this sale. If you pay my asking price and meet me at my FFL in South Philly I will cover the transfer fee! If you wish to meet at an FFL of your choice then the transfer fee is on you. I am willing to meet at any FFL in PA within a ~30 minute drive of Philly (not including traffic, so pretty much anywhere).Included in this sale is the original Glock case, all original paperwork (including the spent case from the factory) all with matching serials. It also includes the Glock cleaning rod and .40 brush. Feel free to message me with any questions. I have more images in a Google Drive folder that I can send to you. Due to file size limitiations I was only able to upload one image. Armslist for some reason won't allow the link to my Google Drive folder in the description despite it working in the past).I have an OEM Glock 22 .40 barrel and two OEM Glock .40 magazines (at least one is stamped LE use only) I may be willing to part with as well. If you're interested just ask and we can figure something out."

You'll like it. The .30 Carbine is similar in energy to a .357 Magnum, and makes a great home defense gun, truck gun, or just a fun plinker. Ammo usually runs $20-25 a box, but it is a box of 50, so a cheap rifle to shoot. This one hasn't been messed with and is in great shape. I'm in Santa Fe and can pretty much meet you any time.

(The installation takes 3 minutes and the ability to remove the grip screws and drive out and replace a pin.). I will also include the original S&W spring that gives a pull so high it interferes with accurate shooting. Function is flawless, and there is no wear on the rifling. I shot the 10-shot 25-yard group using my range bag to rest my wrist and holding a conventional sight picture.  The 15-yard groups are unsupported and shot with the white dots.  The $500.00 is firm.  No trades.  Cash only.  ID and bill of sale required."
