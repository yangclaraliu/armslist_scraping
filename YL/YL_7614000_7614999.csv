Armes .8 cal French handgun manufactured in 1924. This handgun is in great shape for its age and everything seems to function as it should. The handgrips are original. This was purchased at an auction and I am no longer keeping it in my collection. Below is some listed information regarding this firearm.

The modèle (mle.) 1892 is commonly referred to as the “Lebel” revolver or the “St. Etienne.”  The latter makes sense as the revolvers are stamped “St. Étienne” but the former is a misunderstanding as Nicholas Lebel does not appear to have played a part in their development.

Production began in its namesake year and continued until 1924.  Barrels have been dated up to 1930 but these are refurbished revolvers.  Manufacture date is stamped right on the barrel, so no confusion for collectors.  M1892s served with the French armed forces through WWI until they were officially retired in 1935.  WWII, however, had other ideas and the pistols were not completely replaced until after 1945.  In many places formally under French rule they remained in service well into the 1960s.  Commercial models, Belgian, and Spanish-made copies also abound with slight variations of fitting, markings, and caliber.Using the mle. 1892 is a mix of old and new revolver styles.  The internal mechanism should be very familiar to American shooters but the operation will seem a bit odd.  To load the gun pull back on the lever on the right side of the frame behind the cylinder; yes the one that looks exactly like a loading gate.  This, surprisingly, will release the swing-out cylinder.  Now gape openly as it drops out of the right side of the revolver.  This is a left-handed shooters dream.  Insert your ammo, close the cylinder and you’re ready to fire.  The revolver may be used in single or double action.  Once done the spent casings are ejected using a single ejecting rod set in the center of the cylinder.

It is a passive system which means it does not emit any signals that can be detected by the enemy. Unlike image-intensifier systems, a thermal sight is not susceptible to 'bloom' issues ie being overwhelmed by sudden bright sources of light.The v2 may be mounted on light and medium machine guns such as the M249 or M240. The sights feature a data port that allows them to be connected to external equipment such as recording devices. Various recticules can be programmed into the units depending on needs. The sights run on disposable lithion or rechargable lithium-ion batteries.The AN/PAS-13 is used by regular and special operations units alike. The Marines of 1st Recon, for example, carried AN/PAS-13 sights with them when they spearheaded the invasion of Iraq in 2003."

EAA Factory MAGAZINE for WITNESS 10mm Full Size. Made in Italy. Picture shows exactly what you are buying. Here is EAA’s High Capacity standard issue magazine, for current production Witness pistols chambered in the power house 10mm caliber. Manufacturer is Fratelli Tanfoglio SNC of Brescia, Italy. Importer and warrantor is European American Armory of Rockledge, Florida. Construction is matte blue scored steel body, with steel spring and heavy duty black polymer floorplate and cartridge follower. Factory number is 101945. Each magazine holds 14 rounds of 10mm caliber ammunition. These magazines are made for EAA Witness series pistols chambered in 10mm caliber only. They do not fit any other pistol that I know of. Body length is 4 1/2 inches, and that is the depth of the magazine well, the distance from the butt end of the pistol’s grip frame to the closed slide. On short frame compact variants of the 10mm Witness, this magazine will protrude from its grip frame but otherwise will work just fine. Each magazine comes lubricated in its labeled factory bag. Replacement pricing on EAA corp com is $40 apiece. I'm offering these 2 brand new EAA Tanfoglio factory 10mm magazines, however, for $45.00 for both.

The more compact design only requires 2.75 of rail space! The compact design used by the XPS and EXPS models was created by separating the battery compartment from the base and mounting it transversely.

This rifle shoots sub-moa from the factory and was built for the 1km for under $1k. I have various furniture options for the buyer depending on your budget as well as optics.
