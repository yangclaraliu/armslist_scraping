The Ed Brown Executive Target is essentially the Executive Elite modified for precise target and range work. Instead of fixed sights, it has an Ed Brown adjustable rear sight. The top of the slide has been flattened and finely grooved at 40 LPI, which naturally guides your eye to the front sight and eliminates distracting glare. Known as Ed Browns best firearm for target shooting, this elegant design has a beautiful simplicity that has yet to be matched. Unique with the Executive series pistols is the 25 LPI checkered frame and mainspring housing. This pattern is not too rough on the hands, but not too fine for a secure grip. The timeless design reflects the genius of John Browning with modern flair. The Executive Target is truly at the top of it's field. This firearm has some minor wear marks (pictures show visible marks) from the old aluminum grips it had. A brand new set of original Ed Brown Cocobolo Diamond Checkered Grips that have been installed. This firearm comes with 1 original Ed Brown Magazine, but no original paperwork or range bag."

Within minutes you have a modular, free-floated rail.

You know you want to try this out so use the included cartridge and buy fresh ones to carry or use for defense purposes.

362,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7411362,For Sale:  Steyr 1886 Kropatschek Infantry Rifle EXC+ Bore SUPER Clean READY 2 SHOOT,"Davie, Broward, South Florida",$ 445,"Listed On: Thursday, October 5, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a standard Kropatschek Infantry rifle with an outstanding bore in perfect shooting condition. This is a regular infantry rifle (longer barrel) but compared to many up for auction recently (Invaluable and other auction services) it is super clean with an EXC+ bore. It has also been disassembled, cleaned and checked over. The last black-powder cartridge rifle designed and these were plenty strong to handle the conversion to smokeless powder. If unfamiliar with Krops, drop me a message or check You Tube (a couple of excellent videos).  The elevator mechanism is smooth and slick as is the bolt. Most of the Krops have a well-used exterior as they were in use from 1886 until the 1970s in parts of the world. The barrel on this one is still darker and has not faded to gray like many. The bluing has turned a slight brown tone with the finish darker and nicer towards the receiver and like 80+ % of them, there is roughness at the wood line (only visible removed from stock) but no active corrosion. This one has been disassembled and cleaned including the magazine tube which gleams like new inside. The bolt was totally taken apart and a century of grime and grease came out. The trigger went from gummy to crisp. The inside of the stock still has cosmoline but it is fine where it is so I left it. VERY nice trigger on this one. The receiver has very nice dark bluing in excellent condition and the metal is overall better than the wood though the wood is solid as a rock with no cracks. The cartouche is very visible on both sides. The wood has been around 130 years and in countless countries and possibly several wars and battles. This one, like most, has a non matching bolt number to the rifle but the rest of the rifle matches. The bolt parts are all matching except the bolt head. Every screw present (some listed are missing some) and all screws and threads have been cleaned. These are LONG rifles and superb shooters. This one is a shooter and not a museum piece and will make an excellent example for a collection. Modern ammo is available on GB and there is still 1920s ammo available (I have some) but using modern loads with cast bullets and moderate powder is a very easy to shoot combo and doesnt stress the gun at all. I have watched these double in price over 2 to 3 years and they can only go up as you never see antique guns go down in value. There are still many in Portugal, who ordered all Krops made (1886 is the only year) and they are popular in South Africa and Australia (where they sell for 2 to 3 times the US price)as well. If you want a solid Krop with no surprises that needs NOTHING but ammo to shoot and shoot well, this is it. You wont need to clean it or worry about any of the parts not working when you get it. You dont need to hunt down any screws or parts, and you do not need to repair the stock. The gorgeous bore means it will shoot like a champ, as well as it did when made. There are some in better overall (wood) cosmetic condition that CAN turn up if you wait, but based on the prices I have seen them go for, this a great buy. Ships for $42 as it is a big boy. As an antique, no FFL necessary but a copy of state ID is to ship. Paypal must use SEND MONEY TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO AVOID FEESOVER 25 MORE PHOTOS AVAILABLE"

I purchased it and it sat in my safe. Need to free up some funds so I’ve decided to sell it. My loss is your gain. All items depicted in the photos are included in the auction. It’s is buyer’s responsibility to ensure that the night vision optic is LEGAL in your city and state. This item cannot be sold or shipped outside the US. Thank you for your interest. Description from Optics Planet where I purchased the unit: The OPMOD GEN3MM 2.0 PVS-14 Night Vision Monocular SNVG-14 is available exclusively through Optics Planet. The OPMOD GEN3MM Night Nision Scope is an incredible value. This Gen III night vision device is a complete package including a night vision monocular, eye cup, night vision head mount, demist and sacrificial shields, and more! The OPMOD GEN3MM PVS 14 Night Vision Scope w/Head Mount can be used as handheld night vision or a head mounted night vision scope, delivering the flexibility and performance that the OPMOD line embodies. The OPMOD night vision monocular complete package was designed to meet the high standards and needs of armed forces and tactical operatives. OpticsPlanet's OPMOD PVS14 Water Proof Sight uses the highest performance commercial grade third generation intensifier tubes available, with a minimum resolution rating of 64 LP/MM (the intensifier tube of OPMOD NVD is made in the USA). The PVS-14 is currently in use by the U.S. armed forces and law enforcement agencies across the country, and is a standard in night vision technology. The monocular uses a single AA battery in its MIL-SPEC housing. This night vision scope is waterproof to 66 feet for one hour, and features multi coated optics. Our third generation OPMOD PVS 14 Waterproof Night Vision Monocular comes in a soft case and includes adjustable night vision headgear for hands-free viewing, along with everything needed to use and maintain the NVG unit for years to come. One AA battery will allow viewing for up to 40 hours. The OPMOD Military Grade PVS14 has a built in infrared illuminator for use without ambient light. The adjustable gain control allows the user to set the image intensifier tube brightness to the optimum level for the desired application. With optional accessories, the PVS 14 may be used weapon mounted behind a night vision compatible red dot sight or riflescope, as well as helmet or camera mounted. The PVS 14 Night Vision from OPMOD is also the ultimate night vision monocular and weapon mounted night vision device for predator hunters. OPMOD Night Vision squeezes every ounce of performance out of the technology to reach the next level of tactical operation. As with all OpticsPlanet MODification products, you can expect these OPMOD Night Vision Monoculars to withstand the harshest weather, the severest environments, and years of intensive use."

This rifle, serial #81870 was manufactured in 1913. The gun comes with a special order Takedown feature, factory sling swivels and I believe a factory installed Lyman receiver sight with windage adjustment. The .405 was introduced in 1904. It remains to this day the most powerful rimmed cartridge designed for lever-action rifles, the only modern lever action cartridge that approaches its performance is the .450 Marlin. President Theodore Roosevelt had to not one, not two, but three 1895's in .405 and it proved very effective on almost every sort of game in Africa. The big 300 grain bullet was a hard hitter with initial muzzle velocity of more than 2230 fps. In perhaps the best presidential endorsement of any product ever, Roosevelt wrote in Scribers Magazine ""The Winchester .405 is, at least for me personally the medicine gun for lions!"" The .405 was discontinued in 1932. As for condition the receiver retains most of its toning original blue finish. The original 24"" tapered round barrel retains 95% of its original bluing. The original walnut stocks are in very good condition, retaining some of their original oil finish, with minimal handling marks. A period correct NOSHOC recoil pad has been added to the buttstock, appearing to have always been there (believe me if you are going to shoot this rifle you'll be glad its there). The action is tight and smooth, mechanically perfect. The bore is MINTY, showing a mirror shine with sharp rifling. I would rate it at 95%+. The barrel address and caliber markings are perfect. The screws are very good and most remain unturned. The special order Lyman receiver with a windage adjustment is marked ""95"". The Takedown mechanism locks up tight. In all this old gun still retains a lot of condition, with an excellent bore that would make this rifle a great addition to ones collection and/or a perfect vintage hunting rifle. I have provided over 90 photos and offer a 3 day inspection period so you can bid with confidence. All pictures were taken outdoors in natural light and provide an accurate depiction of its condition. I will need a signed FFL of C&R to ship. Insurance is included with shipping.
