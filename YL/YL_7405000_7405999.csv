PREFER NOT SHIP BUT WILL CONSIDER FOR THE RIGHT PRICE. OTHERWISE CASH AND FACE TO FACE ONLY. ASKING $600. #6358X Barrel Date: 1944 - 85% Blue, bright sharp shiny bore, matching bolt, post war stock in excellent condition with a 1896 Izhevsk receiver. Manufactured by famous machine gun barrel maker Valmet. This M39 is an extremely rare legally defined Antique, that has been unfired since being re-arsenaled by the Finnish military. This is essentially a brand new, accurate and powerful rifle that is legally classified as an Antique. Rifle comes with original wartime leather sling. Chambered in 7.62x54R. Only around 100,000 M39 rifles were made. One of the most accurate military bolt action rifles ever produced as they were required to shoot sub MOA. The M39's also have a number of variations and makers/manufactures as well as having quite a diverse history both in WW2 and post war Finland. These are great rifles to shoot and collect. 7.62x54R surplus ammunition is very inexpensive and cheap to shoot - which is a great bonus since ammunition prices have risen so much recently. 7.62x54R is comparable to the 30-06 round, and is much more powerful than its little brother, the 7.62x39 round that is usually chambered in AKs and the SKS. This Finnish M39 Rifle has been protected and preserved for long term storage with cosmoline, which is still on the rifle. When cleaned the rifle and stock will be beautiful. Weight: 9.5 lbs (4.3 kg) Over All Length: 46.75” (118.7 cm) Barrel Length: 27” (68.6 cm) Stock Length: 43.25” (109.9 cm) Groove Diameter: .310” Sight Radius: 22.75” (57.8 cm) Cleaning Rod Length: 24.375” (61.9 cm) Caliber: 7.62x54R No FFL is required to buy or sell antiques across state lines-- they are in the same legal category as a muzzle-loading replica. With no ""paper trail”, many think of these as the last bastion of gun ownership privacy."

In very good original condition, from my late father-in-law's estate. I believe he had this from the 1960s or 70s (perhaps earlier), but I'm uncertain of the exact year or model number. Serial number is A1369x - I tried to find the date of manufacture and model by researching the serial # online, but it turned to be difficult to figure and confusing. On left side of barrel is stamped ""Browning Arms Co. St. Louis MO"". Wood is nice with no cracks, metal good but there is some minor rust speckling as can be seen. Has 27"" barrel, and a choke. Functions very well - I did some trap shooting with it a couple of years ago, and it performed faultlessly. A nice gun but we have moved from a big country property to a much smaller one in a neighborhood, and I need to sell off some guns which I don't use anymore. Buyer must be 18 years of age or older to purchase, and abide by all federal, state and local laws to purchase. Background check will be required. Sorry, no trades or shipping.

Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with 5R Rifling at minimum bore and groove dimensions, minimum headspace and centralized chamber. 20 MOA Picatinny rail secured with four, #8-40 screws for increased long-range elevation capabilities. “Upper” receiver and one-piece bolt are precision CNC-machined from pre-hardened 4140 chrome-moly steel to minimize distortion. Three-lug bolt with 70° throw features dual cocking cams and a smooth-running, full diameter bolt body. In-line recoil path manages recoil directly from the rear of the receiver to the buttstock, not through a traditional bedding system, providing maximum accuracy potential. Ruger® Precision MSR stock with QD sling attachment points features a bottom Picatinny rail and soft rubber buttpad. The left-folding stock hinge is attached to an AR-style buffer tube and accepts any AR-style stock. Length of pull and comb height are adjustable. Equipped with a Ruger Precision Rifle® Short-Action Handguard for improved scope clearance for long-range scopes. Magazine well front is contoured for a positive grip for bracing against shooting supports. Oversized bolt handle for positive bolt manipulation, with 5/16″-24 thread for easy replacement. Bolt disassembly tool is stored in the bolt shroud for easy striker channel cleaning. Also features a Ruger Precision Rifle™ Billet Aluminum Bolt Shroud. “Lower” magazine well halves are precision machined from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum and are Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability. Patent-pending multi-magazine interface functions interchangeably with AICS and M110/SR-25/DPMS/Magpul-style magazines (works with some M14 magazines). Ruger Marksman Adjustable™ trigger is externally adjustable with a pull weight range of 2.25 to 5.0 lbs.; wrench is stored in the bolt shroud. Extended trigger-reach AR-style grip and 45° reversible safety selector. May be configured with any AR-style grip and selector. Barrels can be easily replaced by a competent gunsmith using AR-style wrenches and headspace gauges. Also includes: two, 10-round Magpul® PMAG® magazines."
