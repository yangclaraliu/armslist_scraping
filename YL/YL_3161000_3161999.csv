77,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3161077,Want To Buy:  22 lr's are out Air Rifles are the next best thing...,"White City, Medford, Oregon",Offer,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 11, 2014",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"So this ad is for information only.
So i had got tired of going to Wal-mart and there was no 22lr ammo.
So i bought.
1. Bone Collector np .177 1300 fps Air Rifle.
2. Benjamin Titan np 22 cal.  
3. Benjamin trail np .177 pistol.
and i have shot metal targets on my property and this is my thoughts about Air Rifles vs 22lr.
Air Rifles are not as expensive to buy vs 22lr's, shoot really cheap ammo 750 rounds of .177 is $8 and 500 rounds of 22 cal is $8 but even though they are single shots they pack power and you can practice shooting just as you do with a regular 22lr, the only difference is the range is shorter so there are no 100 yard shots for me they are more like 50 yard shots, but i can shoot all day and spend pennies vs dealing with ammo scalpers wanting $80 for a brick of 22lr they just bought for $24 at Wal-Mart,.
You will need to lube and clean your Air Rifle just as you do a regular gun but USE AIR RIFLE CLEANING KITS AND LUBE.
I buy the break barrel air rifles as they pack some heat each shot, but beware if you get a 25 cal., air rifle the ammo is real hard to find so stick to 22 or 177, these new air rifles are light years beyond the old school pump air rifles we had when i was a kid, these are not toys they are competition air rifles with velocities up to 1650 feet per second and thats screaming power behind a pellet. Now Air Rifles of this power are not allowed to be shot in most city limits so check local laws, but felons can own them, shot them as long as they have completed their probation and most of the time as long as their release does not state they can not shoot them, they have the ability to do so, but check first. 
If anyone has questions about my Air Rifles just ask me.
i have added a photo of my abused targets to give you an idea of what they do to metal targets and paper at about 50 yards."

This scope is opened but brand new! I had it mounted on my rifle and used a bore sight to zero the scope, but this scope has never been on a fired rifle. Brand new condition. This scope was purchased brand new as part of Burris' package with the P.E.P.R. mount and Fastfire III. HOWEVER, I am only selling the XTR 1-4x24 scope. I plan to keep the reflex sight and scope mount. NOTHING AT ALL is wrong with this scope. This is the Gen. 2 model after the first recall. The Gen. 1 models were manufactured from 2010 - 2011. This was purchased 6 months ago. I am only attempting to sell it because I want a higher magnification. I paid over $800 for the package. I do not need to sell this so please don't try to low ball me. This scope will come with the original packaging, box, dust cover, and battery. This is an amazing deal for this quality of scope! I live in Cottondale, and work in Panama City, so I could meet you within those general areas. If you are out of this area, I can ship the scope after I have received payment. Feel free to ask questions. Thank you for your interest and your time.

Hey all,
This listing is for a like new iPad mini wifi 16gb in white. This is in like new condition and has literally only been used for maybe a few hours total (got as a gift and never used it really). It also comes with a nice Targus kickstand/case cover that makes it real easy to stand it up for videos or the like. It also comes with original charger, cable, box, and paperwork. For the right trade offer I can also include extras on my end (depending on the item). In terms of trades I'm mainly only looking for firearms or very large lots of certain ammo. Or I would just sell for cash. I am located in Norman and would need to meet here if possible. This still works great and will give someone a whole lot of fun! For any questions or offers shoot me a message on here or at REDACTED and we can go from there.

The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient.

Gun has had about 200 rounds through the barrel, so still in nearly new condition, cleaned thoroughly after every range visit. Upgrades include a new Mainspring housing to eliminate the ILS, an Ed Brown competition mainspring, Wilson Combat Bulletproof sear spring, Wilson Combat A2 Bulletproof sear, an STI Titanium Hammer Strut, a Harrison Design and Consulting long black trigger, and a Wilson Combat full length guide rod and also a set of VZ Operator Grips. Also purchased Wilson Combat ETM Mags for it. None of these upgrades are in the photo below as I haven't gotten a chance to take a new photo yet and will get some this evening when I get home. Can throw in ammo for the right price, have plenty of 9mm to add to a deal.

If you believe my asking price is too high for a used Range Officer, feel free to do the math on all of the additions that are included in that price point and you'll find that I have invested a little over $1,150 easily into this gun. Please keep that in mind if making an offer as well. Thanks."
