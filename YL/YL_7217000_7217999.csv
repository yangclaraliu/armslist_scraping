In development for more than four years, the VP9 is HK's first striker-fired handgun since the P7 series was introduced in the 1980s. Its premium light-pull trigger has a short takeup with a solid, single-action-type break followed by a short, positive reset. Customize grip configurations by changing the three included backstraps and six included sideplates to accommodate various hand sizes. All controls, including the magazine and slide releases, are ambidextrous. Patented charging supports at the rear of the slide enhance leverage and grip for racking the slide, speeding up reloading and making it easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. Extended Picatinny rail molded into the polymer frame supports up to 5.6-oz. accessories. Proprietary captive flat recoil spring improves shooter control.

Couple spares included.Spare parts out the whazoo for it. Runs, drives, stops as it should. Passed inspection last December. Clean title and current tags. The bad. Never got around to getting the roof done. Has a almost soft top at the moment. Needs paint as well. I've got the material to do the roof & the paint which can go with the truck or I'll do it myself and bump the price up significantly higher. It's the only reason I'm willing to sell it so cheap. There aren't many of these crew cabs that are still a 6x6. Most have been bobbed, check ebay. They aren't cheap at all."

I shot this specific rifle in an amature  shooting event in Wyoming awhile back and it was awesome holding its ground very well against the AR folks. (Wish I could same the same for me.)  After running the course I understand clearly why Israel's Defense Forces selected this design. Where the optic sight was mounted there is some minor bluing wear, other wise the rifle is in near new shape.  I do not know the round count if that matters to you. I have the rifle and two mags only.  Unfortunately the person who I acquired this rifle from could not find the original box. It is totally stock including the IWI combat trigger, which is really heavy.  If you like the bull pup design you will like this rifle. I am not am not really interested in any trades at this time.  (But hey, I am always open to ideas.). Price is $1,400.00.  Buyer pays the FFL fees.Thanks for reading my ad."
