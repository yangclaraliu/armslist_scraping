I paid a little bit over 1700 for this January 2018 and have a receipt for proof. I have only shot it once (100 rounds). It is in perfect factory condition with no scratches or marks. The firearm is currently featureless with factory pinned stock and a fin grip. This color was a special order and I had to wait a while. It comes with its original case and accessories along with one factory magazine. I am looking for cash but will also accept trades for a Springfield TRP full rail operator or Sig Legion series as well as other high end 1911s. Thank you for looking and if you are interested let me know and we can schedule an appointment at an FFL so you can see this beauty in person.

Finish at about 90%.  Some finish wear on the edges. Minor pitting on top of the slide that is so minor that it won't show in pics.  Might have been owned by Broward County Sheriff's Department, since they obviously weren't shot much.    I actually shot 6 mags through it.  Shoots great and ate all types and makes of ammo.  Very accurate for a conceal carry pistol. Will come with one brand new flush fitting 10 round magazine,or a nice used 12 round flush fitting mag. 15 round mags are available for only $20, which seat well and are for the same 59 S&W series, but extend somewhat past the body of the pistol. I suggest getting it with the one flush fitting  mag, and getting the 15 round mag for $20 more. Its nice to have a 15 rounder for range time anyway.  I will not sell magazines separately without pistol purchase. While polymer frame pistols have their place  there is something to be said for a classic American made fully metal service quality pistol.  This baby eats Glocks for lunch.  This is the type of gun that you could pass on to your great grand kids after 5g rounds and it still will look and function great.   Super fantastic conceal carry pistol.  Smith & Wesson stands by its firearms, so buy with confidence.

The feel of this gun in your hands is simple amazing. Feels better to me than any other gun I own. And I own some nice pieces. Sigs Kimbers colts Baretta etc. Here is the problem for me.  This gun was built in Feb of 2002. It has since remained in its case un fired. Personally I can’t be the one to fire it. It needs to be a part of someone’s collection who will appreciate it for what it is.  As we know it’s only worth what someone will pay for it.  I gen 1s listed as high as 700.  450 in trade or cash will take this one.  I can almost guarantee you, you will not find another one this old un fired and for sale.All original, with case, 2 mags and original safety key.
