But it shoots almost exactly like my .40, same trigger, same accuracy, almost the same recoil.The .45 Shields are slightly larger and fatter than the 9mm and .40 Shield, just enough so that many holster models don't fit either size.So my holsters for the .40 don't fit the .45, I'd have to buy new ones.Plus I now have to keep .45 ammo on hand, where before all I had was .40.The .45 does have better stippling for a better grip than the .40, also the .45 has a better thumb safety. It sticks out a bit more, has more travel, and clicks on and off positively, where my .40 safety is mushy.I've fired a 100 round box of Winchester FMJ, and about 15 rounds of Federal JHP through it, not even broken in yet.It comes with the box, lock, papers and the two magazines, one 6 round and one 7 round. Add one in the chamber, and you have a nice thin 7 or 8 shot .45.These have great triggers for a polymer gun, and the Shield is nice and compact for concealed carry.I would consider trading someone for a 9mm Shield, either the standard one or the Performance Center 9mm Shield, as I want to get one of those for my daughter.  She's small, and I think she would do better with a 9mm than the .40 or .45."

Being all steel, pistol is heavier than most with enough mass to genuinely control recoil/ muzzle flip and stay on target for devastating damage. I fired this once and put only fifty rounds through it. It is extraordinarily accurate.

Of course, flawless function. I purchased it a few months ago but have since decided to pursue other projects. It comes exactly as I picked it up from my FFL. HK Heckler & Koch Recoil operated with locked breech and tilting barrel. Grips made of glass fibre reinforced polymer with corrosion proof metal inserts. Ambidextrous safety with separate de-cocking lever for the hammer. Steel magazine with 12 round capacity. Integrated support rail for aiming units. Open square notch rear sight with contrast points.  The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns - yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.   The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!  Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile Match grade trigger One piece machined steel slide Frame mounted decocking lever and separate ambidextrous safety lever Can be carried ""cocked and locked"" in single action mode with the safety lever on Patented HK recoil reduction system Corrosion resistant blued finishCorrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Oversized trigger guard for use with glovesUniversal mounting grooves for installing accessories Ambidextrous magazine release lever Extended slide releaseExtractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator Patented Lock-Out Safety device"
