It is the 1:60"" twist that shoots roundballs. It has a buckhorn sight and I will also include the factory adjustable sight. This was a kit that was put together by myself and a local gun builder. It is more slimmed down than a factory Lyman rifle and is very pleasant to hold and shoot. The barrel and furniture is a browned finish and the stock is with Tru-oil. It is glassbedded in the breech area as well as the forestock. I only have about 120-150 shots through this rifle.  The ramrod is an upgraded one from Track of the Wolf. It is a wood grained phenolic resin material. Stiffer than the typical delrin replacement rod and more durable than the wood rods. Great gun but I am selling to help fund another muzzleloader build. I would prefer local pick up, but will consider shipping. I seem to only be able to upload one picture so you can text fiveZeroThree Eight71-84eight1 to get more pics. Thanks!"

Very very low round count. I bought it for my daughter as a present so we could shoot together...... well we went twice and she lost interest in it. And it's not my cup of tea. But it's a extremely light and smooth shooting rifle and I've added multiple upgrades to it as I've had it for about 8 months since buying new. And I still have the original s&w box and pprwork.Upgrades are as follows.......Changed out the moe stock  for a FDE CTR STOCK Added a Magpul b.a.d lever, Magpul extended mag release, ambi qd duel l&r sockets on the BUFFER tube, Daniel defense qd socket to the handguard, Magpul FDE xts handstop kit, Magpul FDE k grip, Magpul type 1 mlok rail covers,Magpul FDE ladder covers, and 4 OEM s&w 15-22lr 25 round magazines. And lastly a 3 chamber competition muzzle brake..... lol not needed for recoil as we all know but it does add just the right ammount of weight to the front end of this LIGHT rifle and keeps it super flat when shooting. Its literally less recoil than a bb gun.Just look up the price of these rifles without all the upgradrd parts and 25$ magazine's and you will see my price is more than fare. Thanks if interested text me 678-681-4519 comes with the rifle case in the pics. Also I have brand new Magpul moe VFG's and AFG'S in black if you do not like the handstop setup.
