I have a Doublestar AR-15 upper in 6.5 Grendel. It has a 20"" threaded barrel. I've had good luck with it, and I'm able to average .8-.9 MOA 5 shot groups with it. It pushes a 123gr bullet at about 2430 fps. The upper has an Odinworks free-float rail that comes with a 3"" picatinny attachment that you can move wherever. I've also threaded in a standard sling swivel for a harris-style bipod.
I'm selling everything you need to convert your .223 AR to 6.5 Grendel, so this kit will come with the upper, a bolt, and two magazines. I also have a set of nice Hornady reloading dies with a case holder that I'll toss in for an extra $25.
6.5 Grendel is a pretty cool caliber, and it actually out performs a .308 AR-10 in windage and energy at long ranges. It fits in a lighter weight AR-15 platform, and the recoil is pretty mild. I'd say it's only about 10% more than when I'm using my .223 upper.
$550 for the Grendel kit, and $575 for the kit plus the reloading dies. The only trade I'm open to would be for a precision .223 bolt action rifle with a 1:9 or faster twist. My phone number is REDACTED. Text is preffered, but if you call please leave a message. I get enough spam calls now that I don't return them unless they leave a message. Thanks for looking!-Matt"

The PX4 is the pistol variant of the formidable CX4 Storm - a renowned tactical Carbine with Pistol-Like Controls.  CX4 and PX4 leverage the same full-size Beretta magazines (as long as they are of the same caliber).  The common magazines afford existing Beretta users the ability to utilize the magazines/clips without the expense of having to buy additional proprietary gear for each platform. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this design versatility is an additional reason why the Beretta Storm Series firearms (pistols and carbines) are highly prized by tactical shooters. When Beretta Storm pistols and carbines, are utilized together it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available on the market today as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following and the PX4’s wide adoption by Military and Law Enforcement Agencies."

Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this design versatility is an additional reason why the Beretta Storm Series firearms (pistols and carbines) are highly prized by tactical shooters. When Beretta Storm pistols and carbines, are utilized together it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available on the market today as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following and the PX4’s wide adoption by Military and Law Enforcement Agencies."

It's been a great gun and has never had a misfire, but Im just looking for a smaller gun thats a little easier to carry. I have only managed to put about 5 boxes of high quality Fiocchi Brass ammo through it, it is a great shooter.. just too big for me... Looking to sell mainly, but I would be open to trades. I'm always interested in SA/DA Pistols. I would be willing to part with this firearm plus cash for any guns higher in value than mine....I like CZs... like the P-07, P-01 the CZ 75 and... I like Sig 1911s, Colt 1911s, Dan Wesson 1911s, Smith & Wesson 357 magnum Revolvers with a 3"" or 4"" barrel, Glock 43 Glock 19, Sig P226, Wilson Combat 1911s, Kimber Ultra TLE II or Kimber Master Carry and Super Carry Ultra+..... also love HK 45c and HK P30 as well as the VP9sk and I might even consider a USP (just because they're awesome)... I'm very open and would consider quite a few things as you can see.... I mainly like pistols in 9mm or 45 ACP. Not really a fan of .40. But I love 357 magnum as well. Just get in touch with me with what you have and maybe we can work out a deal. The Price is 430 OR BEST OFFER. Thanks. Have a great day. 828-962-536eight. My name is Nick.I may consider 9mm and 45ACP carbines as well (Not Hi-Point). Or a Bolt Action Savage Or Weatherby chambered in 300 Win Mag. Or a Henry Lever Action 45-70. I have a pretty long list so just let me know what you have. I may be interested even if you don't want the M&P. If it's not in great condition I don't want it.I abide by all federal and state laws.

I'm putting up for sale a number of guns (that I don't necessarily want to sell) in order to down-size for a move. That being said, I am open to a couple specific trades. This particular sale is for my Daniel Defense rifle.
 
HERE'S THE DEAL:
-Buyer pays transfer fee
-I'm firm on the $1600 (unless you want me to not include the red dot, chest rig, ammo and magazines)
-I'm open to meeting a variety of locations around Bellevue, Renton, Orting, etc.
-I'm open to the trades listed below
 
If you're looking for a no B.S. mil spec rifle that actually has a track record overseas and you don't want to mess with an unreliable ""Custom"" built rifle, look no further than this Daniel defense. I've priced it to move...so I can move to my new place. The price is literally for EVERYTHING you see in the pictures! If you don't think this is a good deal, then you're probably not really looking for a good rifle. This is as close to free as it gets. 
 
Here's the details of the rifle...
 
-This is a 14.5"" pinned and welded (16.1"" with flash hider) barrel that's pretty short and does NOT require any special SBR paper work.
-It's had exactly 2000 rounds through it (I was the only owner) over the two years I've owned it and it's never had even one failure of any kind (it also was 100% reliable with the 300 rounds of steel cased ammo I put through it).
-The rifle is completely mil spec
-You will not find another DDM4V11 SLW like this one, because it has a ""normal"" grip and trigger guard, but comes with the OEM grip.
 
Here's the details of what you'll get with the rifle...ALL INCLUDED FOR ONLY $1600!!!
 
-I'm not sure of the quantity of ammo, but there's hundreds of rounds. ALL AMMO IS 5.56mm. Most of it is American Eagle XM193 55grain, but there is some Lake City 62 grain green time and PMC XTAC 62 grain green tip as well
-You will get a Blue Force Gear 4 magazine chest rig. This normally runs about $120 new.
-You will get the original Daniel Defense case and all OEM documents/accessories.
-You will get 15 magazines (8 30 round gen 2 Magpul PMAGS, 1 gen 3 20 round Magpul PMAG, 3 30 round Colt G.I. magazines with the yellow Magpul anti tilt mag followers and 3 20 round G.I. magazines
-You will get a new Stream light Protac rail mounted light
-You will get the newest HOLOSUN 515 red dot/65 MOA circle dot optic (about $250 new).
-You will get a Daniel Defense fixed front sight post and a Magpul Pro metal rear flip up sight (Both new and never used).
-You will get a Blue Force get 2-point sling (I think this is the Vickers Tactical one). This sling has QD mounts and the sling adjusts like a boss."

I'm putting up for sale a number of guns (that I don't necessarily want to sell) in order to down-size for a move. That being said, I am open to a couple specific trades. This particular sale is for my HK USP 45 V1 (De cocker and safety).
 
HERE'S THE DEAL:
-Buyer pays transfer fee
-Asking $700 OBO
-I'm open to meeting a variety of locations around Bellevue, Renton, Orting, etc.
-I'm open to the trades listed below
 
If you're looking at this pistol, that probably means you understand how awesome, reliable and accurate it is. Sure, you probably won't conceal carry it, but it's a great home defense or target shooting gun.
 
Here's the details of the pistol...
 
-This is the full-size version of the USP .45 ACP
-It comes with three 12 round (Original German HK brands) magazines
-It has brand new Meprolight Tru Dot night sights. The rear sights are orange and the front sight is green.
-It will come with an outside the waistband holster.
-As far as I know, I'm the second owner and this gun was used overseas by a dude stationed out of Ft. Lewis. I've personally put 500 rounds through it. It has a brand new OEM HK recoil spring."

The PX4 is the pistol variant of the formidable CX4 Storm - a renowned tactical Carbine with Pistol-Like Controls.  CX4 and PX4 leverage the same full-size Beretta magazines (as long as they are of the same caliber).  The common magazines afford existing Beretta users the ability to utilize the magazines/clips without the expense of having to buy additional proprietary gear for each platform. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this design versatility is an additional reason why the Beretta Storm Series firearms (pistols and carbines) are highly prized by tactical shooters. When Beretta Storm pistols and carbines, are utilized together it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available on the market today as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following and the PX4’s wide adoption by Military and Law Enforcement Agencies."
