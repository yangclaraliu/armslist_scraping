The deep royal blue finsh looks as good now as it did almost 40yrs ago. There is zero wearing on this gun. It has the 6in barrel chambered in .357mag. The pictures certainly do not do the this gun or its finish justice but I'm not a professional photographer either. It has the original grips and the only thing I don't have is the original box it came it. I am open when it comes to trades but if you want to get my attention I like unique things. So if your interested contact me and the worst thing that can happen is me saying no. Thank you and have a great day

Unfortunately, I can't make it out to a long distance range as much as I would like to anymore with work and life in general. This rifle has a 20"" barrel, threaded muzzle currently fitted with a muzzle brake, though you could easily suppress this rifle should you have a can that would fit the thread pitch. It has a 10 round box magazine, a no-name telescoping bipod, and the scope and rings.The scope is a Vortex Viper PST 6-24x50 FFP EBR-2C (MRAD reticle) sitting on top of it, mounted in Seekins Precision rings. The scope is currently zeroed at 100 yards using 140gr Hornady ELDs. I have shot this rifle out to 575 yards and was hitting a 4"" steel plate repeatedly. If you're looking to get into shooting long range stuff with the caliber that has become extremely popular, this is a set up that will get you there.i have a 20 round box of Hornady ammo I will include with it, as well as brass from the 30 rounds I shot when I took it out to zero it/see what it was capable of.What I have in this set up vs what I'm trying to get out of it is quite reasonable, but make me an offer anyhow."

This handgun DOES HAVE A MANUAL SAFETY.Next is the Stevens Savage 320 12 gauge home defense shotgun w/ pistol grip. This comes with the original box, trigger lock and 25 8-shot 2 3/4 Winchester Target shells. Both guns have been to the range once and ran perfectly.The Taurus had about 50 rounds down-range, no failures. Handled smooth as butter, and hardly any recoil. The Stevens has kick, which is expected, but performed extremely well, with no ejection issues. Both were thoroughly cleaned afterwards, and both are in like new condition.I will also be including a new set of range muffs as well as a Hoppes no. 9 complete gun cleaning kit. The Taurus ran me just over $300.00 and was purchased about 2 months ago. With everything that I have with it, total value is right around  $350.00. The Stevens ran me right at $200.00, and the shells were next to nothing. The muffs were $20.00 and the cleaning kit was about $20.00, which brings the grand total value of everything to right at $590.00I'm asking $450.00 OBO. Would like to have them go as a package deal, but would be willing to sell individually, just text me for a price or for more information @ REDACTED. Face-to-face only, must have FL DL and must be willing to sign bill of sale.

The grips are in great condition as is the revolver, with only a.faint turn line on the cylinder. I would rate the bluing at about 98%. The bore and rifling is bright and the mechanical functions are perfect, with a tight cylinder lockup. It comes with the box, owners manual and additional paperwork shown. The serial number dates it to 1975. This revolver will be hard to improve on. Please look at all the pictures and judge it for yourself. I just recently moved due to Medical issues but Your gain is on me. This EXTREMELY reasonable price/deal includes shipping. No shipping to AK, HI and CA. You must forward me your FFL copy for shipment within 24 hours of the final sale and payment must be within 24 hours by emailing me asap before the gun ships. No local pickup, sorry. Thank you and Happy Hunting! If doesn't suit you please move along"

It has a 24 inch barrel, and it's been drilled and tapped by a local gunsmith because shooting iron sights is getting too difficult with my tired eyes. It comes with a Simmons 8-Point 3-9x40 scope that sits on a weaver base and rings, Butler Creek flip open lens caps, as well as the rifle sling that is shown in the pictures. It also includes a camo butt stock rifle shell holder that I removed for the pictures. You won't find a 1950 era rifle in better condition than this one, especially one that has been carried in the deer woods. I'm selling it because I have another Marlin 336 in 35 Remington and I can't hunt with both of them at the same time. It might not show up in the pictures but there is a handling mark on the right side rear of the forearm. It's not perfect, but the metal and wood are in great condition. The rifling is bright and sharp. This rifle is worth a look. It shoots and functions flawlessly. Cash and local sale only at an licensed FFL to meet the requirements of the NY gun laws. $400 and you pay the transfer fee. Thanks for looking."
