In actuality, they are descendants of S&W model 65 and 66. The 65 & 66 models were discontinued and the 619 & 620 filled their place as the next generation.

Would like to trade for guns or guns and cash. Cash price is $3000 firm. Guns must have a realistic value of at least that much or more. I like old school weapons - Mausers, M1 garands, SVT's, AK platforms, Pump Shotguns, Bolt action rifles, and revolvers. Anything surplus +++. Service handguns like 1911's and berattas are cool too. Don't be afraid to offer other platforms.This is a 1992 Ford crew cab that was originally a 7.3 diesel. 5 years ago it was Cummins swapped with a built '90 5.9, VE pump, HX35, Fass, and rebuilt NV4500 with a Valair dual disc clutch. All the proper motor mounts and driveline was used. Everything was done professionally and even the factory tach worked. Runs and drives. In fact it's rather fun to drive around. Trans shifts smoothly. Good tires, brakes, and fair steering. 4.10 gears for pulling. Needs electrical work and basic tlc. It was parked last year because of electrical problems. I beleive most of the problem is in the multifunction switch or steering column. Interior is rough. Both windows fell off the tracks and needs driver side mirror. Would be best to find a donor truck to get interior and electrical parts. It's a worthwhile project with about $8k spent on the motor/trans alone. Basically have it valued at what I've been offered for just the motor/trans. Not parting out. Clear title in hand. I'm tired of messing with it and want some guns to tinker with this winter.Serious inqiuries only. Please don't waste my time trying to straight trade a $489 AR.

Rugged yet lightweight construction makes the 6X RAPTOR® very reliable and is the most accurate imaging device available to professional shooters. Designed to meet strict military requirements for extreme long range accuracy, the 6X RAPTOR® can be mounted on almost any weapon with an M1913 (Picatinny) Rail, and withstand the shock of full automatic fire of weapons such as the M4, M240, and M60. It can also withstand the recoil of high caliber sniper rifles, including .50 cal BMG (12.7 x 99mm). This Weaponsight incorporates a MIL-DOT Reticle (some models use the Chevron Reticle) with Variable Brightness Control, and can be zeroed with separate Windage and Elevation adjustments.  An Objective Lens Cover or Daylight Cover is a rubber cap that protects the objective lens, as well as the image tube, against accidental exposure to bright light. This daylight cover can be utilized for training and bore sighting during low-light conditions such as dawn, dusk or overcast days, by means of a small hole in the center. For night use, the cover can be pulled back on top of the sight. This Daylight Cover may be needed on nights with a full moon especially with snow covered terrain. A pressure operated rubber ""Shuttered"" Eyeguard consists of a molded rubber eyecup and an adapter ring which protects the eyepiece optics, provides operator protection from recoil, and prevents light scatter from the image tube from illuminating the shooter's face. Optional extended shuttered Eyeguard's are available.  The Objective Focus Knob is used to focus the 6X RAPTOR® for range. With a single wrist movement, the lens can be adjusted to focus distant objects from 98 feet (30mm) to ∞ (Infinity); 82 feet (25mm) to ∞ (Infinity) for the 4X Raptor.  The Elevation and Windage knobs control the Reticle position up or down (Elevation) and right or left (Windage) so the sight can be zeroed on the weapon.  The Eyepiece Focus Ring can be rotated to adjust the eye piece focus from -6 to +2 Diopters to suit the individual user.Serious inquiries e-mail for demo pictures at 300 yards  and questions , I will answer to the best of my knowledge.    Thank you very much .Shipping F*R*E*E after puchase"

It fits pretty well, but someone that has a dremel would be able to make it sit just a bit better. I bought it as my first rifle to turn into a hunting rifle, and I decided that I'd like a Glock better. It's also worth noting that the serials on the bolt and receiver both match.It fires very reliably. It's dead on accurate. There are a couple of scuffs and a TINY amount of rust around a couple of the letters. There is a small amount of cosmoline that someone with a bit more patience than I could get off.It comes with 188 rounds of military surplus rounds from a spam can, 20 rounds of Winchester 180 grain hunting rounds, a 7.62 bore snake (makes field cleaning a breeze), and I'll even throw in the waterproof ammo can from Cabela's."

It does have some wear and tear. from holstering it. It is a top shelf reliable side arm. It has never failed to feed any type of ammo.  It is a smooth shooting hand gun That I  have been able to depend on . It's all steel and it is heavy. in my opinion it's as close to perfect as I could ask for.  It's a double/single action with a decocker.  Also I do not have time travel . I can meet in Morristown or the Tri Area areas. Thanks for looking.

Just bought the scope and rings a few weeks ago for this deer season. The gun is lined in at 25 yards and is easily a 100 yard gun!

According to the serial number, the rifle was manufactured in 1993. Did some research and it’s very hard to find a Mark II in 6mm up for sale, they seem to be scarce in that caliber. If you aren’t familiar with 6mm REM, it was developed in 1952 as the .244 Remington alongside the .243 Winchester, but did not enjoy the same popularity, although it was a superior round. It was later re-branded as 6mm Remington. It has tremendous potential for custom loads as a super accurate, high velocity intermediate round with a flat trajectory/minimal arc with more than enough power to  take down deer and antelope with ease. This rifle is clean and in excellent condition, with a blued finish and wood stock with a tiger stripe grain pattern on the buttstock. This gun is a tack driver and then some. Super accurate out to 500 yards+. Will include Gun Guard rifle case, Butler Creek sling and Allen shell holder. For sale or trade.

Firearms.  Sometimes when you hear that a rifle is custom built, buyers get turned off, because it could be some dude making a ""Frank-n-gun"" in his basement.  However, that is not the case with this gun.  This is a 100% milspec rifle that was professionally built by C.a.R. Firearms.  It's one of a kind, because it's the same rifle that gets made for a Florida-based security contracting firm.  I became aware of the rifle a few years back when I saw one being made for that firm and decided to have them build me one, too.  So, if this is such a great ""One of a kind gun,"" why am I getting rid of it?  Well, the truth is that my shooting interests are changing.  They're moving away from the AR-15 platform to longer range shooting and pistols.  As a result, I'm just not shooting this rifle as much as it deserves.  Here's the specs on this rifle:-ROUND COUNT:  ~3000-The rail, upper and lower have been heat treated a grey/green color, which is a bit stronger and longer lasting than cerekote (there is minimal wear on the rail to this finish)-Spike's Tactical lower-Spike's Tactical heavy buffer-Rainer Arms upper-Hyper Touch trigger system (~3.5lb pull)-16"" Rainier Mountain Barrel 5.56/.223 w/1/7 twist (This is literally a cold hammer forged machine gun barrel, that's been shot peened and magnetic particle tested)-15"" Troy VTAC rail-BCM Mod 1 compensator/flash hider-Milspec buffer tube-Magpul CTR stock-ERGO pistol grip-Two removable milspec rail sections-The rifle is VERY light for a milspec 16"" barrled rifleIn this deal, you'll also get:-Magpul MBUIS folding back-up iron sights-One Gen 3 non-window 30 round Magpul PMAG-Magpul MS3 Gen 2 one and two point slingRELIABILITY NOTE:  -It's never had even one malfunction in ~3000 rounds-This rifle was also 100% reliable with 200 rounds of steel case ammo for testing purposesACCURACY NOTE:-I can't say that I've shot it side by side with all brands of rifle, but the one I'm selling is definitely more accurate than a BCM Recce, Daniel Defense V11 and Colt 6920."
