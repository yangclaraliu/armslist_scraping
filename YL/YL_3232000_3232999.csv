The GLOCK 23 is a great weapon due to the fact its big enough for duty use, home defense and concealed carry. And with all .40 GLOCKS you can buy conversion barrel's to convert them from a .40 to a 9mm with the switch of the barrel. You can also convert it from .40 to 357 sig the same way.  If converting it to 357 sig you can use the .40 mags but if you onvert it to 9mm you will have to buy 9mm mags also.   The only change i have made to this weapon is by upgrading the sights to Trijicon night sight everything else is factory.  And that brings me to let you know it comes with the two 10 round mags that came with it. Also it comes with the GLOCK case all paper work the speed loader the cleaning rod and brush and the two spent casings and cable lock.   The weapon looks as it did new with the exception of being shot 200 rounds."

These Rifles are at the top in the world of AK-47's. This rifle has only about 80 rounds through it. Never had a single problem, always taken care of. This model is sold out online at K-var and Atlantic. The Arsenals are said to be the best in many forums and reviews. Also included in an additional 30 round mag, and over 500 rounds of ammo, almost all wolf poly performance. I paid exactly $1000 for the rifle earlier this year. Very fair price considering availability and ammo included. Face to Face transaction only. Valid ID/CC permit, and paperwork will be required. All federal/local laws will be followed. Thanks"

However, I am not charging tax and I do not need to charge a FFL transfer fee, and if you buy online, you will pay for shipping. So if you want to pay another $100.00+ because it makes you mad that I am asking for fair market price, please go ahead and do so. It is within your rights to pay more and/or if you want to save $50.00 and buy a used one you can do that as well. This gun is new and worth every bit of $675.00 no matter where you get it from. 

If you haven't shot one, go shoot one and you will see why its probably the best compact 9mm pistols you can get on the market for this price. 

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

Blackwood: A natural stainless steel slide and black hard coat anodized alloy frame are paired with Hogue Blackwood grips."

Two cases; a total of 50 individually packaged authentic Cuban Guantanamera cigars. One will find them priced around $15-25/piece for a total value of more than $750. Factoring in the value of the rarity of these cigars is hard to do, but it may make them worth over $1,000 easily. People pay huge money for authentic Cubans.

Just to be clear this is a full milspec AR and would make a great base for military/law enforcement, the avid hog hunter, or someone who is looking for a non entry level premium AR 15. Firm on the price as it cost well over what I am asking to build it, and it only has about 40 rounds through it.

As you know the Trijicon sight has 12 years of warranty, so it has 10 or more years warranty left. Mine is the BE13Y model (you may find on Trijicon website) which features a green dot at front and 2 yellow dots in the rear. It is extremely easy to align the sight without trying to identify the front dot. Very bright and clear at night. 

Nothing wrong with the sights, I just don't use my 92 as a home defense gun any more and I want to switch back to OEM white dot for outdoor shooting.

Paid 140 plus tax and shipping for them. Asking only $100 and you got nice night sights with 10 years of warranty.

A mere 20 rounds suggests this .44 magnum is just too much gun for me: there isn't much recoil but the very loud BOOM makes me flinch. And my bills were more than I'd expected so...

It's in great shape, with a cross-bar safety, a blued finish, the standard walnut stock, a hammer extension I see no need to remove, and a Micro-Groove barrel. (Wikipedia says ""in the mid-1990s, Marlin changed the .357 and .44 barrels from 12-groove-or-more 'Micro-Groove' rifling to 6-groove 'Ballard' style rifling."") The only things wrong with this gun are that the folding leaf rear sight somehow broke off, and now there are a couple ugly but not fatal scratches on/near the sight base from where I tried and failed to install a replacement (see second photo). 

UPDATE: I went ahead and ordered another folding leaf rear sight from Midway; they say it shipped and will be here by July 7th, i.e. within a week. If somebody buys my rifle before then I'll mail it to you quickly to complete my end of the deal.

I won't be taking checks, credit cards, first-born sons, suckling goats, etc. And yes I'll consider a partial-value trade but still there has to be enough cash involved. 

You'll need to show me your valid KY driver's license or state ID, with a photocopy for my records; if you want I'll do the same. A CCDW would also help by establishing you're legally allowed to own a gun (but that's optional; I don't have one yet)."

I was able to get the DOPE on this rifle in 10 shots and went 3/4 shots at 1600 YARDS!! I just need a smaller caliber to shoot competitions, but I am also interested in muscle cars, fast cars. Would be willing to trade my set up for a decent condition muscle car must run and drive, i can do the cosmetic work. Or a decent quality Jeep. What I am trading is worth close to 10000 and this gun will only appreciate. Please dont send offers of junk, I only like american made motorcycles as well. 
I am selling my like new Barrett 98B 338 Lupua 27"" Fluted barrel, bolt action Dream rifle . It has less than 125 rounds through it not even broken in yet. Comes in its custom Pelican case and 2 mags. I have a Brand New Zero Stop NightForce 5.5X22X56 Scope on it, Mil/Mil Leupold Mark rings. Added AADLAND engineering scope covers, best in the business at $100 a pop and lifetime warranty, you cannot break these. I have over 350 rds of 338 Lupua with it. Lupua Brass Fed Gold Match Primers and Sierra Matchking 250 Gr bullets. Also including the die sets. You will have everything you need to make your own rounds for this beast. I dont get the chance to shoot it enough to warrant keeping it. I need a smaller caliber to shoot comps with unfortunetly and my loss is your gain. I love this rifle. You can not just go and find this gun just anywhere.. 
The Barrett 98B cost $5000
Nightforce Scope $2400
300 Rds Lupua Rds $6-$7 bucks a Rd so at minimum $1800

Would also consider trading for a muscle car that runs and drives, I can fix the cosmetics and other things but it needs to start,Older American sports cars i can hot rod out, Vettes Camaro's or American Motorcycles, Harley, Choppers. Remember my package is valued at close to 10000, thats not what I would take cash for it though. So if we trade we have to consider what mine is worth as well. Maybe some of you have a garages or a nice old muscle car that you just havnt finished. Shoot me your offers . Would have to go to FFL to transfer the Barrett into your name then go from there. Send pics or info if you have something to my email

Long story short, this firearm unfortunately got tossed out the window of a truck and hit the pavement. There is scuff marks on the barrel and in a few places. The rear sight is completely gone and the front sight is loose and beaten up. 

However, this gun does shoot and the internals are in perfect condition and 100% reliable (assuming your not shooting extremely cheap ammo). 

Included with the pistol is the box, manual, magazine, and a top rail that can be mounted for a red dot. (Firearm is factory drilled and tapped) 

Overall this gun is in 65% condition and with a pair of sights or red dot, will be ready to go plinking. Upon request i will send more detailed pictures off all scuff marks. I'm sure that if your a handyman, it could be buffed out and end up looking brand new."

This HK91 is in good condition, but used. It is an original HK built gun from the HK factory, except for the receiver, which is a Gewehr Werks Replacement(fine quality receivers)and it was installed by a proper gunsmith. THIS IS NOT A PARTS GUN OR A GARAGE BUILD
I can prove its a true Hk as well. The Lower, which is Steel(oem from Hk factory) has the 0-1 safety, the barrel has 12 flutes, and 4 lands in the barrel, as well as a HK proof mark on the gun(KF) dates the gun to be manufactured in 1995. I have researched Gewehr Werks and they make great quality receivers for all types of weapons, so its not a cheap part at all.
***SEE PICTURES BELOW

It shoots pretty good, about 2.5 inch group at 100 yards with open sights. I have had no malfunctions at all, and the internals are all good. Works like an HK should. I dont really want to get rid of it, but just throwing it out there because id like an extra vehicle

Comes with 500 rounds of .22 CCI

 The ARX160 is a rimfire version of the ARX100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle. But aside from the caliber, this .22 LR rifle is virtually identical to the centerfire version as far as operations, controls, accessorization and customization options. A training rifle that will never let you down, the ARX160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.

Ambidextrous Controls

A serious training rifle should always mirror the “real thing” in the way its controls work. This is why the ARX160 features ambidextrous two-position safety, magazine release and cocking handle. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank.

Limitless Accessorization, Customization Options

This training rifle is a great base for building the tactical system of your dreams. It comes out of the box with four Picatinny rails: on top, a full rail enables you to easily attach your favorite sighting or optics system, while on either side and on the bottom of the fore-end additional rails let you add other accessories such as tactical lighting. Other customization options include the telescopic folding stock: you can adjust the length of pull at the touch of a button, while the stock can be folded partially or all the way to accommodate most firing situations.


Durable, Easy to Shoot and Maintain

The ARX160 is built to be durable and super-tough, being constructed of superior steel and technopolymer. Its flip-up sights are just like those on the full-caliber rifle—super-light but rugged, and featuring a rear diopter for quick and accurate target acquisition. Maintenance is easy thanks to the simple way in which it comes apart and is reassembled without any tools. Whether you use it on its own as a rimfire tactical rifle, or as a training tool to improve your handling of the full-power counterpart, the ARX160 will always turn heads at the range and will never let you down."

It sits in the limited edition Moon Harvest camo stock and has probably seen less than 50 rounds. 

The major flaw with the Axis series is the wimpy flexible stock and stiff trigger. I have addressed these issues by reinforcing the fore-end of the stock with epoxy and aluminum flat bar.  There are a total of 6 aluminum reinforcements in the stock now.  The gaps around the trigger guard on the stock have been filled to eliminate side to side give as well.  The trigger has been set at 2.8 lbs and the trigger has been reshaped into a flat bar design that allows for more sensitivity in the finger tip-overall better trigger pulls leading to more accurate shots!  I have done what Savage should have done from the factory.  Way better performer now, will shoot 1 moa at 100 easily.  Custom gun work can cost a lot of money, save here with a great deal on a light weight bolt action that will deliver awesome performance for a budget.  

No scope is included. The rings and mount however is. 

Below are a list of things that has brought this Axis up to the rest of the competition:
Aluminum pillar bedding added to fore-stock
Trigger adjustment-2.8lbs!  breaks clean and easy

My wife and I will be leaving the country for jobs in Germany (where they don't allow firearms) and would like to sell our 9mm Hi Point before we go. 

It's almost new, it basically was bought, taken to the range once, and then sat on the bedroom dresser for the last year. Comes with two mags and is in great condition. 

Also, we might be willing to trade depending on what you have. No junk please. 

We are leaving on the 15th, so get it before then. Must go through FFL.
