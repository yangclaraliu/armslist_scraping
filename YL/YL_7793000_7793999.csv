The only remaining parts are the core, consisting of the barrel and receiver assembly and the original bolt.The threading allows for the installment of a Custom Muzzle Break, creating a large flash and loud discharge, but taking the kick down to less than an AR-15, making it easy to shoot and easy to maintain sight picture for long range shots.Then we added a Tinmey Replacement Trigger for custom weight and great wide, curved blade for comfortable and consistent placement and pull.Next is the XLR Evolution Tactical Chassis, allowing for use of AICS Box magazines (1 included), picatinney rail and QD attachments, and an adjustable, padded comb, and adjustable buttsock. (with Allen Wrench)Last, but not least, is an amazing Leupold Mk4 LR/T 6.5-20x Scope with a 30mm tube, 50mm Objective, and Leupold mounting rings. The clarity is great and teh eye relief is easy. This model has tactical milling rather than mil-dot, which is a little harder on the eyes but allows for the accuracy of hash marks versus large dots, which is needed for those long shots using holdover.Currently under 40 rounds fired, which were all fired from the completed assembly. These rounds sighted the 7mm easily at 300 meters with the first mil hashes as a perfect holdover to 400 and 500 meters on 8 and 10 in steel gongs. Also included, if requested, is a foam padded Pelican 1750 rifle case, 50 inches long to comfortably protect the rifle and magazine.

Do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond. I purchased this rifle new, back in 2013, and have been the only owner of it since then.  From my recollection, I have fired more than 100 and certainly less than 500 rounds through this rifle.  All rounds were brass cased, non-corrosive ammuntion.  This model is the composite stock - not wood, and not fiberglass.  This is the Standard model.  It has the normal, full length barrel (it's not the Scout 18inch nor the Socom 16inch) and the sights are not the National Match kind.  The Standard M1A model sights are 1 MOA clicks for both windage and elevation and the National Match sights are 1/2 MOA clicks according to Springfield Armory's website.  Included with the rifle is One 20 round magazine from Checkmate Industries, One 10 round magazine from Springfield Armory, and an old(ish) Marine Corps Loop/Parade sling, which I very much enjoyed shooting this rifle with.  The picture that shows the magazines and sling I am including has goofy blacked out portions on the rifle from where I blacked out numbers to post pictures online, there aren't actually black spots on the rifle like that.  Very Noteworthy - I carefully went about actually calibrating (more than just ""zeroing"") the rear sight to M80 Ball, such that the BDC (Bullet Drop Compensator) clicks actually mean what they say (I could verify at 200 and 300yards back when I was shooting this rifle relatively often). So that's value added for somebody.
------------------------------------- FULL DISCLOSURE Portion:
The painted stock: I took this rifle out of its stock, set the rifle (barrel, receiver, trigger mechanism, all that stuff) in the house, and tapped off the inside of the stock, and the rubber buttpad, and spray painted the exterior of the stock.  To my recollection I gave the stock a light sanding ahead of time to roughen up the texture to better hold the spray paint on, prior to painting it. I used a stone grey textured spray paint that I thought looked awesome.  Got the best part of a Wermacht grey to my eyes, and made the stock disappear against stone wall.  As I proceeded to use the rifle, in heat of summer (my face sweating) and in wet winter (slushy sleet/snow falling on me and the rifle) I found that the paint wears off in the points of greatest contact between shooter and rifle (on the comb where face rests in a good stock-weld position) and on the forend where, I suppose, my thumb rests in some shooting positions.  So, no paint on the metal of the actual rifle, but there is such paint on the composite stock, and I wanted to described its potential downsides in case that would turn somebody off of this rifle.  I care more about doing honorable business than making a sale.
On December 27, when I photographed this rifle outdoors, I was startled and saddened to find that something was wrong with the magazine well of the composite stock; while at the same time, thankful that if such a problem existed, I found it before selling it and handing a potentially rude surprise to someone.  I went to seat a 20 round, steel, Checkmate Industries magazine in the rifle for a picture, and found that while it was possible to seat a magazine in the weapon, it took great effort and diligence, as there was significant, perhaps extreme, resistance in the movement of seating the magazine.  It was like the composite stock had swelled and there were fractions of millimeters less space in the magazine well than before.   I tried again with the 10 round Springfield Armory magazine, and then again with a different 20 round Checkmate Industries magazine, and still - same problem.
What has me still stumped and confused is my past experiences with this rifle and full knowledge of how it has been stored.  I have used this rifle in summer and in winters with snow on the ground, and have never had a hint of such a problem.  I purchased this new, back in 2013, and between 2013 and 2015 I shot it in summers and atleast one winter, shooting more than 100, and certainly less than 500 total rounds during those years.  Since then, It has pretty much been a safe queen.  It was a low of 30 degrees F and high of 50 degrees F in town on December 27 (likely closer to the high when I photographed in the afternoon) so it was in the mid range of temperatures I have personally seen this rifle's magazine well perform just fine in.   I looked in the magazine well for plastic composite being shaved off by magazine seating and didn't see anything out of the ordinary to my eyes.  It's not like this stock is made of wood and had been soaked in water before being exposed to freezing temperatures.   Since I've been the only owner and the one storing it, I know that it hasn't been dropped, twisted, wrenched, compressed, overheated, used as a prybar, nor to prop open castle portcullis.  I'm simply stumped where this problem materialized from.   
So, after all that, short story - this is an excellent rifle, with a calibrated rear sight (wasn't easy to do) but for points 1 and 2 of FULL DISCLOSURE, a buyer might be after this whole package with full intent to discard the stock and drop the rifle into a new stock or chassis system.
End of FULL DISCLOSURE Portion:
-------------------------------------- My Escali kitchen scale says this rifle weighs 8 pounds, 3.1 ounces, with the rifle unloaded and no magazine inserted. Transfer will go through FFL.  That FFL will be South Carolina Gun Company (SC Gun Co) at 242 W. Wade Hampton Blvd, Greer, South Carolina.   
In the event I'm shipping this, whatever the buyer's cost to receive it from their FFL is will be on the buyer.  Transfer going through FFL is non-negotiable.  Offers to skip the FFL will be viewed as a waste of my time.  I took several more pictures than the 3 I can post with my free Armslist account.  If you want more, I can email them.  If I am to ship this rifle, I will accept USPS money order, and I will turn that into real cash money in my hand before I ship anything anywhere.  Sorry for the extra time and hassle, I'm selling a legit product and I want to ensure I have legit payment to avoid getting burned here. 
If we meet in person at the FFL, I'll accept cash, and cash only.  Buyer of a rifle needs to be 18 years of age and able to pass the inquiry of ATF Form 4473.
In the event that buyer wants me to ship this firearm to their FFL, buyer assumes burden of responsibility of knowing that this firearm is legal for them to possess (whatever the particulars of their state's laws and statues are on the subject).  Buyer also ensures that he or she is legally able to possess this firearm (is mentally competent, has not been convicted of even a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, and all the other qualifying points on ATF Form 4473).   In the event that buyer and seller agree to a sale, I (the seller) receive payment, package up the firearm, take it to the FFL, transfer the firearm to the FFL so that the FFL can proceed to ship firearm to the buyer's FFL, and then it turns out the buyer cannot take possession of the firearm for whatever reason - we (buyer and seller) agree that I (seller) will refund only half of the money.  I know this is ugly talk, but it's just and it's simple: I'm a regular guy with a life to live and job to pursue, trying to liquidate a couple items, buyer needs to know if they can pass the checklist to take possession of said firearm (i.e., I respect your time, hard-earned money, and hassle; I expect you to respect mine).
I will not sell firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms right to an individual (i.e., bypassing the FFL). Again, do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.  I really mean it - tested and proven.
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order.   If purchasing a firearm, buyer agrees that I (seller) cannot and should not be able to monitor the use of the firearm anymore (it will no longer be my possession, my responsibility, or any of my business for that matter)."

It uses any and all AK-47 mags. Comes with the: “UltiMAK Vepr II” Optic mount from Primary Arms: http://www.primaryarms.com/ultimak-vepr-ii-vepr-k-scout-mount-m3-bupper for mounting any and all optics. Using a quality Red Dot Optics allows you to co-witness with your manual sights. It has a beautiful sporter wooden stock with matching forearm, that can be easily converted to a folding or slide out stock or any other stock configuration you like. Russian Molot manufactured, and imported by FIME in Las Vegas. FIME has been importing the Arsenal rifles. All Molot VEPR made 7.62x39 AK variants are now banned on import to the USA. Only reason I'm selling this one, is I have two that are just alike. Both are “LNIB” and a coin toss picked this one to sell. The 16.5” chromed lined and Russian machine gun barrel is extremely well balanced, and shoulder's to sight level instinctively, like an extremely well balanced hunting rifle. The VEPR 7.62x39 was the base gun used in the very expensive Krebs Custom AK. I use to own that model Krebs, until I got my Molot VEPRS's. I have had them all, including Arsenal's, Krebs, etc. and these VEPR rifles are more accurate, and higher quality in build than any other AK platform that I have seen. The Molot VEPR is made from the Russian RPK machine gun, and has the RPK-style hammer forged chrome lined barrel and the RPK-style 1.5mm heavy stamped receiver. It gives the VEPR extra strength, without the extra weight of a milled receiver. You also have to consider that it has the RPKstyle reinforced trunnion block. These guns were made to shoot thousands of rounds. Seek out on the internet, the youtube video of one of these rifles in full auto, shooting so many rounds, one after another, that the front wooden forearm stock catches fire from it getting so hot, but still shooting. My price is $1100. Comes with original box and two mags. Original Red Russian mag in pic does not go with gun. Don't buy an overpriced Saiga converted AK or any lower end Romanian Wasp AK's, they will not have the quality, accuracy, built in toughness or re-sale of this VEPR rifle, and you will pay as much or more for them, and very rarely will you know the person or persons that did their conversions or head spaced the gun properly. Russians know how to make AK's they invented them. Stick with a Russian made AK- 47 or one of their variants. I am a private gun owner, and just selling off a few guns. (No Fire Sale Here, but you will save some money.) I only own and have purchased quality firearms. Because of arthritis many of my guns have never been fired. I Will require a “Bill Of Sale” and proof of Alabama residency (AL. DL) to anyone of legal age, on all firearms that I sell. Will only consider pistols as trades. TEXT will not be answered."

Do you have trouble counting to 7? Is it hard to figure out when your slide locks back that you need to reload? Your problems have now been solved! Up for sale is the Radetec ammo control grip which uses a digital numerical readout to tell you how many more ninjas you can shoot before reloading. It has a photocell which dims the light in low light conditions so you can focus more on insurgents and less on that ultra exotic 1970's display from your dad's old VCR. It includes two nice 8 round mags, and the grip itself which installs on pretty much any gov. sized or commander 1911 platform chambered in .45 acp. The pics show the grip installed on my Sig. There is a built in shock sensor that will display the remaining rounds after every shot or a manual check button on the front of the grip(where most laser buttons are). Also has a button on the side that will display the total shots fired since installation, so when you sell your pistol you will know exactly to what degree you are lying when you say ""I only fired 1 mag through it and put it up""....or the more realisitc ""one clip threw it"".Make your fellow Navy Seals envious, make your wife aroused, and make 1911 purists vomit by installing this LED infused christmas tree on your vintage collector weapon. This thing might save your life one day...or it might not, but you will never know unless you buy it. Hey, the 2 mags alone are almost worth the price, they are not cheap mags...not Wilson combat nice, but not cheap either. You get the grip, 2 mags, factory box, papers and instructions and the swell of pride from being the baddest MF in the valley? well that's free."

The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine, and a low capacity-compliant version is available with two 10 round magazines. With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.
