I NEED one. Ok, I don't actually ""need"" one, but, yeah, I do. I'm 99% interested in trading this for a 9mm MP5 clone BUT I will entertain other trades so feel free to send trade offers. Oh, and I'd also consider an HK MP5 de-mil parts kit too. 

Anyway, if I spend another nickel out of our checking account my wife will run off with the good looking guy at her office and live happily ever after. I'd rather she not be be happy so I'm not going to give her an excuse so instead of buying an MP5 clone I'm going to try to trade for it first. 

I've been researching MP5 clones so I know a bit about the good ones and the ones to watch out for but I'm actually open to any of them at the moment. Please just let me know what you have. Whatever I buy is going to get a stamp so I'd prefer to buy one as a ""pistol"" but I'd buy one with a 16"" barrel and cut it after the stamp comes back too. 

Here's what I have for trade and I'm willing to trade any combination of these things or one or two items plus cash or whatever works for you: 

1) 
Colt upper M4 clone. 
The Upper- This upper is a rare Diemaco (Canadian) Colt upper receiver with a Colt 14.5"" Govt. profile barrel, 1/7 twist, Colt ""F' marked FSP, Knight's Armament RAS rail, Knight's Armament rear BUIS, professionally pinned and welded BCM A2x flash hider (reaches 16.1"") and has a hard to find CQD forward sling mount. EOTech 512 red dot optic. The BCG is not Colt. I'd estimate that the barrel has seen no more than 400rds. (Almost all the wear you see on the weapon was just cosmetic paint wear to add to the cool-guy-factor of building an M4 clone. The wear on the EOTech 512, however, is real.) 
The Lower- This lower is just an Anderson standard A2 lower with a CMMG LPK, OD green A2 grip, VLTOR IMOD mil spec stock, and a MIdWest Industries rear QD sling mount with loop. 
This weapon shoot like a dream 100% reliable and accurate. Hate to get rid of it but my lust for an MP5 clone is undeniable. 

2) 
7.5"" AR pistol with Sig brace 
The upper- The upper is a lightweight profile 7.5"" 5.56 barrel with a LaRue gas block and a LaRue 7.0 free float rail. Hayes Research HK sights, Streamlight M3 light and Rocky Mountain Tactical NiB FA BCG. This thing is 110% reliable. I have literally NEVER had a single failure with this weapon. Ever. I don't know how I lucked out with this build but it is solid and reliable. I've put maybe 250 rds through it. All XM193 
The Lower- Spikes tactical ""no-logo"" A2 lower with a PSA LPK in it and a RRA fluted pistol tube, a Sig brace and a Magpul ASAP rear sling plate thing. I included photos of this thing next to the tennis racquet bag that I carry it in and keep it in my car on the passenger side seat or floorboard. Again, this thing is a dream to shoot. I've also included photos of it atop my NFA lower (the green one) to show you how bad ass this thing is as a small little SBR/PSD build with a small CAR stock or the LWRC micro stock.
The optic- It is not pictured but this will come with an S.P.O.T. red dot optic in an Aimpoint QRP mount. 

3) 
West German marked Sig P226 with five Sig mags.This is one of the ones that has the slide, frame and barrel all marked with the same serial number. This is one of the Sigs that were made back when Sigs were actually Sigs. This one was made with the original grips. Comes with five mags, 4 German Sig zipper back mags and one slightly newer Sig mag made by MecGar under Sig contract. All are in great condition and function flawlessly. This was an LEO duty weapon so it has some wear marks on the slide near the muzzle from holster wear. Comes with the Sig ""Law Enforcement Only"" hard case. 
The holster- Super cool mil surp US Navy Seal ""operator modified"" Safariland dropleg holster that has had the standard mods that they all do to it where they shorten the belt strap, remove the upper leg strap, drill a hole to add a bungy to slip over the grip when parachuting. Painted FDE(ish). Right hand. 

4) 
Mossberg 500 ATP (marine finish) 12ga former police patrol shotgun. 
This one is rare. It is marked ""Surete Du Qubec Police"" and looks like it bounced around the back of a lot of patrol cars in its life. It comes with the original folding stock/pistol grip that was on it when it was a patrol weapon. I also bought a Mossberg fixed stock and then an slightly smaller aftermarket fixed stock (the one on there now). This one is in that marine finish. Looks like it has been to war and back but runs like butter."

This model was bought a few years ago and has the gold anodize finish on the barrel; they don't make this model anymore, and it was somewhat hard to find when I did buy it...even harder to find today.  Obviously, it shoots .22LR and has a nice set of sights.  I painted them for easier acquisition (see pictures).  The rear site is a target site that is fully adjustable for windage and for elevation.

The Lite version of the 22/45 has an aluminum upper and a polymer lower.  The barrel is fixed to the polymer receiver; the bolt cycles rearward after firing the round and then comes back forward to strip another round.  The gun originally had a magazine disconnect from the factory that both locked out the trigger when the magazine wasn't present AND prevented the magazines from falling free.  I replaced that with a new bushing from Tandemkross and the gun works better than new now.  Tandemkross also makes a kit allowing you to ""slingshot"" the slide forward, but I haven't installed that.  The grip panels are rubber and removable; as this frame has the 1911 grip angle, I understand that most all 1911 grips can be installed as-is or with slight modifications.

I have probably 600 rounds through this gun.  It operates flawlessly.  It's been stored clean and empty.  It comes with everything you'd get if you bought it new; Ruger box, all papers, original spent shell casing, locks, upper scope rail (not shown installed in the pictures), two magazines, and soft Ruger zipper pouch.

I'd prefer to sell, but would consider trades.  Let me know what you have.  The buyer (either through cash or trade) will be required to sign a bill of sale and will have to have a concealed handgun permit or a pistol purchase permit.  I have a concealed handgun permit, so if you are considering a trade, know that I have the required paperwork my end.

Asking price is $350 or best offer."

The 96A1 is an evolution of the legendary 92FS (M9), one of the world’s most successful pistols for military, law-enforcement and self-defense use. Chambered in the powerful .40 S&W, it comes with two 10-round magazines to deliver impressive firepower for any tactical use. It is safe, accurate and reliable while offering easy operation, accessorization and disassembly; and its durability is further enhanced by a recoil buffer that greatly diminishes component stress. A pistol that bears the unmistakeable Beretta looks, it is the ultimate choice for shooters wanting a professional-grade personal- or home-defense pistol that can also be easily adapted for concealed carry.


 Accurate and Reliable

The cold-hammer forged barrel on the 96A1 is designed to deliver great accuracy out of the box, while the dovetail-mounted front sight is easy to adjust to always keep you on target. The barrel is encased in an open slide typical of Beretta’s 90-series pistols; besides reducing weight and backward-momentum during firing, this design maximizes reliability and virtually eliminates “stove-piping.”


Durable and Made to Last

With the 96A1, the hard-hitting .40 S&W comes back stronger than ever in the 90-series lineup. The brand new recoil buffer that is machined right into the action of the 96A1 essentially acts as a cushon against the stress between moving parts, greatly boosting the service life of this powerful pistol. Also, the Bruniton finish on the metal is designed to be corrosion resistant to give worry-free maintenance even after all-day concealed carry in scorching-hot conditions.


 Easy to Accessorize

The 96A1 comes with an integral Picatinny rail on which users can easily mount a variety of tactical accessories--such as tactical lights, aiming devices or even both. Additionally, the front sight is dovetail-mounted, meaning that it is adjustable for windage and can be easily replaced with an accessory front sight of the user’s choice. If you love the unmatched performance of the Beretta 92FS or M9 and want a few extra tactical features as well as the extra power of the .40 S&W, the Beretta 96A1 is your ultimate choice."

280,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3079280,For Sale:  * RARE * Wilkinson Terry 9mm Tactical Entry Carbine gun * uzi * 9 mm *,"Pierce County, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,200","Listed On: Monday, May 19, 2014",Rifles,no type,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Listed here is a rare piece of firearm history that dates from the 1970’s and 1980’s. This is the Wilkinson Arms Terry 9mm Carbine. Based on an original design from J&R Engineering called the M68, this was a limited production run from a Mom & Pop style firearm manufacturer that placed too much emphasis on perfection and quality that subsequently put them out of business.

The Terry carbine is chambered in 9mm and is a pistol caliber carbine. Although it has the legal barrel length of 16in, several inches of the barrel reside in the receiver to give an extremely compact tactical package. The end of the barrel features a muzzle brake enclosed by a flash suppressor cone. As you can see from the pictures, the barrel removed from the receiver by simply unscrewing a washer which then breaks the gun down into an extremely small and concealable package.

This carbine was designed as a tactical entry carbine for use by law enforcement and SWAT teams. This gun takes 32 round magazines and feeds in the same manor of an Uzi. This gun will out-shoot an UZI all day long with accuracy and reliability. The quality of manufacturing and materials put the cheaply stamped UZI to shame. This thing functions as solidly as a bank vault! Essentially, this is the American Uzi that never made it mainstream. The upper part of the receiver is formed so that a simple claw scope mount can be mounted and optics utilized. I can personally attest that of the 3 times I have shot this rifle, I had no problem hitting a man size metal target from 100-150yrds. This carbine is an absolute joy to shoot and the 9mm ammo is not only affordable, it can be shot at any gun range to boot!

Wilkinson Arms also manufactured a much more common variant of this gun in pistol form known as the Linda. This particular example is in excellent condition and comes with 3 32 round magazines.

 The stock is in BEAUTIFUL shape and the entire rifle looks great and functions fantastically.
 I had plans to keep this locked in the safe but other projects force me to sell. Buyer is responsible to make sure they are legally able to purchase and own this weapon. A Washingtong State drivers license or CCL will be needed for my records only for the bill of sale. Please feel free to call or text with any questions. REDACTED

The Ruger® LCR (Lightweight Compact Revolver) Standard Hogue Tamer Grip
This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** Hogue® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil"

Beretta 96A1: Ultimate Tactical Firepower

The 96A1 is an evolution of the legendary 92FS (M9), one of the world’s most successful pistols for military, law-enforcement and self-defense use. Chambered in the powerful .40 S&W, it comes with two 10-round magazines to deliver impressive firepower for any tactical use. It is safe, accurate and reliable while offering easy operation, accessorization and disassembly; and its durability is further enhanced by a recoil buffer that greatly diminishes component stress. A pistol that bears the unmistakeable Beretta looks, it is the ultimate choice for shooters wanting a professional-grade personal- or home-defense pistol that can also be easily adapted for concealed carry.


 Accurate and Reliable

The cold-hammer forged barrel on the 96A1 is designed to deliver great accuracy out of the box, while the dovetail-mounted front sight is easy to adjust to always keep you on target. The barrel is encased in an open slide typical of Beretta’s 90-series pistols; besides reducing weight and backward-momentum during firing, this design maximizes reliability and virtually eliminates “stove-piping.”


Durable and Made to Last

With the 96A1, the hard-hitting .40 S&W comes back stronger than ever in the 90-series lineup.  The brand new recoil buffer that is machined right into the action of the 96A1 essentially acts as a cushon against the stress between moving parts, greatly boosting the service life of this powerful pistol. Also, the Bruniton finish on the metal is designed to be corrosion resistant to give worry-free maintenance even after all-day concealed carry in scorching-hot conditions."

We have the box and paperwork as well. 
Caliber: .40 S&W
Capacity: 6+1 (extended Magazine)
Operation: Trigger cocking DAO; lock breech; ""Browning - type"" recoil lug; passive striker block; no magazine disconnect
Barrel: 3.1"", conventional rifling; 1 - 16 right-hand twist
Length O/A: 5.47""
Height: 4.0""
Slide Width: .94""
Weight: Pistol 15.8 ounces, Magazine 1.9 ounces
Grips: Textured polymer
Sights: Drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight, pinned in polymer front sight
Finish: Black polymer frame, matte stainless steel slide. 
The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses.

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today:
 - The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds.
 - Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design.
 - Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols."

The other difference is that the controls are silver colored instead of black. These match the stainless finish on the gun and in my opinion, makes it more visually attractive than the non matching American models. This gun was cleaned after being purchased by myself, but never fired. I do not have the original box or case and it comes with one magazine. The sights are standard red dots and not night sights.

Test fired only.

Bravo Company (BCM) complete 20-inch 1/7 government profile barrel, A4 upper with BCM bolt, carrier and charging handle. 

Got the whole thing from Bravo company a few years back, added the handguards (they are Colt or old Bushmaster, I can't recall) and set it aside. Its been sitting in the safe for a while and just needs a new home. 

Bravo company is really first-rate gear and quite exceptional. This is the info from their website:

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM™) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups or charging handles.

...from Bravo Company's website regarding the high quality of their lowers.

As a note: BCM™ barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM™ upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

Like new- no issues at all. I think I even still have the original packaging. 

From their website:
The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™’s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.
