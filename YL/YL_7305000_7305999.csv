Except for their threaded barrels, these variants are identical to standard VP series pistols; only their weights and lengths differ due to the longer and slightly heavier threaded barrel.  At the rear of the slide is a pair of protrusions called charging supports. These inserts appear to be polymer pieces that are dovetailed into the sides of the slide. The supports extend at a 90˚ angle from the side of the slide, and are designed to improve the shooter’s ability to work the slide. Carrying the idea of the People’s Pistol forward, the handgun has interchangeable backstraps and side panels to fit nearly any hand size. Right out of the box, the gun can be configured for 27 different grip sizes.The VP9 is fully ambidextrous. Every control on the left side of the gun has a duplicate control on the right side of the gun. There are no parts that have to be swapped to make it south paw friendly as must be done on some other pistols."

Will sell the rifle and ammo separately, for $500 for the rifle, or $200 for the ammo. Has fired maybe 50 rounds. This rifle was originally equipped with all the things to keep us safe, including the restricted magazine. Normalizing the Yugo isn't easy, but I liked the swept gas nut, the other models don't have and the beefer construction. Hogging-out the well with a Dremel looks terrible and is just the beginning of a proper conversion. They cut the bolt as well, and it must be replaced to feed correctly. Conversion to normal capacity magazines, threaded barrel and other things not remembered, were performed by Two-Riivers Arms, owned by Rep. Steve Russell. Two-Rivers specializes in recreations of the Tabuk, if I recall. I was lucky an AK-only shop was not far. I wanted a correct and pristine conversion of the magazine well, and that's what I got. It looks and works perfect. To do it right, it all had to be drilled apart, machined and reassembled. The bolt and gas piston was replaced along with the trigger group. The top cover was replaced, to remove the ridiculous useless rail mounted to the shakey sheet-metal dust cover of an AK, by the importer. Parts removed in the conversion are included. Trade the rifile and ammo for $700 in Bitcoin BTC, Litecoin, Etherium or BCC. Cash OK too, I guess. Offers must be entertained in person. Don't even bother bringing me an offer, unless it's face to face. If cash is all you have to offer, best bring the full amount. I can meet at Highways 33 and 74 (Portland Ave).

Less than one hundred rounds fired through it.This is a sub MOA carbon fiber masterpiece. Made in Utah. 18inch, hand-lapped (from factory) match barrel. Carbon fiber barrels last considerably longer than traditional, much stiffer, and dissipates heat much faster - in addition to being much lighter. You also get an awesome carbon fiber keymod (my fav) handgaurd. I get 1/2 MOA with Hornady ELD-X rounds and have gotten some 1/4 MOA with my hand loads. It has a Triggertech match trigger. My opinion is that they are the finest AR triggers you can buy. The Christensen receiver pins are superb as well!I bought this rifle to be my elk gun and because I can hunt any big game in N America and carry it all day. It is as light as a AR-15. Just over 7 pounds. Once it is in your hands, you will fall in love.Improvements: I added an ergo grip, and Drakes and Associates butt-stock that has a shock-piston to even further lessen felt recoil. With the Christensen tun-able titanium muzzle brake, this bad boy shoots as soft as an AR-15! I paid $3,100 before add-ons. It does come with scope, mount, bi pod, or sights. Comes with Christensen embroidered tac bag.Buyer pays transfer fees. $1,950 OBO. That's over a $800.00 savings for basically a new rifle! Not interested in any trades.
