The guns pretty rare, made after the spas 12, is the semi auto only variant of it. Was only imported for a few years then banned around 94 so there's not a ton around for sale. I'd like to trade it for some older unique rifles or shotguns. Remington autoloading rifles, model 8, lever guns, older stuff mainly but will also trade for newer stuff. Offer anything I don't use this gun as much as I should and would like to trade or a couple other guns instead. Send me what you have and we can go from there. Value of the gun is around $900-1000 based on what shops around me want for it and how much it goes for on gun broker. I'd be willing to consider a little less if cash offer comes along but trade value is around 900-1000."
