As stated, this set will only fit the Yugoslavian/Serbian AK rifles and not standard AKM pattern.
Handguards have a nice heatshield and the buttstock is collapsible with an adjustable cheek riser. Great for rifles with optics. Also comes with the pistol grip.
I'm selling because it was an impulse buy and I changed my mind shortly thereafter because I still like the wood on my AK.

I tried to take close up pictures of the stamps. It's an underwood barrel marked 4-43. The SN places the gun in 1943. I'm far from an expert on these but I have some customers that have told me this was original with the Underwood barrel. It's nice and tight. Buyer will pay $20 for shipping.

I've used this gun for everything from woodchucks to coyote and even a bobcat this year and it absolutely  anchors them with no pelt damage. This gun shoots sub MOA groups that could be covered with a dime. If you sight it in 2 inches high at 200 then your shooting almost flat out to 300 yards.
