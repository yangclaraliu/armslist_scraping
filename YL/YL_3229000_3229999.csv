with the most beautiful and sharpest-shooting real-live US-made Winchester
lever action you will ever hold in your hands. Whether your target is paper, a water-filled pop bottle, a deer, or a MMF wild pig head-on, there’s nothing like the BOOM on your end and the SMACK on the other end of a 225 grain flat-nosed lead slug over a full case of FFFG!

20 in Starline brass seated to the first lube groove.

I’m an old black powder fan turning 70 this year, with too many guns to play with anymore. Time to pass some on, to bring smiles to new faces.

$750, about the value of the rifle alone as a collector piece. Chuck in the dies, brass, and loaded ammo, you got yourself a bargain.

The CZ50 is a rugged all steel construction pistol that's a very close copy of the Walther PPK. It is a single/double action pistol. 

Overall condition is very good with 85% of the metal finish intact. There is some wear on the sharp edges and around the muzzle from holster carry. The bore is bright and shiny with no rust or pitting. Grips are excellent with no cracks or chips. 

This pistol was most likely issued to CZECH Police units, and it served them well until replaced by the CZ70. 

Pistol comes with two factory finger grip mags, original cleaning rod, and an original black leather CZ holster that is stamped with the CZ logo and the pistol model. Original model specific CZ holsters are very tough to find nowadays. 

Finally there are two 50 round boxes of recent manufacture 32 ACP FMJ ammo by Fiocchi included in the deal. 

All in all this pistol would make an excellent nightstand/self defense, or concealed carry weapon. As with all CZ made firearms it very reliable and quite durable.

Price is $350 picked up in the Brandon area. FTF Only. Buyer must be a Florida resident who is at least 21 years old. 

Thanks for looking."

While it's a neat piece of history it's no safe queen. I've dropped deer with it though in its current state it isn't much fun carrying through the Oregon woods. I bought it because I thought it'd make a fun project gun to sporterize and I love shooting it, but I just don't have the time to do anything really nifty with it. Maybe you do, and can make it into something beautiful.

I value the rifle AND ammo around $450 — lowballs politely DECLINED though I'll listen to reasonable offers — and will be putting up photos over the next couple of days.

This is an older model 92 but it is in great shape, not LNIB, but around 90-95% condition.  This is an Italian made model with the more desirable straight dust cover and all metal, no plastic parts (metal guide rod, controls, sights, etc). Comes in its original case and with two magazines.
 I'm a big fan of the Beretta 92 but its just a bit too long for me to carry on a regular basis.  I'd be interested in trading it for something more in the mid size range.  However, I'm only looking for 9mm's, and Id like to stick with something sa/da and hammer fired.

Even in summer months, this Galco holster can easily conceal a large HK USP under an over shirt without having to worry about it digging into your side or buying a larger pants size for a sub par IWB holster.

It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."

The Winchester Model 1876 or Centennial Model was a Heavier-Framed rifle than the Model 1866 or Model 1873, and was the first to be chambered for full-powered centerfire rifle cartridges, as opposed to rimfire cartridges or handgun-sized centerfire rounds. 
While similar in design to the 1873, the 1876 was actually based on the prototype 1868 lever-action rifle that was never commercially produced by Winchester.

The 1876 was introduced to celebrate the American Centennial, and earned a reputation as a durable and powerful hunting rifle. 
The 1876 in the latter chambering is the only repeater known to have been used in any numbers by the professional Buffalo Hunters.
The Canadian North-West Mounted Police used the 1876 in .45-75 as a standard long arm for many years with 750 rifles purchased for the force in 1883
The Mountie-model '76 carbine was also issued to the Texas Rangers.

""Theodore Roosevelt"" used an engraved, pistol-gripped half-magazine 1876 during his early hunting expeditions in the West and praised it.

A ""1876"" Rifle was also found in the possession of Apache Warrior ""Geronimo"" after his surrender in 1886.

 Cons: The steering has some play, but everything about the mower works perfectly. It still drives fine and mows great. It might not even matter to you, but i just wanted to be honest. It's a simple 15 minute fix but I haven't had the time to do it. 

Cutting deck is sitting about an inch off the ground at full height. Needs to be adjusted for better height adjustment.
