Profile: Ultra Slim Compact Carry Taurus
 
Condition: Perfect!
 
Super-compact 9mm pistol that easily fits into a pocket or waistband.
Striker-fired action. Trigger system is like a true double action/single action design. It is fired single action every time, and the double action is there as a backup, in the event that a cartridge fails to fire on the first pull of the trigger. In other words, the trigger system has double-strike capability. The slide does not have to cock the action before the trigger can be pulled again, allowing the shooter to try again if a dud cartridge does not fire on the first pull. Trigger pull is perfect for its size.
Multiple safeties: Manual safety allows the pistol to be carried cocked and locked by blocking the trigger and locking the slide. There is a trigger safety, so carrying with the thumb safety in the “off safe” position will work as well. There is also an internal firing pin block, that blocks the striker from reaching the primer of the chambered cartridge unless the trigger is in its rearward position.
3 dot sight system.   Rear sight is adjustable for both elevation and windage.
Grip well-textured for a positive hold and shaped for a comfortable feel.
Low-profile magazine release -- large enough for a quick reload, but is not so elevated above the surface of the frame that it might be unintentionally activated.
Barrel is 3.28” and provides excellent accuracy for such a small pistol.This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is for sale.  If you can see the ad, it is for sale.(No trades.  No silly low offers.  These messages will not be returned.)"

I also painted the A2 style front post for better visibility, and recently did a full strip, clean, and lube using Hoppe's #9 solvent, lube, and CLP (just so you know in case you prefer FrogLube, which is a great product too!) so she will be nice and shiny when you get her!!

I've never experienced any of the issues you see online that obviously stem from abuse and neglect - if you know this firearm then you know how capable it is.

No real need for it. I would like to trade this bad mamma-jamma for a 4x4 vehicle. Obviously not new one haha! Preferably an older Jeep Wrangler or perhaps an older Land/Range Rover. There are other 4x4’s I’d consider, just let me know what you have. I’m looking for SUV’s or trucks, not ATV’s. My criteria is that IT MUST BE WORTH AT LEAST $9,000 on KBB. Also no rebuilt orSalvage titles.I can wiggle a little on the worth depending on what you have but i won’t accept a $3,000+/- vehicle with $4k worth of upgrades. Upgrades are purely personal preferences and don’t hold much weight in terms of adding value. What YOU wanted might not be what someone else wants. When you look this bike up on KBB and NADA.com, they both post is at $8,500 and that is with their calculated National Average Mileage accrual formula saying that this bike has an average of 13,700 miles...This Bike ONLY HAS 1,700 miles on it soIt’s obviously worth more. Here’s the breakdown of the bike.2015 Yamaha Stryker Bullet CowelPristine ConditionONLY 1,700 miles on it!!!Clean title, insured, registered.Under bumper-to-bumper fully transferable warranty until August 20201,304 cc engine.Adult owned, always kept in the garage, never dropped, always kept clean and dust free. I turnit on and run it every single day for about 5 minutes just to keep things circulating properly. Newly inspected. I have a little girl and my wife is extremely terrified of ever losing me. So I’ve decided to stop riding, I have other hobbies anyway ;) I’m willing to sell it outright, or trade for guns, but would prefer a 4x4 vehicle if you one.I'm located in San Antonio.
