I'm leaning towards 22 caliber but I'm open to other calibers. Please be realistic in offers. Don't expect me to give full retail on your $80 Wal-Mart gun and expect me to trade even up. Also bear in mind air rifles do not hold their value like Henry rifles do. I'm not trying to low ball anyone, but I do expect fair market value for both of us. I will gladly give fair used value for extras such as optics, bipod, slings, ect.  I am the first owner of the Henry, it will include the factory box and paper work. It has a low round count. This rifle is very accurate and reliable. Shoots short, long, and long rifle. It's only going up for trade because I generally take one of my many other 22 rifles out before this one."

Also equipped with tri-rail, spiked muzzle brake / flash hider, bipod forward grip, and a cheap red laser (on left side).Slide-Fire brand bump stock is lockable. This gun is lots of fun and can reliably feed all kinds of ammo thanks to the adjustable gas piston regulator upgrade... Most other semi-auto shotguns will only work with high-power tactical loads like slugs and buckshot. Takes a little bit of practice but the gun provides plenty of recoil to operate the bump-fire effect; not for kids; blowing through 12ga buckshot at high speed tends to push the shooter backwards. I've decided to offer it up for sale/trade since I rarely get to use it and have other shotguns that are more manageable.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSlygOKvk7AAny trade/sale will be via FFL gun shop of your choice (I prefer Welcher's or Quantico in Tacoma)related guns: Izmash Russian Zentico Vepr 12 molot Oruzhie VPO-205, VPO-206, Cheetah, , AK47 12ga, kushnapup, vaper, vapor,"

Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, yet without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers. Specifications and features: Kel-Tec SUB-2000 carbine 9mm Luger 16"" barrel 17 round detachable magazine (accepts Beretta 92 magazines) Single aperture rear sight Fluorescent front sight, adjustable for windage and elevation Crossbolt, protected safety Black synthetic thumbhole stock Can be folded in half for an overall size of 16"" x 7"" for compact storage 29.5"" overall length 4.0 lbs unloaded"

He thanked me and did not change the advertisement. Many guys would probably spot the fake, but some might not and that is why I’m posting this. You can tell it is fake by the lettering, it is not raised, molded lettering. It is white ink printed lettering. Along with poor workmanship as a whole. Be careful buying used optics!! There are lots of ways to check the legitimacy of Trijicon products! Have a good day"

Started as a M92 PAP and had all following modifications professionally installed by a few local gunsmiths (It was sent out to a specialist for the barrel threading and piston tune): Side folding SB Tactical Mini Pistol brace installed on a stormwerkz hinge. ALG Enhanced AK trigger was installed. Barrel was threaded 1/2x28 to allow use with normal flash hiders or suppressors. Threads and barrel were checked for concentricity by the smith. Gas Piston and spring system were tuned to lower the gas pressure on the carrier (these are notoroiusly overgassed). This now runs 100% reliably both suppressed and unsupressed - rare feature for AK variants. The famous TWS Dogleg Rail cover as well as rear peep sight were installed. Finally, the Midwest Industries MLOK handgaurd installed (will also include the original wood front handgaurd). This ""pistol"" had a lot of care go into it and is an incredible project. Ton of fun to shoot. Will include 2 PMAGs and 2 factory mags with purchase to qualifying buyers. Must ship/transfer through FFL"
