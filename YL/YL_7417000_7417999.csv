I have shot and carried this gun a lot, but I find myself not shooting it as much as my no-dash in the same barrel length, so time to move on to other guns.Overall condition is pretty nice. Some light freckling (shown in photo) from old corrosion that has been removed. A couple scrapes and dents on the back strap and stocks from use in the backcountry (shown in photo). Timing is good, lockup is tight on all chambers. Target stocks have most of the original finish and just the dents shown in the photo. Overall an excellent pre-lock ""shooter"" ready for use as a woods gun for defense or handgun hunting.$750 cash, firm. I will cover transfer fees at Sound Loan in Everett.

However, we will not ship the firearm until the check is verified and has cleared our bank.
Ohio residents must pay Ohio Sales Tax at our State/County rate of 7.0%. There is no city tax at our location.
We do not ship firearms direct to any person. We only ship to a transferring Federal Firearm Licensed dealer. We will need you to provide us with the contact information for that dealer. FFL's can be scanned and sent to us at the contact information you will receive during the checkout process.

Itll rest on your shoulder with a Magpul PRS stock as you squeeze the Timney trigger. Mounted in some Seekins Precision rings is a Vortex Viper PST 6-24x50 FFP. The riffle rests on an Ergo Grip with Palm shelf and a Harris Bipod. Building this thing cost me around 3K, but I'm listing it for only 2300 as I'd like it to go somewhere itll actually get used.

One of them is this very nice and rare Franchi I-12 Limited. Made by Benalli. This shotgun is in excellent condition. Here is a text from a gun review site. 
The Franchi I-12 Limited is a semi-automatic shotgun chambered in 12 gauge. Since 1868, Franchi has been designing and manufacturing double-barreled and semi-automatic shotguns for sportsmen. The I-12’s top-of-the-line model, the Limited, differs from other I-12’s in that it has custom touches like an engraved nickel receiver with gold inlays and a beautiful hand-rubbed, oil finished walnut stock. 
The Limited uses the Inertia Driven System for its action where the bolt is basically fixed when the firing pin punches forward and strikes the primer. The primer sends a charge into the gunpowder and it explodes and releases gases that propel the shot through the barrel. Once the shot and gas exit, a backwards force drives through the gun. When the force reaches the bolt housing, the bolt is then driven back until the inertia spring catches and sends it forward. This system replaces systems that other semi-autos use where gas or the initial explosion drive the bolt back. And, since the gases can’t seep through into the chamber there won’t be any carbon-build up.
The Limited also features a Twin Shock Absorber (TSA) recoil pad that deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter’s shoulder. MSRP was $1,699 and you won't find these very easy. Nice collectors shotgun. I'm needing the money so I'm only asking $1,200 for this beauty. Have more pictures available upon request and willing to meet if distance is a problem. Must have valid MS DL to purchase."
