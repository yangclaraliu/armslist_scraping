If for somehow it is worth anything worth writing home about, please be honest and tell me what it is and make an honest offer. These were gifted to my now deceased father YEARS ago and have been scuffed/sanded and left no identifying marks on the receivers or barrels except the middle one (judging by length) and it says ""J.C. Higgins-model 101.1, Sears , Roebuck and Company"". All hammers can be cocked back with healthy spring rate left and are held when cocked, and released when trigger is pulled. All three are break actions and all the levers seem to work, but the only one with a barrel shows how functional it really is. Price is negotiable to someone that can do something with them. Hell maybe I'll learn what they were and it'll give a little meaning to holding them so long after my father went home to see the Lord.

This shotgun is in great condition. It saw some use in the field and minimal range time before sitting in a safe for a while. There are some handling marks on the wood furniture that would be expected but is still good cosmetically and the matte finished steel is all in excellent condition. Most of the wear is from being moved from place to place and not from being shot. The barrel is a super magnum 3.5"" vent rib, bead sight smooth bore with Rem-Choke. It is an Express Magnum 870 that can fire up to 3"" shells and has seen fairly little use. You can put the barrel on a super magnum if you want to shoot those heavy turkey loads but this reciever is only a standard 3"" magnum. This is an excellent shotgun overall and I am only selling it to fund another project. I would prefer cash to go towards that (or .308 Winchester/7.62x51 mm NATO ammo to feed it) but I have made a lengthy list of possible trades (see below). Asking $350 or best offer. I can throw in target load ammo if needed. Better photos are available.If you are interested, please save us both a lot of time and review the below information. Thanks!If you decide to purchase a handgun from me, I will take down your ID and CPL/PP info, I will fill out the pistol transfer forms as is required by law and I will write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. If you decide to buy a long gun from me, I will check your ID and write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. The bill of sale will include identifying information for both parties and there will be a copy for me and a copy for you. This is only done as a measure of protection for both parties. This is something you should welcome in an honest transaction. The registration paperwork and bill of sale on handguns is not negotiable. I don't like the laws any more than the rest of you but I intend to follow them. If you read this and are still interested and have any questions, please let me know.Please, be able to have an intelligent conversation about pricing, values, basic guns and ammo information and item descriptions. I try to list everything of importance in my ads and do not want to have a week long back and forth discussion because you cannot articulate an acceptable explanation of your items or questions about my items. If you refer to magazines as clips, I will assume we are off to a less than desireable start. Sorry if I sound rude, but I have bought and sold a fair amount from Armslist and this is an ongoing issue.If you want to test fire a gun that I am selling, that is perfectly acceptable in most cases. I am happy to meet with you at Family Shooters Corral on a weekend with you as my guest or at a range of your choosing at your own expense.Thank you for looking! Check out my ""Listings by this user"" link to the right of the photo above for a look at all of my listed items! I am always listing new items and may not have something posted yet. What are you looking for? I have a large collection of gear that I am selling but it keeps getting flagged and removed. I can send you the list if you are interested in it."

Configurations include either a black stock with a blued receiver and barrel, a stealth black stock with a phosphatized action and barrel or a green stock with phosphatized action and barrel – all come with a black bolt.   The solid vault-like action is cold hammer-forged from special steel alloy. Integral 17 mm axial scope mounting rails have integral recoil stop-slots on the top of the receiver. The sturdy bolt with three locking lugs feeds rounds flawlessly from the centerline of a detachable staggered 2-row magazine. It has a reliable feed for various ammunition types. The bolt lift is at a 60° angle for fast bolt throw.”Less than 200 rounds total have been fired through this amazingly consistent and extraordinarily accurate rifle. The stock is a green polymer over molded on a rigid aluminum frame that fully floats the barrel and is adjustable to fit nearly any shooter. The trigger is fully user adjustable in every way possible and is one of the best you will ever encounter.  Included with this rifle is the excellent Schmidt Bender 3-12x50PMII/LP scope and once you look through it and manipulate the knobs you will understand why they are regarded as the best optic in the world. The scope has a 34MM main tube and is secured to the rifle with Badger Ordnance 34MM USMC steel rings and both are mounted to a Near manufacturing 20MOA rail. The muzzle end is fitted with the effective Sako brake and the solid steel Sako bipod, this combination allows the shooter to see each impact through the rifle scope. The components chosen for this weapon system have been deployed with various militaries around the world and have a proven track record of performance and reliability in the field.

It features a unique gas-delayed blowback locking system modeled on the Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) .  The advantages of this system are a simpler manufacturing process due to the absence of a locking system and a high mechanical accuracy due to the barrel being fixed in the frame; the barrel does not execute any sort of lateral or vertical movement during the operating cycle as with the Browning cam-action systems common to many other locked breech pistols.This the most accurate 9mm pistol Ive ever shot, once the squeeze mechanism is cocked the trigger is extremely light, combined with the fixed barrel it shoot amazingly dead on.MN Buyer needs MN state ID and Permit.Out of state buyer pays $30 shipping to local FFL."
