I never left powder sitting in the barrel after hunting i would remove it every time.  The only thing that i can pick out is 3 small little dings right next to each other on the action itself. I have included a pic so you can see.  As far as accessories i have installed a DNZ mount with a Nikon BDC 250 scope (which as the drop reticle for 100 or 150gr powder charges and a 250gr sabot). I also have a leupold mount and rings for this muzzle loader and extra TC camouflage thumbhole stock and forearm.  Why am I selling this muzzleloader since i like it so much.....well i just bought a new Remington Ultimate Muzzloader and I don't need two!  I am asking $700 OBO but i would prefer to trade.  I would like to trade for nice optics or a nice rifle.

This GP is a slight step ahead of the rest. It has had a trigger job done on it and the factory hammer and trigger springs have been replaced with Wilson Combat 8# springs. You want a light triggered .357 magnum, then this is the answer. Trigger pull is somewhere around 2.5 to 3 lbs. All remaining springs in the WC spring kit are included as well as the factory springs.
 
It has only been fired 12 times since new and has zero wear anywhere. Not even on the cylinder.

The 3"" barrel is included but would need a gunsmith to properly fit it correctly. 100 rds of PPU target, 88 rds of Winchester HP, 25 rds Hornady Critical Defense HP, and roughly 300 rds of various brand .38 spl. Factory box with all paperwork, test casing, and lock. 1 HKS speedloader and just for shits and giggles 2 original 1980's advertisement signs.
 
This GP is a slight step ahead of the rest. It has had a trigger job done on it and the factory hammer and trigger springs have been replaced with Wilson Combat 8# springs. You want a light triggered .357 magnum, then this is the answer. Trigger pull is somewhere around 2.5 to 3 lbs. All remaining springs in the WC spring kit are included as well as the factory springs.
 
It has only been fired 12 times since new and has zero wear anywhere. Not even on the cylinder.

I used it for a few weeks before deciding to go with a more expensive selectable IWB/OWB version. I found it to be comfortable and very well built but it did not fit my concealment needs as well as I wanted. Maybe it will fit yours just right. It is equipped with the Viridian ECR magnet for automatically turning on/off the Viridian R5 trigger guard laser.
Typical lead time for these holsters is three weeks. Why wait? I will sell you mine and you have it quicker; everybody wins.
