I paid a premium price just to get that particualr Barreled Action, which was blue printed at the Savage factory and not offered in any other of their current rifles! Though this chassis is Really Cool, and I just about talked myself into keeping it, ultimately I decided to stick to my original plan to make a dedicated, heavy, bench gun. My loss is your gain. (?)
If you have a Savage short action with a Stock mounting screw spacing of 4.400"" (just over 4-3/8"") and the bolt release is up between the bolt and ejection port, then your action should work! All aluminum, modular design allows you to costumize the chassis to your needs (see links below). Included forend is a very lightweight surround with M-Lok slots machined in it, for the most flexible mounting of accessories possible! The rearend is Foldable and equiped with an AR Buffer Tube, so you can choose between any Mil-Spec Buttstock available (comes with a Magpul CTR buttstock)! And maybe the Coolest feature of all...you can slide the grip module to get the correct distance for your trigger finger length!!!
 Accepts magazines Compatible with short action AICS (Accuracy International Chassis Systems) pattern bottom metal and cartridges built on a 0.470"" case head such as 7.62x51/.308 Winchester, 7mm-08 Remington, 6.5mm Creedmoor, .260 Remington, .243 Winchester, and others.
I have a brand new, 5 round mag that I would sell with the chassis for an additional $30)

Shoots Short, Long and Long Rifle ammo. Tube fed. The original box is rough, but included. I have owned this rifle for 20+ years and have hardly ever shot it. The wood is 98% the metal is 99%.  It's a great little rifle, and most people regret ever selling the one that they once owned.As for the pundits:Many believe that these rifles are either stainless steel or nickle plated. I was so unsure of what to believe, that I called the Rossi USA customer service number, listed on their website. I gave the rep the serial number, but she explained that this rifle was made sometime in the 1980's and that she had no specific record of it's actual date of manufacture or metal composition. But, She said that Rossi never plated any rifle. They only offered a couple models of pistols, that were nickel plated.I'm not one to believe the blogs, hearsay or expert opinion. To resolve the issue, once and for all, I went to see a metallurgist. He had a machine that analyzes metals and displays the composition.The Gun is actually manufactured from Nickel Iron alloy. NOT Nickel plated. Nickel Alloy is similar to Stainless Steel except that Nickel is used instead of Chromium. But Stainless Steel typically doesn't have nearly as much Chromium in it, as this Nickel Alloy has in Nickel. The barrel analysis is @ 65.4% Nickel and 33.5% Iron. The receiver analysis is @ 57.9% Nickel and 41.6% Iron. The ammo tube analysis is @ 54.1% Nickel and 45.7% Iron. The hammer assembly analysis is @ 97% iron. I have the pictures. It's just that AL only allows three pictures.In summary, it is manufactured to a much higher standard than any of today's weapons. It is Not plated, so there will be no peeling of the finish, and the hammer/trigger assembly parts are very hard and very durable.This gun is heirloom quality.Cash Price is firm. Ridiculous lower offers will be ignored."

You will quickly master getting on target in your Mozambique Drills with this bad boy. This variant of the HK45CT is a DA/SA, decocker with a safety (V1) control lever. This is an outstanding weapon. I also have a new, never worn Galco Concealable OWB holster Model number CON292B: Right Hand: Black ($118). Will sell separately ($1,100 and $100), or as a pair ($1,150).FROM H&K Web Site:The HK45 Compact Tactical builds on the tough, military lineage of the Heckler & Koch HK45 series of handguns to devise the ultimate operator’s pistol. The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HK’s American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the new pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit.  The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10-round magazine with extended floorplate, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences.  The HK45 pistol series were originally developed as candidates for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition so there is little wonder that the HK45 CT is so well-suited for military, law enforcement, and security use. Each HK45 CT comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.  An HK proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces affecting the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.  An “O-ring” barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. And the threaded barrel on the HK45 CT is made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.  The HK45 Compact Tactical uses all HK45 magazines, from 10-rounders to the smaller capacity 8-round magazine. A Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for mounting lights and accessories is molded into the polymer frame of the HK45 Compact Tactical."

Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/haley-strategic-partners-d3crx-chest-rig-multicam-black-d3crx-mcblk/ Description The NEW Disruptive Environments™ Chest Rig X has been redesigned to improve comfort, storage capabilities and work seamlessly with D3CR accessories. The X harness was added for comfort and ultimate adjustability. The addition of 2 Multi-Mission pouches allows the rig to be more streamlined and carry mission essentials where they count. The full field of velcro allows the rig to be outfitted with the latest D3CR accessories as well as assist in the full contact connection with plate carriers. Just like it’s predecessor, it is designed and optimized for work in urban, vehicle, rural and other confined settings. Driven by mission versatility. When used as a stand alone, the platform is low profile enough to be worn fully loaded and not print on a normal/loose fit jacket or sweatshirt. When used on a armor platform with a quick release system, such as SwiftClips™, it can be attached or stowed in seconds, giving the end user the versatility to transition from low vis to high vis or vice versa. The rifle magazine pouches accept AR type magazines as well as AK 7.62 x39mm and 5.45 x 39 magazines. The Multi-Mission Pouches accept 1911, Glock, Sig, M&P, XD and other standard double or single stack pistol magazines, as well as many handheld lights, multi-tools, and 37mm/40mm grenades. The rig intentionally does not include a radio or dedicated full size medical pouch so no matter the posture, essentials such as communications and medical kits can remain on the end user at all times."

908,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7731908,For Sale:  WWII British No. 4 MK 1 Lee Enfield Sniper Rifle with Mk 32 Scope & Crate,"Washburn, Northern WI, Wisconsin","$ 3,500","Listed On: Thursday, January 11, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a very rare firearm that you will not find very often. This rifle was on an auction but did not meet our reserve. Since the auction we havle learned quite a bit about the history of this specific rifle. This is a British Enfield #4 Mk 1 that comes with a Mk 1, 32 scope converted by Holland & Holland. This rifle also comes with wooden shipping container. Now for the history on this specific rifle that we know. We took this rifle in from a local individual that has owned the rifle for many years. He stated that he purchase this at a gun show years ago but was unsure exact year. When he boutght the rifle he stated that the Enfield came as box, rifle, and scope. The owner went and purchased a reproduction metal case for the scope that is included. He also got a few of the tools that the rifle came with however are not original. These include the cleaning rope, T handle, sling, shell extractor, scope adjustment tool, and pouch. Now as for the rifle we looked over the rifle and it appears to be a great find with no rust or pitting and a clean bore. We took lots of pictures and some may not be shown. If there is anything on this rifle you want to see more close up or have questions please feel free to contact us. All sides and top of the box have not been messed with however the bottom of the box was repaired. There are some old shipping labels that are still on the outside of the box and one has a shipping date from the 1950s. Now in the last couple weeks we have gathered some very good information about this rifle from several that are very knowledgeable and familiar with these No 4 MK 1 rifles and MK 32 scopes. What we have been told is that this rifle was more then likely never fitted in 1945 with a this 32 scope and riser combination. This is why the rifle never got a T stamp on the left side of the receiver but did have the S51 and TR stamp. The Mk 32 scope and scope riser are original from the early 1940s and were used in WWII but again they were not originally put on this year rifle in 1945. A 1945 No 4 MK 1 should of had a MK 32 III scope not a MK 32 1. With this being said this is still a great very hard to find WWII collectable. The conclusion that has been made is that this was a No 4 MK 1 that just was never fitted with a scope near the end of WWII. At some point after the war some one put on an original MK 32 scope and base that were from WWII. The numbers were then placed in the stock matching the stock and scope. You can see the numbers in the stock were never altered and this makes since as the rifle had never been fitted with a scope as it would have been done by BSA Shirley. So in short we believe this rifle is a (T less Mk 4 rifle) meaning it was not fitted with a scope while in service. We don't know exactly when the scope was added but believe the scope was added after it's service time. The serial number on this rifle is V38301. The number on the handgrip behind the receiver is 4279S and this match’s the number on the scope of 4279. On the left action strap is the M47C stamp with 1945, England, and below this is the TR Stamp. This has the S51 proof under the rear stock. We tried to take pictures of all the proof marks and stamps we could find but we may have missed one if you are looking for something specific. Again please ask and we can check for you. Here is a description of some of the stamps and proof marks. Stamped on the barrel under the handguard is .303 2.222"" UBNP (British Proof Stamp) Serial number 38301. Stamped on front action right side is UBNP (British Proof). Stamped on bolt handle serial number 38301. Bottom of the action between magazine and swivel is proof mark M47 stamp. Bottom center strap swivel is 5.126. On metal front upper hand guard with Great Britan Proof Mark. Safety Lever is stamped M/47C. The scope mounts are numbered 72 & 73. The peep sight was removed as most were in order to fit the scopes. There is British Stamp forward of the bolt on the chamber. There is a G stamp on the lower rear of the butt stock. The stamp on the bottom of the forend grip is also matching numbers of 38301 with proof marks JC N22 with British Proof. There is an S marked on the right side of the action. The scope mount also has a couple proof marks it has a circled S on the outside and what appears to be a British proof on the inside but we are unsure there is pictures of this. The left side of the receiver does have some markings that are hard to see but it does appear to say ( No. 4 Mk 1) along with what looks like a British proof mark. We tried to take as good of pictures as possible with our lighting. This rifle does come with scope caps. The caps appear to be older and may be the original ones but that is unclear if they were the exact ones that came with the rifle new. The lenses on the scope are undamaged however glass has that blur to it that is often seen with age. This may clean up with some with proper cleaning and care. However we will leave that to the next owner. Overall this is an excellent condition rifle with no cracks in the stock. Shipping is set at $75.00 and extra care will be taken to make sure this is shipped properly. Buyers are welcome to pick this rifle up from us directly as well. We are located in far Northern Wisconsin. Again if you have any questions please ask. If you would like to look at the rifle in person please contact us.
