This is a single shot, bolt action rifle - would be a great choice for training children and new shooters.The Model 67 was produced between 1938 and 1963. Unfortunately, because serial numbers were not mandatory in the US until 1968, I have been unable to date the rifle. From my research, I believe it to be post-1944, and it appears to be identical to models produced around 1950. Because of this, I'm pricing it a little lower than similar listings I've found.The gun has the expected finish wear and nics in the stock, but is completely functional and has not been abused.

Front sight is rough but it is usable. The fact this gun is in the original caliber of 8x50r and doesn't have Import marks makes it rare. all of these guns were re chambered in 8x56. This is a 700 dollar rifle with the correct stock on it. Reference gun broker for example. The only one on there is currently listed at 789 by a collector. Email or text for pictures. REDACTED

This model was made in the early 1930's and used thru WW2 to train Mid and High School Youth in the Basic shooting skills. This early training was to ensure students were to be ready to be inducted into the NAZI military. These rifles were issued all over pre-war Germany to schools and various Target Shooting Clubs. Just another way to get around the WW1 Surrender terms. These high quality rifles made by many contractors such as this one by ERMA. This Rifle is an extremely very rare rifle as not only does it have ALL MATCHING NUMBERS of Barrel, Action and of all things, even the original BOLT matches TOO! Even with the forend of the stock cut off at the front band this is a very hard to find rifle. this last was probably done when issued to the elderly or the Hitler youth in the closing days of the war. This is an extremely accurate rifle and could be an excellent choice as a youth training rifle with a possible shot to getting a rabbit or squirrel for the Pot. The starting price on this is low as it has been in my closet for a long time and my son has acquired his own collection. I highly recommend westernunion but will also accept payment by USPS Money Order, and cash deposit with shipment. I a dealer and as a collector no returns or refunds will be accepted. Only exception, if I have misidentified the items manufacture or contract country. No ""Wife changed my mind for me"" problems. shipping for this rifle as it is a lightweight will be $35. paid with the purchase amount. This rifle is C&R eligible so either a current C&R FFL or a Dealer FFL will suffice."

This is chambered for the Swiss GP-90 which is 7.5X53.5 and the brass is easily trimmed from the 7.5X55 Swiss. This is one of less than 7000 total produced. Nearly 3500 made by SIG-Neuhausen in 1895, the remainder by Waffenfabrik Bern. Which also attributes to it's rarity. Very few remain as they were well used by the Cavalry they were issued to. This beautiful rifle does not show much evidence of more than very little carry wear and almost no firing as the bolt head has only a very faint primer ring. Every Serial Number on this Rare Carbine matches even the inside of the stock. Shows beautifully grained and tiger-striped wood the length of the stock. Well over 85% original bluing with small areas of bluing worn at receiver bridge, sides of both bands and bottom of trigger guard. There are no metal surfaces heavily marred or scratched. The dark area in picture # 4 is just a shadow, not a stain. This Rifle is most probably one of the 25 nicest of the small number in the US. This is an ANTIQUE and may be transferred without a FFL. I will still need a scan copy of buyer's State Driver's License and a Statement the buyer is fully eligible to legally receive and possess a firearm. Shipping is $50. UPS Ground inc. insurance and Adult Signature Required. This little carbine will be the ULTIMATE of a SWISS RIFLES COLLECTION. PLUS, using the correct ammo this can be a wonderful shooter to go with a SWISS firearms collection. This is an antique and as such I do not accept returns. Only exception is if I grossly misrepresent the items Manufacture or Basic Production Model. For payment I recommend WESTERNUNION and MONEYGRAM and I also accept; USPS Money Orders and Bank wire transfers."

I simply use my thumb to pull the hammer a pinch further back. It then goes back into Single Action and it works great. If you know anything about fixing pistols, you can probably fix it. I don't.Once you pull back the hammer for the first shot, it continues perfectly in Single Action until all bullets are fired. Never jams. So, I'm lowering the price to $200. It's still a good Single action 9mm. Much better power and accuracy than any 380.Firm on price, so don't bother lowballing. I won't respond.It's still a great shooter for the range and home defense."

The only thing I would consider trading for is a nice AR-15 and I’m not putting money on top so if it’s worth way more please don’t waste both of our time. This gun is in showroom condition. If you’re looking for a beautiful Glock 43 you don’t have to do anything to, this is the one. The trigger is perfect I assure you, this gun will be an added Gem to your collection.?Serious inquires only. Price is firm considering condition and what I have invested. Stock Glock 43’s go for more and aren’t easy to find. It's Christmas time and as my kid gets older it seems the prices of the things go up as well. Happy Child or The Glock 43 I love? Hate to make the choice but it's an easy one. Happy Child. So thank you for looking I can meet within reason. If this is still posted its still available."
