The thread protector has been cut off and I just have a standard ak47 style muzzle break. I planned on mounting a dragunov style flash hider eventually. I had ordered a dragunov style stock from Ironwoods Designs that's unfinished. Sadly I broke the stock in the grip area but its with the grain, hardly noticeable. It just needs to have a pin ran through the grip and it'll hold fine and be finished up. I mounted on a picatinny rail that's 2 parts, the AK303-M lower with the upper part with the larger picatinny rail available. The scope mounted is a vortex viper 4-16x50. Great scope. Don't plan on parting with it but I will for the right price. Any questions just ask, I'm open to trades depending on what it is. I don't NEED to get rid of the rifle but I have other wants. So please no low ball offers. The rifle is no longer being imported so these will start to dry up. Ill be honest, I've got a little more than 2000 in the rifle with the stock from Ironwoods Designs and scope so that's what id like in at least trade value. I'm interested in HKs, really wanting a Steyr L9-a1 or M9-a1 also an Aug just a heads up for interests in trades."

The Grendel was the predecessor to Keltec and owned by the same person. This unique 380 used an internal magazine that held an impressive 10 rounds in a very compact design. Loading could be done using a stripper clip or rounds could be loaded individually from the top through a locked back slide. No safety on this model, just a long double action pull. This was meant to market to police officers who were used to carrying revolvers and accustomed to loading rounds individually and a double action, hammer fired weapon. Unfortunately it came out at a time when police where making the switch over to semi autos. So this design was very short lived and very few ever made. This one comes in good condition and appears to function as it should. Bore and internals look to be in good shape. I have never fired or even loaded this gun. So, I cannot comment on how it shoots. I have no idea how many rounds have been fired through it before I acquired it. It does not come with anything but the pistol itself. No box or factory paperwork. It is what it is, just a cool, old, cheap, unique gun. Looking to get $150 cash. All laws apply. Foid, ISP check and wait period required. Pick up in St Charles or near by. Thanks and Merry Christmas!"

A standard example that is in good condition despite apparent holster wear, this 1908 features a 3.5"" barrel, vulcanite grips, and external hammer. Adopted by the London Metropolitan Police in 1908, the M1908 is familiar to American collectors as the H&R Self-Loading Pistol, which was a licensed, hammerless copy of the British Webley. Although never officially adopted by the military, the M1908 was a popular officer's private purchase weapon, and saw favor with plainclothes cops as well as anyone in need of a discreet means of self-defense. In fine operating condition, this Webley M1908 may prove to be a fine shooter for the vintage pistol enthusiast and a worthy addition to any early 20th Century or British arms collection.ConditionGood, all-original condition, the finish has largely faded to a blue-tinged grey patina, with flashes or the originally dark, high-polish blue visible in the protected areas. There is no rust or deep pitting present on any of the pistol's exterior and only mild and occassional impact marks in places. Markings are well-struck, correct and include all Birmingham Proof House marks on the barrel, slide and frame, as well as the Webley address and brilliantly preserved Winged Bullet logo(pictured). Importantly, neither import nor export mark are present. Grips rate as good with wear to the checkering, a scrape on the left grip and a nick out of the point of contact with the safety lever. Mechanical function is excellent, and the bore rates as very good, having strong rifling with light frost running the length-it should clean nicely.December Shipping Blackout Dates: 12/11-12/15 & 12/25-12/29.Contact:For More Info Interested buyers should contactText Number: +1678-718-8067"

It has an ambidextrous safety, fixed sights, and a rainbow titanium nitride finish on the controlsMaple Grip Blued To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the CZ 75, CZUB set their master engraver, Rene Ondra, to the task of creating a special pistol for the occasion. Each pistol is hand-engraved in the Czech Republic in true old-world style, with a hammer pushing the engraver's tool through each minute detail of the art decorating the slide and frame, which are then polished and finished in a deep, glossy blue. The controls, extractor, grip screws and magazine baseplate are finished in a rainbow tritium nitride, an attractive and extremely tough finish. This is the same type of finish applied to drill bits to extend their working life up to three times.SPECIFICATIONS: - Condition: New In Box- Manufacturer: CZ- Item Number: 91144- Action: Double - Caliber: 9mm- Capacity: 16+1- Barrel Length: 4.6""- Safety: Ambidextrous - Grips: Maple- Sights: Fixed- Frame Finish: Blued New!!
