 AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish"

 30 rounds custom load .223 yellow tip starburst incendiary ammunition. $105
 This ammo is a yellow tip Incendiary ammo that will explode with a bright white flash and emit a shower of titanium sparks upon impact. This ammo will burn a little hotter and give you more sparks and fragments, than regular incendiary ammo, due to the added Sponge Titanium in the Incendiary mixture in this ammo. It is vis...ible day or night upon impact. It will burn at 4000 degrees when it hits a hard target. This is some extremely fun ammo to shoot and has a devastating impact. Use extreme caution when shooting this ammo, it will start fires when it explodes around flamable objects.
 STARBURST AMMUNITION IS BASICALLY AN INCENDIARY ROUND LOADED WITH TITANIUM FLAKES. UPON STRIKING A RELATIVELY SOLID OBJECT, A FLASH IS PRODUCED ALONG WITH A SHOWER OF SPARKS IN A 6-8 FOOT DIAMETER AREA. THIS ROUND CAN SERVE AS A SPOTTER ROUND, MUCH LIKE THE INCENDIARY TYPE AMMUNITION. AMMUNITION IS NON-CORROSIVE AND MEETS SAAMI SPECIFICATIONS. CAUTION MUST BE EXERCISED WHEN FIRING THESE ROUNDS TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL BRUSH FIRES. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THEY BE USED AT AN APPROVED FIRING RANGE.

This item has been with my family for approximately 20 years and fired minimally during this time. This item has never seen holster time and is in new condition.

Originally, this firearm was in a satin nickel finish, however in the mid-2000's the firearm was shipped to W. E. Birdsong in Mississippi and personally coated by the late Mr. Birdsong himself in his trademark Black-T protective finish. This coating is impressive and I have been beyond happy with the product.

The original wood scales have been replaced with a more comfortable Hogue grip with finger-grooves. I will also provide the original wood scales with the gun; however, I personally don't think they look quite right with the Black-T finish. They are yours to do as you wish though.

Along with the pistol itself, two original magazines are included with the sale. Those too have been coated by the aforementioned Birdsong Black-T polymer coating.

There are quite a few Colt 1911's out for sale right now, but I assure you that few are in this pristine of condition and NONE have a superb finish like this one! I can guarantee this.

Very nice and extremely accurate Remington 700 in .223.  Choate Ultimate Sniper stock, Timney trigger (no need to worry about the Remington safety recalls!), Nikon Monarch 5-20x44 SF on a rock-solid 1-piece mount, bipod (not a Harris but all steel & works well), sling.

Barrel is turned down and threaded 1/2-28.  Can't see it in the pics because the thread protector is installed.  Barrel was indicated off the lands when threaded and re-crowned - job was done RIGHT and no fears running a tight bore suppressor on this rifle.  Barrel is finished in Armor Black Cerakote.

Trigger is set at 3lbs and has a wide, flat face.  It is adjustable from 1.5 - 4 lbs.

I have well over $1500 (almost $1600) in this rifle and am only selling because I need funds for another project.  Not interested in any trades.  I do need to sell fairly quickly to raise funds for something else, but it's not to pay my mortgage or put food on the table so I won't entertain any lowball offers - price is firm and a lot less than what's in the gun.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with the rifle.  A few small signs of use (I shoot my guns, they're not safe queens) but overall 99% cosmetically.  Shoots 1/2"" @ 100 yds all day long with 55gr VMax loads and I'm probably the limiting factor."

In both function and performance, 9mm 85 grain DRT ammo will function in all 9mm weapons reliably and is the staple of the DRT line of projectiles and ammunition. Very light felt recoil and standard pressures allow the shooter to have faster follow up shots as well as better accuracy. You simply don't need heavier bullets to inflict catastrophic damage to the target when 100% of the energy is absorbed by that target. In tests, the DRT 85 grain 9mm bullet penetrates semi-hard barriers like sheetrock, plywood, car doors, bone and most glass, then still performing well passing through clothing and into the gelatin test block. Utilizing a Hollow Point Flat Based (HPFB) design, the bullet is engineered to delay its expansion 1-2 inches before the jacket begins to peel back exposing the core. Penetration is 11-12” in ballistic gelatin with a wound cavity is typically 3” in diameter with complete fragmentation of the core."

Love these guns. I have two.  I'm looking to get a P-09 to leave home. 

The one I'm selling has less than 100 rounds through it, more like 50. Cleaned and lubed and ready for a new owner. No scratches. These guns really are great. I sold my XD and my Sig 2022 after I got this gun. It's personal opinion, but neither came close in ergonomics, trigger feel, etc. 

It is a 40 with one 12 round magazine and the case it came in. 

I would ask for valid DL and receipt.

It has a thick, solid Milled receiver with a USA flag stamped into it. This is a high quality weapon, much different that what CIA usually builds. 

It comes in original box, 2 30 round tapco mags, and I added the Sig Style brace which makes it 100% legal like an SBR without a tax stamp. It is also fully legal to fire this from the shoulder, the feds have released a clarification regarding the use of pistol arm braces. 

The weapon has the shortest barrel length of non custom AK pistols, there is the draco which is full size ak with short barrel, then the mini draco, and now this Micro ak. The hand grip is solid wood and very comfortable while providing heat shielding for safe handling, the original micro dracos did not have this and you could burn your hand. It has an integrated sight rail for optics and has built in red fiber optics for the rear sight. it also features a removable flash hider unlike the yugo pap pistols.

It comes with the brace, or you can remove it and use the rear sling mount. 

This is a really nice weapon system, full AK47 build, no custom rods or spring system to muck it up, straight AK action inside. Terrific home defense or CQB weapon. it is very compact.

The craftsmanship is worthy of made in the USA designation, you must see it to appreciate it. These sold out quickly. 

Please text me at REDACTED if interested in buying it. Price is FIRM.

At first glance you would think that the Colt 901 is just a .308 Win./7.62 NATO version of a standard AR-15, much like any other .308 AR out there, but it is a lot more than that. The Colt LE901-16S is a “Modular Carbine,” which means it can be adapted to any AR-15 platform upper. This isn’t a new concept, because there are of course a whole bunch of different caliber uppers for ARs. The difference is in all the other ones, they have adapted a standard size AR magazine to boutique calibers and cartridge designs. The Colt 901 is different. It can be adapted from .308/7.62, using standard P-Mags, to .223/5.56, using standard AR mags, and back again, in literally seconds. The design uses one proprietary part, and you have to swap out the recoil system. It is that simple, and it works fantastic."

Welcome to our Ladies Only Concealed Carry Handgun Certification Class!! My wife Kim and I will host it at our normal location at the Moore County Wildlife Conservation Club at 1820 Camp Easter Rd, in Carthage. 

We do our best to create an environment where everyone feels safe and everyone feels comfortable taking this class. It is important to know that I teach this class to the lowest common denominator. Most classes, the majority of the people have never fired a weapon or have very little experience. That is great. We will teach the class so that you are very comfortable if that is the case, so do not feel pressure that you need to have experience or knowledge coming into the class.

My goals in the class are simple:

•	For the class to be very safe and free from any injury
•	For you to learn something you didn't know, regardless of your skill level
•	For everyone to be treated with respect
•	For you to get your certification of completion so you can exercise your 2nd Amendment rights and be better protected wherever you go
Here is my list of needs and items that need your attention:

•	The class will start at 8:00am sharp with 100% attendance required. I ask that you arrive at 7:45-7:50 a.m. so we start on time.
•	You will need the following items for the class:

•	MANDATORY
o	gun (if semi-auto, please have at least two magazines; if revolver, please have at least one speed loaders)
	If you do not have gun, ammo, hearing and eye protection, we can provide them
o	50 rounds of ammunition
o	Holster
o	eye and ear protection
o	billed cap
•	RECOMMENDED
o	long pants 
o	bug spray 
o	sunscreen 
•	Other Facts
o	We will provide training, targets, and teaching
o	We will be providing lunch, so we can have a working lunch, as well as we will provide water for the range. If you want something other than water, you should bring it. You are welcome to keep it in our cooler. 
o	The class is $85, which includes the above lunch and drinks. Gun/ammo/eye and ear protection is extra.
o	Payment is due 8 days before the class.  We accept paypal/check/cash/visa.
o	The class is scheduled from 8am-6pm. Be prepared to stay that long, though we may get out a bit early
o	Attendance: YOU ARE REQUIRED to confirm with us if you are going to be there.  So, please email my below email and let me know for sure if you are going to be in the class. 
	OR if you have signed up, but you are not going to attend, we need to know that as well. Your slot may be able to be filled by another.
	If you have paid and you can refill your slot, we will give you a refund. If you don’t show up, it is non-refundable. If we are full and you give us notice of cancellation, but we can refill it, we will give you a refund.
•	Rules – Safety and Respect – if you don’t have either of these two requirements, you will be ejected from the class. We have fun in my classes in a safe and respectful way.

If you have any questions or needs that are specific to you, please let us know as soon as possible. We will do our best to answer your questions or help with whatever need(s) you have. Please do not be afraid to ask questions or raise concerns. We are going to be handling and firing handguns. That is really fun if done safely. However, if there is any issue, whether it is a physical impediment or anxiety issue that you have, we need to know that. Please know that anxiety from someone who has little or no experience with weapons is very normal and we appreciate knowing as we can help you with that.  We will assist you any way we can, including more individual attention if needed, for your safety and success.

Guys, thank you all so much! We look forward to seeing you all out there for a safe and fun day! 

Thank you!

The P229® was the first pistol to be manufactured in Exeter, New Hampshire.The P229 is one of the most popular SIG SAUER® pistols and carried by thousands of law enforcement professionals throughout the country. The compact size of the P229 makes it ideal for concealed carry. Not only is it non-railed like the traditional P229s, but it also has the classic P229 slide with the half-height rear cocking serrations. These are hard to come by NIB for under $900.

This gun comes NIB with the original ergo grip not installed. It currently sells on eBay alone for up to $75. I added the Sig panels with $13 stainless hex button head screws from TJ's Custom Gunworks. The older style panels fit my hand better. Sig ergo grip tool, Sig owners manual, and cable lock come with the sale. Also included are two new Sig branded factory 12 rnd. mags. This is a great configuration if you don't require all the tacticool features of a TacPac or railed model. Not alot of these non railed, classic slide models floating around NIB. Checked Buds.com and several local dealers prior to this listing so I'm aware of whats out there currently. Dealers who are few and far have theses listed for $949+ No trades, and cash gets the deal done! Buyer will need to meet me at a local FFL (of their choice) for the transfer. Buyer is also responsible for his/her own state background fee and any other associated transfer fees.
