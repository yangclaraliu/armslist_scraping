The barrel profile is a special lighter weight with a .750 gas block and lightened between the muzzle and the front sight base. The upper comes standard with mid-length handguards and a taper-pinned F-marked front sight base.Upper: 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a milspec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.Each upper is assembled from US-made parts, to order, with care, and test fired.Info from BCM:Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM®) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired.As a note: BCM® barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM™ upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures.M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top ReceiverIn developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.T-Marked Upper ReceiverThe contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.USGI 1/7 Twist RateThe USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel SteelBCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.Chrome Bore and ChamberOne of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a worldwide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.Manganese Phosphate Barrel FinishBarrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.5.56 NATO ChambersThe USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight BasesMil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.Government Barrel ProfilesDuty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.HPT / MP Inspected BarrelsMilitary specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

The truth is that I don't have the time or land for hunting, and it's not exactly useful for target shooting or defense. I'm looking for cash, but I would consider a trade for a traditional muzzleloader of approximate equal value. The Bergara barrel is amazingly accurate, and the gun is magnum capable (150 gr). Included is the BH209 breechplug I ordered a while back. I still have all the original paperwork, including the owners manuals and warranty information. For those not familiar with this platform, it is a break action. To load, you break the action to insert the 209 primer. It still must be loaded from the muzzle."

She was one of my first handguns and we’ve treated each other very well. We taught friends to shoot and survived Mas Ayoob’s MAG40 together. She never let me down.In three years, this G17 has never jammed and refuses to show wear. This is likely because I babied the thing: I never shot it dry, gave a detail cleaning after every trip, and always used an extra-power G22 recoil spring to tame light range ammo even more. Factory-fresh Trijicon HDs were professionally installed in late 2015 to the tune of $150.00. By GLOCK standards, she's a safe queen.I love this pistol, but I need to love people more. I’m staring down a mortgage right now. My hobby is keeping me from friends and family. I’d rather add value to your life.My only problems with this gun are preferential. I’m one of the few people who doesn’t adore Trijicon HDs because I’m used to CAP sights. My family prefers the smaller G19 grip even though I think they carry and shoot the same. However, if I could only have one GLOCK, the 1911-commander-sized G17 is probably the most capable.I’m selling this at a loss. If I can bless your home and mine, count me a happy man.$20 FFL TRANSFER REQIRED: This is non-negotiable.

The lower is a Seekins Precision milled receiver with ambidextrous bolt release, and a Noveske 60 degree short throw selector. The trigger is an unbelievable Geissele SD-3G trigger which has a flat bow and weighs in at approximately a 3.5 pound trigger pull! A Magpul UBR stock and pistol grip complete the furniture on the lower and ensure a stable, repeatable cheekweld for positioning behind the optic when magnified.
If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. I can't justify keeping this one around anymore just to leave it sitting in the safe, so help me give it the home that it deserves.

The only way a round can fire is if the shooter pulls the trigger because its internal design won’t allow the firing pin to punch forward any other way. This prevents accidental discharges if the pistol is dropped. High muzzle velocity and energy, all packed in an easy-handling subcompact .357 pistol: the GLOCK 33 opens up new possibilities in concealed carry. This proven GLOCK design is comfortably worn concealed, and nine highly effective rounds are available for use in the standard magazine. As a backup weapon with superior ballistic performance, the ""Pocket Rocket"" is second to none."

Gun has all proper markings, has the colt on the left side, and the left side of barrel has cobra and all other markings you would expect on this gun.  This gun is the ultimate CCW gun or for personal protection, it's very light weight.  Barrel, cylinder, trigger, hammer and internal parts are all steel.  In my opinion this is a fine example of Colts craftsmanship, nothing else surpasses it.  I can email more pictures if requested.  Gun looks better than it does in the pictures because the camera I'm using is very old.Local cash only sale, I won't mail it. My price is firm.  Please no history lessons and no low balling, serious inquiries only.  Possible trade for  Brand name only 1911 45,  Beretta 92 9mm, etc.  Maybe an even or partial trade and cash?  I would prefer cash.Thank you."

Millennials who have never seriously shot service revolver may have a hard time appreciating the single best training tool on the planet.There was a day when good men relied on six shots of 38 beneath ten pounds of pressure to face the evil in our midst. Men like Jim Cirillo of the NYPD stakeout squad, police chiefs who interrupted quals with a j-frame and a perfect score, generation after generation of American LEOs. These men and women relied on many classic firearms, but at the end of the day, they were well-armed facing the gravest extreme with grit, determination, and a bobbed S&W.I love wondernines, but shooting a PPQ well is little more testament to your skill with a gun than your hour-count mouse-clicking through Call of Duty. There is no harder skill to master than a double-action revolver pull, but no easier gun to practice with than a DAO service revolver. Every time I've taken serious auto shooters to the range, they leave surprised at how much their skills improved with their pistol after their first deliberately-shot box of .38. I taught myself how to shoot quite well with this revolver and a lot of hard work. Sadly, my days in this hobby are numbered and I'm scared to death of a looming mortgage. I have great memories of this piece, but right now, its just stuff. I'd be really happy to see this piece in a new home coaching the next Good Guy (or Gal!!!). I'd really appreciate your helping me start the next chapter of my life.My Smith has excellent lockwork and rifling but cosmetic wear. Its a shooter and I'm not interested in selling if you won't use her! That said, she's in pretty good shape. Please evaluate the pics? Nicer grips and speedloaders available extra. :)$20 FFL TRANSFER REQIRED: This is non-negotiable. I'd like to meet at Arnzen Arms of Eden Prairie, a well-lit store full of delightful, outgoing, heavily-armed professionals.

The Vickers Glocks have the discontinued RTF2 grip texture which is really nice. The gun will come with 2 mags, box, papers, etc. Unfortunately, I do not have the extra TangoDown parts that normally come with the Vickers models- However, these parts are available from Brownells as a package for 55 bucks (extended slide release, mag release, floor plates). This gun is very clean and has very few rounds through it. Price is 500 firm and I'm not really looking for trades (I'm selling to fund a new suppressor). I'm located in St Petersburg. For fastest response or for more pics, TEXT me at REDACTED."

I'm the original purchaser and have put 200 rounds through this in one range session (100 suppressed and 100 not suppressed) this past August. This is a beauty and it has all the upgrades that really make it special. It comes with all the original packaging, paperwork, and accessories including the 3 original unused 17 round magazines with the fde basepads. It also comes with the 2 original sets of grips as well as a set of the black Vertec plastic grips. It also has a Wilson Combat fluted steel guide rod and Beretta Elite II Skeletonized hammer inside, and wears a really nice set of Wilson Combat G2 black grips with the gold medallions in it. I will also include the original parts that were removed for these upgrades. Finally, the most important upgrade of them all, the entire slide and barrel assembly (including all internal parts, decocker assembly and the Wilson Combat guide rod were sent off to WMD Guns to be Melonited. This is a much more durable and in my humble opinion, more attractive finish than the weak finish put on by the factory. I was going to have the frame anodized black, but thought it was a nice unique look and would still allow you to return it to original factory condition as easily as ordering a new slide from Brownells. The pictures do not do it justice, the dark earth frame is much more subtle and almost an olive drab look when not in my bright workshop. It's a beautiful handgun and I already regret selling it. I have over 40 pictures of this handgun for you to scrutinize over including all the angles and pictures of it stripped down. Email me if you want more pictures. I have over $1400 into this and am willing to let it go for $1200, no trades.Can meet for transfer at a gunshop (buyer pays transfer). NO SHIPPING, to many scammers and bots out there (you can all go f*ck yourselves). Let me know if you have any questions. CASH ONLY for local transfer."
