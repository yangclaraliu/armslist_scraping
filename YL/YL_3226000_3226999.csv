The Ruger GP-100 revolver was first introduced in 1985 as a 2nd-generation of the Ruger Double Action revolvers, with intent to replace successful Ruger Security / Service / Speed Six line of revolvers. The GP-100 was a serious improvement over previous Ruger guns. It was made even stronger, with intent to fire an unlimited number of full-power .357 Magnum rounds, and was produced in many variations, with three basic barrel lengths (3"" / 76 mm, 4"" / 102 mm or 6"" / 152 mm), various barrel profiles, with fixed or adjustable sights etc. GP-100 revolvers also are offered in two finish/material variations - blued carbon steel or polished stainless steel. Like most other Ruger guns, GP-100 revolvers are exceptionally strong, reliable and durable, and are great self-defense, security or practice weapons.
The Ruger GP-100 revolvers are double-action guns with exposed hammers and swing-out cylinders."

 First up is my custom American Classic Commander. As the name implies its a commander size 1911. It has a trigger job and full length guide rod. It's been refinished in teflon gun kote OD green slide, grip safety, and main spring housing. The frame is matte black. It's got houge grip pannels with a pearce rubber finger grip. This gun shoots great and has one of the best triggers you''ll ever feel on a 1911.  $600 cash and will want a little more in trade value. I also have ammo available but it will not be free. If you want a hand out email Obama, your not getting it from me.

 Next is my stainless Taurus Circuit Judge. This is a discontinued Taurus not a Rossi. Shows some handling wear but nothing severe.  Shoots great and includes the factory extras, no box or papers though. Not much else to say. It's an off the shelf gun. It is the common 45 colt and 410 shot shell chambering. $500 cash more in trade."

OK let's analyze this post .
It's rare because I say it's rare - Spikes made tons of uppers in 5.45. They recently stopped because of the importation ban on most of the popular 5.45 ammo. This 5.45 ammo is no longer cheap .
This build has a ""modified mag "" mag has been modified to use ammo - this makes it rare too !! It's a customized mag which I know I would trust a whole bunch. 

However - let's price this build 
Upper - was sold complete at AIM as per his description for $600
Lower $89
LPK.    $70 note this is a Tactical standard parts kit ...LOL
STOCK - $80 for a fab defense stock 
Buffer tube kit - $60.
Mag - ?? I ""customized mag"" I wonder of this has a lifetime ""warantee""

The prices listed are on the very high side , I bet you could have shopped around and trimmed build cost by at least a $100-200. But hey I know I want a bubba built custom special for $1400 

Fact - due to ban on importation of the ammo , companies like spikes have stopped making 5.45 uppers due to lack of consumer demand."

The Ruger GP-100 revolver was first introduced in 1985 as a 2nd-generation of the Ruger Double Action revolvers, with intent to replace successful Ruger Security / Service / Speed Six line of revolvers. The GP-100 was a serious improvement over previous Ruger guns. It was made even stronger, with intent to fire an unlimited number of full-power .357 Magnum rounds, and was produced in many variations, with three basic barrel lengths (3"" / 76 mm, 4"" / 102 mm or 6"" / 152 mm), various barrel profiles, with fixed or adjustable sights etc. GP-100 revolvers also are offered in two finish/material variations - blued carbon steel or polished stainless steel. Like most other Ruger guns, GP-100 revolvers are exceptionally strong, reliable and durable, and are great self-defense, security or practice weapons.
The Ruger GP-100 revolvers are double-action guns with exposed hammers and swing-out cylinders"

The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy."

This transaction will take place at Gander Mountain in Thornton - $20 total for both transfer and background fees paid by buyer.

******If this ad is still on Armslist, the pistol is still available for sale.******

It is the perfect size for pocket or purse and it is user friendly for a man or a woman's hand. Excellent pistol for a women. 

Rather than use the slide extractor which would discard the empty casing in the barrel, the gun could discard last spent casings strait up with the barrel tip lever, it can also be checked for a live cartage in the barrel for safety before use.

I have had this pistol for 3 years and had only used it a four times at the range, ran twelve magazines though it without any issues, it is accurate, fun, economical and lethal when need.

The one rest that does it all. 

The highly versatile Matrix combines great new features and rock solid stability in an affordable rest. Central tot eh design is the innovative, ultra rigid U-channel frame, quickly adjusting in length for the perfect fit with any gun while remaining perfectly stable.

The two piece sliding frame incorporates an open central channel with plenty of clearance for hi-capacity detachable magazines (AR style guns) as well as lever action guns. A convenient storage area incorporated into the front of the base features a removable lid that adds additional clearance when detached but also doubles as a rubberized rear support surface for firing handguns when left in place. 

Another key feature is the all new innovative front elevation system. A spring loaded tension mechanism and height adjustment knob allow for fast, one handed elevation adjustments, keeping the front cradle wobble free throughout the entire vertical range. Overmolded front and rear supports protect the guns finish but are firm enough to prevent any give or play. Shooters will also enjoy the versatility of converting the Matrix into a compact front rest be removing the rear portion of the frame. Weather used as a front rest or as a full length rest the Matrix provides stability that will deliver maximum accuracy potential.

480,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3226480,For Sale:  POF / Hogan .308,"Columbia, Columbia, South Carolina","$ 2,600","Listed On: Saturday, July 19, 2014",Rifles,no type,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Hey all, I'm getting out of .308, as I'm not reloading, and ammo is hella expensive compared to .223, which is what I'm into more.

I have here a complete optics ready Hogan (Same as POF, used to be the same company) H308.  Gas Piston powered rifle with 16 inch barrel, full rail, 4.5 pound in house trigger with KNS pins.  More information can be found here: 

http://www.hoganguns.com

Breakdown of prices:
Rife - MSRP $2600.00 - new
12 PMAGS - $20.00 new
Magpul CTR with Larue RISR - $135.00 new
Magpul BUIS - $80.00 new
AAC Brakeout - $80.00 new
Slashes heavy buffer designed for gas piston rifles - $145.00 new

Also included
8 magazines worth (160 rounds) Federal Gold Medal Match 168 Grain - $224.00
2 magazines worth (40 rounds) Hornady Amax 168 Grain - $60.00
Additional pistons (2) to tune the rifle to the load you are shooting, similar to having an adjustable gas block on a DI rifle.

So as you can see, this is truly optics ready.  I've included a picture of my last 5 round string at 100m, and called the flyer that can be seen.  Without that one flyer, this is shooting at, or just under 1 MOA.  It is also worth mentioning this was shot in rubber mulch, on a bipod with a sand sock under the rear stock, not in a cradle or sled.

I have put only federal gold medal match 168 and 175 grain, and hornady steel case 155 grain match ammo through this rifle


Round count is at 540 rounds down range.

Not including the ammunition, the total cost was ~$3280.00, I'm asking $2600.00 for everything minus the ammunition, including the ammo will bring you up to $2850.00

There are a few dings on the rifle from use,  so I've chosen what I consider to be a fair price for the rifle, I doubt I'll be lowering it much, but I will entertain reasonable offers.

I'm looking for 5.56 rifles, ammo and such plus cash or additional firearms to meet close to the asking price.  Will reduce overall cost by a few hundred for trades provided the trade offers are good.  I'm really interested in the following:

IWI Tavor (FDE preferred, but black can work too)
Bushmaster ACR (again FDE preferred)
PWS 5.56 rifles
Any others you might have please let me know

Also interested in
FNX Tactical 45 (FDE)

Please don't bother emailing me asking if I'll take a price, and when I reply with either a midway price, or in one case lower the price by removing certain upgrades to meet your price, not reply to my return email, that's messed up, quite frankly.  Don't bother emailing me a price if you don't have the money to back it up, window shop elsewhere on the internet, not here.

Thanks for your time"

Springfield Armory M1 Garand 30-06 plus ammo Up for sale is this Korean War Era M1 Garand with nearly new Boyd's stock set. Stock set has all new metal except for the butt plate. Has a few dings and some scratches on the right side of the butt stock. There is also one scratch. This gun was inspected nuzzle to butt stock, and then some, by a former CMP armorer with intimate knowledge of these Garands . All parts were checked out to specs and all that was replaced was the Op-Rod Spring and follower/slide assembly.

Shoots great  least out to 100 yards on his personal range with everything grouping nicely on official CMP Targets http://www . midwayusa .com/product/792024/ nra -official-high-power-rifle-target- sr -1-100-yard-slow-and-rapid-fire-paper-package-of-10 0 

Since I took it out of the wood, you'll have to take it out and re-sight it to get it broken in and restore some of the accuracy lost. Speaking of sights, I've had aftermarket National Match sights installed to include the special ring that goes between the sight base grooves and the elevation knob. This allows more minute clicks when adjusting the elevation. The front sight came with a cross hairs so I figure what the hell and put those in as well. There is also a National Match Op-Rod made by Remington Arms under contract with the original Springfield Armory back in the late 50s to early 60s. There is no rust on this gun and the  Dec 1953 barrel's bore is bright and shiny with no pitting. Muzzle wear gages at less than 2 and throat erosion at less than 2 as well. Basically it's a brand new barrel which is great for accuracy.

I'm also including 48 rounds of HXP Greek surplus 30-06 on Enbloc clips in a vintage bandoleer. If you have any questions, please email me.

Maybe a nice AR upper in 556/223 with a 10.5"" bbl or in 9mm with a 5.5"" bbl.  Can add or receive cash as needed.

Scope is not included at the $750 price, but can be purchased seperately if wanted. Decent bushnell trophy. Not a Leupold, but does the trick. I can round up some 223 shells cheap for the buyer if wanted.

The gun is very accurate and once you get it ""tuned"" in to the load you are shooting, it is surprisingly accurate. Beautiful gun, gets compliments everytime I've taken it anywhere. Less than 200 rounds and it shows. Stated in manual and on net by Ruger, only meant to fire .223's.

Would consider trades for: rifle calibered in 218 Bee, 222, or 225; and Browning BAR (willing to pay extra), maybe a really nice Ruger .204 scoped.

So there is no confusion, there are two prices for the rifle (One with the red dot $420 and one without $350). The rifle is in excellent condition and only has one spot where the finish has been scratched. It is on the magazine release lever where my thumb nail has scratched it over the years. I built this rifle a few years ago for three gun competition training and it holds very similar to an AR15. It has had numerous upgrades in the trigger system, barrel, sights and furniture that I will list below. I am not asking new gun and accessories prices for this rifle but am going to list the original prices that I paid so you can see what you are buying.

Even though the condition of the rifle is excellent and shoots flawlessly, it has been used. If you want all of the accessories, including the new Red Dot, I am asking $420 for the entire package. If you do not want the red dot I am asking $350 for the rifle, fore end grips and magazines and I will keep the red dot. 

I live in the Clayton area but travel for a living so I can meet anywhere in Central/Eastern NC if you’d like. If you have any questions about the function of the rifle I would recommend meeting at a range of your choice. I am happy to let you shoot the rifle so you can see this thing is the real deal AR clone and functions perfectly. I will provide the ammo if you like or you can bring your own. It runs on anything. If you buy the rifle I will also throw in another 100 rounds so you can have a little fun. 

In the past I have had offers to break up the parts and have not done that. I feel that it is a complete set and would like to keep it that way. However, as long as you are not requesting just the barrel or something that would make it non-functioning, I will split up the package. So if you do not want the entire package as it is listed just let me know what you would like and we can settle on a price.

I will follow all laws and will not sell this rifle without a carry conceal permit or an FFL transfer.

Here are the options for this rifle:

•	TAPCO TACTICAL TRAINER STOCK: This stock is different than the regular Tapco takedown stock as it has the front rail over the barrel and takes both the .920” bull barrel and regular Ruger barrel. It has the SAW style pistol grip and two butt stocks. One is an angled stock tube for low profile sights and sits more like a traditional rifle (which is pictured) and the other is a straight stock tube that is appropriate for more “AR” height sights such as the Eotech or Aimpoint. Both are adjustable just like the AR15 standard collapsible stock. The stock also includes a sling adapter that will accept the HK style hooks. This stock currently sells for $114 on the Tapco site and slightly less on Amazon.
•	HOGUE .920” BULL BARREL: I put the heavier bull barrel on this rifle to give it more weight to the front so it would hold more like an AR. What surprised me the most what the accuracy increase I got with it. While zeroing the sight I had on it at the time I decided to see how far it would shoot with CCI MiniMag ammo. I consistently hit a paint can at 200 yards with every shot out of the rifle with zero magnification. It is impressive. Hogue no longer makes this barrel but similar barrels sell from $149 to $249.
•	BUSHNELL TRS-25 RED DOT SIGHT: I purchased this sight just a year ago when I had planned on turning the rifle back into a standard .22. The sight has only the rounds in it that I shot to zero it and is the newest part of this rig. It has multiple brightness settings and gives a pretty clean sight picture. They currently sell for $90 and if you do not want this sight I will be more than happy to keep it as it will sit on just about any platform.
•	RUGER BX-25 MAGAZINES: I have three Ruger BX-25 magazines that come with this rifle. They are factory made Ruger products and are pretty impressive. They hold 25 rounds each and have steel feed lips. I have been quite impressed with them as they have not had a single feed failure since I purchased them. The older Butler Creek ones did as the plastic feed lips just… well… sucked. I am including all three of these and three Ruger 10 round rotary magazines.
•	TAPCO FORE END GRIPS: I purchased two Tapco vertical grips to keep the look consistent with the Tapco stock. One is a stubby grip and the other is the same style but longer and comes with a bipod extension. They both have rubber bottoms and storage capacity. The stubby one still sells for $21 and the longer one with the bipod extension sells for $35.
•	ERGO RAIL COVERS: I purchased rail covers for the entire fore end so they would not tear my hands up. They are Ergo and sell for $10 each.
•	TRIGGER UPGRADE: I bought a complete set of springs, hammer and trigger for this rifle to clean up the gravely feel of the standard Ruger trigger. For the life of me I can’t remember the name of the company as it was years ago when I installed it and there is no value I can put to it. However, I thought it appropriate to mention since the trigger is not factory. I did not lighten the trigger much as I wanted it to mimic the AR trigger in my Stag but it is a very clean crisp pull. Much better than the original factory work.
•	HOGUE OVER MOLDED STOCK: I have a second stock for this rifle that I will throw in if you buy it. It is a Hogue over molded rubber stock. It has the lines of a traditional rifle stock and can be switched by just unscrewing the main screw of the rifle, pulling out the action and placing it in the new stock. This sold for $99 new and is in good condition. It has marks on the stock where I had a bag attached to the butt for a cheek rest but still works fine. I am just throwing this in as a bonus if you buy the rifle.

If you look at just the accessories you are getting a good deal. All are in like new condition and together with the rifle make a pretty awesome package. Thanks for looking and pleas let me know if there are any questions."

The reason it is considered ideal is due to its completely unique safety system, namely the ""squeezecocker"" control surface built into the front of the grip. When the operator picks up the firearm, the main shooting hand instinctually squeezes the panel rearward, and this action cocks the striker rearward while unlocking the sear for use. The panel is spring-loaded, which means when pressure is reduced, it snaps forward, decocking the striker and locking the trigger. This system is also designed to release the slide when it is locked rearward. This design eliminates the need for a decocker, external safety lever or slide stop lever, making the sides of the firearm completely flush and reducing overall width. The barrel is fixed (does not cant upwards) which means despite the firearm's compact size, it is capable of printing groups of 2 inches or less at 25 yards. This accuracy is easily comparable to many high-end automatic pistols in production. It has classic three white-dot sights dovetailed into the slide. I purchased it New in 1996 and have fired approximately 400 rounds through it without a single jam.Will include extra mags and nice holster.OREGON Residents ONLY

The reason it is considered ideal is due to its completely unique safety system, namely the ""squeezecocker"" control surface built into the front of the grip. When the operator picks up the firearm, the main shooting hand instinctually squeezes the panel rearward, and this action cocks the striker rearward while unlocking the sear for use. The panel is spring-loaded, which means when pressure is reduced, it snaps forward, decocking the striker and locking the trigger. This system is also designed to release the slide when it is locked rearward. This design eliminates the need for a decocker, external safety lever or slide stop lever, making the sides of the firearm completely flush and reducing overall width. The barrel is fixed (does not cant upwards) which means despite the firearm's compact size, it is capable of printing groups of 2 inches or less at 25 yards. This accuracy is easily comparable to many high-end automatic pistols in production. It has classic three white-dot sights dovetailed into the slide. I purchased it New in 1996 and have fired approximately 400 rounds through it without a single jam.Will include extra mags and nice holster.OREGON Residents ONLY

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.
