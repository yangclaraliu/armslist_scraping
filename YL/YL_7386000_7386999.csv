Please read this first and if still doubting google 26 OAL.""OAL determines the legality of using a VFG on an AR-type weapon with no buttstock. If it is under 26"" OAL and has a VFG, it is considered an AOW rather than a handgun, as we all know. But, if the weapon is more than 26"" OAL and has a VFG, it no longer fits the definition of ""handgun"" or ""pistol"", but also doesn't fall into the AOW catagory, and it is not a rifle because it has no buttstock. It becomes simply a ""firearm""."""

413,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7386413,For Sale:  170 years old!,"ia, Iowa, United States","$ 1,050","Listed On: Friday, September 29, 2017",Antique,Century International Arms                                                                                ,no type,no type,Pistol,"From my personal collection, here is a rare and historic Jennings rifle manufactured circa 1850, and in very solid condition for almost 170 years old! I put ""repeating"" in quotes because while these rifles were designed to be repeaters, the action was fundamentally flawed, and as a result most of the very few in existence were converted to single shot - both breech and muzzle loading. This one is converted to muzzle loading, but what I like is it retains the original round sliding ring ""lever"" and oval guard components of the action. So there is no visual difference in the outside appearance from the original repeating design.The condition of this rifle is solid, while showing its age. The wood has been refinished, but it retains its signature original Jennings German silver inlay on the side of the stock and the original buttplate. Refinish was done very professionally and now has some age to it, and is a touch short of the metal in places. There's some very attractive wavy figure in the dense walnut. The metal is in nice clean condition, with crisp frame markings characteristic of the Jennings. This one also has desirable and beautifully executed engraving, as is occasionally seen in this identical pattern on these guns. The barrel and tube have a fair amount of blue mixing with grey brown patina, looks to me like a very old refinish. The manufacturing was contracted to Robbins & Lawrence in Vermont,  it is marked as such, which is typical. Barrel is heavy, measures 33.5"" to the percussion nipple, and is 54 caliber. As noted, it was converted to muzzle loader, but the finger ring/trigger still slides back/forth and the cocking, lock and trigger mechanism function (while the ring/trigger is in the ""back"" position). The sliding doors on the side and top of the frame rotate open and closed, but internally they no longer serve their original functions related to single shot breech loading on the side and pill priming on the top. These sliding covers are nearly identical to other converted Jennings rifles I've seen published in auction catalogs. Front and rear sights are the standard basic design for Jennings rifles. I could go on and on, but suffice to say this is a very unique opportunity to own a real piece of firearms and Winchester history, it would be right at home in any early Volcanic, Henry, or Winchester collection. Photos taken in extremely harsh outdoor light that magnifies every flaw and thins the look of the blue. Postal Money Order. If you need additional photos or have questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I'm happy to help. 3-day no questions asked inspection,  you will not be disappointed with this fine rifle."

I do not need to sell it and would rather trade it, so no I will not take $700 unless you're adding another gun I can easily sell to make up the difference. Do a bit of searching before you come at me saying my price is high etc. There are I believe two other Legions for sale on here, I have 3 extra mags, 1 extended, a holster, and a threaded barrel... and those two listings are more $$. What my gun comes with:Sig P226 Legion firearm (read about it if you want specifics) roughly 100 rounds through it, yes it has holster wear, but not alot. Threaded Sig Sauer barrel from a MK25 (one of the few barrels that fits the unique internals of the legion). Original Sig Box, Large Padded Legion Case, 4 15 round Sig mags, 1 15 round Mec-Gear mags, 1 20 round Sig mag. Blackhawk OWB holster. Sig Legion Challenge Coin, all pamphlets, stickers, and info if you want to buy Legion gear. The only way I will half-way consider another trade is if there is atleast $700 in cash (about how much it costs to buy one of the guns I am looking to trade for)."
