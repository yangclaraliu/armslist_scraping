Comes with soft case, two mags, two sets of grips with one being rubberized gold pony stamped target grips. Every gun collector should have at least one Custom Gun in their stable of guns. Les Baer's Premier II© has become the industry standard to which all other factory or custom built 1911s are compared. The 5"" long Government Model (pictured ) is the best single stack duty, defense or competition pistol you'll find in America …. the best quality, the best value and the best performance. No wonder so many of them show up at IPSC Limited Class matches. The Premier II© is even guaranteed to shoot 3"" groups at 50 yards! That means that 99% of them will be closer to 1.5” groups at 50 yards in a ransom rest. The Premier II© has become the flagship of Les Baer's 1911 line of pistols. It performs like a million bucks, but it costs a whole lot less than Wilson Combat, Nighthawk, Ed Brown etc. I can say that unequivocally, because I have owned all 1911's just mentioned. This Premier II will out shoot all of them. Features include: Baer NM steel frame, NM slide and NM barrel with stainless bushing • Slide fitted to frame • Double serrated slide • Low mount LCB adjustable sight with hidden rear leaf • Baer dovetail front sight • Lowered and flared ejection port • Tuned and polished extractor • Baer extended ejector • Baer checkered slide stop• Baer speed trigger with crisp 4 lb pull • Baer deluxe Commander hammer and sear • Baer beavertail grip safety with pad • Flat serrated mainspring housing • Beveled mag well • Polished feed ramp and throated barrel • Baer extended ambidextrous safety • High checkered front strap @ 30 lpi • Pistol tuned for total reliability • Baer Premium Checkered grips • Blued finish • (2) 8-round premium magazines. If you are looking at adding a Custom 1911 to your collection, then this is the gun for you. Check out Les Baer's web site. Go to Les Baer web site and see what you have to pay ordering from him + shipping + FFL dealer transfer fee. My price for a LNIB Les Baer Premier II is only $1795 CASH or higher value for trades. Specifications: Caliber: .45 acp Frame: Steel. Sights: 3-dot contrast. Barrel Length: 5.00.” Length: 8.7.” Weight: 41.6 oz. with magazine. Capacity: 8+1. I have other gun's that are either NIB or LNIB in .45 acp. 40 S&W and 9 mm for sale as well, let me know what you are looking for? I am a private gun owner, and just selling off a few, (No Fire Sale Here, but you will save some money.) I only own and have purchased quality firearms. Because of osteoarthritis many of my guns have never been fired. Better make your BUYS now, before congress shuts down private transfers of guns, through web sites like this. “It's coming.” I Will require a “Bill Of Sale” and proof of Alabama residency (AL.

Product details
The NIKKO STIRLING Nighteater 3-10x42 Rifle Scope, LRX Reticle, 1in. Tube (NP31042LRX) is a versatile rifle scope which has grade ""A"" fully multicoated lenses with Microlux ETE coatings. It is one piece body for strength, rigidity and improved accuracy.
 
The Nighteater stylish ""built in"" sunshade has a saddle parallax adjustment from 10m to infinity; fast focus eyepiece. Waterproof as each scope is tested to 1.5m and shockproof (shock tested more than 200 times to the equivalent of 240kg). In the Nighteater nitrogen filled for fog proofing.
 
The LRX reticle helps shooters to quickly acquire the target for quick and accurate shots. The hold over lines in LRX reticle are set at exact inches. The first one is set at 1 inch then 2 inches then 4 inches of hold over.
 
The series includes scopes for all hunting conditions from low light forests to plains varminting. Hunters will appreciate the speed of the saddle focus for parallax correction to a target distance that will vary during a hunt. Objective lens focusing is not nearly as efficient.

I have a Bushmaster Model XM15-E2S Chambered in 223-5.56MM. with a few add-ons.  This rifle has a NATO 5.56 heavy duty barrel with a 1/9 twist. As far as aftermarket parts, it has a Rock River Arms 6 position stock and grip, Magpul BAD Lever to drop the bolt from the trigger group, ASAP Sling attachment infront of the buffer tube for a single point sling, as well as metal attachments for a double point sling, and an UTG 12"" Quadrail (numbered). Overall I would rate the rifle as a 8 out of 10 as far as condition and I've put 2,000-3,000 rounds through it. Its a solid, fully furnished ""M-16 Style"" rifle. I need to figure out what I would take cash, but for the time being if you have an offer just let me know. All laws must be followed, If you have a CCW or pistol permit I would confirm, as well as a signed bill of sale for both parties; If those dont apply to you I would be much more comfortable having a FFL do the transfer as I can't do a background check. Please don't waste your time with lowball offers. I don't need to sell but this rifle just takes up space in the safe. I open to trades, just let me know what you got. Interested in well known reliable manufacturers for rifles, pistols, and I would like to get a nicer semi-auto shotgun for 3 gun. I'm fine with trading value going either way. Thank you!"

All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory. Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.
