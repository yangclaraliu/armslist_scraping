Gebby that is complete with a vintage Lyman 6 power ""Junior Targetspot"" scope.  The receiver is marked ""DOT 4"" which stands for the Brunn-BRNO A.G. firm which was located in Czechoslovakia and the manufacture date of 1944.  This receiver was likely brought back as a complete rifle by a U.S. soldier who took it as a war trophy.  At some point most likely in the 1950's when these K98s were not worth very much as collectibles, the rifle was taken apart and the receiver used as the starting point for this custom rifle by ""J.E. Gebby"".  J.E. Gebby was a well known custom rifle maker who specialized in varmint rifles and who is best known for patenting the ""wildcat"" .22 Varminter cartridge in 1937, which later became the extremely popular .22-250 cartridge standardized by Remington in 1965.  This particular rifle was actually chambered in that original .22 Varminter cartridge and later rechambered for the .220 Swift, and is marked so on the barrel with the original caliber markings and J.E. Gebby ""lined out"".  This rifle has been used but not abused.  It features a 26 inch heavy ""Varmint"" profile barrel that is drilled and tapped for Lyman/Unertyl blocks with two forward block mounting positions to handle multiple sizes of that style of scope.  The forward pair of holes are currently filled with plug screws.  The barrel has a target style crown and the bore is minty and bright.  The rifling has sharp lands and grooves and shows no signs of pitting or erosion of any kind.  As mentioned before, the barrel is stamped on the left side near the receiver with the serial number ""No.577"", ""Trademark Reg. .220 Swift (caliber is lined out and .220 Swift is stamped below original), and ""J.E. Gebby"" (also lined out when the caliber was changed).  The original gloss blue finish on the barrel rates 95%, with some minor high edge wear at the muzzle.  The receiver was buffed and blued, removing most of the Nazi proofs and leaving only the maker code and date stamp and the model designation on the side ""Mod. 98"".  It retains 95% of this finish as well.  The bolt is also an original  WW2 German K98 bolt but has been altered by changing the safety to a lower profile sporter type, the bolt handle has been extended and reshaped/welded to a sporter style, and the body and bolt handle stem has been polished bright.  The bolt handle knob itself has been textured for grip.  The rear of the bolt is finished in the same blue as the receiver.  The trigger guard and floorplate are K98 parts as well that have been polished and blued to match the rest of the rifle.  The trigger in this rifle is spectacular.  The military style trigger was replaced with a single-set adjustable unit and is really nice.  Even without ""setting"" the trigger it is crisp and breaks cleanly; when using the single set feature as it is currently adjusted the trigger is a ""hair trigger"" that breaks almost at the touch.  The stock is a checkered Walnut Monte Carlo style stock with an ebony forend tip.  It has some light handling marks but is otherwise in excellent condition.  The checkered panel areas still have a lot of grip to them and the stock is 100% free from cracks or repairs.  It has large sling swivel studs installed and a ""White Line"" recoil pad that pulls 13.75 inches to the end of the pad.  Completing this vintage package is the Lyman Junior Targetspot scope which is mounted on this rifle.  It is a 6 power scope with an adjustable objective lens and features standard fine line crosshairs."

Sauer & Sohn Mauser S/147 1937.  A true “RC” in unmolested form.  I say unmolested because the elements of the Russian rebuild are still evident and have not been altered to remove the historical importance of this rifle’s journey from German to Russian heritage.  Typical elements of Russian adoption are intact - “X” marked receiver, period appropriate “re-bluing”, bolt forced matched via electric pencil to receiver, original German cartouches sanded off from stock and then stock stamped with receiver number, period appropriate red shellac stock.  Receiver bears many Weimer/Reichsadler eagles.  It would be my hopes that this rifle is purchased and kept in its present form.  Experienced firearm owners know that those surplus firearms that are kept in their original surplus form (and not stripped, sanded, redone, etc.) are the firearms that most likely greatly increase in value.  Erasing the Russian history of this rifle would be travesty - the age old saying holds true – “If this gun could talk…..”

I hate to admit this but my dislike is based on most everything I've read. I've never handled one let alone fired one. I reckon I was told not to like them so I didn't. That's totally my fault and I take full responsibility for my ignorance.I recently acquired this Custom Shop Ultra Raptor II 3"" and I absolutely love it! This one's bruised and worn but it's butter smooth and consistently accurate at 25 yards. It, like most guns, is a better shooter than me. The trigger is excellent and it cycled through six different manufacturers and grains without a hitch.It's a damn fine 1911 and will be a welcomed addition to any collection.Text me ar REDACTED"

This rifle comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. This rifle does have some minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it did see an average amount of normal usage, but was well taken care of. There are no major flaws/defects to be found on this rifle, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, rusting, or discoloration. There are a small handful of shallow nicks and cuts throughout the rifle's wood stock, which is fairly light in color, and is beautifully carved/etched. The receiver is also in good shape, though it does have some scratching on the inside of the chamber, and the previous owner etched what appears to be his serial number into the opposite side. This rifle features a safety switch set directly into the rear of the trigger assembly, and has its original iron sights as well a top-mounted scope, and a hard rubber butt-plate. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this rifle, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

The Caracal® Enhanced F – Limited Edition is a striker fired semi-automatic pistol chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum. The pistol is comprised of a Caracal International frame and a Caracal USA slide, and is assembled in the United States. Only a limited number of these pistols will be placed into the market, commemorating Caracal’s commitment in the industry and Caracal USA’s first consumer product release. 
 
The Enhanced F – Limited Edition pistol features a redundant safety system consisting of an integrated trigger safety, firing pin safety and a drop safety. 
 
The ergonomically designed contoured polymer frame, with its intuitive grip angle, incorporates a rail interface system for mounting lights, lasers and other shooting accessories. With an 18mm (0.71”) distance from the center axis of the barrel to the apex of the tang, the low slide profile puts the recoil axis close to the shooter's hand, which greatly reduces muzzle rise and felt recoil. The trigger shoe, trigger safety and trigger bar have all been designed in conjunction with a one-piece multi-function unit. Comes with 2 magazines, case and paperwork - $600.00 or consider trades.

I bought it as a affordable quality 9mm 1911 Style pistol that I could plink around at range, but I don't really use it so I'd like to get something new for my collection. This is a good range pistol and an historical collectible with an all steel construction. I have more pictures I can email you upon request. Historical Background:
 The Star Model Super B was manufactured in Spain from 1946-1983 by Star Bonifacio Echeverria. This particular model of handgun started off in the 9mm Largo Caliber (9x21) but was re chambered in 9mm Luger for WW2. During WW2 These pistols were primarily used by rearward echelon German Troops. After the war, many of these pistols were used by Soviet Police. These handguns were very popular in Hollywood as a replacement for 1911 pistols as 9mm was easier to convert to fire blanks. One of the Star Super B's most Iconic role was Jules' (Samuel L Jackson's) Pistol in Pulp Fiction. Star Bonifacio Echeverria went out of business in 1997 but their handguns are pretty good in terms of Quality, fit, and finish.
The Good:
- Accurate
- Light Trigger
- Light Recoil
- Custom Wood Grips
- Nice Blued Finish (This one was a hand pick from Classic Firearms)
- Collectible - The import supply dried up so they are going up in value.
- 3 Extra Original Factory Magazines - Spare Original magazines are even harder to find than the pistols.
- 1911 Style Firearm - Although more like a Browning High Power 9mm in terms of the mechanism, this is a fun and cheap way get the 1911 feel without the 1911 price.
- Excellent Construction - Completely made for quality steel.
- Internals are in good condition
The Bad:
Reliability - It will jam up here and there. It maybe because certain magazines work better than others. It's good enough for the range but I wouldn't recommend carrying it. I read that there are ways to fix the reliability issues but I'm not a gunsmith so I don't want to do something I'll regret.
The Ugly:
Blemish - There is a small spot at the left end of the slide by the barrel that is pitted. The gun was the Slide was re blued so there is no rust but you can see where there was rust at one point. This pistol is in good surplus condition.
Includes: Pistol, 4 Original factory magazines, New Wolf Recoil (Still in package), Original plastic grips, Soft pistol case, Original Manual in Spanish, Original Cleaning Rod."
