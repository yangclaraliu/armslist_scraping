This is a fun little topbreak revolver. It's a second model, made from 1908-1912. So over a hundred years old, but still capable of taking a rabbit or being a good field or truck gun. Or even just a collectible. It comes with a box of CCI standard velocity ammunition. You should probably not shoot high velocity ammunition out of it in respect for its age. Thus I am including the ammo I have that works well in it. It will also shoot .22 Short or long of course. The holster fits well and is modern. Of course, this is also small enough to fit easily into a jacket pocket. I have carried it when knocking around in the desert for the past few months, and even have a couple of YouTube videos of me shooting it out there. If you want a link, just ask. I am not receiving Armslist's emails for some reason so it is best if you text or call me at REDACTED here in Santa Fe. I am buying a rifle, so this listing will only last a couple of days and then I will remove it if it doesn't sell right away. Thanks for looking. You will like it.

I'm the second owner on this pistol. It shows normal wear and has not had any kind of abuse or high round count. It has steel, factory Glock (Meprolight) Tru-Dot 3 dot night sights that are at what I'd easily call 80%+ brightness. The previous owner stippled a small index point on the frame, shown in the pictures. I bought it, added the Vickers parts indicated below, put a box of ammunition through it, cleaned it and have not fired or carried it since. If you would prefer the factory slide release and magazine release, I am happy to reinstall them for you.
 
Original Glock plastic case with all accessories
Vickers Tactical slide release (installed)
Vickers Tactical magazine release (installed)
Two grip extensions to fill the gap when using 15rd magazines
Three 10-rd Glock 26 magazines
Two 15-rd Glock magazines
Two 15-rd KCI magazines (new)
One 17-rd KCI magazine (new)
one Pearce +2 extension baseplate
two Glock baseplates with pinky extensions
one Vickers baseplate
EXO Concealment Kydex belt holster for Glock 26
This is a pistol and must be transferred at an FFL. I'm in Southern Chester County, PA and am willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet at a reputable FFL. Buyer pays transfer fees.

It therefore has a small amount of the re-bluing showing wear.The bore is clean with pronounced rifling, but is pitted.
The pistol was originally cleaned up, polished and re-blued over 25 years ago by a professional gunsmith, who also was the one that carried it. It was not over polished and therefore there are some slight pitting on both the slide and frame, which are now encapsulated by the re-bluing.
It comes with its original 8 rd magazine, which is blued without a serial number.$300 
A second magazine is available and has a serial number of 426209 and marked with a II.$75

Also would consider S&W or Ruger .357 magnums. Tactical shotguns by a reputable company in 20 gauge only, AR-15 and AR-9 pistol that accepts glock mags, other decent 9mm carbines, gen 1 or 2 sub-2000's that accept 9mm glock mags,  cmr-30, sks in wooden stock, and lastly either the HK 416 in .22lr or the Sig552 chambered in .22lr.  Maybe a S&W M&P 15-22 depending on model and what's included. 5.56 and .223 bolt or single shot rifles as well. I'm aware many of these guns are more than $450, but just putting out there what I'm interested in. Really want something reliable, that you don't see often at the range, but reliability is the biggest thing. I don't want any lemons. Willing to go anywhere in chittenden county and maybe a little further depending on deal or individual. Check email often, but also text with pics, details, and prices eight oh two 324-3350. Have valid Vermont drivers license. Thanks for reading my rather long post. Giving it 24 hours, before I order online and have it shipped locally"

It’s time to upgrade for me but this gun will serve whoever buys it very well for a long time. This gun has been used hard and functions flawlessly. Daniel Defense barrels are some of the best in the industry and this barrel alone retails for around 280. This gun has about 3000 rounds through it so it has a long life ahead of it. The barrel length is 14.5 inches and has a silencerco asr flash hider welded to this end so it is legally 16 inches and NFA rules do not apply to it. This gun is buttery smooth, has to be handled to appreciate it. Very lightweight and maneuverable! Here is a complete parts list.- black forge upper and lower- standard lower parts kit and mil spec trigger- spikes tactical phosphate BCG- FDE MOE grip- fixed FDE MOE carbine stock (mil spec)- mil spec buffer tube- standard carbine buffer and spring - sling compatible end plate- Daniel Defense 1 in 7 light weight 14.5 in cold hammer forged barrel- Troy V-tac Alpha rail 13”- Superlative Arms adjustable bleed off gas block- Silencerco ASR flashier compatible with many silencerco asr mount supressors.
