And REPR stands for Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle. 20 inch barrel, the desireable 10 twist, best gas piston system in the industry, highly desireable left side charging handle so you don't break your cheek-weld (just reach up with left hand to grab it), billet aluminum construction for quality, and ATLAS Bipod ($300 bipod) attached, and factory back up iron sights.  This rifle is known for MOA and sub MOA accuracy to 1,000 yards. Shotgun news did a write up on this rifle and they got 0.3 MOA groups at 100 yds with Federal's Gold Medal Match 168 gr Sierra Matchkings.  Rifle has only had 50-60 rounds fired through it. I love the gun but I am selling it because I am moving out of state soon and want the money to go towards earnest money for a home build.  This particular model of REPR is sought after because the barrel is non-fluted and they are known for extreme accuracy. The non-fluted barrel won't warp, compared to what you risk with the newer model with a spiral fluted barrel. They should have put a straight flute on the barrel if any kind of fluting at all was to be used, but they spiral fluted it and that is not wise to have under a sustained fire or shooting in hot weather. Rifle was $3975 new. Atlas bipod was $300 with two sets of prongs to fit on it. One regular and one pair of spiked prongs which are for sand or soft ground. That's $4275.  I am selling it for $3600. And while that is a fair price, make an offer if that is out of budget. You will want it with that specific bipod. They are both the best in the industry.  NOTE: I AM IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING TO THE BOISE AREA. Contact me at 971-701-0406. Text or call. Thanks. Jeff    I WILL BE MAKING MY SECOND TRIP BRINGING MY HOUSEHOLD GOODS TO IDAHO IN MID DECEMBER AND CAN BRING THE RIFLE DURING THAT TRIP.  IF YOU NEED IT SOONER THEN I CAN SHIP IT TO YOUR FFL FROM WHERE I LIVE IN SALEM, OREGON."

This rifle feels better to me then a regular AR-15 style rifle. This Sig SCM is much more substantial and the quality fit and finish on the gun is way above a regular AR in my opinion. This rifle has a clean bright bore and strong rifling. The gun comes with open sights and a Sigtac Optic that has 3 different choices of red dot holograms, a regular dot and a circle with dot and progressive cross hairs ( I think that is how to describe them). The optic either way is really cool and can be removed if you just want to use the open sights"

I took it out to the gun range the first weekend I owned it and put 150 total rounds of factory 115 grain FMJ regular and hollow point ammo through it with absolutely no issues. It was bought to serve as my home protection gun with its compact size and high capacity, so I haven't shot it much other than to take it out periodically to ensure it is working well and that I can shoot it with accuracy. Last weekend I put the 500th round through it and it shoots and works as well as the first 150 rounds did. I hadn't planned on selling this gun (I always have good intentions...) but this is my only 9mm semi-automatic pistol and have decided to get down to just my revolvers for now. I may buy another 9mm next year, but for now I will be a .38 caliber shooter. This Springfield XD9 Mod. 2 Sub Compact 9mm is a great shooting and feeling gun with a nice trigger. The gun has been house kept, protectively stored, and cleaned after every shooting. It is in excellent condition and comes with a total of three (two 13 round and one 16 round capacity) magazines plus all the stuff that was included when I bought it such as a hard plastic case, extra green and red fiber optic rods, owner's manual, lock, and bore brush. The features of this gun include:

Striker Status Indicator gives a visual and tactile feedback of the condition of the pistol

Loaded Chamber Indicator gives a visual and tactile feedback of the condition of the pistol

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System which prevents rearward movement of the trigger without it being intentional

Accessory Rail

Ambidextrous Magazine Release

Grip Zone contours and texturing

High Polish Stainless Steel Magazine which assists in being drop free

No Snag Trigger Guard

High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail that enables the shooter to get a grip as high as possible toward the barrel bore

This gun has had a easy life so far and needs to be shot!!! This is the 1st and only Sig SCM that I have ever seen or handled and I really like the rifle. This rifle feels better to me then a regular AR-15 style rifle. This Sig SCM is much more substantial and the quality fit and finish on the gun is way above a regular AR in my opinion. This rifle has a clean bright bore and strong rifling. The gun comes with open sights and a Sigtac Optic that has 3 different choices of red dot holograms, a regular dot and a circle with dot and progressive cross hairs ( I think that is how to describe them). The optic either way is really cool and can be removed if you just want to use the open sights."

This is a 1940's vintage Mossberg, from when rifles were made to last. This is a full size, tube fed bolt action. It has the T bolt handle that still shows some faded case colors. The bluing is excellent and original. No big scratches or anything of the sort. It is complete with all the original sights, including the usually missing S-130 peep sight and interchangeable flip up front sight (the model number escapes me at the moment). The stock is in near perfect shape, original finish. The only thing worth mentioning condition-wise on the entire rifle is some minor shrinkage in the molded trigger guard. You wouldn't notice unless you were looking for it. It's minor enough that I never bothered refitting it. Unfortunately I do not have sling swivels for it. I never bothered much with slings. This is kind of a rare bird as it will shoot short and long rifle .22 ammo.This is one of my last pieces because although it's a sporting gun, it is flat out the best shooting .22 I've owned- and I've owned many. Shot it side by side against my Winchester 52 and 75, Remington 512T and various other target guns and spanked them all. It loves Remington Auto Match and Wolf MT. Challenge the kid in the next lane with the tricked out 10-22 and win some beers.If you've been wanting one of these, now's your rare chance at a near pristine example. You won't find one nicer."

If you'd prefer just to purchase I will accept cash offers as well. More photos can  be sent on request.  Thanks!"

A three-point-takedown safety system will not allow you to break down the firearm with the magazine in the gun or without the slide locked to the rear, making it difficult for an accidental discharge to occur. Modular grip frame accommodates a wide range of hand sizes. SIGLITE® night sights provide target acquisition in any lighting situation. Double-action striker-fire operating system. Quick takedown with no tools required. Includes SIG Sauer ROMEO1 mini reflex sight pre-installed and zeroed.

683,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7684683,For Sale/Trade:  .22 LR AR15 / M4 upper CZ-V22 conversion kit for .22 long rifle,"county, California, United States",$ 475,"Listed On: Saturday, December 9, 2017",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is brand new, never fired CZ-V22 fully self-contained .22 LR upper for the AR15 platform. I've owned this upper since around 2005. I purchased it new, but have never fired it. It's been in storage since new (only opened to take photos).This is a very nice self-contained upper for converting your AR / M4 style rifle to .22 LR. Unlike conversion kits which attempt to use your existing barrel and upper assembly, this upper is complete with its own bolt and its own magazine (the magainze included is 10 rounds, but I believe 30 round magazines are still available on line, which are compatible with this kit). Simply install using your standard take down pins on your lower and you're all set.Check YouTube and you can find some videos showing this brand of upper in action. From what I understand, this is one of the more reliable .22 LR uppers for the AR. I've never fired it myself, but my friend had one and he loved it (which is why I purchased mine). It appears to be pretty high quality. The upper looks to be painted black, but I'm not 100% sure of the nature of the coating. I had plans to maybe refinish it using some sort of mil spec paint, but I'm not sure that's even really needed.Comes in the original factory box. Payment & Shippng: I accept payment via paypal and ship quick with excellent and secure packing. Tracking # included.  As far as price, I don't really know what this thing might be worth. I've seen it sell via on-line forums at close to $500 in the past. I'm asking $475 shipped, which I think is a fair price. Feel free to make me an offer, as I don't shoot much .22 LR any more."

So I can meet you just about anywhere from Eugene to Bend, or Burns, or Portland to The Dalles, La Grande, or Tri-Cities area, etc. Call me at REDACTED to work it out. Or I can ship it to an FFL and split the shipping with you.  This is truly a great rifle. Jeff.  This one has been stored in a gun safe in a climate controlled home.  It's a 7.62 x 51mm LWRCI REPR, meaning it also takes 308 Winchester rounds. And REPR stands for Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle. 20 inch barrel, the desireable 10 twist, best gas piston system in the industry, highly desireable left side charging handle so you don't break your cheek-weld (just reach up with left hand to grab it), billet aluminum construction for quality, and factory back up iron sights.  This rifle is known for sub MOA accuracy to 1,000 yards. Shotgun News magazine did an in-depth write up on this rifle and they got 0.3 MOA groups at 100 yds with Federal's Gold Medal Match 168 gr Sierra Matchkings.  Rifle has only had 50-60 rounds fired through it. I love the gun but I am selling it because I am moving out of state soon and want the money to go towards earnest money for a home build.  This particular model of REPR is sought after because the barrel is non-fluted and they are known for extreme accuracy. The non-fluted barrel won't warp, compared to what you risk with the newer model with a spiral fluted barrel. They should have put a straight flute on the barrel if any kind of fluting at all was to be used, but they spiral fluted it and that is not wise to have under a sustained fire or shooting in hot weather. Rifle was $3975 new. I'm selling it for $3395. That is without the bipd. The bipod is not for sale.  CALL OR TEXT ME AT REDACTED, AND MAKE AN OFFER. THANK YOU.  JEFFNOTE:  I WILL SPLIT THE SHIPPING COST TO AN FFL OF YOUR CHOSING IF YOU WANT IT SHIPPED."

Max’s “MM” logo is custom engraved on the slide and machined into the Hogue® custom G-10 “Chainlink” grips, which offer a very aggressive, non-slip surface to the shooter.“I’m pretty particular about what goes into my guns,” Michel said. “In my world, a broken part or a malfunction could end my shot at a world title. I wouldn’t put my name on a gun unless I was certain it would measure up to my standards.”Built to Michel’s specifications, the 1911 Max has a host of custom features, including SIG SAUER flat trigger, external extractor, a Dawson® Ice Magwell®, a Koenig® Speed Hammer® and EGW® sear and firing pin. Fiber optic front and adjustable rear sights also provide high-speed visibility.  sale or trade.comes with factory hardcase,4-8rd magazines  and 40 rds of hormandy hom defenve.call or text REDACTED with trades or offers."

And REPR stands for Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle. 20 inch barrel, the desireable 10 twist, best gas piston system in the industry, highly desireable left side charging handle so you don't break your cheek-weld (just reach up with left hand to grab it), billet aluminum construction for quality, and ATLAS Bipod ($300 bipod) attached, and factory back up iron sights.  This rifle is known for MOA and sub MOA accuracy to 1,000 yards. Shotgun news did a write up on this rifle and they got 0.3 MOA groups at 100 yds with Federal's Gold Medal Match 168 gr Sierra Matchkings.  Rifle has only had 50-60 rounds fired through it. I love the gun but I am selling it because I am moving out of state soon and want the money to go towards earnest money for a home build.  This particular model of REPR is sought after because the barrel is non-fluted and they are known for extreme accuracy. The non-fluted barrel won't warp, compared to what you risk with the newer model with a spiral fluted barrel. They should have put a straight flute on the barrel if any kind of fluting at all was to be used, but they spiral fluted it and that is not wise to have under a sustained fire or shooting in hot weather. Rifle was $3975 new. Atlas bipod was $300 with two sets of prongs to fit on it. One regular and one pair of spiked prongs which are for sand or soft ground. That's $4275.  I am selling it for $3600. And while that is a fair price, make an offer if that is out of budget. You will want it with that specific bipod. They are both the best in the industry.  Contact me at 971-701-0406. Text or call.

And REPR stands for Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle. 20 inch barrel, the desireable 10 twist, best gas piston system in the industry, highly desireable left side charging handle so you don't break your cheek-weld (just reach up with left hand to grab it), billet aluminum construction for quality, and ATLAS Bipod ($300 bipod) attached, and factory back up iron sights.  This rifle is known for MOA and sub MOA accuracy to 1,000 yards. Shotgun news did a write up on this rifle and they got 0.3 MOA groups at 100 yds with Federal's Gold Medal Match 168 gr Sierra Matchkings.  Rifle has only had 50-60 rounds fired through it. I love the gun but I am selling it because I am moving out of state soon and want the money to go towards earnest money for a home build.  This particular model of REPR is sought after because the barrel is non-fluted and they are known for extreme accuracy. The non-fluted barrel won't warp, compared to what you risk with the newer model with a spiral fluted barrel. They should have put a straight flute on the barrel if any kind of fluting at all was to be used, but they spiral fluted it and that is not wise to have under a sustained fire or shooting in hot weather. Rifle was $3975 new. Atlas bipod was $300 with two sets of prongs to fit on it. One regular and one pair of spiked prongs which are for sand or soft ground. That's $4275.  I am selling it for $3600. And while that is a fair price, make an offer if that is out of budget. You will want it with that specific bipod. They are both the best in the industry.  Contact me at 971-701-0406. Text or call.

Or I can ship it to an FFL and split the shipping with you.  This is truly a great rifle. Jeff. Bottom line is these original type REPRs from LWRCI made through approx 2014 are the most accurate LWRCI has ever made, and this is well known. They are accurate to 0.3 MOA with Federal Gold Medal Match Ammo and people that have this version of the REPR are not selling them. The newer version has a spiral fluted barrel which can change point of impact once it heats up. This was done to cut weight, which was not necessary on a precision rifle. They should have gone with the straight fluted barrel to preserve accuracy They chose looks of a spiral flute & marketing over practical sense. So if you want the most accurate AR-10 ever made, you get the original black REPR that has no fluting, and it still has the best gas piston in the industry, huge advantages of left side charging handle, all billet construction, 2 stage national match fully adjustable trigger, and more. Mine's a late 2012 model in mint condition and all instructions in the box. Mine's been kept in a safe and is my prized rifle in new condition but I am selling it because I am about to build a custom house and think I might need the money for it.  This one has been stored in a gun safe in a climate controlled home.  It's a 7.62 x 51mm LWRCI REPR, meaning it also takes 308 Winchester rounds. And REPR stands for Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle. 20 inch barrel, the desireable 10 twist, best gas piston system in the industry, highly desireable left side charging handle so you don't break your cheek-weld (just reach up with left hand to grab it), billet aluminum construction for quality, and factory back up iron sights.  This rifle is known for sub MOA accuracy to 1,000 yards. Shotgun News magazine did an in-depth write up on this rifle and they got 0.3 MOA groups at 100 yds with Federal's Gold Medal Match 168 gr Sierra Matchkings.  Rifle has only had 50-60 rounds fired through it. I love the gun but I am selling it because I am moving out of state soon and want the money to go towards earnest money for a home build.  This particular model of REPR is sought after because the barrel is non-fluted and they are known for extreme accuracy. The non-fluted barrel won't warp, compared to what you risk with the newer model with a spiral fluted barrel. They should have put a straight flute on the barrel if any kind of fluting at all was to be used, but they spiral fluted it and that is not wise to have under a sustained fire or shooting in hot weather. Rifle was $3975 new. This model cost more than the newer version, and this is the most accurate version. It's in mint condition. The bipod is not for sale.  CALL OR TEXT ME AT REDACTED, AND MAKE AN OFFER.

This is a high quality all-steel 1911 Colt Government Series 70 clone made in Turkey.  It’s a two-tone ( FDE & Black),, 5 inch polygonal stainless barrel with a fitted bushing and a Picatinny rail under the dust shroud.  This pistol was greatly enhanced from stock, by a professional 1911 Pistolsmith to ensure reliability, safety and accuracy.  Among the work performed was fitting and polishing of internal parts, replacement of non-standard grip bushings and screws, installation of XS Sight systems DXW front tritium Big Dot & rear White Line sights, installation and fitting of an STI Long Curve trigger, installation and fitting with an Ed Brown Extended magazine catch, a Wolff Type B recoil spring and a Wilson Combat Bullet Proof sear spring.
In addition, it has the Hogue 1911 rubber wrap-around Red Laser grip.  Also included are the original three 8-rd MecGar magazines, plus  a Galco Yaqui tan leather belt slide holster.
All components, mags and accessories are new -  I couldn’t take it out to the range due to health reasons, which is why I’m selling my favorite 1911.
I accept checks and money orders, subject to clearing, and can ship to your FFL Dealer for under $20.  If picking up at my home, I’ll also include a 50-rd box of ball ammo.  Thanks for looking!"
