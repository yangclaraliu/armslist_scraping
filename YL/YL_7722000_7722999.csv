General Specs: Marlin Arms, Year 1888, .32-40, 8lbs 5oz, Lever Rifle Serial Number: 16681 What an incredible piece of history we have before us in this antique Marlin Deluxe special order rifle.  Can you imagine ordering a gun like this in 1887 and taking delivery at the local general store in February 1888?  What the town's people must have thought, and what pride of ownership the gent must have had.  This is a very rare example of John Marlin's first lever action repeating rifle, with only 16,378 made.  The Cody Firearms Museum letter gives us the basics; Model 1881, .32-40 caliber, 28"" barrel, shipped 1888.  As noted in Colonel Brophy's seminal book on Marlin guns entitled ""MARLIN FIREARMS --- A History of the Guns and the Company That Made Them"", the early records did not record whether the guns were ordered with engraving, or other special order features.  However, the gun does speak for itself, and we know that it was ordered on the small frame used for the .32-40 and the .38-55 with the special ordered heavy octagon barrel, that it was ordered with Deluxe grade English walnut, factory checkered buttstock and forend, a Lyman Ivory Bead front sight, and factory engraving.  Louis Daniel Nimschke is given credit in Brophy's book for most all of the engraved 1881 rifles, and if you look at the hand of the engraving, it is definitively Nimschke's signature scroll and game scenes.  Only 1785 of these rifles were made in the .32-40 caliber, and only 1303 with pistol grip butt stocks.  Only a tiny handful were factory engraved.  BEST OF ALL---THIS RIFLE IS UNTOUCHED AND RETAINS 45% FADING FACTORY CASE COLOR, 95% FACTORY BLUE, AND MOST ALL OF THE FACTORY WOOD FINISHES!  The factory checkering has never been recut, and the bore is mirror shiny with all of the rifling crisp and clear, the screws are in excellent condition, and there is no pitting inside or out.  There is one tiny split just starting on the left side of the forend wood that is of no consequence.  The mechanics are crisp and excellent in all ways.  A Marlin with identical engraving sold in the December Rock Island auction for $51,750 and appears to have had a replaced forend wood.  We are offering this historic rifle at a very modest price making it a great investment opportunity and fleeting chance to own a piece of history at a bargain price.  DON'T LET THIS ONE GET AWAY!"

Match grade adjustable rear sight. This amazing HK Expert was purchased new by me in 2009. The pistol has had exactly 101 cartridges put through it. (two boxes of 50 by me and the test cartridge in a sealed envelope included with its paperwork.) This gun features a jet funnel, an extended slide release, two hammers for additional configurations and an ambidextrous decocker which also act as a safety, allowing its operator to carry ""cocked-n-locked"" aka 1911 style, allowing this top-of-the-line German pistol to function like standard auto pistols and also like a 1911 platform sidearm. This gun is undoubtedly one of the nicest pistols I have ever fired, a joy to shoot and extremely accurate. HK uses an O ring system around the front of the barrel, which assists in the gun's accuracy, creating slight friction at the front of the slide, which helps eliminate barrel play within the slide. This is currently one of a small handful of HK USP Expert pistols available for sale anywhere. Not only an amazing, high performance German-made pistol but also an extremely collectible choice firearm.Includes:four 16 round OEM/factory LEM (law enforcement military use only ban no longer federally prohibited)Original grey zippered HK caseBlank warranty card, operator's manual, and test cartridge (signed and dated by HK)**No low ball offers, I don’t need to sell, just looking to change up my collection a bit.

A one-piece steel bottom metal adds extra rigidity to the Super Grade’s stock and action for improved accuracy. The super grade’s shadowline cheekpiece is beautifully functional, placing your eye in perfect alignment with the scope. The Model 70 still has the famous 3-position safety which is convenient to operate with the thumb of your firing hand, lifting the firing pin away from the sear. When the safety is in the intermediate or middle position, the action can still be operated, allowing unfired cartridges to be cycled with the safety on. It's smooth to engage and easily identifies the safety status of the rifle. A Blade-Type Ejector gives you full control when ejecting a fired case. If you pull the bolt back slowly, the empty case doesn't fly anywhere, so you can catch it in your hand and the case is not damaged as it hits the ground. If you pull the bolt back quickly, it ejects the cartridge with more force, throwing it well clear of the action. The forged steel receiver starts as a forged from a solid block of steel."

A one-piece steel bottom metal adds extra rigidity to the Super Grade’s stock and action for improved accuracy. The super grade’s shadowline cheekpiece is beautifully functional, placing your eye in perfect alignment with the scope. The Model 70 still has the famous 3-position safety which is convenient to operate with the thumb of your firing hand, lifting the firing pin away from the sear. When the safety is in the intermediate or middle position, the action can still be operated, allowing unfired cartridges to be cycled with the safety on. It's smooth to engage and easily identifies the safety status of the rifle. A Blade-Type Ejector gives you full control when ejecting a fired case. If you pull the bolt back slowly, the empty case doesn't fly anywhere, so you can catch it in your hand and the case is not damaged as it hits the ground. If you pull the bolt back quickly, it ejects the cartridge with more force, throwing it well clear of the action. The forged steel receiver starts as a forged from a solid block of steel."
