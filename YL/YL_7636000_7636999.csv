Stock is in great shape for its age. Rifle shoots very well and feels good. I don't think it's been shot much because the coating on the bolt from the factory has very little wear. This is for the rifle only. Or for the right deal I can throw a Nikon buckmaster 4-12 on top of it. I'm mainly looking to trade. Needing a heavy barrel 22-250 or maybe heavy barrel 243. Friend moved to Wyoming and I'm going up to shoot some prairie dogs so got to run a heavy. Looking at a ruger American predator heavy barrel Remington and maybe a heavy barrel savage. Send me pic of what ya got. REDACTED I have a few more pic I can send also. I would sell it out right 425.00 with a 4-12x40 Nikon on top ready for the field. Rifle shoots .6s at 100 yards have shot several sub moa groups with the rifle using 55gr Winchester black box ammo.

Built originally of carbon steel in either a blued or nickel finish, a stainless version was added in 1983. The stainless version was produced until 1996. The original carbon steel models lasted in general production until 1998. That same year, the stainless model was featured in the famous Microsoft PC game Half Life, which is considered the Python’s first (of many) video game appearance. Such media depictions of the Python have only added to its mythos over the years. The Python is most easily recognized by its vented rib, though many Colt revolvers later used this same feature.

Ammunition engineering necked down the cartridge to accept the .277 and the hi powered flat shooting & extremely accurate 270 cal was born. Who hasn't heard the theory that you have to spend twice as much on your scope as your rifle? Well I didn't have to after doing a lot of research. The fact is that Vortex, Leupold, and the like are all great but grossly overpriced scopes that only charge so much because people continue to pay it. I spent only as much for my Italian made Konuspro scope and it has better technology than any of the fore-mentioned brands. This is an $800.00 2.5-10x52 w/ 30mm tube all aluminum construction w/ parallax wheel that remove parallax from 10 yards to infinity. 1/4"" moa along w/ 550 yard BDC reticle that is duel illuminated in both blue or red at 5 light intensities all adjustable by a singe knob. Depending on dusk or dawn use the red vs blue against varing backgrounds makes all the difference so why haven't you ever heard of this before you might wonder and the answer is because we have all been looking at less research and developement and more expense than the the Italian Inovation of Konus. Too much to list but it has flip up caps, 4 inch screw on sun shade, 3.5 inch eye relief, and awesome pupil & field of view specs etc. all available proir to your purchase. I can text you pics of the illuminated reticle I took with my phone but they only allow 3 pics on here.The 270 is a very long range flat and accurate round great for an array of large game animal hunting. Any calibur will kill if it is placed in the correct kill spot within the appropriate distance but the 270 is one of the 3 calibers I bought for a carefully planned hunt that was coming up for Carribou, Bear, and Moose. The Savage 116 Weather Warrior is a serious outdoors hunting riffle and not to be confused with an entry level weapon. It has a 24"" brushed matte Stainless Steel barrel, synthetic lite weight stock, accu trigger which is fully adjustable without the need of a gunsmith to do it. Bury it in the mud then submerge in water till clean and fire. Weather elements doesn't faze it as it was designed for extreme weather. So many upgrades over the Savage Axis, Axis II, 110, 111, 114 series that came before it. Able's is the only store in the country right now who claims to even have a single one left for sale for $820.00 plus shipping etc. (Savage 17799 116fcss DBM 270 Win There are more than one Weather warrior models so you must compare the model # it'self.) I had a chance to buy 3 weather warriors in .270, 7mm, & 338 win mag. I have installed bi pods on each, and hi end scopes with each specific to its caliber for eye relief etc. These guns never made it to the gun range and have never been fired. Warranty card still in the box never been registered to the end user yet, and stickers and tags still on the gun and hanging from the triger guards. In their original boxes. For anyone who doesn't know about the history and the value of a Savage manufactured rifle do your homework and you will find that it is the best value bar none and the most accurate right out of the box. I have 2 sons and had planned to take them on a hunt this season up in Newfoundland, but had a heart attack that has changed everything. I am selling the .270 with bipod & scope in the original box, new unfired, for $1,388.00, the 7mm for $1,483.00 & the 338 Winchester magnum for $1,593.00 OBO's. I am prepared to take a loss. This is Hundreds under my invested price.If u want any other Konus made scope then just check out this web address and let me know the model #  http://www.konus.com/_upload/_allegato/REDACTED.488_54.usa.compressed.pdf  If your not close by then I will ship to your local FFL dealer and pay the cost for them to transfer the riffle to your name.

Well I didn't have to after doing a lot of research. The fact is that Vortex, Leupold, and the like are all great but grossly overpriced scopes that only charge so much because people continue to pay it. I spent only as much for my Italian made Konuspro scope and it has better technology than any of the fore-mentioned brands. This is a $1200.00 scope 4-16x52 w/ 30mm tube all aluminum constructionw/ bubble level built in the bottom of the reticle (and reticle etched into the first focal plane must read to educate) w/ parallax wheel that remove parallax from 10 yards to infinity. 1/4"" moa along w/ 550 yard BDC reticle that is duel illuminated in both blue or red at 5 light intensities all adjustable by a singe knob. Depending on dusk or dawn use the red vs blue against varing backgrounds makes all the difference so why haven't you ever heard of this before you might wonder and the answer is because we have all been looking at less research and developement and more expense than the the Italian Inovation of Konus. Too much to list but it has flip up caps, 4 inch screw on sun shade, 3.5 inch eye relief, and awesome pupil & field of view specs etc. all available proir to your purchase. I can text you pics of the illuminated reticle I took with my phone but they only allow 3 pics on here. THis gun is also available with an identical scope in 6-24x52 & 8-32x56 with all the previous mentioned options and more for same price or a new 2.5-10x52 for less price. I bought all of these scopes for my own specific idea which to mount them on but they can be mounted on any of the guns to meet your needs. These guns can all shoot to a 1000 yards or more so if you want to take an Elk in Wyoming at 1300 yards then the 338 and the most powerfull fore mentioned scope will make easy work of it with a lot of practice and the right ammo, the 7MM will do well up to 1000 yards with either of the latter mentioned scopes, and the 270 will also make 1000 yards with the correct ammo and scope match. The 7mm Rem Mag is a very long range flat and accurate round great for an array of large game animal hunting. Any calibur will kill if it is placed in the correct kill spot within the appropriate distance but the 7mm is one of the 3 calibers I bought for a carefully planned hunt that was coming up for Carribou, Bear, and Moose. The Savage 116 Weather Warrior is a serious outdoors hunting riffle and not to be confused with an entry level weapon. It has a 24"" brushed matte Stainless Steel barrel, synthetic lite weight stock, accu trigger which is fully adjustable without the need of a gunsmith to do it. Bury it in the mud then submerge in water till clean and fire. Weather elements doesn't faze it as it was designed for extreme weather. So many upgrades over the Savage Axis, Axis II, 110, 111, 114 series that came before it. Able's is the only store in the country right now who claims to even have a single one left for sale for $820.00 plus shipping etc. (Savage 17801 116fcss DBM 7mm Rem Mag There are more than one Weather warrior models so you must compare the model # it'self.) I had a chance to buy 3 weather warriors in .270, 7mm, & 338 win mag. I have installed bi pods on each, and hi end scopes with each specific to its caliber for eye relief etc. These guns never made it to the gun range and have never been fired. Warranty card still in the box never been registered to the end user yet, and stickers and tags still on the gun and hanging from the triger guards. In their original boxes. For anyone who doesn't know about the history and the value of a Savage manufactured rifle do your homework and you will find that it is the best value bar none and the most accurate right out of the box. I have 2 sons and had planned to take them on a hunt this season up in Newfoundland, but had a heart attack that has changed everything. I am selling the 7mm Rem Mag with bipod & scope in the original box, new unfired, for $1,483.00, the .270 for $1,383.00 & the 338 Winchester magnum for $1,593.00 OBO's. I am prepared to take a loss. This is Hundreds under my invested price.

Well I didn't have to after doing a lot of research. The fact is that Vortex, Leupold, and the like are all great but grossly overpriced scopes that only charge so much because people continue to pay it. I spent only as much for my Italian made Konuspro scope and it has better technology than any of the fore-mentioned brands. This is a $1280.00 scope 8-32x56 but can be removed and fitted with 2 other identical scopes in either 4-16x52 or 6-24x52 all w/ 30mm tube all aluminum constructionw/ bubble level built in the bottom of the reticle (and reticle etched into the first focal plane must read to educate if you dont know the difference) w/ parallax wheel that remove parallax from 10 yards to infinity. 1/4"" moa along w/ 550 yard BDC reticle that is duel illuminated in both blue or red at 5 light intensities all adjustable by a singe knob. Depending on dusk or dawn use the red vs blue against varing backgrounds makes all the difference so why haven't you ever heard of this before you might wonder and the answer is because we have all been looking at less research and developement and more expense than the the Italian Inovation of Konus. Too much to list but it has flip up caps, 4 inch screw on sun shade, 3.5 inch eye relief, and awesome pupil & field of view specs etc. all available proir to your purchase. I can text you pics of the illuminated reticle I took with my phone but they only allow 3 pics on here. I have 4 new scopes and 3 new guns for sale as you will see as you read on. I bought all of these scopes but they can be mounted on any of the guns to meet your needs. These guns can all shoot to a 1000 yards or more so if you want to take an Elk in Wyoming at 1300 yards then the 338 and the most powerfull fore mentioned scope will make easy work of it with a lot of practice and the right ammo, the 7MM will do well up to 1000 yards with either of the latter mentioned scopes, and the 270 will also make 1000 yards with the correct ammo and scope match. The 338 Win Mag is a very long range flat and accurate round great for an array of large game animal hunting. Any calibur will kill if it is placed in the correct kill spot within the appropriate distance but the 7mm is one of the 3 calibers I bought for a carefully planned hunt that was coming up for Carribou, Bear, and Moose. The Savage 116 Weather Warrior is a serious outdoors hunting riffle and not to be confused with an entry level weapon. It has a 24"" brushed matte Stainless Steel barrel, synthetic lite weight stock, accu trigger which is fully adjustable without the need of a gunsmith to do it. Bury it in the mud then submerge in water till clean and fire. Weather elements doesn't faze it as it was designed for extreme weather. So many upgrades over the Savage Axis, Axis II, 110, 111, 114 series that came before it. Able's is the only store in the country right now who claims to even have a single one left for sale for $820.00 plus shipping etc. (Savage 17803 116fcss DBM 388 Win Mag There are more than one Weather warrior models so you must compare the model # it'self.) I had a chance to buy 3 weather warriors in .270, 7mm, & 338 win mag. I have installed bi pods on each, and hi end scopes with each specific to its caliber for eye relief etc. These guns never made it to the gun range and have never been fired. Warranty card still in the box never been registered to the end user yet, and stickers and tags still on the gun and hanging from the triger guards. In their original boxes. For anyone who doesn't know about the history and the value of a Savage manufactured rifle do your homework and you will find that it is the best value bar none and the most accurate right out of the box. I have 2 sons and had planned to take them on a hunt this season up in Newfoundland, but had a heart attack that has changed everything. I am selling the 7mm Rem Mag with bipod & scope in the original box, new unfired, for $1,483.00, the .270 for $1,383.00 & the 338 Winchester Magnum for $1,593.00 OBO's. Depending on which gun and which scope we can adjust the price as you pick your package. I am prepared to take a loss. This is Hundreds under my invested price. THE .270 & 1 SCOPE HAS BEEN SOLD!
