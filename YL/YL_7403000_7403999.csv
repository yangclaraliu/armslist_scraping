This rifle is in Mint condition and has seen less than 75rds. The scope is a perfect fit and it is currently zeroed at 100 yards. This thing is a damn tack driver out to 450 yards with a .243 caliber. (That's the furthest I've been deadly accurate 9/10 within 12 inches) Hits at 500 but only about 3/10. So, I think it's more of a user error at that point. LOL There are guys on YouTube going out to 1500 yards with this. At 100 yards, lol. You couldnt find anything more accurate. Dime sized groupings when I'm shooting well. This rifle is far better and more capable than what I am. The bolt is typical of a Sako rifle, butter smooth. Comes with 1 factory 5 Rd. Magazine, bipod attached, Leupold Vx1 3-9*40, box of 20 rounds, butlee Creek flip covers and the scope is sitting on the best mount possible Warne mount. Also you'll notice a 2nd scope and that one is for sale separately or if you'd rather have it vs. the one on it. It is a Leupold VX-2 2-7×32. I've used it on this rifle and it's an awesome deer hunting scope or assault rifle. The price if this scope was the exact same of the other so the price doesn't change should you opt for the 2-7 In total I've got a little over 825 in this rifle, of course because I purchased everything new. I need to sell this TODAY."

Bolt remains open after last round is fired. If magazine and chamber are both loaded, opening action will result in ejecting shell from chamber and cycling new shell from magazine into the chamber. If operator desires to unload the chamber only, slightly push lifter up and open action. This cuts the magazine off from cycling a new shell while unloading the chamber. Chamber will remain closed though.   Safety: The primary safety is located on the backside of the trigger guard. When engaged, the safety is designed to block the trigger, hammer lever and the hammer which makes the firing mechanism immobile.   Magazine: Tubular magazine; bottom loading. Shot plug is included and comes installed. Shot plug is easily removable by unscrewing the magazine cap. Simply pull plug out and replace magazine cap."

It’s only 10.2 oz! – I can run down the street with this in my pocket in gym shorts and hardly notice it! Made my wife and I feel very secure going shipping around town. Unfortunately, we are moving to AL where it’s illegal to carry concealed – I don’t want this to collect dust in my closet and have my children reach it.I have only sent 100 rounds down the gun – so it’s still very new. I do carry this everyday – it’s easy, it’s like not having my cell phone when I leave the house, so because of this it looks a little dirtier than the pictures show. We can meet at Bass Pro shop – so you can range test it or at Frontier Justice if you like. No FFL needed as long as you are a MO resident, but willing to meet at a local FFL dealer if you want this transferred into your name at your cost.Everything in the pictures come with – case, ear plugs, (2) mags, almost 200 rounds, gun key lock, and two different carrying holsters – one for the hip and the other is one that goes in a pocketCall or text Carl 816-469-331 zero"

Most are NIB and a couple are LNIB. Check other armslist ads for what I have. Next up is my LNIB Les Baer 1911 Premier II .45 acp. Comes with soft case, two mags, two sets of grips with one being rubberized gold pony stamped target grips. Every gun collector should have at least one Custom Gun in their stable of guns. Les Baer's Premier II© has become the industry standard to which all other factory or custom built 1911s are compared. The 5"" long Government Model (pictured ) is the best single stack duty, defense or competition pistol you'll find in America …. the best quality, the best value and the best performance. No wonder so many of them show up at IPSC Limited Class matches. The Premier II© is even guaranteed to shoot 3"" groups at 50 yards! That means that 99% of them will be closer to 1.5” groups at 50 yards in a ransom rest. The Premier II© has become the flagship of Les Baer's 1911 line of pistols. It performs like a million bucks, but it costs a whole lot less than Wilson Combat, Nighthawk, Ed Brown etc. I can say that unequivocally, because I have owned all 1911's just mentioned. This Premier II will out shoot all of them. Features include: Baer NM steel frame, NM slide and NM barrel with stainless bushing • Slide fitted to frame • Double serrated slide • Low mount LCB adjustable sight with hidden rear leaf • Baer dovetail front sight • Lowered and flared ejection port • Tuned and polished extractor • Baer extended ejector • Baer checkered slide stop• Baer speed trigger with crisp 4 lb pull • Baer deluxe Commander hammer and sear • Baer beavertail grip safety with pad • Flat serrated mainspring housing • Beveled mag well • Polished feed ramp and throated barrel • Baer extended ambidextrous safety • High checkered front strap @ 30 lpi • Pistol tuned for total reliability • Baer Premium Checkered grips • Blued finish • (2) 8-round premium magazines. If you are looking at adding a Custom 1911 to your collection, then this is the gun for you. Check out Les Baer's web site. Go to Les Baer web site and see what you have to pay ordering from him + shipping + FFL dealer transfer fee. My price for a LNIB Les Baer Premier II is only $1795 CASH or higher value for trades. Specifications: Caliber: .45 acp Frame: Steel. Sights: 3-dot contrast. Barrel Length: 5.00.” Length: 8.7.” Weight: 41.6 oz. with magazine. Capacity: 8+1. I have other gun's that are either NIB or LNIB in .45 acp. 40 S&W and 9 mm for sale as well, let me know what you are looking for? I have a beautiful two tone NIB and un-fired KRISS-SPHYNIX 9 mm with threaded barrel end for $950, if anyone is interested. I am a private gun owner, and just selling off a few, (No Fire Sale Here, but you will save some money.) I only own and have purchased quality firearms. Because of osteoarthritis many of my guns have never been fired. Better make your BUYS now, before congress shuts down private transfers of guns, through web sites like this. “It's coming.” I Will require a “Bill Of Sale” and proof of Alabama residency (AL. DL) to anyone of legal age, on all firearms that I sell."

The WML-HSP attaches to any properly Mil-Specced 1913 Picatinny Rail, but when mounted on the Haley Strategic Throntail Offset Mount, built by Impact Weapons Components, the light sits at 45 degree offset position, ideal for weapons manipulation ergonomics.  Disruptive Grey Cerakote:  Joint Force Enterprises and Haley Strategic co-developed a custom grey tone Cerakote finish for The Jack called ""Disruptive Grey"".

Many considered the CZ 75 at the time of its introduction to be the greatest double-column-magazine 9mm pistol in the world. With the slide riding inside the frame, there is a very tight fit between the two, which contributes to its impressive accuracy. The high-quality carbon-steel slide has been trimmed down on the sides to give the pistol the more angular look of the original Desert Eagle. This also has the added benefit of reducing the pistol’s weight and creating a thinner profile. The effect is significantly more pronounced on the polymerframed version, which has itself been given a matching angular design. From the front, the look is almost triangular. The slide also features a matte black oxide finish, Novak-style three-dot sights and an ambidextrous decocker/ safety lever with a teardrop shape for ease of use. This allows the operator to safely lower the Commander-style hammer from the single-action to the double-action position while also engaging the hammer-block safety mechanism. The pistol also features an internal firing pin safety mechanism. The trigger itself has also been redesigned for a smoother and more comfortable pull, which has been set at 12 pounds for double action and a crisp 4 pounds in single action. If you are looking to ad a .45 acp to your gun collection and like having DA/SA with a de-cocker and a 10+1 ammo capacity, then this is the one for you. Only $525 NIB. Built like an Israeli tank with deadly accuracy. I have other gun's that are either NIB or LNIB in .45 acp. 40 S&W and 9 mm for sale as well, let me know what you are looking for? I have a beautiful two tone NIB and un-fired KRISS-SPHYNIX 9 mm with threaded barrel end for $950 if anyone is interested. I am a private gun owner, and just selling off a few, (No Fire Sale Here, but you will save some money.) I only own and have purchased quality firearms. Because of osteoarthritis many of my guns have never been fired. Better make your BUYS now, before congress shuts down private transfers of guns, through web sites like this. “It's coming.” I Will require a “Bill Of Sale” and proof of Alabama residency (AL.

It's a Savage 10 FCP-SR chambered in .308. It has a threaded barrel and has been dropped into an MDT LSS Chassis. It has the MDT stock extension and a Magpul MOE Fixed Stock and a Hogue Grip with battery storage. It also has an Atlas bipod knock-off that's actually decent. It has an Accutrigger and this gun was sub MOA out of the box with the accustock. When I put it in this chassis I was able to get it down to .4 with a Vortex Viper scope (already sold). This gun is incredible and it's in perfect condition. It has only one problem. MDT made the  Chassis tolerances a little tight and there's a spot that is hindering the bolt release lever. So the bolt is not removable without taking it out of the stock. Two options for fixing this are grind or mill the spot out a couple of millimeters or get MDT to replace it. I've had two gunsmiths look at it (one who is the among best in the hill country) and that was their suggestion. Other than that the gun is flawless, shoots insanely tight groups, little recoil, suppressor ready and looks bad ass. This package cost me $1,250 before taxes and shipping on all the parts. So you couldn't this for under $1340 something. I'm selling cheap for quick turn and because of the small problem with the Chassis."

Has a ghost 3.5# connector installed and will include original parts as well.  I also added a ""Don't Tread on me"" slide plate.  It's a little blurry in pic 3 since the focus is the front sight but you get the idea.  $60+ in after market parts and will include all the originals as well.Gun will come with 1 10round magazine and thats it for accessories.  Great gun, great shooter but I need to thin the G17 herd a bit.Final price drop to $400, if it doesn't sell I still have room in the safe.Face to face in Woburn area of MA, must have LTC, all laws followed.  If you want an FFL, I will pay the cost at Precision Point Firearms in Woburn.  Shipping is an option as well if needed but I'd need to validate price and add it to the $400"
