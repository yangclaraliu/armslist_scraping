It featues the same 4"" stainless steel barrel, stainless steel slide, 11 round .40 cal. 40S&W double stack magazine, and Novak Lo-Mount 3 white dot sights except the chassis is hi-tech aluminum alloy. It was a big hit with law enforcement and this is a former duty pistol manufactured 9/23/2002. As you can see the finish is good even though there are a few signs of holster wear on the right side, normal for a duty pistol which is carried a lot and shot little. The grips are like new and the internals are spotless showing little wear. The laser engraving and accessory rail are often worn on these but excellent on this pistol. The TSW (Tactical Support Weapon) features thicker full length frame rails for enhanced accuracy and delayed unlocking to reduce felt recoil. Even though the 40 S&W round is known for snappy recoil, I found this pistol to be a highly controllable soft shooter for accurate follow up shots and comfortable fun at the range.  The .40 S&W cartridge was developed by Winchester and Smith & Wesson in an effort to to create a round with knock down power similar to the FBI 10mm round (also .40 cal.) but with a shorter case which would facilitate accuracy and allow use of a smaller, more comfortable grip frame. As a result the .40 S&W became the cartridge of choice for law enforcement agencies.The action is called Traditional Double Action (TDA) which describes a longer 1st shot trigger pull which cocks the hammer, and single action short, crisp, and light trigger pull on subsequent shots. An ambidextrous safety / decocker is featured for convenience and ultimate safety.This pistol is extremely CLEAN, well maintained, and scarce in this condition. It comes with 2 S&W factory 11 round magazines in excellent condition in a Smith & Wesson plastic case including an instruction manual, gun lock, wax wrap and paperwork it came with new.
Please email  or call / text Bill 813 . 857 . 8287 for more info or pictures. I'm willing to meet anywhere in the bay area to show this fine pistol."

Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/cold-steel-trench-hawk-black-90pthz/ Trench Hawk Description  The Trench Hawk by Cold Steel is a tactical tomahawk that features a drop forged from 5150 carbon steel and differentially hardened, the head will withstand tremendous blows and the awful stress of continued throwing. The Trench Hawk's cutting edge and spike also provide a big tactical advantage, as either can be used for hooking or trapping and its length can be used to parry or block an incoming blow. The polypropylene handle of the Trench Hawk is also highly resistant to shock and impact and will withstand abuse that would easily break even a tough hickory handle. Finally, to help protect its owner from its cutting edge and dangerously sharp spike, it comes with a Secure- Ex sheath.   Specifications:  - Overall Length: 19""  - Blade length: 3.5""  - Head Material: 1055 Carbon Steel  - Handle Material: Polypropylene  - Sheath: Secure-Ex Sheath  - Weight: 24 oz"

You will be paying the same price as a normal Glock 26 with a value of $770 with the gun and all the extra parts!! This my loss your gain!! Deals like this are hard to find!!

The Cold Steel version, the Axe Gang Hatchet, is an authentically formidable weapon, not just a prop for the cameras. It features a drop-forged head, with a differential heat treatment (hard edge-soft body), and a straight, four inch cutting edge (with sharp corners). In addition to that it has a straight grain American Hickory handle with the Kanji characters that mean “Axe Gang”. The sharp corners of the edge will easily pierce the thickest skull and the razor sharp edge will shear through flesh and bone like it was white bread. Plus due to its substantial weight and straight handle, it’s easy to throw with great accuracy and is sure to explode any target with the most violent effect.

Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/cold-steel-war-hammer-90wha/ War Hammer Description Weighing a little over 21/2″ lbs., the War Hammer is highly maneuverable and can be easily wielded with one or both hands. The head is drop forged out of 1055 steel and differentially heat treated. This means the point of the spike and enormous hammer face (11/2″ x 11/2″) are fully hardened so they can pierce and crush tough materials without failing while the rest of the hammer is left soft to absorb the shock of heavy blows. The handle of the War Hammer has been designed to be equally tough. Made of straight grain American Hickory and measuring 30″ long it provides tremendous leverage so enormously powerful blows may be struck. To protect the handle from assault by an opponent armed with an edged weapon included is a pair of sturdy steel langets which can be attached below the head with the screws provided. (Some assembly is required. Instructions are included). Specifications: – Weight: 39.8 oz– Overall Length: 30″– Handle: Straight Grain Hickory with Langets– Hammer Face: 1 1/2″ x 1 1/2″– Head Width: 7 3/8″– Steel: Drop Forged 1055 Carbon"
