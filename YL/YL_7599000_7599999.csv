Its cold-hammer forged heavy barrel is 16.5"" in length, chrome-lined, and threaded in a standard 14x1 left hand thread pattern. The cartridge chamber, gas cylinder and bolt-support rod are also chrome-lined for extended life and reduced wear. With two locking lugs, this is the most durable and accurate AK you are going to find. A scope rail is mounted on the left side of the receiver. The barrel is topped with a removable muzzle brake, which also serves to protect the barrel threading. This gun is compatible with most in-spec hi-capacity AK magazines and drums.

The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate. The Hogue Two panel rubber grips are anatomically formed, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired. The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged. Construction Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.
 
The Mark XIX Desert Eagle pistol offers true interchangeability. Three different pistols are available in .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, or .50 Action Express, each with a 6"" or 10"" barrel. Purchase one pistol and you have the platform to build the other five with a simple switch of components. Made in the USA."

It starts easily, runs strong, and drives great. It is an automatic transmission, 4 door sedan. Everything works - all the lights and signals, dash gauges, etc. The car has hot heat, and cold a/c. It has an aftermarket stereo with CD/MP3/AUX/USB/etc. Great speakers all around, sounds nice. The car is very reliable and has no issues mechanically. It has a few cosmetic blemishes, such as a spot of candy in the backseat, a little staining on the driver's seat, and a dent above the rear passenger's side wheel that I took a close up picture of. The least attractive part is the missing piece in the dash. It is a thin piece of plastic above the radio, which was broken when a thief stole the last stereo deck. They sell this piece on eBay for $60. I leave the owner's manual there so it's not an eyesore. Other than that, the car is in good condition, and needs nothing to be a solid, reliable vehicle. It has a very large trunk space, with a stow away jack and full size spare. The tag is out, but I have a clean, green, lien free, Oklahoma title, in hand and ready to go!Mostly looking for AR's, AK's, and ammo such as 54r, 223, 556, 7.62x39, 9mm, etc. I would also like a tavor, scar, and scorpion evo.

I bought these for one of my builds and decided to I wanted a Burris 1-8 XTR instead. The AR-536 was only on the rifle for about 100 roudns and the FastFire was never even installed on the AR. It saw some very light use on my Ruger 22/45 pistol and then taken off when I decided to sell it. Selling as a set only. The set sells for $480 on Amazon. $300 oboREDACTED

The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.
Let's start by talking about the durability and reliability of the Glock 27.  Glocks are famous for just these two things.  These are some of the reasons that they have been so trusted by military and law enforcement around the globe.  Have I actually put one in the mud and then shot it? No, I can't say that I have,  but I can tell you however that the testing of these handguns is quite extensive. 
Personally, I have seen this gun shoot anything and everything that is put in it, with not one malfunction.  This is the most reliable gun that I personally have used and that is why I trust it with my life."
