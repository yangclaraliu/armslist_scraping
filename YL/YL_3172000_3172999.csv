The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

31,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3172031,For Sale:   Bravo Company’s KeyMod™ Rail 13” BCM-KMR13,"Kennesaw, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 249,"Listed On: Friday, June 13, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"BCM KMR-13

 Bravo Company’s KeyMod™ Rail, 13”

Manufactured from an exclusive blended aluminum and magnesium alloy, it weighs 30-40% less than aluminum with the same strength properties. Also featuring a proprietary patent pending mounting, indexing and lock up system that mitigates 12:00 rail movement under heat generated from the barrel nut.

 Handguard alone weighs 5.5oz!

 Mounting hardware, 2.2oz, for a total of 7.7oz on a very long 13” rail.

 The KMR’s propriety finish was originally developed for the Aerospace industry. It is a plasma deposition process which creates a stabilized ceramic-like surface coating with superior wear resistance when compared to anodize or even hard chrome. The stabilized nature of the coating means it has a higher corrosion resistance as well, due to the lack of ‘pores’ in the surface.

 The KeyMod™ interface system was developed by Eric Kincel (now the Director of BCMs' product development team) to work in parallel with the current picatinny system. In many applications it will advance modularity past the current 1913 rail system.

 The BCM KMR also allows for a larger range of modularity offering 4 different offset mounting positions between traditional 3,6,9, and 12:00 positions.

 In the most basic of applications the KeyMod™ system allows for universal modularity between various manufacturers of accessories, and accessory rails. A big win for the trigger puller. As the industry advances the modular accessories will mount directly to the KeyMod™ instead of picatinny, allowing for a lighter, cleaner, and less bulky weapon system."

The 24/7 pistol features an injection molded polymer frame with stainless steel slide. The PT 24/7 pistols share several safety innovations with other Taurus product lines, including a positive firing pin block as well as the 'Taurus Safety Latch', a transfer bar safety which prevents firing of the pistol unless the trigger is pulled. Together these safeties assure that the pistol will not fire if it is accidentally dropped; selected models have been certified as satisfying the California drop safety requirement. All 24/7 models also include a frame-mounted manual safety lever, and are equipped with an integrated firearm locking safety system, which Taurus calls the ‘Taurus Security System' (TSS).[3] 24/7 pistols are also equipped with a visible/tactile loaded chamber indicator and a dust cover. Decocker is built into the safety. Push the safety lever all the way up to decock the pistol. Picatinny accessory rail integration system, allowing for the attachment of accessories such as laser sights or tactical lights. Three-dot hifgh contrast sights. Handling characteristics of 24/7 pistols are enhanced by features such as an ambidextrous decocking lever and ergonometric design which Taurus calls 'Memory pads', consisting of various grooves which promote proper consistent hand placement for superior handling control. In addition, a secure grasp of the pistol grip is afforded by a high adhesion gripping surface.

Bought it several years ago used, shot it often and alot.  Never misfired, failed to fire, failed to eject/load etc.  Cleaned well after every outing.  Locking block broke about 500 rds ago (replaced with Beretta 92fs locking block).  There is finish wear of course, but barrel still looks great.

The reason I am selling so cheap is because I managed to lose 2 grip screw bushings and cannot find replacements anywhere.  Beretta 92 grip screw bushings will fit as well, but I am just tired of looking, and have other handguns to shoot anyways.  The handgun is still fireable, but the grip is only secured with one screw on each side rather than two.

102,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3172102,For Sale/Trade:  Camo for your weapons,"240/sunnylane, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 0,"Listed On: Friday, June 13, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Are you wanting to camo out your rifle or pistol? Are you just wanting some color or accents done? I can do it for you and make it look however you want. I specialize in military style camo and can do basic blending that matches the environment around here. I can do digi, desert, urban, tiger stripping, ect. Ten years of marine corps infantry including instructing camouflage at ocs in Quantico VA has given me the skills to match just about any environment. I can do pretty much anything you need done. Deer binds, tree stands, you name it and I'll camo or paint it. I don't have set prices because I will work with your budget and also the work you are wanting done. Some of the camo takes a lot longer and is more tedious than others so please keep that in mind.  I spend normally about 5-10 hours on most jobs.  Some can take longer such as the digi.  Pistols generally are less due to the size.  I am painting/airbrushing, not dipping so don't be confused and any work I do is removable if you choose. I'll take your old paint off for a fee if you want to change or remove completely. I can make some samples upon request of patterns if you want to see what you will be getting before I start any work. If you have been looking to camo your weapons, hunting items, or whatever just hit me up. I am much cheaper than having them dipped and my stuff can be changed if you do wish to do so. 

I CAN DO DURACOATING. If you want duracoat, I will need a deposit up front because the materials must be ordered and takes 3-5 business days to arrive. I will not pay out of pocket for materials for the duracoat, although I do not charge for the labor until the weapon is finished and you approve. If you want the duracoat, go to the website and look around at what you want. I only charge a deposit of the materials that you wish to order. (plus shipping) 
This does take slightly longer than normal due to the shipping.

Some examples of what patterns I can do: (these can be done with duracoat or airbrushing if you want cheaper prices)
Multicam (the current camo the army is wearing in Afghanistan) 
MarPat digital
Desert Digital
Army/ACU camo
Vietnam era tiger strip 
zebra/ leopard print (any animal print for the most part)
skulls, spider web, (working on zombie stuff so that will be available soon)
snakeskin 
Urban (digi, tiger striping, or normal patterns)

I can do most items you may want done such as:
Rifle cases
Pelican Cases
ammo cans
animal skulls
scopes and other optics
Deer blinds/tree stands
anything you want, I can usually work with, just ask!

These are just the common ones I can do, I am constantly working on new patterns and ideas so if you don't see one that you are interested in give me some thoughts on what you would like. I can pretty much do whatever you want done. Think about it like a tattoo for your weapon (or any items like ammo cans, tool boxes, boats). I can also do those patterns in any color scheme you want. For example the urban pattern with red like the spetznas wore. I can also do a detailed cleaning on your weapons for additional fee. I spent a decade scrubbing m16s, SAWs, M9, ect and know how to get it inspection ready. I can take even the dirtiest AR and make it brand new. (no chemicals or power tools just elbow grease and an AP brush) Text or call anytime but text works faster for me. I am 100% Disabled Vet and do not work FYI so I can spend a great deal of time getting your weapon back to you fairly quick. Semper Fi

IF you don't have ammo or cash to throw in, I am probably willing to trade one 30-06 for one AK47. For both rifles I'd need more than just one AK and a little ammo. Just looking for a fair deal for both of us. Just let me know what you have in mind. I'm often negotiable.

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. P30 and P30S models available in 9 mm and .40 S&W. Key Features: Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Multiple trigger firing modes available Patented HK recoil reduction system One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel Corrosion resistant “hostile environment” blued finish Ambidextrous slide levers and Ambidextrous magazine release magazine Patented lock-out safety device Bobbed hammer (LEM models) Spurred hammer (DA/SA models) Automatic hammer and firing pin safeties Ambidextrous safety levers (P30S model)"

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines..

491,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3172491,For Sale:  .22 LR ammo,"south side, greenwood, whiteland, franklin, Indianapolis, Indiana",FREE,"Listed On: Saturday, June 14, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Not trying to advertise for Gander Mountain but I recently saw a scam in action.  As scarce as ammo has been, there are groups of old dudes that have a ring leader.  Every Friday morning/Thursday night, GM gets loads of .22 ammo. The good stuff. CCI mini mags, CCI Blazers, CCI Stingers, Federal target and small game ammo.  I recently got there an hour early to see these guys in line to get in the store(since youre only allowed one brick), and the ring leader had all his elves buying up all the ammo so he could go to the flea market and jack the prices up ohhh, I would say 400% or so.  So if you need .22 ammo at regular prices, be at GM in Greenwood about an hour before they open and you can get regular prices on the quality .22 ammo that everyone deserves.  I'm blowing the whistle on this guy because it's a load of crap.  He told me he had several thousand bricks in his basement and garage. About as much as he could store and fit. That really hit me the wrong way. So I'm just telling everyone. Friiday mornings, be there an hour before they open and you can get what you're looking for.  Thanks for reading."

Emergency Vehicle Code3 48in police/fire/rescue/towing Lightbar

I have for sale a Code 3 48in model 360 high end emergency vehicle lightbar. I bought it a few years ago to use on my search & rescue vehicle, but I never got around to it & am no longer with SAR, so with bills coming due I thought I would see if anyone locally could put it to good use. It just needs a new power cord (not a big deal; when removed from previous vehicle & sold by the police department, they cut the power cords on all for easy removal; could easily be spliced or replaced for not much.

Currently has red & blue lenses as was used on a police command vehicle, but can easily be swapped out for blue, red, amber, green, clear, purple, etc. Or can be used as is, would make a great prop, attention getter, decoration, etc. Extremely bright, one of the reasons this model is so expensive is because it has a sophisticated array of high end lights built in, from take downs & arrows, strobes, etc. The perfect lightbar for your emergency vehicle! Also great for construction, roadside assistance, police, law enforcement, towing, security, ambulances, ems, fire, search & rescue, disaster relief, snow plows, etc.

It comes with 4 metal GI mags that have new springs & magpul followers, 200 rds fmj ammo, a nifty discrete violin type hard carry case, extended take down pins (so no tool is necessary to push out the pins to disassemble the rifle), It has a fixed A2 type carry handle and A2 type flash hider, and polymer lower receiver made by Frontier Armory.  I have no idea of the total round count.  I have had the upper for over 10 years and the lower for approximate 4 years but have never fired it.  I have no idea who made the bolt carrier.  I do not have a cell phone and I have no way to send pictures (no camera). I know that may seem odd but i am old and just don't care.  I am not desperate to sell it.  I am NOT interested in any trades.  I will only sell fact to face because I want the buyer to be happy.  I live near Asheboro NC."

Steiner Military/Tactical 4-16x50mm
Part# 5416
G2 Mil-Dot Reticle 

Key Features:
Versatile range of power
Developed in coordination with Special Forces and international weapons specialists
Waterproof
Shockproof
Fogproof
First Focal Plane reticle
Illuminated Reticle - 11 intensity settings
Fully multi-coated optics
5 mil of windage adjustments in either direction
19.5 mil of elevation adjustment
Audible click adjustments
Parallax adjustable
Accepts standard sunshades, ARDs, etc.
34mm tube

The 4x-16x-50mm is a versatile choice for most tactical operations. At 4x magnification, it provides a wider field of view for quicker target acquisition, while at 16x power this scope is extremely well- suited for long-range target engagement. 

These scopes feature 34mm tubes and 19.5 mils of elevation and 5 mils of windage adjustment, a specially designed illuminated, front focal plane G2 Mil Dot reticle and side mounted parallax/focus adjustment. Fully multi-coated optics increase contrast and edge to edge clarity for maximum visual acuity. 

The windage and elevation knobs are designed for precise adjustment. The dials are calibrated so that 1 click = 0.1 mRAD. The windage knob, located on the right side of the tube, is calibrated for up to 5 mils of adjustment for both left and right adjustment. All adjustments are indicated by detents and audible clicks and hard stops at both ends of the adjustment range prevent shooters from getting lost on the dial. 

For shooting at extreme distances, the elevation knob offers up to 19.5 mils and two revolutions of adjustment. The first revolution or 100 clicks are indicated by white scale on the knob. On the second revolution (101 to 195), a small elevation Rotation Indicator pops out at the base of the turret to remind the shooter to use the second scale indicated by grey numbers on the dial. 

Parallax adjustment is located on the left side of the scope, letting the shooter make adjustments without removing his eye from the scope. These scopes also feature a large eye box for more comfortable viewing and faster target recovery after the shot. This turret also houses rotary illumination switch for the reticle. The switch has 11 intensity levels and a battery saver position in between each level. There are ""Off"" positions at the minimum and maximum ranges. Each level also has a detent to prevent unintended changes during use. 

Like all Steiner optics, they are waterproof, fogproof and shockproof."

These rounds are much cheaper than standard 9mm Lugers. I have upgraded the Recoil and firing springs from Wolff Springs on the gun to make it have way less recoil effect and to eliminate the hard trigger pull that these guns are known for stock. Comes with some bullets in a bag and a carry case with one clip. Personally i have shot about 100 rounds through the gun and fires perfectly and is kept cleaned and lubed. There will be no more imported P64 makarovs because they ran out of supply for good so the value of this pistol will greatly increase over the years to come. Since i bought this gun 2 years ago the value has gone up 100 percent and rising

Scope is not included at the $750 price, but can be purchased seperately if wanted. Decent bushnell trophy. Not a Leupold, but does the trick. I can round up some 223 shells cheap for the buyer if wanted.

The gun is very accurate and once you get it ""tuned"" in to the load you are shooting, it is surprisingly accurate. Beautiful gun, gets compliments everytime I've taken it anywhere. Less than 200 rounds and it shows. Stated in manual and on net by Ruger, only meant to fire .223's.

I'd like it out of my kitchen ;) Make me an offer. I'm updating the kitchen.
It's very very clean inside, and I just put a $48 Water Filter on it week before last, your good for 3 months at least.
I'm the original owner. We paid $2300 for this one.
The door dispenser isn't working right. It's not a big deal, the price reflects this.
You can still get all the filtered ice cold water you want, just no ice etc.
