I'm not an expect on these, but everything else appears to be Savage if I remember correctly even the wood has some markings on them. The stock does seem loose and it either needs shims or a good BLO treatment. I can provide more pictures of whatever you'd like. Also included in the sale is a genuine British issue sling and a Savage marked bayonet (not stamped with same serial as rifle unfortunately). I can also throw in a few stripper clips if needed.

Leica Geovid 10x42  

The 42mm model combines the functions ""viewing"" and ""measuring"" not only in optical and electronic perfection - their handiness also allows for ease of use in any situation. 

The 10-40X variable magnification guarantees a steady image. The combination of 125 m (368 ft) field of view and precise distance metering makes the 10 x 42 a compact, all-around companion. 

A LEICA GEOVID BRF will accompany you through thick and thin. The housing is made of cast aluminum, not only to reduce weight but also for its special robustness. It is filled with nitrogen to eliminate fogging-up of the lenses. The precise processing typical for Leica guarantees that a LEICA GEOVID BRF-Y remains fully operational even during inclement weather conditions - even down to five meters deep in water (16.5 ft). Its folding lines and the ergonomic design make the Geovid extraordinarily compact and space-saving. The way it fits in your hand is a feature that you will continue to notice, even after many ventures out in the field.

$400 firm in cash.  Any trades would need to be a really good deal for me to consider at this time.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and Exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, another firearm, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I do not need anything in trade right now, but will trade if it makes sense on my end.  If you offer something of less value and do not mention adding cash or other to the deal, I will assume you want a straight trade and pass.  Same on your end, if you have something of higher value let me know what you are looking for on top.    

Below I listed a handful I do not have yet and would not mind owning, but also listed are ones I would not mind having more of and will consider if the deal makes sense, so feel free to offer as I like a bit of everything.

FN SCAR 16 and 17 or AR uppers (or completer rifles) in .450 Bushmaster, maybe .50 Beowulf, would like to try H&K USP or prefer larger like the Tactical or Expert models, that's about all I would not mind trying right now.

Semi-auto rifles, AR, AK, Saiga, PSL, FAL, AR-10, AR-15 and variants.

Semi-auto pistols or revolvers in .357 mag & .44 mag.

Maybe bolt-guns in the common calibers, or quality higher power range optics.

Maybe ammo in the popular calibers to help make a deal happen, but not going to give retail value as I do not need any.

Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do make trips to Arlington and Lewisville area on occasion.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed."

This revolver is one made during World War 2 original as part of the Lend Lease Program the US had with Great Britain. Those revolvers were chambered in .38 S&W , but once the US entered the war and needed weapons for their armed services S&W began producing them in .38 Special since it was more popular in the US. This is one of the later war productions originally chambered in .38 Special, not one of the .38 S&W ones sent to GB and then rechambered after the war to be sold in the US as surplus. The grips are original the era, but aren't the grips serial numbered to the revolver. The lanyard is a reproduction one that I had purchased and installed because I liked the look and wanted it to be more correct. I've had this revolver for several years, having purchased it at a gun show, and lately my interests have hone to other areas so I'd like to sell it to someone who will appreciate it more than I am doing currently. Also included in the sale is 70 rounds of ammunition (majority are reloads I got from a friend after he sold his revolver), one speed loader, a manual, and a soft pistol case. I can send more pictures if you'd like, since armslist only let's you do three and I want to be as honest and fair about this as possible.

•	1750 (yes, one thousand seven hundred and fifty)+ .223 Remington brass that was professionally (on a commercial machine/device) cleaned, full length sized, trimmed and even flared.  The brass is mixed headstamped and much of it was new, not once fired.  This brass is PERFECT!  They are also already PRIMED!  This brass IS READY TO LOAD!  CONSERVATIVELY worth $400 (Check on-line or at gunbroker)

•	Approximately 50 reusable white cardboard reloader ammo storage boxes with Styrofoam inserts (see pic).  These are perfect for storing ammo after loaded.  $40

The total that I paid for all of these items is over $1700.  I would like to sell it all as a package but may sell certain items individually.  I will delete the items sold from the listing if I am offered a fair price (approx half of what I paid for it $850).  I would entertain BEST offers for everything!  I may be interested in trades (especially AR uppers or AR related items).  What do you have?  I’m not desperate to sell any of this, so please don’t waste either of our time with ridiculous offers.  Contact me any time via text, phone or e-mail (text or e-mail is preferred).  I live in Nixa and have a relatively flexible schedule.  I apologize for the poor pic of the press.

Powerful 8,000 watt continuous rating
Impressive 13,500 watt surge rating

Convenient flip up handles and wheel kit for portability.  Push button electric start and backup pull starter provides 2 ways to start this generator.

This engine is specifically designed for heavy duty generator use, and it is designed to last 3 to 5 times longer than the typical generator engine.

Compare the specs of this generator with newer units available now.  The large generator head and powerful engine can surge up to 13,500 watts on this unit, with the continuous rating of 8,000 watts.  You will be hard pressed to find a current generator rated at 8,000 watts continuous with such a large surge rating.

Top speed for a stock 1984 is about 74mph, stock 1985 is about 80mph, and stock 1986 is about 83mph. The small difference between speeds could be made up by a more experienced rider. Well that's not the only difference I guess because the owners of the 85/86 models are asking twice as much, if not more for that extra speed!

The CM4043 has the same external dimensions as the PM4043, which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM4043 is chambered in a .40 S&W caliber, has a 3.1"" barrel and an overall length of 5.47"", with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models include: the CM4043 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; and finally, the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines. The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols. The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses. Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today: - The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. - Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design. - Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols. Caliber: .40 S&W Capacity: 5+1 Operation: Trigger cocking DAO; lock breech; ""Browning - type"" recoil lug; passive striker block; no magazine disconnect Barrel: 3.0"", conventional rifling; 1 - 16 right-hand twist Length O/A: 5.47"" Height: 4.0"" Slide Width: .94"" Weight: Pistol 15.8 ounces, Magazine 1.9 ounces Grips: Textured polymer Sights: Drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight, pinned in polymer front sight Finish: Black polymer frame, matte stainless steel slide Magazine: 1 - 5 rd flush floorplate"

I don't know much about it since my grandpa died before I was old enough to really ask him much about this.  It has a wood stock that covers everything except the top of the barrel.  It has a brass hilt, brass trigger guard, and brass end piece at the barrel end.  The cleaning rod is present.  There is a little bit of rust developing on the barrel.  The left side plate is plain brass and the right side plate where the hammer is located looks like it is maybe steel since it has a flat patina color to it with no rust.  The etched design is very beautiful. The top of the barrel is marked ""SPAIN"" with a serial number of 023525 and by the serial number it looks like it says ""IIIKAR"", but I am not sure what that means.  I have no idea who made it or when.  I think I am going to list this as ""make an offer"" and keep it listed for maybe a week and see what offers I get while I try and research it some more.  If anyone has any idea exactly what I have please let me know.  This muzzle loader has been a big mystery to me for the last 20 years and I can't find any info on it.  It may be junk or it may not.    I need the space in my safe, and I am not into muzzle loaders so it needs to go to a good home.  You can email me at REDACTED
*****I've had some users email me with some info that seems to be right and I am going to post what they said below:
It's a spanish-made replica of a Tower pistol. Probably .45 cal. The company name is Eibar-they made the barrel.

$250 is way too much. More in the $75 - $100 range though the barrel shows rust on the surface.

There might be import marks under the barrel but you would need to remove it. See if you can find the calibre. I am sure it's probably .45. Should also be stamped 'black powder only.'

From the website: 

Authentic Look of Old West - Modern Function 

All of the western gear I make is based on originals from the 19th century. Making my own patterns has allowed me to duplicate the styles and designs of cowboy gear that were once popular on the western frontier. Many of my dyes I mix myself to more closely resemble the colors that were used “back then.” I also use the same construction techniques that the saddle makers used 120 years ago. All of this ensures that my product is as authentic as I can make it. 

I only use the same western hardware that was available during the 19th century that is still made the same way today. My buckles are made either of solid brass or are nickel plated brass. The rivets I use are either “tube” rivets or copper bur rivets. 
Cowboy Action Holsters 

Back in “the day,” cowboy holsters were designed to keep the gun in the holster regardless of weather, bouncing around on horseback etc. To accomplish this, the old holsters were generally made of thinner leather which ""clung"" to the gun. However, Cowboy Action Shooters want the gun to come out of the holster as quickly as possible, which means that the holster has to be made of thicker leather to hold its shape after the gun is removed. Although thicker leather works better, the edge doesn’t look the same. 
My solution is to make the holster out of thicker leather, which holds its shape well so you can remove and replace the gun quickly; but I thin the leather at the edges to give the holster the same look as the originals."

Gun has had about 200 rounds through the barrel, so still in nearly new condition, cleaned thoroughly after every range visit. Upgrades include a new Mainspring housing to eliminate the ILS, an Ed Brown competition mainspring, Wilson Combat Bulletproof sear spring, Wilson Combat A2 Bulletproof sear, an STI Titanium Hammer Strut, a Harrison Design and Consulting long black trigger, and a Wilson Combat full length guide rod and also a set of VZ Operator Grips. Also purchased Wilson Combat ETM Mags for it. None of these upgrades are in the photo below as I haven't gotten a chance to take a new photo yet and will get some this evening when I get home. Can throw in ammo for the right price, have plenty of 9mm to add to a deal.

If you believe my asking price is too high for a used Range Officer, feel free to do the math on all of the additions that are included in that price point and you'll find that I have invested a little over $1,150 easily into this gun. Please keep that in mind if making an offer as well. Thanks."

All numbers match. Looks Arsenal new, inside and out. Please note the splice at the rear of the stock or the toe. This is not an arsenal repair, but was done to allow the use of smaller stock blanks to conserve material during WWII. The stock was arsenal refitted during WWII, and is the sole factor determining that this model 1891 rifle is an Ex-Dragoon and not a Dragoon 1891 Mosin Nagant. With the condition of the rifle approaching 100%, I don't have a clue as to why it got a new stock during the war, but it did.

This ammo does not contain gunpowder; it relies on the primer charge to propel the 20 grain bullet. Not for use in semi-autos. This ammo makes less noise than many pellet rifles! Great for pest control at close range or for areas where you don't want to annoy your neighbors. I had a few requests to ship this ammo, but it's for local sale only. I have to drive over an hour to get to the shipping hub so it's not worth it for me for what this ammo is worth. Text me for a cash price if you're interested but can't trade. Evidently, some loser who flags all .22 ammo on Armslist got my listing removed last time because he's angry over the current prices of .22 ammo. I'm in the Cedar Creek area of Greeneville.

All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action.

The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more."
