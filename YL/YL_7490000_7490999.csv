This was the carry gun for a police officer for many years and appears to be a typical ""carried, not shot much"" police gun. The finish shows a small bit of holster wear and has a scratch on the right hand side of the frame near the grip (see pictures) but is otherwise pretty solid. Timing and lock-up are rock solid and the trigger is long and smooth in double action mode with a crisp, light trigger in single action mode. All the mechanicals of this gun are in excellent shape. The gun comes with its original hammer, which is stock, and a second hammer which was bobbed for conceal carry. It also comes with a DeSantis Sof-Tuck holster for IWB conceal carry. The holster fits the gun well and draws smoothly. Additional photos here: https://imgur.com/a/HqAdmI like this gun but have decided to go with something in 9mm for CCW and am running out of room in my safe, so I'm putting it up for sale. Buyers must be within 15 miles of Ann Arbor and have a CPL."

Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. INOX version.* Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.* Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.* Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling  and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.* Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.* External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.* Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.* Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.* Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so its either positively on or off . The safety lever also functions as the pistols decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop."

Only shot about 10 times to sight in. Still original strings. No blemishes or marks what's so ever. Mint condition. QAD drop rest, Trophy Ridge 1 prong sight, soft case, release, and premium arrows with field tips included. Nothing wrong with the bow. Wanted to get into bow hunting but just don't have the time. This bow is 34 inches so it is for a tall person. Well over $1200.00 in this bow and accessories. Serious inquiries only. Asking $800.00. Want a picture? Just ask.
See below for full details on bow:
The Super-Deluxe, slightly bigger brother of the Arena 30, the new Arena 34 adds four inches to the axle-to-axle length but still retains a 6.5"" brace height sweet spot for an insane level of speed, comfort and forgiveness. Bar none, this one stands to become the premier choice of ground hunters and 3D shooters who've long known exactly what balances out a truly perfect hunting bow. At only 4 pounds, think light. But not so light it compromises noise, shock or vibration. Again, it's all about perfect balance. Now check the technology when compared to the price. Pretty obvious that one's so weighted in your favor it borders on the unfair.
