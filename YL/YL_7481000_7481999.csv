Within its noticeably slim profile, the Mod.2 FDE offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension magazine, all while being just two tenths of an inch wider than the slimmest single stack polymer-frame pistol available. From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD Mod.2 .45ACP Sub-Compact FDE is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package, making it a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry. And of course, GripZone ergonomics set this pistol apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Springfield Mod.2 on target round after round. When you pick up the XD Mod.2 45 Sub-Compact FDE, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, youâ€™ll probably find that youâ€™ve got a new favorite to carry. Springfield XD Mod.2 45 FDE Features  GripZone: the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact 45 FDE applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. The GripZone is a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. Fiber Optic Front Sight: Achieve easier and faster target acquisition with the fiber optic front sight. Low Profile Extended Rear Sight: The rear sight on the Mod.2 FDE is low profile, snag free, and holster friendly. Posi-Wedge Serrations: A more pronounced rear serration makes racking the slide effortless. Slimmer Slide and Frame: The Mod.2 FDE has a slimmer slide for concealability and more comfortable carry. The Mod.2 45 Flat Dark Earth frame has been re-contoured, a slimmer frame adds up to a more natural grip. High-Hand Beavertail: Higher hand positioning toward the barrelâ€™s bore axis reduces felt recoil when firing. High-Hand Grip Relief: Works in unison with the High-Hand Beavertail to reduce felt recoil  Manufacturer: Springfield Armory   Model: XD Mod.2 45 Sub-Compact Flat Dark Earth Part Number: XDG9845FDEHC Caliber: 45 Auto Capacity: 9+1 Rounds / 13+1 Rounds with X-Tensionâ„¢ Grip Width: 1.20â€ Weight: 26oz with Empty Mag / 27oz with X-Tensionâ„¢ Length: 6.5â€ Height: 4.75â€ / 5.5â€ W/X-Tensionâ„¢ Barrel: 3.3â€ Hammer Forged Slide: Forged Steel Frame: Flat Dark Earth Polymer Finish: Melonite Magazines: 1 Stainless Steel Flush Magazine and 1 Full-Sized with X-Tension"

RCBS lube/sizer .431 for 44 special/mag (forgot this one earlier) $27.00Total value $1738.00 in equipment.......BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!!599.5 pounds lead that I mined off of the pistol berms at Cascade Shooting Facility in Ravensdale. This lead is what I was using to cast bullets, and it runs a consistent 12.5 hardness by the Lee hardness tester listed above. 12.5 is the hardness Elmer Keith used to make his reputation over 5 decades of shooting. It runs just fine with that lube and any fouling comes right out of the barrel with just a few brush strokes and a good bore jag, unlike so-called ""hardcast"" which can take severe measures to get out. This lead has been smelted down into biscuits (cupcake size), that run 2 pounds or a little more each. Photo is the one with six buckets.196.5 pounds pure lead. This is lead I got from job sites that came in sheets. We were putting up lead backed drywall for x-ray rooms. Would be great for muzzleloaders or cap and ball pistols. It's also in biscuits. Photo is the one with two buckets.27.5 pounds pure Linotype. I got this in a big bar like they used in newspaper printing years ago. I broke up the bar and poured it into biscuits running about 1 pound each. Photo is the one with the single white bucket.Total amount of lead 824 pounds. That's 5,768,000 grains of lead, or enough to cast 46,516 (124 grain) 9mm bullets, 32,044 (180 grain) 40 S&W bullets, or 23,072 (250 grain) 44 magnum Keith bullets. Just to give you an idea.....Lead runs $2 a pound. $1648.00 value. Total for all this at any store that had it all would be $3,359.00 and that's BEFORE tax. I'll let it all go for $2,400.00. That's a $950 dollar discount, even before they tax the piss out of you and slap on the extra $350 bucks in this commie state. I would consider selling all the lead in one shot for $1250.00, or all the gear for $1300.00. I might do a partial deal on lead or gear, I just don't want to be selling 10 pound here and thirty pounds there. I'm getting rid of this stuff because I flat don't have time for it, so I don't have time to be trucking small batches of stuff all over bejesus either, you guys understand I'm sure. Also have a bunch of cast bullets (from these molds) in 9mm, 38/357, 44, and 45-70 and a bunch of casting safety gear (gloves, face shield, leather apron, arm sleeves) that I'll throw in for free, along with a Lyman Cast Bullet Handbook (4th edition), and a copy of ""From Ingot to Target"" by Glen Fryxell (best casting manual there is).BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!!I forgot to add my smelting setup when I wrote this ad. You get a Lodge brand cast iron kettle (not to be used for food ever again obviously), a big 50,000 BTU burner stand, my screen that I used to get the raw material off the berms, muffin tins for casting (also not ever to be used for food), and assorted tools for skimming dross, and pouring lead.With all this stuff, you can effectively become your own bullet supplier, never having to worry about paying for bullets again. To give you an idea, your cost to shoot even a full house 44 magnum with a two foot long muzzle flash is a little under 6 (six) cents per shot. A 45-70 bear stopper load (440 gr bullet running 1750 fps) would run you about a dime. Compare that to buying Bufflalo Bore ammo at what they're charging.this site won't let me post attachments. if you'd like to see photos, just PM me your email and ill send some over.."

Manufactured by Pack Rifle in Utah, this ultra-light weight rifle is a single shot .22 LR survival and camping rifle. The rifle breaks down into two separate pieces in less than 2 seconds to eject and reload spent cartridges and for ease of carry in even a small daypack. The receiver, and most other parts are machined from high strength aluminum.  Most wear parts and fasteners are constructed of stainless steel. The barrel is a precision button rifled, Cro-Moly liner with a carbon fiber composite outer. Carbon fiber is also used for the butt stock tube of the rifle. This construction makes the Pack-Rifle both weather resistant and the lightest rifle out there. I personally did a camouflage paint job on the rifle and made a kydex sheath for the rifle so it doesn’t get banged around too much in a pack. I have put about 100 rounds total through the rifle. I purchased the rifle from the company for $425 + tax. 
This rifle also comes with a very small 4x20 air rifle scope and mount which helps considerably with the accuracy and shooting past 30 yards. It also comes with a small fishing reel attachment system with collapsible rod extensions contained in the buttstock tube. When the rifle is broken down into its two separate parts you can use the rear half as a fishing pole. It is actually really cool to use and a nice piece of creative design. All of these accessories were designed and purchased from the company. The cost for the scope and mount was $70 + tax and the fishing rod/reel set was $90 + tax from the company.
It is a great little set up and if you are a lightweight camping/hiking enthusiast then this rifle is worth looking into. I am getting rid of it because I have stopped hiking and I am hoping another hiker and small game hunter would like to purchase it. I have attached links to a YouTube video for the rifle and accessories and if you Google Pack Rifle you can view the exact specs. I am asking for $400 for the rifle and accessories and the buyer will need to pay for the FFL fee. If you are in the Denver Metro area I will drive to meet you at just about any gun shop you like in order to do the FFL transfer.

Unless the trade is pretty beneficial to me I would prefer to sell.First is an MP9c, I don't know why these are hard to find locally. It was the first one I had seen and it is awesome. If you only wanted one handgun and you didn't want a Glock 19, this could be it. This one I bought used with almost no feed ramp scratches. I have fired it about 250 times with no issues or failures. It isn't a perfect new gun, but it would be perfect for someone who will actually carry it. LEO price on a new one is still over $415, this one does not have a box or the accompanying materials like the back straps or fired casing. It comes with one 12 round magazine. You can buy a fully kitted out SW case that is specific to this gun for under $50.00 on eBay. So I would like $325.00 and If you can live without the other stuff you get a great deal on a pretty cool handgun. Shield has SOLD.Also available are two good quality name brand EDC knives. I have never carried them as I bought them as part of a collection. I helped the collector who is one of my best friends choose the knives and saw them weekly until he decided he wanted to collect other things. I ended up with over twenty knives that had been put on a shelf and never carried. These are the last two I am willing to sell. Benchmade 300sn FDE - Nice flipper in Mint condition.  Sells new for around $150.00, but the first $100.00 cash takes it.Combative Edge Sr11 Titanium frame-lock. FDE and it's literally showroom new. I can't find any marks on the knife and it has been oiled once monthly since it was bought. These are discontinued and getting pretty rare. If you want new and never owned it will go for around $250.00, Only one on eBay, which is the black and is in the same never carried, never sharpened condition as this one. It is going for $150.00. So I would like $125.00 If you want both knives I would take $200 cash to move them down the road. If you want everything, knives and pistol, you can probably get away for $500.00 firm. If you buy everything I'll throw in 100 rounds of 9mm ammo and a magazine of hollow-points.If you're interested shoot me a text at Eight50/two seven 4/seven seven seven zero or email me using the Armslist system. Calls are fine if you text me your name and number first, otherwise, it probably won't be answered. Have a great day and thanks for looking."
