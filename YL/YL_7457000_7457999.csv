Very solid built gun and looks very similar to a 9mm MP5. Shoots great. The suppressor is fake, it covers a thin barrel underneath to meet ATF requirements. This is the second one of these I've owned and I enjoy shooting them. I am looking a bolt action. 22 of equal value."

You will probably not see any of these at your local gun store or at your local gun range. As you can see in the pics this is the two tone olive green with threaded barrel, with the protector nut screwed on. Comes complete with back straps, two mags and factory case, cleaning kit and loader. The SPHINX SDP Compact Alpha is a duty-sized pistol that can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the de-cocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box. This is the closest you can get to a CUSTOM manufactured gun without the CUSTOM manufactured price. My price on this beautiful NIB gun is $950. If you are looking for a premium 9mm without breaking the bank with a custom made pistol, then you need to carefully look at this gun. I have other gun's that are either NIB or LNIB in .45 acp. 40 S&W and 9 mm for sale as well, let me know what you are looking for? I am a private gun owner, and just selling off a few, but don't have to sell any of them. “I'll run out of time before I run out of money,” so please no low ball offers, it's just a waste of time and effort. Better make your BUYS now, before congress shuts down private transfers of guns, through web sites like this.Kriss-Sp"

It does have a discreet Century import marking as well.I have not done any ""Bubba"" work on this, so it is as originally purchased. The stock is in remarkable condition for its age, showing just a few dings, as well as some flaking of the varnish used by the Soviets on their stocks. Some of the Mosin-Nagants imported in later years were in more rustic shape, but this one is very nice. You will also get many accessories with the gun and all are in great shape. These include a bayonet, a period-correct leather and canvas sling, an oil/solvent bottle, ammunition pouches and a canvas tool bag with all the tools.
I also have 220 rounds of 7.62x54R Soviet ammo that I will sell for an additional $90 (about 41 cents a round). These are the original copper washed rounds manufactured by Soviet bloc countries and that came in spam cans -- these rounds work well in the Mosin and in my opinion are better than the plain steel commercial rounds that can be hard to extract.
Face to face sale to MN resident. Must have PTP or PTC and sign a bill of sale. I would be willing to travel (within reason - i.e. southern Metro, Rochester, Mankato) to meet a serious buyer. Reply via e-mail. I will remove this ad when sold.

This is an AA Arms Pistol, model AP-9, manufactured from 1991 until 2001 in Indian Trail, North Carolina. It is a direct descendant and copy of the notorious Intratec KG-9 from the late 1970s. This was, to the best of our knowledge, the final clone of the KG-9. The KG-9 stirred up some action and warnings from the BATF, an agency that has always been more patient than many of us give them credit for, because that pistol fired from an open bolt. The KG-99 and this pistol, the AP-9, will release the sear from a bolt position that is only about halfway open. While the Intratecs had aluminum alloy lower frames, this one has a rough textured polymer lower frame. It is more ornage than its predecessor, with larger sights and a grooved muzzle barrel instead of a threaded barrel. Weight empty is about 3 1/2 pounds. Barrel length is 5 inches, and the included magazine holds 35 rounds"".You can research these all day long and find used ones for sale, this one my friends is brand new in the box !    The value on the 9mm in cash is $420  I am looking to trade the weapon for a rifle ,  xp100 ,  possible shotguns or handguns depending on what they are.
