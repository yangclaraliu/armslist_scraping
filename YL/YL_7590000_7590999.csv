Pistol grip safety and 3.) Manual lever safety.It also has a detachable Walnut wooden butt stock that has a built in magazine loader.A true one of kind opportunity to own an extremely rare weapon in preban '82 open bolt semi-auto configuration! It is a very uncommon and rather odd firearm resembling a Thompson submachine gun.This rare weapon turns up every so often in the hands of dedicated open bolt collectors.The original Fox Carbine open bolt assault carbine was manufactured by TRI-C, Inc. in Manchester, Connecticut for only two short years in 1974-1976 due to a fire that completely destroyed the factory in April 1976In 1977, the rights were sold to Dean Machine Products Incorporated (DEMRO PRODUCTS INCORPORATED) in Manchester, Connecticut.DEMRO continued to produce and sell these firearms until the early 1980's only because the BATF made a ruling in 1982 that all semi-automatic open-bolt weapons weretoo easily and readily convertible to full automatic fire. Therefore, such weapons manufactured after the date of this ruling are classed and controlled as fully automatic weapons;(weapons manufactured prior to the ruling are grandfathered and are still considered semi-automatic).This weapon is considered semi-auto only and is legal to own in most states. This rifle can switch between 9mm and 45acp IF you have the 45acp barrel,bolt and mag well insert I do not have the 45acp barrel,bolt or magwell insert.My rifle comes with 3 sten mags. One mag has problems, probably a weak spring, other mags work perfectly.I am asking $800 cash or best offer or trade."

These are a little hard to come by because of the ban; I bought it in 2014 from Classic Firearms. I have put a few hundred rounds through it (not quite 500) and I have never had any feeding issues from any of the magazines or the rifle itself. It eats through any ammo you give it, and it is very accurate. It was my first rifle that I bought and I did my best to take very good care of it (cleaned it after every use). It is very fun to shoot, has virtually no recoil (probably due to the weight), and I made sure to set it up over the years for any type of use from self-defense to hunting. It comes as seen with gun bag, 6 magazines, and about 200 rounds of ammo. If you want more detailed pictures I am more than happy to provide them.Parts list below: - 7.62x39mm caliber- Izhmash manufactured receiver- 16"" Hammer Forged, Chrome-Lined Barrel- Comes with 6-30 round magazines - 1 Tapco, 2 Romanian Steel Surplus, and 3 Russian Steel Surplus- Adjustable Rear Ghost Ring and Front Tritium night sight (I was able to hit 6"" diameter targets at 300 yards using these sights).- Collapsible Tapco T-6 ""BLACK"" stock with sling attachment point. - Stamped steel receiver with black finish.- Tapco trigger (has about a 3 lb pull).- Hogue's rubber Overmolded grip- Chaos Saiga Rifle AK Titan hinged dust cover rail. - Carolina Saiga/VEPR Rifle Tactical Billet Quad-Rail.- Modified muzzle - I removed some of the muzzel cap (the job was clean) and threaded 14x1 LH threads. - Phantom Flash Hider.$1200.00 FIRM // You cover shipping and any fees for shipping out of state."
