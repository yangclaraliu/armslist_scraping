Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/aquamira-waterbasics-water-storage-kit-60-gallons-with-filter-67260/ Emergency Water Storage Kit w/Filter60galRED-II-120 Description: The WaterBasics Emergency Water Storage Kit with Filter is a new and innovative approach to the age old problem of storing water. Forget the bulky, and cumbersome ridged plastic containers that are difficult to move, fill and dispense. Now you can have emergency water storage available in minutes, with a system that you can store under the bed. Simply open up the package, insert the stiffener pack and Liner, and fill on the spot. WaterBasics even provides all the fittings necessary to connect and fill your system from any hose spout, or faucet. Two layers of containment means that you can store water without worries about leaks or spills. The Kit also includes the WaterBasics pump and RED Line filter for easy dispensing and the peace of mind that comes from the ultimate RED Line level of protection. With 120 gallons of water filtration capacity, the RED Line filter can supply an entire family, or small group with fresh clean filtered water. The pump is easy to operate, tucks neatly away inside the container when not in use, and includes a shut-off valve, Series II Filter connection and a directional nozzle for accurate, spill free filling of containers. Because the WaterBasics Emergency Water Storage Kit is so easy to transport and set up it is perfect for home emergency water storage, base camps, family camping, small groups etc. WaterBasics unique Double Containment, Collapsible Container assures a positive leak free seal, easy to access water, and the ability to “pack it away” when not in use. The Liner is constructed of double wall food grade LDPE that is BPA and phthalate free, it will not add taste or odor to the water and maintains a positive seal. The outer shell is constructed of the same super tough materials as rubber rafts, and has welded seams to assure strength and provide a water tight second layer of containment. The patent pending spout fitting allows you to connect to the water using the retractable hose provided in the kit. Everything fits snugly inside the shell for easy storage and access when needed. WaterBasics RED Line Filters with Mixed Media Filtration Technology are designed to take advantage of a unique combination of the most advanced filtration materials and media science available today. Using a patent pending filter design and manufacturing method, Aquamira engineers have created a multi-stage filtration system that incorporates the power of electropositive charge differential to “pull” particles as small as viruses out of the water stream while still maintaining high flow. This technology has been thoroughly tested and proven effective by independent laboratories to consistently remove protozoan cysts, bacteria, and virus to ANSI/NSF Standard 53, and US EPA standards without the need for cumbersome “back-flushing” requirements or disinfecting chemicals such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The WaterBasics RED Line filter provides the absorptive capability required to remove harmful chemical and environmental contaminants, bad tastes and odors, to ANSI/NSF Standard 42 requirements, and has been tested and proven effective in removing Cyanotoxins such as Microcystin and other biotoxins. WaterBasics Series II filters connect easily to any WaterBasics water bottle cap, storage or filtration kits and pump. They also connect easily to most standard water storage containers. Fewer fittings means one filter is all you need Made in USA Features: – RED Line Virus Filter with up to 500 ml/minute flow rate– Miraguard Antimicrobial Technology suppresses the growth of bacteria, algae, fungus, mold and mildew within the filter medias– Filters 120 gallons– Easy to transport so you can take the ability to store water with you– Ideal for Emergency Water Storage– Space-saving design works well in apartments and small homes (approximately 25 in³)– BPA free, chemical free, and iodine free– Perfect For: Apartments and Homes Emergency Preparedness Disaster Evacuation Travel and RV Specifications: – Accepts: WaterBasics Series 11 GRN Line Emergency Filter WaterBasics Series 11 RED Line Emergency Filter"

Common with bring back Mauser K98's from what Ive read. This rifle retains all of its war eagle stamps on barrel, receiver and bolt end. Rarer to find Taper down barrel from what I read. I assume this rifle to be at stock 7.97X57 8mm mauser caliber as the barrel is not marked with caliber. Cannot verify this, so new owner will need to verify caliber with a gun smith (before firing). Semi verified this chamber to be 8mm with appropriate 8mm snap cap round (selling this rifle for a friend of the fam who has limited knowledge of rifles, sorry for the lack of info) rifle condition is nice. blue is around 95%, bore is shiny. wood stock shows a little wear here and there, a few nips around rear sling stud area (see pics) but generally nice for its age. It is assumed this rifle was sporterized in the late 50's early 60's by age of stock pad. Overall a very nice ww2 era K98 sporter that can be hunted. Rifle was scoped with a junker tasco and used yearly on Dear hunts according to pictures I saw. removed scope myself, (will include original weaver scope bases with rifle.) Was definitively this Vets cherished Hunting weapon! ask questions? see pics. pretty vintage piece! Im not an FFL holder, so make sure your FFL is fine taking in a weapon from a private individual.

The innovative new XPL coated lenses gives you “Xtra Protective Lens” coating that protects you lenses from moisture, oil, dirt and smudges. The super-fast side parallax focus makes certain you have the clearest image in the world when it matters most. The ultra-strong one-piece tube is hammer-forged from an aircraft aluminum alloy for more strength than standard aluminum, multi-piece scope tubes.
