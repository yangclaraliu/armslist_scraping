The rifle is in excellent working order with less than 500 factory brass-cased rounds through it, and would likely be sold by a dealer as LNIB condition. I am a member of Copper Star indoor shooting range in Camp Verde (http://copperstarisr.com), and prospective buyer will be able to test fire the weapon prior to purchasing provided they bring their own ammo.

Although I would prefer a face to face deal with a local Arizona resident, I would also ship to a buyer's FFL using my local FFL after payment clears, or would be willing to use my FFL as escrow if buyer is willing to pay the associated fees. Please note that it is buyerâs responsibility to confirm the rifle is legal to own in their City & State of residence.

At this time I am unwilling to âpart outâ the rifle, and full or partial trades will be considered for Colt/S&W/Dan Wesson Revolvers or Remington/Savage action Benchrest rifles ONLY

166,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3011166,For Sale/Trade:  Spanish FR-8 .308;  $450 OBO or trade,"Charlottesville, VA, Virginia, United States",$ 450,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 6, 2014",Rifles,no type,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"The FR-8 is a spanish bolt action 7.62x51 / 308. It was the last military bolt action they fielded before moving to the CETME. The FR-8 has the distinction of having a front end design that mimics a semiaauto, with what appears to be a gas tube below the flash hider. The ""gas tube"" was in fact a storage tube for a cleaning kit. Mine is, I believe, a 1946 rifle. It is very accurate. I am only selling or trading it because I bought it to hunt with and as a backup SHTF rifle but there is no way to put a scope on it without altering it and that seems like a travesty. 

     The rifle is all original wood, no alterations or modifications. There is apparently an argument about whether or not to use  308 hunting loads in this rifle. I can say that this rifle was built on the famous Mauser action, and I shot at least twenty rounds of 308 (remington core-lok to be precise) through it before I even heard about the argument. A that point, my response was ""meh"" and I kept shooting whatever I wanted through it. I've shot about 50-60 rounds through it, a combination of civilian and military ball, with no problems."

I have 3 Benchmades and 2 Spydercos that I'm looking to get rid of. All knives have original packaging. 

The Benchmades are:

-Benchmade Griptilian SHOT Show 2013 Limited Edition. Black & red G10 scales with red anodized aluminum backspacers. Blade steel is CPM-M4 and is coated black. Limited edition number 48 of 750. I never carried, used, or sharpened it. Overall condition 10/10. $200

-Benchmade Apparition model 672. Black G10 scales with a plain edge D2 blade. Kind of unique, it comes with a torx wrench so you can convert it from assisted opening to a manual folder. Discontinued. Carried for a few weeks and sharpened once, never saw hard use. Most, if not all, of the wear is on the pocket clip. Overall 9/10. $100

-Benchmade Auto Bedlam. Black sculpted G10 scales with a combo edge 154CM blade, which is coated black. It is a side opening automatic. Carried briefly for a couple days, but decided it's pretty large for pocket carry. Never resharpened. Very light wear marks on the spine of the blade from being in my pocket. Overall 9/10. $200

The Spydercos:

-Spyderco Persian 2. Black G10 scales with a plain edge VG10 blade. I carried this one for a couple months, mainly cut boxes with it. Has been resharpened a couple of times. Minor handling marks on the scales and light wear on the pocket clip. Overall 8/10. $90

-Spyderco Navaja. Black carbon fiber scales with stainless bolsters. Carried for under a month, no hard use. Resharpened once. Plain edge blade in CPM-S30V. Has a ""ratcheting"" mechanism at the pivot so it makes a unique noise when opening and closing. Keys in my pocket had scuffed up one of the bolsters, and that's pretty much the only area with any wear. Overall 8/10. $110

$550 takes the whole lot

Elite Special Forces units including Delta are allowed to ""pick"" the weapon they wish to utilize for a specific mission so long as they can justify their decision. Numerous operators still request this 7.62mm/.308 platform for it's known ability to incapacitate vs the 5.56/.223."

Comes with Magpul PRSÂ® Precision-Adjustable Stock in olive drab. this stock alone lists at $255 on Magpul.com.  From the website: ""The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) â AR10/SR25 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock especially designed for the longer charging handle throw of 7.62 NATO platforms. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage.""

This came out of an auction. He repainted it and made it look awesome. This is a genuine Mosler that a bank stored cash in. It has a Fort Knox sticker for looks but is actually a Mosler. Comes with a genuine unpickable Mosler high security lock key and is ready to be screwed to your floor. This doesn't have the issues commonly found with complex vault gears and mechanisms. It's just a basic solid steel case with basic solid steel lock. Wanted it because I had the ones with gears and couldn't get the door open. This will actually keep people out unlike the cheap safes on the market. It's comical how many put their valuables in those ""value"" safes which usually cost more than i'm selling this for. Has an active bolt and bolt on opposite side to hold the door solid even if hinges were torched off. Would make an awesome gun safe or other place to stash valuables. Can be hidden easily. This safe is solid steel and heavy. Moving and must sell all extras otherwise would not part with this gem. I will deliver to your front door for an additional fee. The dimensions for the safe are 20/18/20 L/W/H."

Love it, i already knew i would but after firing her she won my heart AND soul. but seriously, right out of the box i fired around 120 rds everything was super smooth. and that trigger reset is a dream come true and the chevron compensator really reduces muzzle climb especially when firing controlled pairs. the only think i replaced was the grip for a Houge rubberized. if you got the extra money don't waste your time with another AK

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

Diemaco got bought out by Colt and became Colt Canada a few years ago. Colt covered down on a few of its mil/le contracts by supplementing with diemaco uppers. The forge stamps show anchor Harvey and diemaco. Took me awhile googling to figure it out. I figure this upper was for either a c8 sfw, or the c8ct. Both are heavybarrel, hhammer forged 16 inchers. Rifle now has vtac rails, cmc trigger, Harris bipod, millet 16 power scope, and a few other odds and ends. Pretty cool, kinda rare. Only way you would be able to tell the difference between this, and an American Colt upper is the forge stamps, and the barrel."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano is extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nanoâs magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nanoâs sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

There is some slight wear of the paint on the grip, near the trigger, and some by the bottom of the magwell, and stock... All purely cosmetic of course... There are no dings dents or scratches underneath the camo paint, I baby my guns  

I have taken it to the range only TWICE since assembling this rifle... I do not know the exact round count, but I am absolutely positive that it is less than 400 rounds!

More than four hundred distinct models of handguns and longarms of muzzle and breech loading designs together with thousands of variations and subtypes are included in this phenomenal accomplishment. Percussion black powder classics such as the Walker and Dragoon models, 1860 Army and 1861 Navy. The most famous revolver ever, the 1873 Single Action Army (or Peacemaker) that signaled Coltâs move into the metallic-cartridge era. The Model 1911 Automatic Pistol that still defines the standard for modern day .45 semiautomatic pistols. The Python, often referred to as the Rolls Royce of double action revolvers

The circumference of the SF receiver is reduced at the rear, or ""backstrap"", which will appeal to shooters with smaller hands and offer increased comfort and control to all. The GLOCK 30 in the legendary .45 caliber offers excellent out-of-the- box precision paired with the ballistic quality of a genuine big-bore caliber. The smooth design and the simple operation of the GLOCK pistol allow quick drawing of the pistol.

You were running late to meet up with your friends and ended up parking a lot further than anticipated. Now it's after 0200 a.m. and you find yourself walking along a dark, isolated streetâ¦and now your situation is about to get hairy. This is a scenario that plays itself out more than ever with financial times as tough as they have been in decades. Like countless military, law enforcement, and concealed carry aficionados I carry a GLOCK for just such an occasion. GLOCK is used by law enforcement and security personal world wide as well as here in the USA because of their rugged dependability and combat reliability. In fact when it comes to iconic firearms GLOCK is at the top of any list because of their innovation and quality components that GLOCK is world famous for. No other firearm is relied on more than a GLOCK for defense and duty use. Pick up a GLOCK 17, 21, 22, 31 for duty use; GLOCK 19, 23, 32, 30 for duty and carry, or GLOCK 26, 27, 33, 36 for deep concealment. 

Designed for professionals, the GLOCK 17, in 9x19, is the most widely used law enforcement pistol worldwide. Because of its unsurpassed reliability, above-average magazine capacity of 17 rounds in the standard magazine, and its low weight, it is trusted by law enforcement officers around the globe. With our revolutionary ""Safe Action"" trigger system, the G17 9x19 pistol is safe, easy, and quick-just what you need in high-pressure situations.

The GLOCK 26, often referred to as the ""baby GLOCK,"" has created a true and practical auto pistol alternative to the standard five shot snub nose revolver.

Barrel is a custom barrel, Rock Creek blank turned by compass lake engineering. It is 5R rifling and melonited, 1:8 twist 16 inch in length medium profile strait contour with a modified wylde chambering. (wylde chambering is a chambering design that allows you to shoot 5.56 or .223 out of the same chamber, the modified wylde chamber I had custom made in this barrel is a more accurate specification of the wylde chamber) This barrel is .75 MOA garanteed though I've been able to get some .5 MOA groups with it.

Rainier Arms XTC compensator (two small scuffs from installation) 
Samson Evolution handgaurds 15"", brand new (one tiny little ding down near the clamp screws on the bottom towards the receiver end.) 
Magpul AFG 
Fenix TK-15 weapon light with 45 degree mount brand new 
Palmetto State armory BCG, well used but runs find no abnormal wear or issues. 
BCM gunfighter charging handle brand new, ran it about 50 times I'd say total since it was installed. 
Stag Upper parts kit 

Would like to sell locally so I don't have to ship, this upper is basically brand new, its had about 75 rounds sent through it since it was built, turns out I just can't afford to shoot it and need money for a wedding. It doesn't have a scratch on it, it's essentially brand new out of the box. 

I love this upper and hate to see it go but I just don't shoot it and need the money. Will entertain offers on non local buys. 

Asking $700 for the complete upper. Upper is complete and ready to bolt onto any lower."

This is the first rifle to enter the US market which combines the handling and reliability of a military-style design, while also presenting the shooter with all the elements of a modern sporting rifle platform. Because the MK22 is manufactured completely with metal parts, it not only exceeds all requirements for durability, but feels like a centerfire weapon even though it is chambered in the economical .22 LR cartridge. The rifle comes standard with front and rear folding sights, along with Picatinny rail mounts that will accommodate all lighting, aiming, and gripping accessories.
