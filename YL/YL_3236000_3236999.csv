I paid $600 for the gun (used) and have put well over another $300 in upgrades in it. Over the few years that I have had this gun I have upgraded almost every part on the gun, and changed up the configuration many, many times. Right now it has the best of all the upgrades combined. The trigger on this little beast is very sweet, and it will eat any ammo that you feed it. I have also re-finished this gun several times with Dura coat. I have a couple videos on You Tube of me shooting the gun and showing it off if you want to look up “James Tuttle Para Ordnance Warthog” you can see the gun in action. It has always performed flawlessly. It comes with the Box and paperwork, 4 magazines (2-10 round flat bottom, 1-10 round w/pinky extension, and 1-13 round with sleeve extension) This gun weighs 24 ozs and has a 10+1 capacity of .45 ACP. I am looking to trade the Warthog for another small carry gun for my wife. Guns similar to what she is looking for would be guns like Sig P938, Sig P290, Kimber Solo, Springfield EMP, or something similar to that.

It sits in the limited edition Moon Harvest camo stock and has probably seen less than 50 rounds.

The major flaw with the Axis series is the wimpy flexible stock and stiff trigger. I have addressed these issues by reinforcing the fore-end of the stock with epoxy and aluminum flat bar. There are a total of 6 aluminum reinforcements in the stock now. The gaps around the trigger guard on the stock have been filled to eliminate side to side give as well. The trigger has been set at 2.8 lbs and the trigger has been reshaped into a flat bar design that allows for more sensitivity in the finger tip-overall better trigger pulls leading to more accurate shots! I have done what Savage should have done from the factory. Way better performer now, will shoot 1 moa at 100 easily. Custom gun work can cost a lot of money, save here with a great deal on a light weight bolt action that will deliver awesome performance for a budget.

No scope is included. The rings and mount however is.

Below are a list of things that has brought this Axis up to the rest of the competition:
Aluminum pillar bedding added to fore-stock
Trigger adjustment-2.8lbs! breaks clean and easy
Trigger guard epoxied/gaps filled
FNH Front rail added w/sling stud
Trigger reshaped-Flat bar design
White inlayed letters in barrel

This gun was built for the purpose of suppressed fire and has had 20-30 subsonic .300 Whisper rounds down the tube to function check the suppressor “which is obviously NOT included”. This thing sounds like a pellet gun when suppressed. I ran a Coastal Guns MIMS suppressor on it. I will assist whoever buys it with obtaining a silencer if they wish to do so. Link showing same gun and silencer combination in action: http://www.coastalgun.com/Home/300Blackout.aspx 

Again this is a .300 Blackout, but also fires .300 Whisper-which is what you want with a silencer if you want QUIET because it is subsonic and doesn’t break the sounds barrier and make that “crack” you hear from normal firearms. Other than function check, this gun has been cleaned and sat in the safe. The sight with magnifier haven’t even been sighted in yet. I am ready for a new project and am letting it go.

Will sell the entire gun as pictured “without silencer” for $1200. Nahunta, GA. Can PM me or text REDACTED. I’m leaving on the 9th for 3 weeks, so if it’s not gone by then I’ll keep er’ I reckon to pop piggies at night with when I get back.

These are very hard to find since myself and my fellow associates have directly created a shortage of these bullets in my area due to stocking our inventory from local distributors. Now I know you are going to flag this as a scam or overpriced but before you do please take into fact of the extreme steps I have to go through to make sure I secure my shipments. I have to know my local store delivery schedules so I know when the product is available. I have to drive to several stores at several different times of the day due to multiple locations. I have to beat out the average shooters to the product even if it means pulling out a folding chair and waiting like it was black friday because my time and money is obviously more important than some little kids fun. I have to keep my cell phone charged because i need to inform my associates where to meet me at so I can get past the 1 box limit which just gets in the way when i deserve all of them. I also have to pay for my Internet so I can sell my product online rather than face to face so the insults and vulgarism doesn't hurt so bad.

Here are a few things about this rifle from the manufacturer: ""Unlike other semi-automatic .50 BMG rifles, the Model 82A1 is completely reliable. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments.

Its re-engineered muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make the 82A1 comfortable and, dare we say, exciting to shoot.

The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it is transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute by simply inserting two assembly pins through both receivers. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. The rifles M1913 optics rail is tapered 27 MOA to take full advantage of the scopes elevation travel.""

This rifle actually will fit in the case fully assembled, which is a nice advantage. No need to mess with assembly while out in the field. Also, the chrome-lined barrel will make it easier to clean.

This is an older model 92 but it is in great shape, not LNIB, but has nothing to complain about. This is a more desirable Italian made model with the straight dust cover and all metal, no plastic parts (metal guide rod, controls, sights, etc). Comes in its original case and with two magazines.
I'm a big fan of the Beretta 92 but I've had a few and would like to try something different.  As the title says I'm primarily interested in a 9mm CZ75.  Would really like a decocker model, but I'd be alright with a standard model.  Might consider other hammer fired, sa/da 9mm's, but mostly looking for a CZ75.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers or questions, texts preferred as I sleep during the day but Ill get back with you asap if I'm interested.

Thanks!

They are identical except for slight differences in the safety. Magazines are interchangeable.

I've sold all my SKS and AK47 rifles so no longer need this 7.62x39 ammo.

I have one sealed case of 1120 rounds on stripper clips.
Nearly impossible to find sealed cases of this ammo on stripper clips.

It is all brass so you can use it at the range.  This is very high quality military surplus ammo and is the best ammo for your SKS or AK47, there is none better. 

The wooden crate shows wear but the interior tin lining is intact and sealed.

I'm located in the Clearwater, MN area.  You must be willing to come to my location for pick up.

You must be at least 21 years of age to purchase and show ID and state that you are legally allowed to purchase and own this.

Back to the Alaskan...
44 mag - ammo still plentiful and easy to find.
box of 240 Grain ,semi jacketed soft hollow point defensive rounds. 1416 fps out of this barrel. 50 count box included
even at 2 and a half inches , this gun gets more than 90 percent of it's potential  power compared to a 6 inch. Very powerful and less recoil than I expected. LOUD!!!
Very fun gun bear gun. 
This gun can handle the very most powerful and or heavy loads produced.
No blemishes, nickel boron treated finish 
It blows thick cinder blocks apart like grenades
It's like an SP101 on steroids.-Same general shape. Just 3 times as big but easy to carry due to it's short barrel and ergonomic textured rubber grip
People ask, ""what do you need that for?"" If I carry, and If I'm limited to 6 rounds, they'd better be 44mag. this gun can handle the exact loads that blew my bulldog in half because it is mlled out of one piece,(the frame).

Accurate with unwaivering reliability helped make these Smith and wesson 2nd and 3rd generation pistols so famous and popular. The gun shoots great, has chewed up spit out every single type of ammo i've ever run through it from cheap steel case surplus ammo to ultra premium nickel cased hollow points. I only ever had 1 failure to fire and that was due to a bad primer in a batch of reloads i ran through it. Its easy to break down and clean which I did after every time it was shot and once every week regaurdless because it was my carry gun. It has a 3.5"" barrel and holds a 13rd double stack magazine. The mags are stated as 12rd capacity but I switch out all 4 mags followers to increase capacity to 13rds so it will hold a total of 14 rounds if theres one in the chamber. Traditional double/single action with slide mounted ambidextorious decocker/safety. Bobbed hammer so it wont catch on things when carried concealed. does have bluing wear some nicks here and there as I carried it daily but functions flawlessly. If interested I can get the gun duracoated either black and/or satin/aluminum color for $100, would take him a couple days to do it and you would have to pay him separately from me. Selling all together as a package do not want to split up because I wouldnt have any other use for it. listed below is everything the package contains,
