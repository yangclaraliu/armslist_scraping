The Pistole Parabellum 1908—or Parabellum-Pistole (Pistol Parabellum), commonly also known as just Luger—is a toggle-locked recoil-operated semi-automatic pistol. The design was patented by Georg Lugerin 1898 and produced by German arms manufacturer Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) starting in 1900 with other manufacturers such as W+F Bern, Krieghoff, Simson, Mauser, and Vickers, it was an evolution of the 1893 Hugo Borchardt–designed C-93. The first Parabellum pistol was adopted by the Swiss army in May 1900. In German Army service, it was succeeded and partly replaced by the Walther P38 in caliber 9×19mm Parabellum."

Our lower has features like no other lower on the market. Some key differences of the SP lower are the oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, large front grip, and a nice beveled mag well opening. The oversized, built in trigger guard allows the use of a thick winter glove. The magazine release area has been designed to allow quick and easy access to the release button from any position. Also, the mag well is wider and elongated in the front for a sure grip as well as having a large beveled opening for fast, smooth mag changes. An upper receiver tensioning screw is located under the grip, and it also includes a captive detent spring to retain the rear takedown pin. The Gen 2 Lower features an ambidextrous bolt release (Pre-installed) Because of the rear take down captive screw, the detent spring will need to be trimmed down."
