Gun has about 500 rounds through it and other than some very light holster wear, is in perfect working condition; laser is great and responsive too. Comes with a case, orginal manuals/paperwork, first round fired through it from the factory (still sealed), and 3 interchangeable palm swells/grips. I also have a Storm Lake 9mm conversion barrel so that you get two calibers for the price of one. Pistol comes with (2) ten-round capacity 40cal compact magazines (one with pinky extension) and one full size 9mm magazine (17 round capacity). Also included is an in-the-waistband Comp Tac hybrid leather/kydex Minotaur holster specifically made for the S&W M&P 40c. It comes with velcro clips but if you want, additional holster clips can be bought directly from Comp Tac. for pretty cheap Lastly, for an additional $115 ($600+$115 = $715), I've got over 400 40 S&W Ball rounds (180gr and 165 gr) as well as over 20 hollow points (mostly hydra-shock). Great gun that has never been abused and I'm only selling because I decided to go with an M&P Shield. Asking $600 for the pistol package and $115 for the ~430 rounds of ball/hollowpoint ammo.If you would like to purchase this M&P 40c, you must be legally able to own a firearm and have a valid Florida's drivers license, and we'll need to fill out a bill of sale. Cash Only. No trades. I'm up near River City Market place and the airport, but am also willing to meet you someplace reasonable.

Need a service pistol or just a “hand cannon”? The K2 was built by Sarsilmaz for the Turkish Military. It is all steel resulting in very manageable felt recoil. A one owner multipurpose handgun that was never carried, and LNIB. It comes with 2 factory magazines, owners manual and SAR case. Range count 100 or less rounds. This is a highly accurate and reliable firearm built to military specifications. Bid with confidence but don't delay as firearm has been cross posted, and is a very popular alternative to the CZ75. Sorry no trades.
 
We must meet face to face. You need to be a Texas resident and agree to sign a bill of sale. Bring your DL for identifcation purposes please. I have a Texas LTC and would prefer to sell to another Texas LTC buyer.

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4″ up to the 3″.This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Features:Gauge: 12 GACapacity: 6Barrel Length: 18.5""Finish: Tactical GrayAction: Semi-AutomaticHeight: 7""Chamber: 3"""

Box, papers, 2 mags. Low round count, less than 1000. This is the most accurate 9mm that I own, or have ever shot. It is an HK, and shoots like one. Everything you would expect from one of the finest gun makers out there. I won't entertain an argument of who really is THE best, but anyone that does not recognize HK as one of the best, well, they should not bother responding to this ad.HK P30L has I think a 5"" barrel, night sights, single or double action, decocker and safety. Has all the interchangeable grips and magazine loader. This thing is such a pleasure to shoot at the range, really. Great for home defense as you can leave a round in the chamber, and just decock, and not worry about your springs wearing out.I just kind of get bored with pistols, and like to try new ones. So this is time to trade. As you make an offer, please remember that this is a thousand dollar gun, that was then upgraded with the cerakote process, it really looks good. I can probably talk the guy in to re-cerakoting the slide if you want a two-tone gun. I will not trade for cheap low end guns, but I am not really that picky either. If you want to buy it cash, I would like to get $700. We can meet at a local shop and work out the details."
