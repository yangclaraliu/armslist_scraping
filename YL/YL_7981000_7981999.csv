What, a rifle that takes Glock Mags?! Unheard of! If you cant tell, this baby is my favorite and I don't want her to go to just anyone. She's had around 1000 rounds put through her and very few issues. When first obtained, she was a little sporadic but with some tender love and care, she's ready to roll with the big guns. Even been through a few 2 gun competitions and got 6th!Don't let anyone tell you she's not worth it. She's a great gun if you need to stash her in a car or even use her for home defence. Being a 9mm rifle, ammo isn't expensive so you can have hours of fun with her or just look at her in your gun case. Great collectors item and well loved. I hope you love her as much as I did!

I have the original box that the gun came in.I was handed down a different Remington 700 so I don't have a reason for this one anymore. It has 180 rounds through it. Went through a thorough break in process of cleaning after every 5 shots for the first 100 rounds and then every 10 shots after that.
