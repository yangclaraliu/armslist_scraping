Pistol has less than 500 rounds through it. This P320 was recently returned from Sig Sauer’s voluntary P320 upgrade program.  This included installation of a new trigger and updating the slide.  The new trigger for the P320 pistol features a thinner profile and reduced mass. This is expected to improve the trigger-pull experience.  While the updated slide features a disconnect notch near the striker assembly. This is a mechanical improvement over the previous commercial series of P320 pistols.  These changes are expected to refine functionality for the pistol and improve both its ergonomics and performance.  Pistol was tested by Sig Sauer prior to returning P320 and has not been fired since item was returned. I am asking 450.00 USD, but I will only consider a SERIOUS offer and only a SERIOUS offer. No low bids and no piece meal offers or trades.

It hasn't been fired since i bought it and i'm just looking for something cheaper than a 357 magnum to take to the range and carry.
I am looking to trade for a semi automatic handgun in 9mm, 45, or 10mm. I prefer metal guns (CZ, 1911's, Sig, etc), but i could definately entertain an offer for a polymer gun, so don't be afraid to shoot me an offer. 
Specific firearms I'm looking for are the Glock 19, CZ75 (or any CZ variant), an IWI 941 jericho in any size or caliber, or a sig p226 or other simarly priced sig handgun or variant, or a cheaper end / entry 1911 in 45ACP or 10mm. 
I would be willing to sell it for 450 in cash, but I'd only be willing to meet in lawrence for cash (willing to drive for a trade)

Built for European market and only approximately 500 were imported into the US. Of those, only a few are the 300 Win Mag, the rest 30-06.. This mint rifle was customized and auctioned by buckmasters and auctioned at a buckmasters event. Buckmaster's engraved in the receiver in gold and the buckmaster's trademark double drop tine Buck engraved into the stock. I purchased from the original owner unfired and mounted a monarch 3 scope with Browning one piece rings. The scope is a 2 1/2 x 10 power to enhance  quick second shot  capabilities of the weapon.  Low 2 and 1/2 power for quick Target acquisition up to 10 power which should be plenty for the large game this rifle was intended to hunt. Also, over 10 power wouldl likely require time consuming focusing with an AO or side mount focus. Also covered under the Nikon no-questions-asked lifetime warranty. If you're not familiar check out the Nikon BDC app for use with this scope. Rifle was shot four times to get on paper with break-in procedure between shots.
 
Purchased hoping to do once in a lifetime bucket list elk hunt. Not going to happen. Continuing education costs force sale. Your opportunity to pick up a rare rifle in a rare caliber with a rare customisation.  Please don't bother with low ball offers.  One and only price reduction....  $1400 if done by Sunday January 14th."

Any out of state transaction must be done through FFL as required by law, no exceptions.
