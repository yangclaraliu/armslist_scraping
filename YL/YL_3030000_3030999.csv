This optic was rarely used and it is in like-new condition (no damage whatsoever) optic was manufactured in 2012.  This is one of the best optics for a KSG.  Comes with the optic/mount, scope coat cover, and manual.  Sacrifice for 450 shipped.  

Awesome reflex

My experience with the RX30 has been a positive one.  It quickly became my favorite reflex sight to date (I have used multiple meprolight and trijicon reflex sights in the past as well as eotechs, etc)  The larger 42mm objective and 6.5MOA dot provides quick target acquisition and wide field of view especially with both eyes open applications (perfect for a rifle or shotgun, but in my opinion it really shines on a shotgun).  I had this on my kel tec KSG.  It was an awesome set up, with the ARMS mount I was able to place it and move it easily until I found the perfect spot.  

A quick note on dual illumination:  If for some reason you are worried about bright light flooding out the amber dot I have a suggestion.  I never needed it but if you are in an environment that you think it may wash out you can tape a cyalume mini chem light to the side of the optic.  That will ensure an exceptionally bright dot for four hours.  If this truly was a problem, trijicon would not sell these.  This is merely a suggestion for those that may be weary about washout.  

If you are in need of reflex sight, this is the one.  My new 870 is for breaching so I no longer need this.  Please ask if you have any questions."

This optic comes with an ARMS quick release mount, bikini covers, original box and accessories.  650.00 shipped to you.

My review

The BSO is in my opinion, one of the better optics on the market.  Built to endure the similar hardships an AR15 may see, I believe a better name would be Browe Survival Optic versus Sport Optic.  I will not expound on the quality as it is as well built as any ACOG.  I enjoyed this optic due to a combination of need, design, and price.  

Need - I wanted a short to mid range optic with 300 blackout reticle.  I want to high-quality glass, durability, ease-of-use, and an illuminated reticle.  

Design - the BSO met and or exceeded this criteria.  I especially like the Rechargeable illumination technology feature.  With this feature the optic has no buttons or batteries, you simply charge the reticle with a flashlight.  In low light or darkness the reticle is not overly bright, rather it is exceptionally clear.  The reticle itself, is in my opinion, is an exceptional reticle for the 300 blackout.  It is a combination of two bullet drop compensators, one for sub sonic (400m) one for supersonic (900m).  Both sides have man-size (shoulder width) milling hash marks out to their perspective yardages.  I really like this reticle.  However I have only tested it with subsonic and supersonic out to 300 yards.  Again speaking of needs, for my purposes 300-400m is the top end for a mid range optic.  However from 1 to 300 yards the reticle was very precise with both super and subsonic ammunition (barnes 110/remington 220).  Based off the leupold reticle, the browe reticle - although similar, is a bit different.  BROWE INC says:
August 30, 2012 at 16:34
The concept of the AAC .300 blackout reticle was benched marked off the Leupold reticle. The horseshoe and dot reticle is not unique and is being offered by many manufactures. Referencing stadia lines with for multiple calibers has also not unique and has been done for years. The reticles are similar, but different. He’s is a listing of the Browe reticle specs:

1.	The 4×32 BCO/BSO AAC .300 Blackout reticle is based in meters vs. yards 
2.	The width of the reference stadia lines are 19” vs. 18”
3.	The BCO top of the stadia tree comes to a point for an accurate 200m pin point shot placement and is illuminated vs. squared off and not illuminated
4.	Our outer ring is 7moa vs. 7.5moa
5.	Our horizontal reference is a MIL reference vs. referencing target speed
6.	Our 1moa dot is zeroed at 100m supersonic and 25m Subsonic vs. 100m / 50m
7.	The BCO is designed for different bullets, compare the 100m subsonic crosshairs
8.	Stadia lines are .5 moa vs. unknown
9.	Subsonic / Supersonic is spelled out vs. using images

Having used both reticles,  I will say the Browe offerings do not trump the leupold design, however it is indeed a solid, useful design. 

Price - through SWFA I purchased this optic for $800.  This price included the ARMS mount (which was surprisingly well built and easy to use).  I was skeptical paying this much for manufacturer and optic I have never used.  After receiving it and using it I would say the Browe BSO does fall into that price category.  Along with the exceptional quality and durability it is always a plus to be made in the USA.  

Conclusion - I believe the only reoccurring complaint about this optic (and other 4 power optics) is the eye relief.  Yes 1.5 inches it's very close (nose to charging handle - which is a known reference point for fast shooting). This is no rifle scope.  It is a short to midrange optic, and it covers and performance in these ranges very well.  My point is when you purchase an optic it usually is mission or need specific.  

I believe this is an exceptional optic, especially for the AR - 300 blackout platform.  It gives the Shooter up close to midrange capabilities with both super and subsonic ammunition.  Also have nighttime illumination without tritium or batteries.  Lastly, speaking of needs again, I no longer need this optic.  I wish to move on and test the leupold mark 4.  As I am looking forward to testing it, I'm looking forward to selling this to someone with similar needs.  

Thank you for your time and if you have any questions regarding the optic please ask."

The scope comes with the IOR cantilever mount, instructions, and original box.  Everything is like new.  This is the newest, most recent generation of the pitbull with the side illumination dial.

- IOR pitbull scope mount (non-quick release with steel bolts)
- All original content (box, paperwork, etc)
- Insured and shipped to you with tracking 

Would consider trade from leupold cq/t with a cmr2 reticle

About the scope

The pitbull is an excellent choice if your intention is to have an optic for CQB to mid range applications.  In my opinion it really shines on a M4/AR15 shooting 55gr or 62gr ammo.  I have used it for both of these applications and the results were extremely favorable.  It's compact size coupled with the 35mm tube make for an easy to use CQB package.  At 1X power, targets are easily acquired with the flaming red dot through the remarkably clear glass.  At 4X targets are easily identified at farther ranges and the reticle BDC is spot on with XM193 and or XM855.

I do recommend the newest generation of this scope.  If you call IOR valdada they will tell you all other versions are obsolete as compared to newest gen.   This is especially true with the illumination.  I believe this is the first generation with a true daytime illuminator.  

 The only vice I could find with this scope is the weight.  It is heavier than other scope in its class.  However I believe the options you get with the pitbull out weight the weight issue.  If your quest is to possess the lightest set up, look elsewhere.  If you want a uniquely designed scope for two-eye applications with the addition of having 4X for your mid range needs this is it.  

I've enjoyed the time I've spent with this optic.  I'm now after a 1-3, 1-6,or 1-8 power so I no longer need it.  If you are interested or have any questions please ask."

We have revamped the RTA line-up! The 14.5"" 1:7 twist barrel is now STANDARD in the Level-1 & Level-2 carbines, with the SevereDuty pkg optional across the line(std on Signature). These are all NFA compliant, with the muzzle device of your choice pinned & welded.

This has allowed us to bring the do-it-all versatility of the 14.5"" carbine system to the more basic RTAs, while dropping the prices across the board. The brute strength of the SOCOM-D profile barrel combined with the RTA full-auto-spec BCG being standard across the RTA line, delivers the same unstoppable weapon, regardless of the furniture you prefer.

I'm looking to pass along my N82 tactical pro holster for my M&P compact.  This is hands down the most comfortable holster I have come across, however to be entirely honest, w/ my build, I have a hard time concealing my M&P so I went w/ a smaller piece for summer carry.

The holster is in brand-new condition, as it was never worn outside - only around the house to dial in the fit, (the cant is adjustable on the pro model).  

Keep in mind that this is the pro model w/ the rigid  shell for the specific weapon, not the universal model w/ the elastic band.  I bought this for a M&P .45c but it will also fit the other calibers in the compact configuration.

New from N82 was approximately $70 w/ shipping - will sell for $50.  Trade offers also welcome for quality knives, or a quality .22 rifle, (+ cash on my end).

DPMS RFLR260 260 PANTHER LR-260 260R 24"" SS BULL LRA3 19RD REDACTED97 

24"" length , 416 stainless steel bull barrel, fluted, 6 grooves right hand 1x9 twist, button rifled

Review:
he .260 Remington cartridge provides the shooter with mild recoil and relatively long barrel life. The shorter barrel in the .260 DPMS hunting version does sacrifice velocity, but it is not meant as a long-range rifle. For example, my sniper rifle with a 25"" barrel pushes 139 to 142 grain bullets at 2870 fps. The .260 LR AR with a 24"" barrel reduces that to about 2750. The hunter version with an 18"" barrel slows the bullet to about 2550. For comparative purposes, all were shot and chronographed using the same load of 45.3 grains of H4831sc (a mild load) and 139 grain Lapua Scenar bullets. If one believes that only 1000 ft-lbs of energy is required for whitetail deer, the 260 Remington in the short barreled AR is good to 575 yards. And in the right hands, it performs admirably at long range. A friend, Andrew Smith, took the rifle to one of my 11"" wide x 22"" tall steel LaRue targets at 900 yards on a recent deer hunt."

Face to face with Ohio Resident at my location.  Cash price is firm, and I beleive it to be very fair considering they are no longer available and you are getting a bunch of ball ammo.  Not trying to gouge anyone, just trying to sell to help finanance another project.  I am not a Garand expert so please don't have high hopes of me answering detailed questions about this rifle.  I simply went to buy a beater field grade to play with and somehow walked out with this.  It has sat untouched ever since."

What is that??? That is the most common thing that my customers say when they see their target for the first time.
Ultimate Targets are made with the highest quality AR500 steel on the market. They are built with care and attention to detail and are built to last for years. Used properly, a target from Ultimate Targets will outlast the shooter. Do you have a concept for a target? I can work with you to make it a reality!

DUELING TREES:
I offer trees for pistol and rifle ammunition. I also offer trees for .22 rimfire ammunition only as well. The legs and target paddles are removable to make them easy to transport and store. Stakes are also provided to secure it to the ground. The AR500 paddles are 6"" round and 3/8"" thick.

These targets will withstand tens of thousands of bullet strikes. If you are building a shooting range, I can help you get the most targets for your budget! I can offer discounts on package deals.

Every target from ULTIMATE TARGETS is made by American hands! No robots, illegal immigrants or communist mass production junk!

The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

EOTech's most popular holographic weapons sight, the Model 512 is perfect for people who want the best in close-quarters-combat speed and versatility but don't need night vision. The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.

He sold because they are moving to a condo and gotta get rid of guns..he told me he received it from a really good friend who's grandpa use to use the woodsman to shoot competition shooting in the army during the war..he didn't know what war I'm assuming ww2 or Korean but I don't know ....I'm asking $1000 or best offer also accepting trade offers...if you want we could meet at range so that you can test her out before buying..she's a smooth sweet shooter you won't be disappointed  ........pics up soon(stock photo currently)...in out of town and not back till Thursday evening so I will update photos when home"

Finish is poor with scuffs, minor pitting along frame, heavier pitting on cylinder. Sideplate is missing large portion of nickel plating. Bore is good, although there is some minor pitting just forward of forcing cone. Rifling still sharp & intact. Grip panels fair, although do show age. Action is tight & is shootable. 

Approximate mfg. year of 1863. Period correct for civil war reenactors portraying Union officers, or for Cowboy Action Shooters who want something a little more authentic. 


This sale of this antique includes:

1. Full box of brass cased Navy Arms .32 Rimfire (long), along with five loose rounds of the same. Box and ammunition are in excellent condition. 

2. Partial box of antique, copper cased UMC .32 Rimfire Long ammunition. 13 original pieces remain, contents fair, although projectiles have oxidized. Box in good condition, edges worn. 

3. Three rounds of antique, copper cased Winchester headstamped .32 Rimfire Long ammunition. Excellent condition. No box. 

4. Three rounds of antique, copper cased UMC headstamped .32 Rimfire Short ammunition. Projectiles corroded/oxidized, casings in good condition. No box. 

5. Nearly full box of antique US Co (Lowell Mass.) .32 Rimfire short blanks. 49pcs. Box in great, but not excellent condition due to wear on edges. Contents in good condition. Retains 100% of all markings. Copper casings. 

6. Partial box of antique Winchester .32 Rimfire Short blanks. 35pcs. 7 or so have been damaged by the previous owner attempting to ignite them in a centerfire firearm, although they are still intact, and usable. Box is in good-fair condition, as one flap has been torn. Retains 100% of all markings. Copper casings. 

7. 44pcs. of antique, copper cased UMC .32 Rimfire Short blanks. Good condition, no box. 



This is a great, great piece of history to have. These pistols were the choice of union officers during the civil war. 

Any collection would do well to include an antique S&W of this vintage, and the ammunition to accompany it. The empty boxes alone are collectable. Antique ammunition & the blanks of this vintage alone are astronomically priced. The Navy Arms ammunition that comes with this alone is worth $2/round and is very hard to find. 

Great investment, I just need the cash. Times are hard, and unfortunately this one has to go, and soon. $600 takes it all away (there's $400 worth of collectible ammunition & boxes here). 

Priced to sell. Anyone that is serious about making an investment or adding an antique S&W to their collection, this is for you. 

Entirely open to fair offers. Willing to drive provided you have cash in hand. As said before, times are hard & I need cash.

He sold because they are moving to a condo and gotta get rid of guns..he told me he received it from a really good friend who's grandpa use to use the woodsman to shoot competition shooting in the army during the war..he didn't know what war I'm assuming ww2 or Korean but I don't know ....I'm asking $1000 or best offer also accepting trade offers...if you want we could meet at range so that you can test her out before buying..she's a smooth sweet shooter you won't be disappointed  ........pics up soon(stock photo currently)...in out of town and not back till Thursday evening so I will update photos when home"

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.-KELTEC
