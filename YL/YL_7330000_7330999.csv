Primary Weapons Systems (PWS)  MK1 Mod.2 Rifle 14.5"" Barrel with pinned/welded Flash Hider to 16.25""  12"" KeyMod Rail with PIC-MOD Technology .223 WYLDE  MFG # 2M114RA1B  LIGHTER & STRONGER The PWS upper and lower receivers are now forged, allowing for a stronger and lighter product. A common known fact that has been lost through the marketing efforts of many AR 15 manufacturers is that a forging can produce a piece that is much stronger than a billet part. As the metal is shaped during the forging process, its internal grain aligns to follow the general shape of the part. As a result, the grain is continuous throughout the part, giving rise to a part that is stronger, yet lighter, than a billet part.  PICMOD TECHNOLOGY The MOD 2 handguard has been equipped with the new PicMod Technology. This allows you to mount any KeyMod attachment anywhere on your rail while being able to mount most Picatinny accessories directly to the rail in the areas where the PicMod feature is present. This gives you the most mounting options without having to use KeyMod mounted Picatinny rail sections, adding unnecessary width and weight to your rifle.  ADJUSTABLE GAS BLOCK The MOD 2 comes with three easy to use gas block settings. Position 1 is recommended for for all types of ammunition and conditions when not using a suppressor. Position 2 is for use with low powered ammunition when using a suppressor. Position 3 is recommended for normal suppressor use with normal and high powered ammunition.  SUPERIOR FIT Everything about the MOD 2 has been designed to be an incredibly accurate fit and finish, including the new handguard mounting system, which features a trunnion machined into the upper receiver.  ENHANCED ZEV TRIGGER The MOD 2 comes with an ZEV SSR Trigger, set from the factory at a crisp 5.5 pounds. (3.5lb hammer spring available) Each trigger is custom adjusted at the factory, to ensure perfect performance, every time you squeeze.  THE NEW BUFFER TUBE The new PWS EBT is impact extruded from 7075 to enhance strength and rigidity, and anodized in mil spect type 3 to exceed standards in hardness and corrosion protection. We’ve added a new Ratchet-Lock Design to eliminate the need to stake the castle nut, and gives a rock solid lock up while being able to be removed easily if needed in the future.  AMBIDEXTROUS We’ve added ambidextrous controls for the safety selector, bolt release, and mag release to enhance the ease of use.  FURNITURE & MAGAZINE Every MOD 2 rifle comes complete with a Bravo Company grip and stock, 3 Rail Scales, as well as a lancer magazine.

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols."""

This Model has been Discontinued by Browning and is no longer available. So when these are gone, they gone.Featuring a unique Composite stock, the X-Bolt Composite 3D proudly displays the Buckmark while retaining the durability utility of the X-Bolt Stainless Stalker.The unique stock sports a gray marble finish on top, gold accent line and the familiar black Dura-Touch on the bottom with a prominent yellow Buckmark in front of the recoil pad. Dura-Touch Armor Coating provides positive gripping surface that is both comfortable and easy to hold onto during all weather conditions Durablelow-luster Stainless steel to minimize reflection and provide resistance to corrosion. Button-Rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy. The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy. Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately. Drilled and tappedfor X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for eachbase to provide a rock solid optic platform. Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass."" Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact. 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion. Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld. Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge bycontacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change. Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged. Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil. Item Selector"

Kick-off recoil reduction system plus Microcore recoil pad. 6.6lbs unloaded. New ""S Grip"" checkering. GunPod2 From Beretta: ""The Beretta A400 Lite Synthetic is a hunting shotgun that does it all--and that doesn’t mind playing hard and getting dirty. After a demanding day upland hunting in the tall grass, waterfowling in the marshes or breaking clays at the range, the A400 is just as happy being tossed in the back of the truck for the drive home. It is not simply a black synthetic version of the A400 family, as it incorporates a boatload of special features like cross-tube piston giving you a 4+1 shot capacity, a new checkering pattern for better gripping, advanced recoil reduction, light weight, Optima HP choke system and the revolutionary smartphone-compliant Gunpod 2 to keep track of (and share!) your shooting activities. It is a workhorse--but a workhorse with an impressive pedigree. Fast, Versatile, Light and Low-Recoiling With its Blink gas-operating system, the A400 is the fastest semiauto action on the market, capable of delivering 4 shots in less than one second. Just as importantly, its 3” chamber will reliably feed and fire different-purpose shells (2 ½” or 3”) from heavy-hitting rounds to light target loads. And as an all-purpose shotgun, it combines low weight (6.6 lbs) with low recoil, so that it can be easily carried around on the most strenuous adventures without ever being punishing on the shoulder. This is because it sports two advanced recoil-reducing devices--the Kick-Off system within the buttstock (which absorbs up to 50% of recoil) as well as a super-soft, no-snag Micro Core recoil pad. Easy and Low-Maintenance In the hands, the A400 Lite Synthetic feels like an extension of your body. Beretta has researched and created a new “S Grip” checkering pattern that gives you a wonderfully-positive hold (even with gloves) while being much easier to wipe clean than conventional checkering. An adjustable shim system also enables you to customize the fit for drop and cast, while a highly-visible fiberoptic sight at the end of the gun’s ventilated rib helps you keep your eyes on the target. The A400 action is self-cleaning, so it requires much less maintenance than any other shotgun you’ll ever own; but when you take this gun apart you’ll be amazed by the intuitive simplicity of the tool-free field-stripping process and by what little maintenance the A400 Lite Synthetic requires. GunPod2: Your Digital Hunting Diary Comes Used in box with: 3 chock tubes w/ wrench, LOP extension shim, cast/drop shims, sling swivels, oil, manuals. Please do not offer to buy if you are not serious about purchasing the gun. contact me if you are ready to buy now, and i will ship once payment is made. I accept payment by Money Order."

Austin.  Shipping may be possible, at additional cost.  Thank you."
