It has a tac rail, night sights, and the grip has been filled in so it can be run without grip panels making it much more low profile for CCW. It has also been cerakoted matte black and has Wilson combat ambi safety and thumb levers installed (original parts included). Has a Surefire X300 with pressure activation bar (removable) that has also been cerakoted to match the 1911.

As well as a high quality Galco ambi vertical carry shoulder holster. (Model VHS266)Mag release screw is a stainless replacement, original was lost durring cleaning.As far as the mags go, 7 of them have baseplates marked .40S&W, after calling SA they assure me that they simply mixed up the baseplates during production. I measured the gap in the feed lips with a digital caliper and they're definitely the same dimensions as the rest of the mags. They offered to replace them but I never got around to sending them in. Be assured that the mags function flawlessly!I would prefer to meet and perform a face to face trasaction in the KC area."

It is a Remington Express Magnum which is an 870 pump designed to take up to 3 1/2 magnum shells. It has a 20 inch rifled barrel. Not sure this is stock or a shortened barrel. It does not have a front sight but does have a mount for the rear. The gun has Magpul stock and forend with sling mounts. I added a M-lok rail underneath for a light or laser.  It has an extended mag tube for an additional round making it 6+1 capacity. The gun is a unique olive drab color. Odd but it grows on you.  I am assuming it has been configured as a home defense gun. A simple barrel swap would make it a hunting gun.I want $300 for it. I'll trade for a small or large handgun.

Cash can be added in addition to the rifle to make up any difference in trade value.The rifle being offered in trade is a 4.79 mil serial with an original 9-43 dated SC barrel which gauges at .9 MW and 1.5 TE (essentially a like new barrel). I believe the rifle to be mostly correct with the exception of the trigger which is an earlier M1903 part. The stock has very attractive grain with some light tiger striping in the butt area. It has been lightly sanded but the boxed FJA, proof P, and sub-inspection cartouches are all still intact. The ordnance wheel was either not applied or was so lightly struck that it is no longer present. I believe that the sanding was likely performed on the arsenal level as the stock was covered in cosmoline or some other type of preservative grease when I received it, but I cannot state this as fact as there are no rebuild cartouches present. Stock has cross-bolts rather than reinforcing pins which is correct for the rifle's serial number. Metal parts are correct for manufacturer, matching in color, and original in finish (i.e. parkerizing and bluing are original and correct for each respective metal part). Rifle includes a Seaville manufactured front sight cover, which is also correct for an SC rifle (not pictured in photos).Please contact me by email with any questions or trade offers."

This Knock-Out started out as the Upgraded All Stainless Steel Compact version of the M9A-1, with a Tactical Rail for adding accessories like lasers, lights, etc., that is a favorite among CCW Holders, and which we chose to use as an example of a Great Handgun that could be turned into a Show Piece while still being used frequently, through a series of carefully selected upgrades and finishes, including Gold Titanium Nitride, one of the hardest Finishes available that was originally developed I believe for the Tool and Die Industry and the Medical Equipment Manufacturers who needed a coating that could withstand rigerous use without wearing off easily! So, not only is it perfect for applications like firearms because it's tough and very thin, but it looks like 24k Gold plating if you just use a soft cloth to Polish it like Jeweler's use, and I'm sure many of you know that Desert Eagles, one of the most Powerful handguns in the World, have been using this process on many of their .44 Magnums and .50AE caliber Models for many years now and are known for their Durability and Good Looks! shipping is also available."
