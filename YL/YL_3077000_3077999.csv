40 rounds of Hungarian steel core, heavy ball (182 grain) with the silver/yellow tip. This ammo packs a lot more punch than the standard 147 grain light ball and it's always been noticeably more accurate in my rifles. Plus it penetrates like crazy. The only drawback at all is that recoil is heavier.

40 rounds East German M39. This ammo was originally designed as training ammo for their machine guns. The theory was that the special black, steel jacketed, steel core 124 grain bullet would travel less far than the normal 182 grain ammo used at the time. However there is nothing underpowered at all about this ammo and it'll shoot through 1/4"" steel plate at 100 yards. The big advantage to this ammo is that felt recoil is about half of what the 147 grain light ball ammo is. Therefore it's excellent for the younger shooters and the ladies who would like to shoot your Mosin.

20 rounds orange tip Red Tracer. The bullet lights up at around 100 yards out, and traces for about 700 - 800 yards. It's visible during the day, but it's spectacular at night.

20 rounds early 50's Bulgarian brass case light ball. This ammo is bright, shiny and looks like it was made yesterday, and I've always felt brass case ammo functioned smoother/better than any of the steel case stuff. 

I'm selling this ammo as one lot for $100 with pickup in the Brandon area. You must be at least 18 to purchase this ammo. I can ship at buyers expense via UPS ground."

Paid $1893 + Idaho sales tax @ 6% = $2006

The Modifications:

The rifle comes from the factory with a stainless steel National Match Medium Contour Barrel, trigger group, and National Match front and rear sights.

The original color of the stock and handguard was what I like to refer to as “bullet sponge black”, and was changed to Light Woodland Green. 

The handguard was clearanced and siliconed to the front ferrule and rear of barrel to keep it from moving/rattling (a National Match accurizing modification). 

The gas cylinder was shimmed so that the gas cylinder lock would start to tighten at the 4:30 position (another National Match accurizing modification).

Battle Arms Development Gas Cylinder Wrench $35
Badger Ordnance bolt roller greaser $9

Parts total including tax and shipping $1125.00
All original parts included as well.

Total of rifle and parts minus labor = $3131.00
What I’m asking for = $ 3000

This is what it cost me to build this rifle. This is a great rifle at a great price! There were many hours spent installing the above parts, and would have easily been over $300 in labor fees to have a gunsmith build this rifle. This expense is not included in the price. The rifle has been function checked with exactly 20 rounds of ball ammo to ensure reliable function after installation of all Nation Match upgraded parts.

Nikon 8394 LSR Archers Choice 6x 21mm 7.5 degree FOV 18.3mm Green

The Nikon Archer's Choice rangefinder was designed exclusively for bow
hunting. It was engineered with the help of Ralph and Vicki Cianciarulo of
Archer's Choice for real world bow hunting situations. The Nikon Archer's
Choice laser rangefinder combines Nikon's advanced Incline/Decline
Technology with all the features serious bow hunters demand in a
rangefinder. The Nikon Archer's Choice rangefinder offers constant first
target priority mode and consistent and accurate measurements. ID
Technology allows bow hunters to range targets from a tree stand or in
steep terrain with the same confidence and ease as ranging over flat
ground. A simple, uncluttered reticle gives bow hunters the one number
needed to make a shot.

Make an offer.

Details:
The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable butt stock for the .223. Unlike typical stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore .223 calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand. 

Specifications and Features:
Mounts on durable Entry-Length Receiver Extension tube (included) to accommodate the common carbine buffer and spring. 7-Position LOP adjustability with customizable preset system for fast access to preferred length.Adjustment lever requires only gross motor movement to operate yet the entire stock remains streamlined and anti-snag
Solid ""fixed stock"" lockup and consistent cheek weld in all positions
Enhanced lock mechanism w/ internal impact buffer increases drop strength and shock resistance. Multi-shell construction provides solid foundation and shields critical operating parts from penetration damage. Sloping cheek weld combines a slim profile with user comfort
Stout construction provides counterbalance weight for improved weapon balance and handling. Storage compartment in tail of stock is removable and the door is reversible for user preference. Removable 0.30"" Rubber Butt-Pad offers an anti-slip surface and increased impact protection. Reversible QD swivel sling mounts fit up to 1.5"" push-button swivels (swivel not included).

Magnum Research Mark XIX .44 Magnum Desert Eagle, 6 inch barrel
Hogue rubber grips with finger grooves (originals also included)
Trijicon tritium front night sight
Second magazine
Nylon shoulder holster
149 rounds of ammo (all pictured plus 32 more Remington)

I really like this firearm, and it works perfectly.  The only reason I am selling it is because I don't have the time to get out and shoot it.

First Choice Armor, Inc.

Synergy, the New Definition of Safety. First Choice Armor, Inc. of Brockton, MA has announced the introduction of its Synergy line of body armor. This latest innovation by First Choice Armor is available in both NIJ (National Institute of Justice) Level II and Level IIIA. The Synergy line offers the lightest Non-Zylon® concealable vest available in the market today, and is so distinctive that it is Patent Pending on the unique ballistic weave made from 100% aramid fiber located inside the vest.
The Synergy vests also have a unique built-in cooling system developed by First Choice. All Synergy vests use the extraordinary Evercool system which draws heat away from the body making the armor the most comfortable design ever.
During certification testing at NIJ, Synergy proved exceptional in its testing of the BFS (back face signature- simulation of blunt force trauma created from the stopped ammunition). NIJ standards allow up to a 44mm BFS. The Synergy Level II has a BFS as low as 23mm when shot with a 9mm round and as low as 30mm with a .357 round. The Level IIIA has a BFS as low as 22 mm with a 9mm and 32mm when tested with a .44 magnum; exemplifying outstanding performance for light weight body armor.
""Synergy is a breakthrough vest for officer protection and comfort. It offers a perfect balance and that's why Synergy seems like such a fitting name,"" stated Karen Harman, President of First Choice Armor. ""These vests offer police officers protection, flexibility, and comfort and reduce the feeling of 'overheating' while on the job."""

It was imported by Mercury-Hermes.

This is a Saiga with pistol grip with battery compartment, Tapco collapsible stock, and sling studs. It's been modified to accept standard AK-47 mags and has a bullet guide installed.  Also ported the hand guards to help keep them cool when firing a lot.  Please note that it is NOT a ""converted"" Saiga - the only conversion is to accept the AK mags.  This can be switched back to the standard European-style Saiga stock and handguards (stock and handguards run about $40 online) if you don't want that ""assault rifle"" look and the 922r headache, or live in an area that won't allow them to be used for hunting.

The rifle has some wear in the usual spots (mag release, side mount, safety lever, etc), but works flawlessly.

They are a clone of the LG-401 laser grips and work VERY well. All the same stats as Crimson Trace: 5mW power output, front grip pressure pad activation with secondary master on/off switch, battery life over 4 hours continuous run time on two CR2032 batteries (included).

Made by Silverback in Japan, these were originally marketed for airsoft BUT go on any 1911 forum and you'll see tons of positive reviews of people who have used them on real .45 ACP 1911's... They all say they hold zero just as well and are just as durable as the CT grips, some have torture tested them and the grips still work like new after 800,000 rounds. (the set you will receive are brand new and unused) 

Crimson Trace somehow managed to get a patent on grip activated lasers in the US (but hey, Amazon somehow patented taking a photo on a white background too) so these can't be brought in any more, and once they're gone they're GONE. Prices on eBay see to be running between $100-$150 for a set, a good deal since Crimson Trace charges $330 for a pair.

My Price? $65 + $3 shipping anywhere in the US. 

Color is black.

Up for sale is my pre-ban FEG SA 85M AK, I never thought I would sell this gun it is the most accurate AK I have ever owned! 

This is a numbers matching AK imported to the United States prior to 1989, imported by Kassnar Imports, Harrisburg, PA. I have contacted several sources who are experts on this particular weapon platform and they have all confirmed this is a genuine FEG pre-ban AK. The only non authentic parts on this rifle is the pistol grips and the fore-guards (they are suppose to be blonde in color with no palm swells) The replacement parts are of Polish origin and genuine to the period just not to the rifle manufacturer.

Rifle has a low round count, shiny bore also included in the deal is a spam can (with opener) of 640 rnds of Tul ammo and an addition 220 rnds of Tul an WPA ammo for a total of 840 rnds of 7.62x39 ammo

I am asking $1500 or best offer for the package will not separate, do some home work you will see these rifles are hard to come by. If you can get a AK for less by all means go ahead and buy one, there are plenty of Century arms WASR out there for under $500

I have enclosed a pic of the serial no and manufacturer for verification, like I said do some research. Stupid offers and emails are simply ignored

Contact me via email then we can exchange phone numbers, Armslist only allows three pics if you need pics of the ammo or the gun please ask

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes."

They are a clone of the LG-401 laser grips and work VERY well. All the same stats as Crimson Trace: 5mW power output, front grip pressure pad activation with secondary master on/off switch, battery life over 4 hours continuous run time on two CR2032 batteries (included).

Made by Silverback in Japan, these were originally marketed for airsoft BUT go on any 1911 forum and you'll see tons of positive reviews of people who have used them on real .45 ACP 1911's... They all say they hold zero just as well and are just as durable as the CT grips, some have torture tested them and the grips still work like new after 800,000 rounds. (the set you will receive are brand new and unused) 

Crimson Trace somehow managed to get a patent on grip activated lasers in the US (but hey, Amazon somehow patented taking a photo on a white background too) so these can't be brought in any more, and once they're gone they're GONE. Prices on eBay see to be running between $100-$150 for a set, a good deal since Crimson Trace charges $330 for a pair.

My Price? $65 + $3 shipping anywhere in the US.

I have a 1989 Ford Bronco for sale. It is in great condition mechanically and pretty darn good condition cosmetically (its 25 years old). Its suspension lifted 6 inches, sitting on 36 inch Irok Super Swampers at about 60-65%. It is a 351w, automatic C6 transmission with 161k miles on it.

I took it to the shop when I bought it and had some work done, they made a list of everything they could find needing fixed, I fixed everything on the list.

It has a new fuel pump, sending unit, and line.
New door hinges.
New U joints
New CV boot

Other then that they said it was in top shape and gave it a clean bill of health. They also noted that the engine had been rebuilt at some point.

The Bronco has been blacked out with Plasti dip on the chrome parts. The chrome underneath is protected and I have cleaned off the bumpers so far should you decide to remove the plasti dip its easy.

4x4 works awesome. I haven't wheeled it hard, but it rocked in the snow and ice this last year.

Flowmaster exhaust, sounds awesome, passes DEQ just fine, tags good till 2016.

The Bronco has a CD/MP3 player with ipod/usb hookups, wired for sub and amp as well. I will include a 10 inch JBL and Rockford Fosgate 500 watt amp for the right deal.

The Bronco comes with an extra bumper in perfect condition, It is wired for towing and has a receiver. I also have a 6 inch drop hitch for it that I will include with the right trade.

The seals on the bronco are all good and the top comes off with ease. Just in time for summer!

The Bronco is a beast, it starts the first time, every time. It handles the 36 inch swampers smoothly does 65 easy on the freeway at 2500 RPM and will go faster if you need. I cant verify that it has been re-geared but it sure feels and runs like it.

Its solid all the way around, and ready to kill zombies or go mudding or wheeling or to just drive around town looking like a bad ass.

This is a great rig, I just don't need it any longer as I have another Bronco project I am going forward with. Im asking 4500, with the lift, the tires and the recent work and clean bill of health its worth that. That being said, I am open to offers.


I will also accept cash and firearms in trade, I am looking for at least 2k in cash and can do the rest in trade or.... I may be willing to trade for multiple quality firearms."

Flat Dark Earth (FDE) color

The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.
