I have brass, much new, some once loaded... I have reloading dies, and I even have a forming die to make a few other casings into 6.5 Rem Mag.  Again, check the ballistics of this incredible belted magnum from 3450 fps to 2700 fps for 140 grain, again, from a small case.  The ammo and brass alone that I have is worth well over $1000.00, and the rifle is as shown in beautiful shape, jeweled bolt and all.  It's likely you've never seen one of these much less fired one, and this one just sits in the safe, so I need to sell it.  If my shoulder could still stand up to it, I would never even consider selling it.  Please, All, do not waste my time and yours with silliness and fake check/money order offers or other scams.  If you have an interesting trade, maybe a Tavor X95 bluse some cash, let me know, and be honest in your mind about its value as regards this rifle and extras.  Thank you.  Post Script:  Had friends over yesterday and took them to the range.  They loved this rifle, but all three said the recoil was ""more than noticeable"", and one even got a slight imprint from the scope ocular on his forehead (to brag to his wife?).  They fired about twenty-five rounds before they had to call it quits.  So I can honestly say that it's been recently fired.  If you're headed to Alaska for hunting, surviving or guiding hunters, this is for you.  So, you have a really neat rifle and caliber, and you can add your own caliber work-ups with the new high BC projectiles and powders.  I can consider trades of low recoil rifles such as Tavor."

They have been in the machining business for over 40 years but, because of the downturn in the economy were going to have to shut down until they decided to enter the AR-15 market. At first they produced OEM parts for other manufacturers, but then decided that they could produce a better rifle under their own brand. They have an innovative and proprietary treatment for the upper, BCG, and barrel called RF85. RF85 is the treatment produced by Better Than New for the racing industry. They apparently will only sell matched uppers/lowers in order to assure tight fit. Lastly they only use 7075 aluminum for their upper and lower receivers. Its a really nice pistol."

Comes with everything in the box including the 2 original magazines.I am also including 2 boxes of FMJ, 1 box of Winchester PDX1 and 75+- assorted rounds of duty ammo including a few Black Talon and CCI Lawman to name a couple.I am wanting to trade for a lightweight commander sized 1911 in 9mm. Something like a Ruger SR1911 lightweight in 9mmI am actually hoping to find a Springfield Armory EMP4 in 9mm. I know this is a more expensive pistol and if you have one you want to trade I can include a customized Remington 870 12ga. (it's only had 2 rounds through it). (the bayonet in the picture is not included but the mount is).You may ask why I am getting rid of the pistol, it is not because of any problem with it. I am trying to lighten my load and so I am trying to consolidate ammo caliber and I already have quite a bit of 9mm and my wife has a 9mm. I don't want to have to feed another caliber into my toys/ tools! That is why I'm including the ammo. I don't really want to get rid of the shotgun but I know the Springfields have a higher price tag so I am wanted to offer an equatible deal.Thank you for checking out my listingI am located in College Station, Texas"

Have you collected a whole bunch of pistols, some of which you never shoot and they just sit unloved in the back of the safe? Could you use some more ammo to fire in that collection of guns and/or some cash? Well, then, I've got a deal for you.It seems I got a bit overzealous in my ammo acquisitions over the past few months and I have more 9mm than I probably need. So, I figure I might as well try to turn it into another gun to shoot. Tell me what you've got, age, condition, what comes with it, etc. and in exchange, I'll make you an offer of new, factory loaded, brass-cased ammo to trade you for your pistol. Everything I've got I acquired in the last six months and has been stored in a cool, dry basement in ammo storage boxes. It is a mix of 115 grain and 124 grain from major manufacturers such as Fiocchi, S&B, Blazer, Federal, Magtech, Aguila, Remington/UMC, PPU and the like. I can also mix cash and ammo for the right pistol, with the majority being ammo and some cash added on top.I am ONLY interested in the following two types of guns: 9mm pistols, preferably full-size and hammer fired; or 22LR/22Mag revolvers, preferably double/single action (not SAO).Let me know what you've got and let's make a deal.

Only the vest/armor carrier and all its components.   Please disregard the black kevlar soft armor panels in the picture where vest is layed out open on the driveway.   Please disregard the pile of MOLLE pouches off to the side of he vest in other photos.I purchased this new back in 2010 or 2011 through SKDtac.com and have been the sole owner of it ever since. It has not deployed with me; just used for attending courses and training myself. I would describe it as ""acceptable to good"" condition, with ""acceptable"" in there based entirely on the visible and tangible ""fluffyness"" of the nylon webbing in the couple spots where male velcro from the cummerbund would regularly rub against MOLLE webbing, and from the wear on the edges of a velcro panel, where velcro is separating from the stitches in place to hold it down.I've found this vest to be versatile in layout, of durable construction (except for that one velcro panel that wants more stitching), and equipped with plenty of MOLLE real-estate. The shoulder straps were broad enough to distribute weight well. I did not care for the way that the quick-release rigging all converges in the internal, back center of the vest. That made a lump of material that I disliked when sitting in vehicles with hard armor plates in, so I slipped in a piece of foam padding, which I'll leave included in the vest.Here is the URL for the vest on the manufacturer's website (Eagle Industries) :  http://www.eagleindustries.com/products/detail.aspx?id=188      That should answer tech/spec questions. Remember that the vest I'm selling is the Land model, not the Maritime model.I'll exchange for cash. No personal identification necessary for this item. Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.    And I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" .   I would receive and cash USPS money order before getting it boxed (or bagged - it is a soft-good) and shipping it out via USPS.  I can also accept payment through Square Cash (Cash App)."

The first Parabellum pistol was adopted by the Swiss army in May 1900. In German Army service, it was succeeded and partly replaced by the Walther P38 in caliber 9×19mm Parabellum."

I got about 2-4 MOA on a 5x5 group at 100 yard, with my 20"" free floating CHF AR (6-24 x 50 scope).I still have 3000 rounds left in the original pack, and I am selling them at $0.15/round OBO.I am a member of Southern Minnesota Sportsman's Club, therefore I can bring you to the shooting range for test shoot or accuracy and cycling check if your prefer.BTW, I have one 1-24 x 4 carbin scope, one Bushnell red dot (box opened, used once), and one Millett red dot (brand new), for fast aimming and fast shooting -- priced for sale.----------------I just received some questions, answer here:This ammo was a pretty hot topic back to October 2016. 
 
From the AR 15 forums, I learned that the original manufacturer was Golden Tiger, made in Vympel Russia, and the steel shell was made of Lacquer steel, which had been specially treated for anti-corrosion; and, the primer and the neck had been sealed -- therefore they are very suitable for long term storage. They were sold at $0.20-0.22 per round at www.SGAmmo.com.

 
However, the whole lot shipped to SG Ammo in October 2016 has a mistake - for some stupid reason, the Russian workers put 5.45x39 primers on the shells. This primer needs deeper firing pin to strike for firing, and somebody also suggested to use a more powerful hammer spring. So the SG Ammo lowered their price to $0.18 per round (started from 2000 rounds pack, shipping included), and stated ""sold as is"". They suggested to use ""enhanced/extended 7.62x39 firing pin"", plus ""Wolff XP hammer spring"". I bought both the firing pin and the hammer spring, but by using this enhanced firing pin, I got only 1/1000 FTF.

 
I am willing to sell the whole 3000 rounds as a whole lot, since I am giving away the firing pin and hammer spring.
 
Thanks."

It is one of the better condition ones I have had and when compared to what is listed. These were sold as target revolvers, a step or two above the ""tackle-box"" guns made to throw in the truck. Larger checkered grips and a 6 inch barrel make them pretty good shooters. These revolvers had their chambers counter bored or recessed so the cartridge head was enclosed and supported. It also allows the cylinder to mate right up to the frame in the rear. Double action, though for target use, they really shine in single action as the trigger is crisp snd light. This is a second series gun as it has the round barrel and after the WAR they were made from 1946 to 1954. The serial number on this one is most likely very late 1940s. FINISH--The metal has very good bluing as many do not. The frame rates excellent with no real fading or wear and just a few very fine scratches. The triggerguard has some light bluing wear and the metal in front of the grip is like new.The barrel is EXC- as it is just as nice as the frame with light bluing wear at the last 1/2 inch by the muzzle. The cylinder rates Very Good as the bluing is mostly fine but there is very light freckling on just one area which is most likely the area that sat against whatever it was stored in. We are talking very light freckling.The wood rates EXC to EXC+ as the checkering is great with no wear and just the faintest dings and marks from use. The surface finish is 100% intact, so not a spot where it is missing or worn.The trigger and hammer are case-hardened. FUNCTION-- Test fired by me to ensure proper function. With the hammer locked back, the cylinder has just the tiniest movement or play which is truly negligible BUT that is not how you check it....as soon as any pressure touches the trigger, it locks solid with ZERO movement. It has been cleaned and lubricated properly. The bore is perfect. Priced the same as others with damaged chambers and quite a bit of wear. Far less than several others in similar condition **I did not shoot at a target or distance, only function tested. Payment by Paypal-- contact me first as the email address is different.

I already have another G-42 exactly like this one, and I really don’t need two.  I love the G-42 because it’s a soft shooter with almost no felt-recoil, yet every inch a Glock.  Its slim profile makes it perfect for either concealed or open carry, for a man or a woman.
The full package comes just the way it came from Glock, including factory box, factory lock with keys, cleaning rod and brush, and all paperwork. 
The two mags are the ones originally supplied by Glock and both are the newest “03” version.  One of the mags has a Strike Industries +2 extension floor-plate installed.  I’ve also added a Talon grip to enhance the grip on this slim pistol.  Otherwise, the gun and all mags are bone stock.
I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas without shipping.  I’m in College Station so anywhere inside the Houston, Austin, DFW triangle will probably work.  Maybe we can meet halfway to minimize driving. 
Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TX driver’s license or permit.
I’d prefer cash, but I can certainly take a look at any trades you may wish to offer.  Mainly I’m interested in a Ruger LC9s Pro, or FDE Glocks, e.g., G-43, G-42 in Glock Dark Earth (not Cerakote)."

This is a 1943 Ishevsk in beautiful condition. All numbers match except the bayonet.  The only issue is the small bruse on the left side of the stock courtesy of some communist. The bolt runs smooth as a babys ass. This rifle was not counterbored when it was refinished after the war. The bore on this Nagant was the nicest of the ones I had. Nice sharp rifling and no pitting or rust at all. It does come have a rubber butt pad on it. These are getting harder to find and are sold out of the usual places that had them for years.  Comes with shown accesories. I cannot find the sling to go with it. But 10 stripper clips loaded with milsurp 54r will go with it so your ready for the zombie invasion ASAP.  Take this beautiful rifle home and watch Enemy at the gates then play Battlefield One with it on your lap you know you want to!
