They call it the Retro.  Details below on what goes into this fully functional collectors gun.  Over $2K invested.

From the Mars Guns website:

Design - The MARS formula for a dependable 1911 mirrors that of the government issue 1911s of yesteryear- begin with a high quality Colt platform, utilize select components carefully fit and tuned by a skilled craftsman. Add to the mix correctly manufactured ammunition and high quality magazines, and the result is a pistol with excellent reliability and durability.

Reliability work - the extractor is hand tuned and the barrel recontoured to feed modern hollow point ammunition. All internal ways and tunnels are polished for smooth and reliable function. The barrel is throated; the barrel/frame ramps and chamber are hand polished for reliable feeding. The barrel is correctly timed, greatly increasing it's life and enhancing reliability.

Precision crowned muzzle - lathe turned for optimal concentricity to the bore and enhanced accuracy; cut flush with the bushing, protecting it from damage and providing a neat appearance.

MARS solid aluminum trigger -  minimalist design with a clean appearance and built in over travel stop pad. Lockwork is hand stoned and tuned for a crisp, clean, reliable trigger pull.

High profile sights - Perhaps the biggest weakness of the original 1911 is it's tiny sights, which are difficult to acquire under stress. The front sight of the Retro replaces the breakage prone staked front sight with a custom contoured, dovetail unit machined from bar stock.   Note: I had them add a tritium insert to the front sight. 

Following the tradition of the great Colt National Match pistols of the 1930s, the rear sight is a high profile hardball sight, dehorned for comfort and carry. The sight notch is widened and deepened, providing a more open sight picture which is faster and easier to acquire under stress and in poor lighting conditions, without compromising the accuracy required for critical shots.

Dehorning - Recontoured hammer and grip safety alleviates the the notorious hammer bite of the 1911. All sharp edges are lightly dehorned for comfortable manipulation, cleaning, and carry.

Special cosmetic features - beveled slide bottom offers a distinctive appearance and eliminates snags. Slide and frame flats and selected small parts are hand polished to a high luster and finished in a deep black oxide."

It was originally a 120GB model (CECH-2001A), but I replaced the hard drive with a brand new 250GB western digital drive that I had. When I bought it, it was on OFW 3.55, so I did the necessary procedures to install the custom firmware on it. It currently has REBUG 4.46.1 REX EDITION on it along with multiMAN 4.55.01. If you don't know what that means... basically, you can play games and add DLC directly to your hard drive (internal or external) without the need for a disc in the drive. There are ways to make it safe for PSN, but I never looked into it and there aren't any patches currently installed.

Asking $400 for everything. Would rather not part out, and as far as trades, I would be interested in a .380 (like an LCP or bodyguard), a .308 (like a ruger american), a cheaper AR platform (like M&P sport, and can add cash), or ammo in 9mm or .22lr

This is the ideal package as I have most of the sought after PS3 exclusives. I don't really want to sell it, but I just don't play it enough to keep it around. Would rather have the cash and see someone else get some enjoyment out of it. If you were to buy a refurb 120GB PS3 slim and all of the retail games I have at gamestop, it would cost you $337.83+tax... which comes to just over $360 after tax. So for an additional $40, you are getting one with a 250GB hard drive, 2 additional controllers, and custom firmware installed (notice how I didn't even factor in the price of the games already installed on the HDD).

----
I would like to offer for sale two (2) tins of Russian 5.45 x 39mm ammo. This is Russian military surplus ammo with the excellent 7N6 bullet, sealed in a tin, for a total of 1,080 rounds per tin, 2 tins to a crate.

Terrific round, whether for self defense (look at 7N6 terminal ballistics), fun times at a class or range (still amongst the most inexpensive centerfire rifle round to shoot), or long-term storage (can't beat sealed tins and Combloc surplus ammo for that).

Even has something for you investors out there, as the price of this ammo is only going to go up now that supply in the US is limited by the importation ban.

Asking $250/tin. Or $450 for both tins with can opener. That's right at 23c/rd if you buy a single tin and under 21c/rd if you buy both tins.

The grips are intact but the finish is very worn.  The bluing is good as is the case and bore.  The serial number match, the gun was made by FAUL in 1965.  It has a cylinder line and several buggered screws.  It is a good quality gun for a shooter grade gun and likely the finest reproduction Colt Army every made.  The box was destroyed by the way the gentleman carelessly wrapped it with packing tape.  His add is still listed so you can see what I took as a true representation of the gun plus trace his other ads as a caution.

The Nano was designed with one goal in mind: creating the ideal micro-compact pistol for concealed carry and personal defense. Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.
Easy to ConcealBeretta Nano

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.
Personal Protection Made Easy

Nano_with_Crimson_Trace_Laser

The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.
Easy to Use and Maintain

The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA.

These guys are getting a great rep in the field for building great uppers. This one is a 7.5 inch barrel and is only legal for AR pistol uppers. It is standard fit to any AR pistol lower. Just slap it on your current lower, and have some fun. Also comes with 7.62 bolt carrier and charging handle. 

Please note, it is not legal to add this to your AR upper if it has ever been a rifle. That would be considered an SBR and that requires an NTF stamp. This can only be used on a pistol lower.

Walmart, Bi-Mart, Sportsman's Warehouse, Dick's, Big-R and all other LEGIT big-box retail stores are not gouging so why play into this crap? Yes they have gone up a few dollars over the years.... no big deal... Bricks are now being sold for $25 when they used to be $12 and even 100 rounds of CCI-Mini-Mags are still sold for $11 at all these big-box retail stores TODAY when they used to be $3-$5 a few years ago. NOT $75-$80 per brick of cheap bulk ammo! NOT $10-$15 per 50 round packs of the better ammo! Are You Kidding Me?!?

/start rant
Since no one has the ballz to say it-- i will:

I can see paying $35 per brick for someone to stand in line for you, but co'mon! REALLY?!?!?!?! 300% markup is friggin insane.... talk about take advantage... and your not helping the situation AT ALL! either by selling at these insane prices, or BUYING at these insane prices and encouraging the gougers.

I dont care if thats what gunbroker.com and gunbot.net and other online retailers have them for sale also at insane prices.... they are gouging people and taking advantage of the situation just like you armslist 'dealers' and 'personal sellers' out there. And you dont even post your ammo in the ammo section - you also post it in the firearms section for people to see! I could also rant about the delusional prices on most of your firearms too (especial charging above-new prices for USED firearms) but ill save that for another day....

I have seen all of you standing in the same lines as me EVERY Thursday at 9am at Sportsman's Warehouse to get my weekly ration given out to the public vultures, and you don't see me listing my crap on here now do you? and if you did... i don't gouge!

So, until i see Walmart, Bi-Mart and the other big-box retail stores start to jack their prices WAY WAY up, then this is WRONG!

.... and I KNOW FOR A FACT your on-line 'dealers' and personal sales gougers out there did not pay $75 per brick! I hope you choke on it.

... and by the way... I have all the bricks of 22lr I need to last thru this bad situation... and i paid avg price of $23 per brick. ... and I waited in the lines just like YOU!

This rifle is what colllectors would consider a Correct Grade, meaning that all the parts of the rifle are correct down to the time period of when the receiver was made - just like it came from the factory during WWII (many WWII rifles received replacement parts after the war). Still fires perfectly. 

The stock of this rifle is an original Springfield Armory NFR - fairly rare in the collector's community - with a tiger striped pattern (also a rare find). CMP Certificate is included.

More photos can be found here:
http://s1337.photobucket.com/user/carsoca2/library/M1%20Garand?sort=3&page=1

I will also include (48) M2 .30-06 rounds with clips for the M1 Garand and bandoleer. 

The only reason I would like to get rid of it is because it would just be a wall hanger for me, being a collectible WWII gun. I would like to give someone else the opportunity to enjoy it."

It's in good/very good condition, and it's all original.  The bluing is a little thin in some places, but there is no rust or other damage to it, and the wood has beautiful grain and deep red color.

I got this through a trade not too long ago. It has about 300 rounds through it. I've made a couple upgrades to it and it functions perfectly, but I'd rather just sell it and get something smaller for concealed carry. Here are the things I've done to the gun:

- Polished Glock factory minus (-) connector (slightly lessens the trigger pull weight and smooths out the trigger a little)
- Grip Force Adapter
- American flag slide cover
- Gen 4 Slug Plug (plugs hole near mag well)

The gun also includes 1 factory 15 round magazine. When I received the gun through the trade, he couldn't locate the original case, but this never bothered me because I use soft cases to save space anyway. I also have a nice kydex holster by Armordillo Concealment that I can include for extra. Price is firm. Not really interested in trades sorry. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to see any more pictures. Thanks for looking."

From what I understand, the VZ24 is identical, or almost so, to the K98 Mauser. Aside from the action, though, it's all changed. Attractive Monte Carlo, wooden stock; internal mag; comes with scope mount; re-barreled in .30-06; Williams rear sight. 

Rifle maintains decent accuracy. I'm not a top-notch shot, but get around 2"" 3-5-shot groups at 100 yards with surplus .30-06. I've never tried quality ammo or handloads. 

The front sight was cracked when I got the rifle, and has since come off. I've been meaning to buy a new one for some time, but it was just never a priority. 

The biggest thing about this rifle that the buyer needs to know is that the internal mag will only hold 3 rounds, even though the original VZ24 held 5. Because the .30-06 is a few millimeters longer than the 8mm Mauser round, if you try to put in more than 3, they will jam in the mag. 

I enjoy this rifle, but have my sights set on something else at the moment. Just send me an e-mail if you are interested!

***EDIT... The scope in the picture can come with the rifle, assuming I can find it. I put a different scope and rings on when I got it, but they won't be included."

So he bought lots of reloading equipment, but, as best I can tell, he never did much reloading.Most of this stuff looks brand new, and some of it was still in the original wrapper, and some of it is obviously used.

I recently inherited this equipment from him; and although I was tempted to start reloading myself, I decided I don’t shoot centerfire rifles enough to justify the time and expense of reloading. So it’s for sale. I’ve done my best to describe this equipment, but due to my inexperience, I may be leaving out some important details. In my opinions, this would be a great way for someone to get into reloading and pay much less than full retail prices. 

I would like $350, In my estimation all this equipment and supplies would cost over $500.

Also, whoever wants to meet up has to be willing to come to my home to pick up the safe if they choose to get the whole package.  It is heavy and will require a truck to pick up in.  I can deliver but depending on the distance, we will have to work out something.  This rifle is brand new, unfired condition.  I am asking 700, but shoot me an offer and if it makes sense, we can work something out  I live in Steilacoom as well, but can meet up depending on your location.  I also have 150 rounds of .556 that come with the rifle.  Three packs of 50 rounds a piece.  The rifle has a chrome barrel as pictured and a collapsible stock.  Very light and versatile.  I am not asking for full retail but I would like to recoup most of my money due to all the items being in a new unused condition."

Originally developed for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition the new HK45 “Tactical” comes standard with a threaded barrel and Meprolight three-dot tritium night sights.

The full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.

The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.

The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.

The HK45T can be converted to nine different kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting.
