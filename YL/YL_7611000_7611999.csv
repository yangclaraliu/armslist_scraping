I built this rifle from the ground up to be a dream long –range precision shooter.  The rifle is a .308 chambered Remington 700 BDL with a Heavy Bull Barrel, fully floated fiberglass Hogue Stock with a custom Multi-Cam / Scorpion camouflage paint set up.
It has a SWFA SuperSniper 10x42M Tactical Sniper Scope mounted in heavy duty rings on a single picatinny rail for ultra-durability, stability and reliability. The Scope itself has Mil-Dot reticle, ¼ MOA and 15 MOA revolution so you can really reach out and touch something. I have personally hit 4” flappers at 900+ years with this dream boat.  The scope alone is $400, the rail mount is $100 and the rings are over $150 – over $650 has been invested in ensuring that what you are aiming at – gets hit.
The heavy barrel and adjustable Harris Bi-Pod up front make it super comfortable to shoot all day long, even with heavy .308 precision target loads.
 
Serious offers only please.
I MIGHT be interested in trading for a high quality AR 7.62 set up with mags, Glocks or other high quality firearms – so go ahead and make some offers."

Smooth Trigger Pull• Novak® Fiber Optic Green Front Sight• Novak® Designed Reduced Glare Rear Sight• Increased Sight RadiusBridging the gap between main production and the Performance Center, the Smith & Wesson Pro Series represents the next step up from standard production line models.

Shoots great, trigger feels like my full size M&P models, never really did shoot as much as I thought I would though. I would roughly guess there hasn't quite been a 1000 rounds shot through it yet. Just recently traded for a different .22 and don't need two of them. Has both 10 round magazines, the tiny allen wrench for adjusting the windage, barrell bushing wrench, box, and cable lock. I've checked retail right now so instead of all that I'm putting it at 300 even. Buyer must have valid VA license and Concealed Carry, and the deal has to be face to face. For just that amount I'm not dealing with any shipping hassles.

Reduces sound pressure levels of .22 LR to an average of 113.2 dB with standard velocity ammunition. Lightweight for balance and portability. Once installed on the firearm, the center of gravity is close to the receiver, making it easy to maneuver and shoot. Easy to disassemble and clean. All internal components seal together to keep the byproducts of combustion away from the tube. A single screw retains the baffles and cap within the sleeve and doubles as a removal tool. The included 5/32"" hex key tool allows the integrally suppressed barrel to be completely disassembled for cleaning. Sleeve surrounding the 17-4 stainless baffles is matched to the forend for a clean, but distinctive, appearance. Stainless steel barrel, baffles and front cap were chosen for maximum strength and serviceability. The aluminum sleeve is permanently attached to the barrel to minimize weight and maintain a minimum overall length."
