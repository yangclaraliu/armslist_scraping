RARE SS192 “Green Ammo” was produced for ONLY 3 months before FN turned to the SS195LF. The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

The receiver is 50% thicker than a normal AK, and has a much thicker barrel as well.  This VEPR has also been highly upgraded. I've added a Russian gas tube to allow fitting of a TimberSmith wood stock set, ALG Ultimate trigger, M+M enhanced magazine release, Krebs Custom safety selector, and has had a bullet guide installed to allow the use of conventional AK magazines. This rifle has never been fired.

It’s a very rare two tone black slide over gray frame. **All Nighthawk Custom Arms include Nighthawk's heirloom warranty, which transfers a lifetime warranty from owner to owner, upon sale or death. That is the Nighthawk Guarantee.**One Gun, One Gunsmith.At Nighthawk, each pistol is built from start to finish by a single gunsmith. Our slogan and philosophy, “One Gun, One Gunsmith,” is the direct result of how we build our guns. Once a pistol is built, the builder test fires the pistol to insure that it exceeds both The Nighthawk Standard, and his own. He then uses a metal stamp to imprint his initials under the left grip panel. While this is not the fastest, most efficient, or most cost-effective way to build a firearm, this shows the highest level of ownership, and it signifies the pride and commitment our gunsmiths take in the work they do.In addition to having the most talented gunsmiths in the industry building each gun by hand, Nighthawk also uses the highest quality parts and components to build each gun. All parts used in the pistols are fully machined from bar stock steel. This is the FM, Fully Machined Series of parts. Each part used is oversized and must be fit to each gun by hand - there are no drop-in, cast, or MIM parts used in the work we do. When the highest quality parts are combined with the most talented gunsmiths in the industry, through the process of One Gun, One Gunsmith, the resulting quality is unparalleled.Im asking a reasonable and more than fair $2500. No... I will not sell my Nighthawk for less than $2000 so please don’t bother wasting your time or mine. I will not ship. Must be willing to meet in person face to face. Valid GA drivers license is required for sale. Please feel free to call or text. I have tons of photos that are WAY, WAY better and I’m more than happy to send them to you if interested.

Bought new 3 yrs ago. Less tha 200 round count. Excellent for CCW. Includes factory concealment holster. Two extended magazines plus the standard mag. Includes everything seen in the pictures.From the Sig website: The P938 BRG finish with black Hogue rubber grips offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant edge finish and SIGLITE Night Sights. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters."

Starting in 2015, they shifted production of parts kit build guns (I.E early Wasr-10 and Wasr 10-63 rifles) to Wasr rifles built with only brand new parts. This means you get a better quality rifle with a cold hammer forged and chrome lined barrel with all new parts being built in the same factory that has been producing AK-47 style rifles for decades in Romania.Ive since replaced the front handguards with original correct Romanian laminate AKM pattern handguards, and replaced the factory plastic pistol grip with a Magpul MOE grip (I can throw in the original grip if you want). It comes with two Magpul MOE 30 round polymer magazines, and the original sling. Condition of the rifle is excellent, with very little wear marks present on the rifle and the bore is as bright and clean as it was coming into the US. This variant also DOES have the slant style muzzle break and bayonet lug, some of the ones for sale online at retailers do not have those features.The sale price for the rifle is $600 OBO, and Im only interested in trade deals that involve something with some cash thrown in (Ill list specifically what im looking for below, and im not interested in anything else at the moment). You can email me or call/text at 417-350-306seven, and im available pretty much all weekend to deal with you in the Nixa/Ozark/South Springfield area.

To charge the rifle the shooter released their hand from a firing grip, grabbed each side of the charging handle with the thumb and forefinger or the first two fingers , (while applying pressure to the latch) pulled the charging handle all the way to the rear, and then released it to charge the weapon. Like everything else in the last 45 years, tactics and weaponry have undergone a continuous evolution. Red dot optics get the shooter on target quicker, shorter barrels allow the operator to more quickly negotiate tighter urban areas, and operator’s manipulations of the weapon system have become much more efficient and faster. The current manual of arms has the operator maintaining a firing grip almost continuously while manipulating the weapon with the non-dominant hand in an effort to more quickly get the weapon ready to fire. With that premise, most weapon manipulations are done only with the shooter’s support hand; to include operating the charging handle. In order to perform an immediate action or charge the carbine, current CQB techniques have the operator racking the charging handle to the rear using their support side hand only. This is done in one swift and strong movement. With the operator’s firing grip maintained, the weapon again has a loaded chamber, and the shooter can immediately bring a hot weapon back into the fight. The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle and extended latches feature internal redesigns to direct the force off of the roll pin and into the body of the charging handle during support hand only manipulations. This new design has a built in backstop engineered into the extended latch and into the charging handle. As the latch is opened up, its’ travel is limited by these flat surface backstops. With this travel limiting feature, the stress is taken off the roll pin, and is now redirected into the entire body of the charging handle. The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle offers two significant advantages.   Since the tiny roll pin is no longer the weak point – it is a much stronger system and tactical latch will stay intact even under repeated support side only manipulation.   With the force kept inside the body of the handle, when the handle is pulled directly to the rear, it moves directly to the rear and does not angle off to the outboard side. A much smoother operation.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXNEvEvA4Fc&feature=youtu.be   Product Specifications   UPC Code: 855877004039   Manufacturer: Bravo Company   Manufacturer Part #: GFH 556 MOD A44   Model: Mod A44   Model: 5.56MM/223   Type: Charging Handle   Finish/Color: Black   Description: Ambidextrious Charging Handle   Subcategory: Long Gun Parts"
