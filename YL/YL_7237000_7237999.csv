Gorgeously Engraved, Gold Inlaid Maker Marked
 
Here we present an antique Nowotny Austrian Takedown Percussion Double Rifle, made circa 1850 in Vienna, Austria. Mathais Nowotny was the maker of this fine and beautiful double rifle. He began his business in Vienna in 1836 after moving from Hradec Kralove in Bohemia and gaining permission to operate. He became a gunmaker to the royal court and made extremely fine firearms. In about 1841 he took on Johann Springer, who married his sister, Catherine Nowotny. Springer was a master engraver from upper Hungary, who also learned to be a gunsmith. Particularly, he specialized in engraving aristocratic coat of arms. Nowotny was involved in a somewhat mysterious love triangle that went rather badly for him, and in 1856 he committed suicide. Nowotny’s widow sold the business to Johann Springer in 1857 and Springer’s business is still in operation to this day, as Joh. Springer’s Erben. Springer continued to produce fine, luxurious sporting and hunting arms for the likes of Kaiser Franz Josef, who gave him the “k.u.k. Chamber Title” in 1872 (“k.u.k. stands for “kaiserlich und königliche“ essentially meaning that he was the gunmaker to the king’s court). He went on to win many other awards at exhibitions because of the quality of his work. Johann Springer died in 1875 and was succeeded in his business first by his widow, and then by his two sons who apprenticed at the Brandlin company in Birmingham. Needless to say, this double rifle has pedigree, made by master craftsmen for the nobility of Europe.
 
This rifle has a full array of custom features that make it desirable for the hunter and the collector alike. It is easily taken down into two parts with the supplied wrench in the jaeger style, deer antler patchbox. Simply loosen and remove the small, decorative bolt in the bottom of the frame to be able to separate the two pieces at the breech. There is even a cross bolt safety that prevents the hammers from falling on the percussion nipples without first depressing the bar at the wrist. Depressing this bar pulls the bars in and lets the hammer have full range of motion. The right trigger has a single set function that allows the trigger to be pushed forward to make it as light as possible. The rear sight is a short, leaf variety so that one may have some elevation adjustment. The front sight is dovetailed and windage adjustable. Sling swivels are mounted on the gorgeous Damascus barrels.
 
Overall, this piece is extremely beautiful and almost certainly engraved by Johann Springer. It features primarily hunting motif with a stag (trigger guard), hounds (left lock), a big cat (right lock), and a wild boar being chased by dogs (bottom of the breech). There is also a curious little mustached face on the breech of the barrels. An Austrian count’s nine pointed crown on the tang contains the letters “EB”. Gold inlays are evident on the engraved butt plate and on the breech of the barrels and tang. The top of the barrel is inscribed “F Weiland in Cassel”. Fredrich Weiland was a gunsmith who likely made the barrels at his shop in Cassel (now Kassel), Germany, in what was then Hesse. This inscription is gold washed as well. “Nowotny” is engraved on the right lock plate, and “In Wien” (Vienna) is engraved on the left. “Patent” is engraved on the tang, just above the safety lever.
 
This double rifle is in fine overall condition. The bores are excellent, as is the action. The wood stock is very nice walnut and shows very few handling marks at all. Most of the gold wash remains and the engraving is in fine condition. The Damascus pattern is still beautiful. The ramrod appears original with a covered, threaded screw on one end and a tulip on the other. This piece is something you would expect to see in a museum in Europe.
 
Here is a wonderful piece of history from one of the foremost makers of fine hunting arms in the world.
 
Own the original! This is a legitimate antique and not a reproduction.
 
Barrel is 25.75 inches in length.
 
Caliber: .58 percussion
 
Bore is in fine condition. The firing mechanism is excellent.
 
Overall condition as seen in photos.
 
Here is a gorgeous Viennese hunting rifle with lots of great features, extensive engraving, an interesting story and an extensive pedigree.

The precision and reliability of Merkel safari rifles has delighted big game hunters and heads of state for generations. The 160 version combines the largest calibre with sidelocks – which also offers our engravers additional scope of decorating the long sidelocks. One of the most beautiful rifles – for the most exciting form of hunting.    The side-by-side rifle is the traditional gun used for high-class big game hunting - a hunting gun befitting its station. Classic areas of application are hunting situations where a quick and sure second shot is needed - e.g. the driven hunt. Merkel precision engineering has also made sure that the side-by-side rifle also cuts a good figure on the high seat. The set trigger option gives the gun precision-shot capability.The side-by-side rifle is not only a very elegant gun; it is also very reliable and responsive. All the mechanical systems are doubled and can thus function autonomously. That is the reason why experienced hunters value this rifle. To this day, the side-by-side rifle calls big game hunting in Africa to mind - but its legend lives on in every other region of the world. Inbuilt power and safety reserves are part of Merkel’s quality concept. The Merkel side-by-side rifle is the basis for the Merkel top-down principle for all side-by-side guns. The actions of lower load guns are identical with those of the high-power safari rifles - even if the side-by-side shotguns only fire low-load shot. Traditionally, the big game hunter in the stories told around the campfire and in yellowing photographs is always carrying a side-by-side gun. And not without reason: the hunt for dangerous game has its own set of rules. Rifles used for this type of adventure must fulfil very specific, demanding requirements. In addition to tried-and-tested highpower big game caliber, Merkel side-by-side rifles of the Africa series offer everything the hunter needs to successfully and safely meet the challenges of the Safari. Robustness, reliability and intuitive handling - these are the properties that matter when every split second counts. The recoil and balance of these unique rifles are optimised by the “inert mass” in the buttstock and barrel set, which have been exactly calculated by Merkel. The resultant greater weight reduces the recoil. This enables the gun to be kept on target for the rapid second shot - experience the Merkel Africa Express.Please Contact REDACTED for more information."

Cougar 8000 series pistols are recoil-operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. These pistols use a relatively rare rotating barrel locking system, in which the barrel rotates on recoil to unlock itself from the slide. The rotating motion of the barrel is controlled by the stud on its bottom, which follows the cam track in the steel frame insert. The frame is made from lightweight aluminum alloy. The basic version of the Cougar pistol is the F model, with double-action trigger with exposed hammer, and ambidextrous safety/decocker levers, located on the slide.

The Antique models unite traditional finish with state-of-the-art arms technology. The visually pleasing Antique models comprise a special colored case hardening finish of housing, bolt handle, breech plug cap, magazine cover, screw base, trigger guard, rear sight base and front sight base. In addition, barrel and system screws get a blued finish.  Besides the idea of visually pleasing design, this type of surface treatment provides technical advantages too. The process of hardening causes extremely hard surface conditions of the treated parts, which gives a higher wear resistance. Components treated this way have a higher resistance against corrosion and mechanical stress. The “Antique” models combine exquisite design, first class quality, long lifetime and excellent precision in one exclusive rifle. With this design we want to exceed the expectations of our customers and provide a genuine heirloom for generations to come. PICTURES DO NOT DO THIS GUN JUSTICE!!! IT IS BEAUTIFUL!!

To say that the last few years have had rather hit or miss quality is a widely accepted statement if you dont beleive me check FAL Files. The biggest issue has been since DSA has been making their own receivers in house. The LMT receivers have always been the standard for quality. I have gone through the issue of less than reliable DSA brand Magazines and replaced them with good quality surplus magazines that look like they were just produced no dents or rust on them. Less than 800 rounds fired through her. Cleaned and maintained consistently. No corrosive ammo shot through it either. Comes with 1 (probably Styer) mag in the traditional flat grey finish and 1 Inch mag converted (professionally) to work in the Metric FAL (all magazines are 20 round magazines) The hard case, Manuals, Sight adjustment tool, both the original bolt carrier and the inch ""sand cut"" carrier, and stock removal tool (I replaced the recoil springs around 500 rounds), and sling. This gun is 100%, about it is accurate and worthy of being a FAL. No rust, No scratches, slight wear of finish on the gas collar and the customary brass marks just to the rear of the ejection port.
