I have less than 500 rounds through this gun and have maintained it impeccably. I love this gun, it has one of the smoothest double action pulls I have shot with, and it is no longer being made by Beretta, but I have 5 other carry guns, let alone all the other pistols I have, so something has to go. There have been absolutely no issues with the gun. Any viewing or transaction will take place at Granite State Indoor Range in Hudson, NH, in accordance with all applicable laws. I have additional pictures I can send if desired. I also have a rear Trijicon night sight that has never been installed that will be included with the gun.The price is fair (the gun and the accessories cost me over $1800) and firm. I am willing to accept offers from outside of NH, but shipping will be from my FFL to your FFL at YOUR EXPENSE (typically $45). If you cannot buy the gun in person and give me cash, the only other acceptable form of payment is USPS money orders (since they max out at $1000 you will need two money orders and cost less than $2 each). I will not accept personal, cashiers or bank checks (certified or therwise) and this is not a topic for negociation. If you are unable to meet in person and use cash, and are unwilling to use USPS money orders it is simple: don’t put in an offer. I am not interested in trades unless you have either a working recent Sig P210 in excellent condition or a working Benelli M2 20 gauge 24” barrel shotgun in excellent condition. I might consider a Sig 320 RX that has already been through the “voluntary upgrade” from Sig plus cash. Offers of other trades will be deleted without a response. Thanks."

This was my first concealed carry gun. I am the only owner the gun has had, and I have taken meticulous care of it. It is in great condition and has been utterly reliable. But my bad back has caused me to move to a smaller carry gun. The SR9c is a good gun for concealed carry, home defense, and range plinking. When I first got it, I used it in each of those capacities. I've since accumulated other guns for specific purposes, and this was used only for carry. Now that I've been forced to move to a smaller gun, I can't justify holding onto it even though it's a terrific all-purpose pistol.I purchased it new in May of 2016. It came with a Ruger cardboard box, Ruger lock, owner's manual, and a couple of 10-round magazines with flush floorplates and pinky extensions for both.I am including everything that came with it, as well as $150 worth of extras:- Two 17-round Ruger magazines- One  Ruger grip extender for the 17-round magazines- A nice Ruger softcase- Like-new Alien Gear Cloak Tuck 3 IWB holster, worn less than 10 hours (I generally used a custom IWB leather holste; the Alien Gear was my attempt to see if a different holster would help my back, so I didn't use it much; the leather holster is NOT included)Specs from Ruger:- Fires 9mm Luger ammo- 3.4″ barrel- 6.85″ overall length1.27″ across (at widest point, but the grip is barely over an inch)- 4.61`” overall height- Stainless steel slide- High performance glass-filled nylon frame- Double-stack 10-round magazine- Extended 17-round magazine with grip extension comes with some models and is available for all models- Weighs 23.4oz- Ambidextrous thumb safety- Ambidextrous D-shaped magazine release- Reversible backstrap- Integral accessory mounting rail- Dovetailed, high-visibility 3-dot sights that are adjustable- Slide serrations to improve grip- Finger grip extension floorplate and well as flush floorplate- 1.10″ RH twistAsking $425 OBO, which seems pretty good since everything included cost me close to $600. Cash or certified funds only. If you think my price is too low, snatch it up. If you think my price is too high, send me a reasonable offer, and I'll listen. I prefer cash but am willing to consider trades (particularly a Ruger AR-556). All laws will be followed, and I will prepare a bill of sale. I don't have a burning need to sell it, so I won't consider unreasonable low-balls. I'm an attorney, so please don't waste my time or yours with scam attempts. In the event of a trade, I have a concealed carry permit. FTF in Triangle. I will not ship, so don't bother asking. I will ask to see a concealed carry permit or a pistol purchase permit (which I will have to keep if you don't have a concealed carry permit)."
