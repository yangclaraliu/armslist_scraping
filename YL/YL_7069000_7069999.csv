Like the FN-FAL, the Kel Tec RFP gas piston system has an adjustable regulator called the ""gas restrictor cap"". This device adjusts the amount of gas that is delivered to the piston, to compensate for the ammunition, weather conditions, and other variables to ensure reliable operation of the action.   Forward Ejection: the empty cartridge case is not ejected with the rearward movement of the bolt and carrier, but is held by the extractors until the bolt is moving forward chambering a cartridge. At that time, the empty case is tilted slightly upward, and is released by the extractors into the ejection chute as the bolt closes on the freshly-chambered round. The empty case then slides forward, out through a hole in the gas block.

First thing I would disclose is that I was actually told by the gentleman that traded it to me that his grandfather brought the gun back from World War II. I cannot confirm nor deny that this is true but it's definitely hard to prove considering most of what I read on the internet suggest if this was a Nazi gun it would have the Nazi markings on it which it does not. However they do also confirm that these guns were indeed carried by the Japanese and German soldiers as a helmet pistol. The term helmet pistol actually originated because the very definition is at this little pistol would be placed to the back of the helmet of a wounded soldier who could not be taken from Battle and he would be killed so as not to leak any information to the enemy if he was captured.Only to add to the potential controversy I discovered articles that clearly State Japanese soldiers did indeed have to purchase their own small caliber pistols and these Mausers were actually very popular. In addition it stated that it was not extremely uncommon for German soldiers to have small caliber guns on them that were not manufactured for war of which they traded items to the Japanese to obtain with intentions of taking them home.In conclusion the gun most definitely could have been taken off of a dead soldier in World War II. I was told that it was indeed and I can say with the utmost honesty that the individual seemed very straightforward and honest. So therefore I am agreeing that it was indeed brought back from war although again I cannot prove it.Open to trades

Comes in the original box with all docs and both mags. These are finely made ruggedly reliable workhorse guns that I still think look and feel just plain badass. Bore is super clean, barrel show almost no signs of even being shot. Admittedly the lower frame does show some signs of holster wear, but the grip and frame still bear the white inlay that often gets scrubbed or worn off. This 457 features the bobbed hammer that is much more desirable for carry. The magazine disconnect is still in place from factory, further pointing to very little if any use; the first mod many shooters do is to disable this ""feature"". All in all a fine piece of craftsmanship even with the minor wear. If I didn't have another one I'd never let it go. Manufatured in 2003.

This Kit contains both medication, Mifepristone and Misoprostol in the recommended dosage in one pack. Mifepristone is an anti-progesterone agent which is taken as the primary drug for medical abortion. Misoprostol pills, on the other hand are prostaglandin analogue and are ecbolic in nature. Both Mifepristone and Misoprostol work together to first block the progesterone hormone which is responsible for supporting the embryo. In the absence of this hormone the embryo becomes separated and is then flushed out through vaginal discharge with the help of contractions caused by the Misoprostol pills.

I cut the barrel to 19 inches from the closed chamber position so there could be no denying that the barrel is legal and the overall length of the whole gun is 37 inches.. I put on the weaver rail and mounted a Sightmark Ultra Shot QD Digital reflex sight to it. I put the 12"" Houge overmold butt stock on which makes it a little more shorter and a Houge overmold foregrip.. It has a 6 round TacStar side saddle on it. I mounted a small rail to the magazine tube and put on a Streamlight TLR-1 HL tactical light which puts out a really bright 800 lumens.. Every single part on the gun that was replaced or the items added to it are all brand new. I have 420 dollars just in parts and accessories (not including what I paid for the gun). It's a very solid gun that you feel like you could throw it around, run over it, and beat it up and it would still be a gun to rely on... My name is Chris and can be reached by text at REDACTED..

I replaced the feed latch, O-ring, firing pin, firing pin spring, and recoil spring with brand new parts as they're cruicial to the gun's function. I have noticed that this gun prefers to have heavier loads to properly cycle the bolt. Light birdshot loads will not have enough nuts to kick the bolt back and eject out, this will cause the firing pin to not reset properly, but if you're using sabots through the rifled barrel and buckshot, rifled slugs, and heavier birdshot loads though the smoothbore with the modified choke, it'll cycle perfectly. This is by far my most favorite deer gun.The rifled barrel is for 2 3/4 shells and the lands and grooves are in mint condition. It is equiped with Trijicon Tru-Glo sights, making it easier to se your sights at duck and dawn. It's extremely accurate and I've had no issue hitting targets at ~200yards with Federal and Hornady Sabots. There're no significant dings or dents on the barrel or reciever. and the wood pieces have normal wear and tear, the buttstock's only damage being the piece chipped off that doesnt affect function and isn't noticeable when shouldered.The smoothbore barrel accepts up to 3"" Magnum shells and has a fixed, modified choke. It holds well with buckshot and heavy loads of birdshot. It has no sights, but point and shoot and it's very communicative with hand-eye coordination. There are a few blemishes on this barrel, but this doesn't ruin the function of the gun in and case. I went through and ensured that the internals have been cleaned and oiled properly before putting this up for sale, and the exterior is just ready to shine and turn some heads. Ready to shoot right out of the case, this gun is eager to please."
