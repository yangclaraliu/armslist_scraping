The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The Ancient Greek phrase μολὼν λαβέ (molṑn labé; reconstructed Ancient Greek pronunciation) means ""Come and take them"". It is a classical expression of defiance reportedly spoken by King Leonidas I in response to the Persian army's demand that the Spartans surrender their weapons at the Battle of Thermopylae.

To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.

The big competitor for the Ruger 1911's is the Remington Stainless 1911.  But there's really no comparison... the Ruger wins that battle in every way.  Lighter trigger, better materials, better hammer... I could go on and on.  

Price is $600 with ammo.  I know it's a good deal.  Grab it while you can.

Full size 1911 with one 8-round magazine ($550), one 7-round Colt factory magazine ($35 - not pictured), WRB XMH holster with thumb break and magazine pouch ($30 - not pictured), zippered locking soft case ($19), rubber Hogue grips with finger grooves ($20), wood Hogue Sig Sauer grips ($50), 8 brand new 16 lb recoil springs ($75), a .45 caliber cleaning kit ($12), 20 rounds of Federal Premium low recoil Hydra Shok ammo ($28), and an antique leather shoulder holster with built-in spring retention ($?).  The prices listed don't include taxes, fees, shipping, etc.

I've put exactly 132 rounds through the pistol. The previous owner bought it and kept it new, but he apparently dropped it so there's a ding on the front left side of the slide, and the left corner of the hammer and safety. Nothing which affects the shootability of this gun. This is considered one of the best entry-level 1911's, and shoots great. Perfect if you're trying to decide if you want to go a 1911 route without paying for an expensive name, or looking for a project gun to test your gunsmithing skills on (not that it needs anything).

The previous owner told me the leather shoulder holster is from WWII, but there's no markings. It's in pretty rough shape. The holster needs some stitching and the shoulder strap is cracking or split in several places.

Feel free to make me an offer. I know funds are pretty tight for a lot of us right now, so while I prefer cash I'm open to trades, especially partial trades with some cash. I can add ammo, etc instead of cash if you have something I want that's worth significantly more.

Do NOT ask what my bottom dollar is or if I still have this - I won't respond. And please don't send me any truly insulting offers. It's not a must-sell situation and I'm perfectly happy keeping this around if it doesn't sell this weekend.  The only things I will strip out at your request is the shoulder holster and the ammo. Otherwise it's a package deal.  Feel free to ask any other questions you may have.  I'd prefer to meet Friday or Sunday afternoon/evening, but if you HAVE to meet on Saturday I can probably swing it.

I might have just the gun for you. Picked up the gun in pretty rough shape, gave it an extremely thorough sonic and manual cleaning. Custom mirror highlights on the receiver, bead blasted finish on the rest, lighter bluing than typical to match the light wood furniture, refinished hand rubbed pores filled furniture. Yeah it's a little over MSRP but the matchless highlights and the wood refinish definitely make this gun stand out from other run of the mill bird guns and I've put about $1000 worth of work into it if I were to bill for the labor I performed. Willing to drive reasonable distance to meet at your FFL or we can pick a midpoint if you're a ways out.

Use your XD-S® Single Stack with an X-Tension™ magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there.

If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack  in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable"

The gun has seen a couple hundred rounds through it and always cleaned and stored properly. It still looks new.

It has the magazine eject button on the right side of the pistol which, along with the ambidextrous slide release lever, makes it about as left handed as you can get without spending a lot on a custom job. The changeover was done properly, so there's none of the issues with loading, feeding, or ejecting that so many homemade jobs complain about online. However, you can swap the magazine eject button over pretty easily if you're right handed. Also, if you're right handed I can include a brand new Blade-Tech kydex OWB holster with it for extra.

**Please Note: the fiber optic sights on the gun in the picture are NOT included. The standard M&P sights have been reinstalled by Fletcher's Arms, who had replaced them originally. No garage gun smithing on this piece!

Do NOT ask me what my lowest price is or if this is still available - I won't respond. Feel free to ask any legitimate questions but please don't waste my time unless you're actually interested in handing over cash for this. No trades unless you have something worth significantly more that I can sell to get the cash.

Stuff I have for barter:

LG 26in TV I bought for $300, it's been very lightly used since then & in excellent working condition. Works great! Great TV for a bedroom or office. Comes with remote & power cord. Multiple HDMI etc. 

Vintage 1960's/70's CVA .50 cal (.490 roundball) Percussion Black Powder Rifle Kit (Incomplete) I bought this from an estate sale to get the missing parts & build but never did; It's the wooden unfinished stock & barrel only. The barrel has a few light superficial rust spots from sitting in storage but is in good shape & restorable. The other parts should be findable with some effort. Made in Spain. 

Panasonic Toughbook CF-28 – I bought it from a police auction a while back for a project but never ended up using it. I got it to boot up to bios; but haven't played with it further. Besides some scuffs from use it's in very good shape & appears to work completely. Not included: AC Power Cable or Hard Drive. Everything else is included; battery, hd caddy, full laptop. This is an Ultra Rugged laptop; water resistant, shock resistant, emp resistant, etc. These are going for $100-$200 on the used market & ebay.

Vintage Pyrex Laboratory Heavy Wall 5gal/19L Carboy. It was manufactured probally in the 1950's but is in perfect conditional & fully functional. These are going for $200-$300 on the used market & ebay.

US General AC Manifold Set W/Guages – I got this for a project but never used it; it's brand new in it's case. New these are going for $60-$80

Mens Snowshoes – These are Youkon Charlies brand, I paid about $120 for these, only used them a few times but they are in great shape & work well! Easy to adjust straps to strap to your feet. Great for the truck or cabin or for winter hunting/snowshoeing! Makes getting though deep snow a sinch!

2 Tripplite 16 outlet commercial power strips. Great condition, full alluminum construction & cost me $100 ea new.

Petzl Ascention L & R Mechanical Accenders, lightly used in great shape (I paid $200/pair New) 

Kevlar Climbing/Caving/Rescue Helmet, lightly used in great shape (I paid $350 New)

2 Antique handblown glass wine bottles from the 18th century (colonial times 1750's) Appraiser valued them at $250-$350 ea

Foster's Beer sign, Vintage & used to hang at a local bar. Appraiser appraised it at $150-$200. Glass & framed, great condition.

Pelican 1500 Case, no foam. Used to use as a trauma case for medical supplies, great condition & decals can come off. I paid $150 for it new

Code 3 48in model 360 high end emergency vehicle lightbar. I bought it a few years ago to use on my search & rescue vehicle, but I never got around to it & am no longer with SAR, so with bills coming due I thought I would see if anyone locally could put it to good use. It just needs a new power cord (not a big deal; when removed from previous vehicle & sold by the police department, they cut the power cords on all for easy removal; could easily be spliced or replaced for not much.

Currently has red & blue lenses as was used on a police command vehicle, but can easily be swapped out for blue, red, amber, green, clear, purple, etc. Or can be used as is, would make a great prop, attention getter, decoration, etc. Extremely bright, one of the reasons this model is so expensive is because it has a sophisticated array of high end lights built in, from take downs & arrows, strobes, etc. The perfect lightbar for your emergency vehicle! Also great for construction, roadside assistance, police, law enforcement, towing, security, ambulances, ems, fire, search & rescue, disaster relief, snow plows, etc."

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year.

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose.

The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select
one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change
everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance."

Custom shaved Hammer
5.45x39 surplus ammo generally requires a stiffer spring in order to sufficiently strike the primer. This results in a heavier trigger pull. In order to avoid this, I shaved down the hammer, lowering its weight and thus increasing its velocity. This results in a successful primer strike 100% of the time, without the heavier trigger pull. A heavier spring is also provided, should you prefer that option.

It was coated with some black paint to blend in. The barrel has around 500 rounds through it and I was able to get a few 3 shot groups with a handload down to .57"" at 100yd.

Remington 1100 tactical Tac 2 semi auto 12 gauge. Speed feed pistol grip stock, extended charging handle, +2 mag extension. This has an 18 inch smooth bore, improved cylinder, beaded barrel that has been gunsmithed to feed reduced recoil buckshot. The gunsmith fired 50 rounds of Remington reduced recoil buckshot to check function. That is the only rounds fired since it arrived from factory. I am also including a Remington manufactured 21 inch rifled barrel with cantilever. This barrel has not been altered to cycle reduced recoil, it is brand new in box. This is an amazing 3 gun starter. The receiver is drilled and tapped for a mount if you plan on using the smooth bore with an optic. Or a low powered scope or red dot can be zeroed on the cantilever on the slug barrel and it stays zeroed even when the barrel is removed."

40 rounds Hungarian Silver/Yellow tip. This ammo has a 182 grain steel core bullet.   
It hits much harder than the light ball that's currently available, and it penetrates like crazy.  
It also shoots a good deal more accurately in my rifles.

20 rounds East German M39 ammo. This ammo has an all black color 124 grain steel jacketed, steel core bullet. It was originally designed as practice ammo for their machine guns. The concept was that the lighter bullet would travel less far. It is however a full power round and will penetrate 1/4"" steel plate at 100 yards. Recoil is greatly reduced due to the lighter bullet making it perfect for anyone who is sensitive to recoil.   

20 rounds Bulgarian brass case with a 149 grain magnetic bullet. Ammo is from the mid 50's but looks like it was made yesterday. It's super clean ammo and I've always felt brass cased ammo operated more smoothly than the steel case stuff.

20 rounds Red Tracer loaded on 4 Mosin stripper clips. Trace lights around 100 yards and continues another 700 - 800 yards. Visible in daylight but spectacular in low light conditions.

20 rounds Green Tracer. Very similar to the red tracer above except burn color is green. It's also packed on 4 Mosin stripper clips.

Great rifles, but I never shoot it as much as my other ARs

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.

**Please note that the Vortex scope is for sale separately

Price WITHOUT Optic: $1200

___________________________________________________

Bottom Rifle: This rifle is a great optics ready carbine. The upper is a Bushmaster factory upper with 16"" chrome lined barrel and lightweight profile. It has a fixed mil-spec front sight on it, and I swapped the furniture out for some Magpul furniture and vertical pistol grip. I have a Diamond rear sight that is on at 100yds. The lower is a DPMS lower with mil-spec trigger and some more Magpul furniture including pistol grip with storage, enhanced trigger guard for shooting with gloves, and lightweight 6 position buttstock.

Price: $750 or make an offer

 If you're looking for non-magnetic 7.62x39 range ammo, then Sellier & Bellot's 7.62x39 ammo is an excellent choice. This high quality brass cased ammo does not contain steel in the projectile making it acceptable to shoot at ranges that have a non-magnetic ammo only policy. Brass casings also offer the added benefit of being more corrosion resistant making them more suitable for long-term storage as well as being reloadable."

The Beretta was probably once a duty gun as there is holster wear on the firearm.  Insides look fine along with shiny bore.  The Stevens has a side mounted Mossberg scope and is extremely accurate.  The stock appears to have been refinished but looks good.  The metal has the typical patina for the age but is missing the iron sights.  The Daisy has peep sights.  It really needs a rebuild because it works intermittently.  The Kassnar 45 cal muzzleloader I was told was a kit gun from the 70's.  I would agree and would probably consider it a wall hanger but look it over...who knows.  The Mossberg 500 20ga receiver is stripped except for the safety.  Last is a vintage crossbow.  I never messed with it or put it together...so unsure if usable as is or not.  I have 50rds of 9mm and a few 50rd boxes of .22 match ammo that the Stevens shot VERY well.  Oh and there is a used Tasco 3-9 scope with wear....but usable."

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x8"" Text or call Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the complete set of Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates would be $300.00"
