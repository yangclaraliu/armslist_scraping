I'm offering you a chance to come down and try out one of the biggest badass rifles made!!!
with the Muzzle brake on this rifle it has the kick of a .243 hunting rifle, even a 7yr old could shoot this rifle!!!!
I'm disabled and had to sell my Barrett because it beat me up to much, this rifle cost me double what the Barrett cost.
So here is my offer....
I'm willing to meet down here by my farm to take you out to shoot up to a 1000yrd shot
will cost $125 per person for 3rds down range,
will do a full mag of 10rds for $200 per person
will do up to 5 people in a group, with minimum 2 shooters.
also will consider kids from ages 10 up who have gone through gun safety....
 or for $50 per person I will do a about hr long safety class with them first before going out. to make sure they understand firearms and how Dangerous or Fun they can be if handled properly.
it takes me over 2hrs to tear down the rifle and clean it, and hr to put it back together
this doesn't include ware on rifle from shooting, this is over a $9k rifle set up
so only will to see how this plays out if I keep doing it.......
if you want, we can go to one of the only gun ranges that allows these rifles you will cover the range fee's, is located in Rochester. I live Southbend/Raymond Area
 but I live out in the country and we can legally shoot in the woods where we have a mountain as a back stop because of how far this rd will travel..
we always take safety first!!!!
not many people will offer you to come shoot a $9,000. rifle for kicks and bragging rights so this might not be up long will see how it plays out....
*First and for most no one who can NOT own a firearm will be allowed to shot this rifle.
THIS MEANS...
NO Felony's OR PENDING....
NO DV Cases OR PENDING....
NO Restraining orders Against you! OR PENDING....
and last if you have been declared with a Mental Illness...

if you Carry a *CWP/CPL this is a plus and I won't have to have your name ran by the Sheriff's before going out to shoot.
*Warning* if any of these apply to you understand it is against the law and 1 yr in jail for being around/shooting/owning firearms when you can't.....
don't want anyone to get in trouble so warning you in advance not to write and try to shoot this rifle. because the Sheriffs will have your info and will deal with it, so best just not write...
ok now that we got that out there...
I will also do part trade part cash 1/2 & 1/2 for other firearms/rifles
just ask most I can do is say no thank you...

**minimum of 2 shooters to bring this big rifle out.**

I also have AR/AK or a Siaga 12g 20rd barrel drum -we can talk about if that is one you want to try out...

**also for anyone who comes to shoot the rifle I will give them a yellow tip .50BMG Russian Armor pricing rd to keep as a keepsake memory of shooting the rifle....***"

Up for sale is my Mossberg 75A bolt-action 20-gauge shotgun, built around the start of WWII. It's a cool old gun I thought I'd hang on to for a longer time, but I don't like owning safe queens/dust collectors, and it's a shame this never gets used. Hopefully it will somewhere else.

This single-shot 75A has great wood, especially for its age. There is one tiny crack in the stock, highlighted in the photo, which has not affected me and can easily be fixed. There is also a dab of White Out on the bead sight, just to help spot clays in low light. That also can easily be removed. Since it's a 20-guage, this would make a great starter gun for a child, a good backup gun, or simply something unique, fun, and cheap to add to your collection.

I'd like $120 for the shotgun but am open to reasonable offers. I would also trade for a spam can of 7.62x54r ammo.

Planned this one out over a while and sent it off to be dimpled, cerakoted, and assembled by M. Pitts, so it has been done right. Never bought another lower to put it on, so it has been sitting unused for a while and needs to go. Fired less than 20 rounds to site in BUIS (not included) and test function. It is a very soft shooter balanced very well with the URX3.1/dimpled barrel.

I bought this out the front knife at the Denver Gun Show 2 years ago, I carried it for a while but I never use it for anything.

 It is heavy duty construction, made of high grade steel with 6 very small brass screws holding it together with and a pocket clip for easy access when needed. 

All you need to do is move the lever on the side to open & close it, it opens and closes very fast, plus it is very sharp.

This knife is approximately 4 & 5/8"" long closed, 1/2"" thick, 1"" wide, the blade is 3 & 3/8"" long with a weight of 3.9 ounces, this is a heaver than the plastic or pot metal knifes but it will last 100 times longer, with the pocket clip it is not noticeably heavy in your pocket. This knife could save your life. 

If interested reply by email or call REDACTED for more information. My price is firm, but feel free to make a reasonable offer or trade, you never know, I may accept it.

311,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3264311,For Sale:  Springfield Armory Lightweight Champion Operator .45,"Pierce County, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,100","Listed On: Thursday, July 10, 2014",Handguns,Springfield                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"One of my favorites sits and no longer gets love, so up she goes to someone who can love and appreciate her more than I can.  

I bought this Springfield Armory Lightweight Champion Operator .45 brand new in 2009 and have shot it four times, for a grand total of 200 rounds through it.  She's been carried a few times, but has mainly resided in the safe and well kept and cared for.  I had the hammer, sear, disconnector, sear spring and hammer spring upgraded to Nighthawk tool steel parts, and the trigger was also cleaned up to eliminate any creep and to break cleaner than factory. You'd have to feel the trigger to know what I'm talking about.  Night sights are factory and very bright, and the pistol shoots amazingly well. I also had the plastic mainspring housing and ILS lock removed and replaced it with an all steel Nighthawk flat mainspring housing, and the feed ramp was hand polished to ensure reliability.  I hate to see this pistol go, but she must.

Besides the pistol, it will come with all factory goodies (plastic case, manual, factory magazines), five (5) Wilson Combat 47D magazines (four stainless and one black with a flat floorplate to fit the gun for carry), and a a right hand black DeSantis three slot pancake holster which is very comfortable for all day wear.  Basically, this gun's ready to be carried the moment you get it.  It was meticulously cleaned and lubed after every range session using Hoppe's 9 and Shooter's Choice grease.  

Also, there is a slight idiot mark on the slide above the takedown lever, but otherwise the pistol is in excellent condition.  There is 3M Stair Tread tape on the frontstrap for traction, and rubber o-rings on the grip bushings to ensure the grip screws don't back out.

They're getting harder and harder to find, and the upgrades from MIM to tool steel make this a pistol worthy of passing down to your son or daughter when it's time.

Asking $1100 FIRM / CASH ONLY and you MUST have a Washington State driver's license and valid concealed pistol license to buy.  No trades at all, please; only interested in selling this pistol.  Also, I live in Pierce County and am willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet you.  

I am hoping for a quick sale so if you are free today and would like to see or buy this pistol, please text me for best results as I will be in and out all day.  Text only to 253 six eight zero 98 seven seven.

In 1926, Italian-born immigrants Costabile and Gianicola Matarazzo decided to begin manufacture of their own shot shells and metallic cartridges instead of using imported ones and – thus – the Fabrica Nacional de Cartuchos e Municoes (F.N.C.M.) was born. Their production of 7x57mm ammunition, then in use by the Brazilian Army, by 1932, reaches 30,000 rounds/day.
In 1936 the company is taken over by the DuPerial group, a joint-venture between USA’s Remington Arms and Britain’s Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and its name is changed to Companhia Brasileira de Cartuchos (CBC). The arrival of American-made equipment, in 1938, enables CBC to increase its daily output of 7x57mm cartridges from 30,000 to 100,000. With the beginning of World War II in 1939, all of its output is directed to the Brazilian military.
Production of .22 Long Rifle ammunition begins in 1953 with a yearly output of 2.5 million rounds. By 1957 this figure had reached 23 million rounds/year.
Year 1960 saw the beginning of firearms production, with technology supplied by Remington Arms. In 1962 production of the Brazilian version of the Remington Nylon 66 rifle begins. Exports of single-shot break-open shotguns to the USA begin in 1966.
In 1979 CBC was nationalized with 70% of its shares being bought by its directors, Messrs. Libero Cerroti, Leonardo Galassi and Tiberio Stein. The remaining 30% were bought by IMBEL (Industria Brasileira de Material Belico), an Army-owned company (which, today, makes the M.1911-type pistols sold by Springfield Armory).
With DuPont’s Nylon no longer available for manufacture of the Nylon 66 rifle, CBC contacts Rhodia (chemical and pharmaceutical company belonging to the Rhone-Poulenc group) for a replacement material and Rhodia develops a virtually similar polymer specially for CBC."

This new load is designed for only certain revolvers that have the cylinder length to handle it. They are as follows; Ruger Red Hawk, Ruger Super Red Hawk, Ruger Super Blackhawk or Vaquero, Freedom Arms Model 83, Taurus Raging Bull, Colt Anaconda and Dan Wesson Revolvers. Suitable rifles include T/C Encore, ""modified"" Marlin 1894, Winchester 1894, any rifle with a falling block action and the Handi Rifle. 

What do we mean above by ""modified"" Marlin? Marlin (for an unknown, not well thought out reason) is using a very slow rate of twist (1/38 inches) on their 1894 chambered in 44 mag. Because of this slow rate of twist, the heaviest bullet that the factory Marlin will stabilize is about 270grs. Other firearm makers that chamber for the 44 mag all use a much faster rate of twist so that their guns will stabilize and therefore accurately shoot bullets over 300grs. Many folks today want their 44 magnums to be able to utilize the heavy 300gr. and heavier bullets - Marlin has not figured this out. If you want decent accuracy out of our new +p+ load in a Marlin, it will need to be re-barreled with a twist rate of roughly 1/20 inch. I have Dave Clay re-barrel all my Marlin 1894's with a faster twist barrel. A 44 magnum that wont accurately shoot 300gr. or heavier bullets is useless to me. Call him at REDACTED for pricing.

This load brings a level of power to the 44 mag. that has never before been known."

This is the cheapest price you will ever see for a FN FNC para.The FN, FNC (Fabrique Nationale carbine) assualt rifle is regarded as one of the best assault rifles ever convceived. The FNC uses a reliable, regulated gas piston design similar to that found on high end AR's but more commonly with the AK-47 and FAL style battle rifles. The FNC is the predecessor to the new FN SCAR. The FNC uses any US M-16 or AR style magazines but also has a specific magazine made by FN, the FNC steel magazines with a metal follower.This model is the Paratrooper folding stock variant. This design is a favorite among collectors. This model also has an integrated, notched, flip up grenade launcher and sight that automatically redirects gas to fire the grenades when the sight is flipped up. The gas system on the FNC is able to be regulated for pressure. The US M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, is loosly based on the FNC design.

Includes:
3  ten round magazines, 2 with finger rest extension, 1 without
(the magazine without the finger rest does not hold open the slide after last round due to modifications)
Basic aftermarket hard case. (Plano)

The pistol functions great.  It has been used in NSSF competitions and will hold its own against target model Rugers and Brownings. The 5 inch barrel allows it to cycle reliably with standard velocity ammo and even some subsonics.

One of the magazines has an issue. It was modified in an attempt to increase capacity, but the modification failed.  Thus it will hold 11 rounds, but will only actually feed 10 of them.  Thus it has a snap cap (dummy round) that just stays in it as the last round.  It still functions fine as a 10 round magazine, it just looks a little funny.

This has been my ""everything gun"" for a few years; competition, home defense, hiking/camping, and daily concealed carry.  I have recently acquired a S&W M&P and have decided to stick with that for future competition and home defense. Thus I am selling the Walther so I can get a dedicated CC pistol and/or another rifle.

Due to new laws in CO, we must use an FFL to run a background check for the transfer. I have one in town I like to use, or I can meet at one of your choice. I will pay half the transfer fee up to $20. (Don't even bother asking me to make the sale without a background check.  As much as I hate the new laws, its not worth risking my rights and my security clearance over a matter of $20.)"

I've had this for about two years now and I was never a great shot with it. It has a near perfect bore, which is quite shiny, and improved action. The action was improved to help cycle rounds better, and for most ammo I've used, it's quite smooth. There are some rounds that it doesn't like, but I've mostly used silver tip Bulgarian surplus (I've cleaned the rifle thoroughly after shooting to prevent corrosion). There are a few parts of the stock that were messed up from shipping, but if you wish to refinish the stock it would be easy. The rifle is a 1943 Izhevsk with the scope serial number matching the secondary serial number on the side of the receiver. The scope is in fantastic shape despite being almost as old as the rifle. It is Soviet made scope from Omsk plant 325 ""progress"", it has refubish mark on it and I think the mount is a reproduction. This is one of the earlier rifles imported from the Molot factory into the USA. Overall, the rifle is in fantastic shape and needs somebody to appreciate it more than I do. I will throw in a soft case and 20 rounds of Bulgarian surplus ammo. I will send additional photos upon request."

Well, I'm here to tell you ladies, THIS is a tactical shotgun.... Great for zombie hunting, space alien fighting or just scaring the life out of whoever is stupid enough to break into your house. 
It all started with a Mossberg 500 with extended mag tube (7+1) Then I added custom aluminum quad rail and ATI adjustable stock, FAO Israeli made combat forgrip and Magpul angled grip. An Apex Gear 3 tiered rough service scope, 5 round side saddle shell holder, custom ""Smile, Wait for Flash"" Magazine cap and to top it off a combat used  Surefire light with IR lens that my son brought back from Afghanistan. 
Shotgun is in great shape with only a couple of minor scuff marks, the Surefire light is beat, scraped, chewed on and has a chip in the IR lens cover from having it jammed in the teeth of an unfortunate Taliban  who said ""Come at me, Bro..."" And by the way, it works great.
Now the icing on the cake... with this I will include 68 rounds of 12 gauge exotic Ammo.

26 rounds Dragons Breath... Shoots Magnesium shot 100 ft (flame thrower ammo)
10 rounds Ball and chain ammo  (14 mm steel balls connected with 3"" braided cable)

It's a Steyr Gewehr 88 from 1890, way before WWI when the German Empire still had a Kaiser (emperor) and looks to be having used in the fight with the Ottoman Empire (Persia, now Iran). It is also often erroneously referred to as “Mauser” or “Mannlicher”.

It has all the hallmarks and markings that make this a rifle to have, from the Emperor's crown to the Ottoman insignia. 

Kaiser Wilhelm II was Germany's last emperor and this baby could have seen action in Iran, then the 1st World War, on to WWII.

The bore's rifling is still exceptional an the rifling twist is incredible, especially with this extra long barrel. Rounds chamber tight and the rifle works flawlessly, we shot 2 boxes and the accuracy is incredible! You can actually see those 8mm extra large bullets hit where they impact, even at a distance. Speaking of which, it has a flip up sight for long range shots. Whatever you hit with this baby, it's going down hard...

With the sight in regular mode, it is sighted to 273 yards, then you can flip it up and it's range is from 500 yards, with approx. 110 yard increments to a total range of 2187 yards.

5 shot clip, which can be strip loaded for fast reloading...

At 124 years of age this puppy will give most modern rifles a run for the money especially in accuracy, my buddy with his scoped rifle couldn't believe the distances that this will hit at, without even a scope.

REAL German quality, even after a 124 years, it becomes very apparent when shooting it.

While you can just hang it on your wall as a show off rife, it will be a real joy to shoot, take it hunting and show your buddies how it's done Old School...

You WILL NOT run across another one like, it is very rare...

I purchased this P7 from a good friend who bought several years ago.  It is a German police issued handgun and the serial number indicates a 1983 manufacture.  The grade on it is an ""A"" and the gun shows no signs of abuse.  It has the flush bottom magazine release as opposed to the one that sticks out.  I have not shot it since I got it and my friend didn't put too many rounds through it.  I have thoroughly cleaned it and looked at it and it does fit the ""A"" grade.  It comes with two magazines and the Black plastic box, manual and gas port cleaning brush.

I also have an IWB Matt Del Fatti holster for it.  For those who don't know or have tried a Del Fatti holster, in my years of carrying a handgun I have not found another holster maker that makes an IWB holster that is as comfortable as a Del Fatti.  He is swamped with orders and has not taken any new orders in a very long time.  This one is Black with the matching single magazine pouch.

I am asking $1000.00 for the P7 (what I paid), and $250.00 for the Del Fatti holster and magazine pouch.  I've seen them recently listed for over $300.00 for the holster and over $120.00 for the magazine pouch.

If you want the package (P7 and holster/magazine) I would let them go for $1150.00.

I would need to see a valid WA. CPL for the sale.

Please pm me with your email address and I will send some photos.

I bought this scope last year and did one week of Elk hunting and two range trips. Sold the gun it was mounted on and then bought new rings for it. Have decided I don't need it anymore. $250 includes scope and rings along with box and all papers (scope is $299 online and I paid $50 for the rings). This scope has a LIFETIME warranty from Vortex that follows the scope. Was mounted on a Ruger GSR .308 in case you were curios. 

Also willing to trade for a Burris FFTAC30 1-4x
