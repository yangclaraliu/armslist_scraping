Its much more durable than the colt navy or army since it has the top strap over the cylinder and maintenance and cylinder removal is much easier as well. The sights are milled into the top strap with an elevation adjustable front sight so it can be a lot more accurate as well. I was told this revolver was unfired by the previous owner and I personally took it out to shoot for one range session and thoroughly cleaned it afterwards. Its a lot of fun to shoot and seeing that big cloud of smoke is really neat but I just don't like how much cleaning you have to do afterwards. There is a small scrape or something on the cylinder by one of the nipples but otherwise this gun is spotless.It includes everything you need to shoot as well as a nice leather holster. Most of a box of .44 cal balls, a powder measure/ flask, most of a jar of pyrodex, Remington caps, a nipple wrench and some greased patches."

Caliber: 7x57mm Spanish Mauser Action Type: Single Shot Rolling Block T Markings: The upper tang is marked “REMINGTON ARMS – UNION METALLIC CTG. CO. / REM. WORKS, ILION, N.Y. U.S.A. / PAT. OCT. 22. 1901”. The top of the barrel at the front of the handguard is marked “CAL. 7 M.M.”. The sides of the barrel bands are marked “U”. The belly of the stock behind the lower tang is marked “S”. Barrel Length: The barrel is 30” in length. Sights / Optics: The front sight is a tall blade dovetailed into a rectangular base on the barrel that forms an inverted “V” when viewed from the rear. The rear sight is a combination sliding elevator/ladder sight. With the ladder folded down, the rear sight is a “U” notch on the top (rear) of the slider. The left side of the base is marked “1-5” for use with the slider as an elevator. When the ladder is raised, a small “U” notch on the top edge of the slider is used. The sides of the ladder are marked from “6-18” for use with the slider with the ladder raised. Stock Configuration & Condition: The stocks are three pieces, consisting of a buttstock, a nearly full length forend and a half-length handguard. The handguard is cut-out for the rear sight, which protrudes up through the handguard. There is a barrel band around the forend at the front of the handguard and another at the front of the forend. The forend has a nose cap which doubles as a bayonet mount and has a hole in its front face for storage of a cleaning rod. The belly of the buttstock is inlet for a sling swivel, but it is missing. There is a sling swivel at the bottom of the forward barrel band. The buttstock has a nearly flat military style steel butt plate with a tang at the top. There is light oil staining in the wrist and at the back of the forend and tiny spots of discoloration on the right side of the buttstock that could be water stains. There are a few dings and light bruises scattered over the stocks with two deeper dings on the right side of the forend, a small deep ding and a drag line in the handguard and a small deep ding in the underside front section of the forend. There is a small surface chip at the back edge of the lower tang and a small abraded spot just above the forend’s nose cap on the left side. The wood to metal fit is excellent and there are no cracks or chips showing. The LOP measures 13 1/8” from the front of the trigger to the back of the butt plate, which shows surface loss, light handling marks, a sharp ding on its right edge near the toe. The butt plate is in about Very Good condition. The stocks rate in about Fine condition. Type of Finish: The finish is blued with a case colored receiver and trigger guard. Finish Originality: There are no indications that the metal surfaces were ever refinished. Bore Condition: The bore is mostly bright, turning gray at the muzzle.
