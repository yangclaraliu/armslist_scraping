This Jeep is a standard transmission (6 speed) with cruise control, front and rear lockers, electronic sway bar disconnect, 4:1 gearing, rock sliders, tinted windows, power locks, power windows, heated mirrors and rear window, Blue Tooth, voice command, mobile audio connection, Satellite radio antenna, stock subwoofer, CD Player, auxiliary connection, keyless entry (two keys), AC outlet (electric plug), 4:1 Four Wheel Drive (Low), and air conditioning. The color is a beige/yellow color called Dune from Jeep. The vehicle has never been smoked in (I'm a non smoker) and I have never removed the top. The jeep has just over 70,000 miles. The vast majority of those miles are highway miles since my trip to work is almost all highway. I only run synthetic oil in it and change the oil every 5000 miles and rotate the tires every 6000 miles. I generally keep the Jeep in a garage at home. The current tires are the BF Goodrich Mud Terrain Tires 255 75R17. They are a 40,000 mile tire and have less than 18000 miles on them. The vehicle has never been in an accident. The winch is checked every year prior to camping season to inspect the cable. I have used the winch only one time for a safety line. The Tuner allows for different modes for types of gas or for economy driving. It can also be given a four wheel drive tune which allows the lockers to be ran in 4x4 High and runs the fan more often to keep the engine cool. I love this vehicle and prefer to keep it but need to sell it due to some life changes. I have taken it camping countless times as well as on road trips. It fits two car seats in the back with no issue. This is by far one of the best performing vehicles I have ever owned for all kinds of terrain. Feel free to text or email with any questions or for links to all the upgrades I have done. It has the following upgrades, which I have links attached for anyone who emails me, however Craigslist rules don't allow for other links in the listing.1.

I bought it used and only put 20 rounds through it. It functions well and is in good condition. It has a few cosmetic marks on the frame from use. I am selling it because it is very picky about what ammo will function in it. CCI mini-mags work great and I've heard Eley ammo works too. Please text: (7I7) 46O-0739.

It was made sometime in the early 1920's between the world wars by DWM for export to the American market. It has non-matching serial numbers on the parts. The pistol was refinshed at some point but mechanically it works brilliantly, shoots like new with very strong rifling in the barrel and is accurate. The magazine is aftermarket and the toggle link doesn't always lock open on the empty magazine due to damage on the feed lips but it's easy to find an aftermarket replacement. This is more of a shooter than anything but still a great piece with rich history and perfect for the beginner collector. Will also throw in any ammo I have for it as well!
