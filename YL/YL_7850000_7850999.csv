The SKS has also been mounted into the Intrafuse tactical stock by Tapco. With the 6 point adjustable stock & foregrip you can set it up for a custom fit. The SKS also comes with (1) 20rnd and (1) 30rnd magazine. PRICE IS SALE PRICED @ $375 for this weekend only... The AK is a Zastava EAA PAP.... not the ""N""pap or the ""O""pap. This is the original that uses the thicker 1.5mil RPK receiver that was heat treated right! I pulled the black poly thumbhole stock and replaced it with 6 point tactical stock thats much more comfortable. The mag well has NOT been modified so it still uses single stack 10rnd magazines, so it will come with 3 of those as well. And if you feel like modding the mag well to take double stack 30rnd mags this is probably the best receiver for it....the RPK rails and stamped dimples eliminate mag wobble. I also have the original thumbhole buttstock for it. I'd like $599 for the AK & magazines. **Shipping is possible** but it has to be shipped to a ""VARIFIED"" FFL.... Got questions? Please email me"

Through rigorous testing, the G19X stands out above the competition and has the ability to function in all situations with ultimate reliability and accuracy. Our goal was to meet the demanding needs of the military while maintaining our standard of perfection. With proven results, the G19X delivers maximum efficiency and trustworthiness.” Confidence now comes in the coyote color with the first-ever factory colored slide. The nPVD slide coating of the GLOCK 19X prevents corrosion, resists chemicals, and stands up against the elements. Additional design features of the G19X include the GLOCK Marksman Barrel (GMB) with enhanced polygonal rifling and an improved barrel crown for increased accuracy, ambidextrous slide stop levers and no finger grooves for better versatility, and a lanyard loop for retention. The pistol includes a standard 17-round magazine and two 17+2-round extended magazines along with a coyote-colored pistol case. The aggregate effect of all the G19X design enhancements gives any user the assurance to succeed and survive in all situations.

By the end of June, only about 14,000 American soldiers were in France and they did not engage in combat operations until October 1917. Because of the scarcity of Model 1903 Rifles, all available weapons were issued to soldiers heading to France so it is highly likely that this rifle made its way to France during WWI. Springfield Model 1903 Rifles manufactured in 1917 and early 1918 are rare because, prior to serial number 800,000, manufactured in early 1918, Springfield used a single heat treatment on receivers. The double heat treatment process was introduced at Springfield from serial numbers 750,001 and 800,000. There were numerous reports from the field in 1917 and 1918 of receiver (and bolt) failures. Although much of these failures (and perhaps most) could later be attributed to faulty ammunition (too high loads or case failures), the single heat treatment process could not be ruled out so the U.S. Army Ordnance Department ordered all “low serial number” Springfield 1903 Rifles, those under serial number 800,000, to be returned for cleaning and repair. During the clean and repair process the receivers were ordered to be destroyed. Prior to WWI, Model 1903 Rifles were manufactured at both Springfield Armory and Rock Island Arsenal. By 1913, the relatively small U.S. Army was fully equipped with the Model 1903 Rifle so the decision was made to cease 1903 production at Rock Island Arsenal since Springfield could easily keep pace with the demand of new 1903 Rifles. With war for the United States on the horizon, Congress increased appropriations for 1903 Rifle production in September 1916. These appropriations led to an order on September 19, 1916, for Rock Island Arsenal to resume 1903 production (although production did not actually commence until February 1917). Congress also appropriated sufficient funds for Springfield Armory to attain full production for one shift and, ultimately, two shifts, as soon as possible. At the time, Springfield only employed 608 men and it was estimated that 3,000 employees would be needed to staff two full shifts of production and other armory-related duties. Serious buyer only"

It has no import marks, just the usual Waffenfabrik Walther Zella Mehlis (Thür) Walther's Patent Cal 7,65 m/m Mod. PPk. Serial# is 248409K, indicating it was made at the end of 1939, right before they started being Nazi stamped. It is in great condition. Mechanically perfect, and shoots great (I put approx 100 rounds through it). Finish is at least 95%, with just some carry wear on the left side that is shown in the pictures. This was most likely carried by a German soldier/Police officer before it was brought back to the US. Has a hairline crack around the grip screw (99% of Bakelite grip equipped PPK's do).It comes with two original 7.65 Walther marked magazines, one shows wear and has clearly been used a bit, the other one is in fantastic shape and doesn't look like it's been used at all. Also comes with a wartime leather DRGM Akah stamped that was (so I've been told) brought back with the gun by the same soldier. This holster has clearly been well used, and was actually on fire at some point in Germany (Flap missing, rear of the holster shows burn marks). I'm asking $1000 for everything These usually go for well over that (Cheapest one on Gunbroker right now is $1200+, cheapest on Armslist is $700 for one with about 10% finish left and $800 for one with about 60% finish left) and that's just with one mag, and no holster (or 70% holster? lol) so I believe $1000 is MORE than fair for this gorgeous old gun, two mags, and the holster.Not looking for trades at this time. Cash is king.Located in Northville, willing to drive a bit but nothing crazy. Face to face only, no shipping.Must be 18+ w/Purchase Permit or CPL.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time. Thanks for looking!~ MikeI've added a few pictures below, should be posting some more when I get off work and I can provide pictures of the internals or any other parts of the firearm upon request."

I’m asking 400 for it to reflect the fact that it has been slightly modified.  Otherwise I would ask 450 like everybody else selling their like new Mod 2s.     
No trades at this time.  Must have a valid Ohio drivers license or valid Ohio CCW before the sale can be finalized.  Preference goes to CCW holders.  Face to face deals only.  I’ll travel within reason (about a half hour outside of Cleveland) to meet with a serious buyer.  Also, I'll be posting a CZ P09 and a 1960 Colt Huntsman with 6'' barrel very soon.  Feel free to inquire about those as well.

Its super lightweight, small, and easily carried, which is why its great to carry not great to shoot, its FAR MORE PLEASANT than 357 J-Frame though. The Trigger is a long double action which is good for avoiding unitended discharge for those with poor trigger discipline, but may be off putting for the guys that have Custom 1911's. That's pretty much it I suppose if you have questions please feel free to email.Transaction will occur at Eagle Armory in O'fallon MO, I will cover the $15 FFL Fee."
