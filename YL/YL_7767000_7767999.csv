Includes everything from the factory (gun itself, two magazines, hard case, manual, etc). To say this gun is accurate and ejoyable to shoot is an incredible understatement: it has nearly no perceived recoil and it's extremely easy to keyhole shots at 25 yards. The gun also has had a factory trigger job performed by Dan Wesson, bringing the trigger pull down to about 3.5 pounds with a 2mm reset. There are some very minor scratches on the slide from holster wear but these can easy be removed. I will outright ignore lowball offers. The cheapest this gun sells for online new is $1453; the list price of $1200 is more than fair for this firearm. I am not interested in trades at this time. I prefer to meet face to face at a FFL within a 30 minute drive from me, but I am willing to ship from a FFL of my choice to a FFL of your choice.

I have a used HK USP Compact chambered in .40S&W that I would like to sell to fund another project. It's an LEM model, V7 with bright tritium. I have 4 magazines and lots of holsters/accessories to go along with it.
I've kept good care of this firearm- it was a safe queen for a while, then it was my OWB carry gun at work (FFL) for one year. There are 1500 rounds down pipe, not one issue with various types of ammunition. No steel has been shot. Externally, it is as expected. Good condition with a little holster wear on the left side of the frame.
The only things I've done are to install a match hammer spring and firing pin block spring. I have a light trigger return spring but I did not install it. All springs (original and aftermarket) are included.
This listing has the firearm listed as DAO, but the LEM trigger behaves like SA when cocked.
Price is $580 shipped to the lower 48. It is the buyer's responsibility to know local laws. Magazines included are (1) 12rd and (3) 10rd.
I prefer paypal F&F but will take G&S if the 3% fee is covered by the buyer.

I believe this gun was manufactured in 1984 from Remington's website. Bluing is 10 out of 10 perfect! Beautifully engraved from the factory with the ""Full Curl"" Ram head on the floor-plate and scribe work on the receiver. The bolt is also jeweled. Rifle also has a really nice Nikon Pro Staff 3x9x40 scope mounted on what I believe are Leopold scope rings. The reason why I rated this gun a 9 out of 10 is due to a couple light handling marks and a few small nicks in the stock, but nothing serious. Asking $850 with the scope or $750 without. This is a rare rifle chambered in 300 Win mag in this condition, but if you are reading this then you already know that. Thanks for looking and God bless!"

Great little example of history.  I've had this for several months and only shot about 150 rds through it.  It's a great shooter with very light trigger and very snug lock up.  Had timing adjusted and was slicked up by R&H Custom of TX (these are the guys who originally made conversion revolvers for Cimarron 20 years ago before Uberti started offering them).   Comes with original box and papers.  I really like it but have other priorities so it needs to find a new home.  A good deal for a pretty little revolver.  $450 is my firm price.  I won't do less.    You can check out Cimarrons or Uberti's websites to find out more.  I can provide more photos on request."
