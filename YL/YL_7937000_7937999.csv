I bought this gun for coyote hunting but now that it's legal to use an AR-15 for that in PA, I prefer that platform and have no use for this gun. I've put about 300 rounds through it and found it to be very fond of 62gr Remington Hog Hammer. I've been able to squeeze 1MOA out of this gun out to 200 yards, you might be able to do better with different ammo or hand loads. The trigger is surprisingly good for a rifle made by a shotgun company.The scope is a Primary Arms 4-16x44mm, SFP, illuminated mil-dot reticle with MOA turrets and the optional sun shade. The glass is clear and the illumination works great. The rings are either Burris or Millet, I think. The scope level is a Burris.The bipod is a Harris 6-9""The sling is Butler Creek, its very comfortable and has little grippy, nubby things on it. Wow!The cartridge holder is from Short Action Precision$550 OBO, cash only, FTF only with valid PA LTCF. I will not ship this gun.

The micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.
 
A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

I bought this gun all original about 2 years ago brand new. It is the Remington 700 long range hunter with a stainless barrel. It is only available from Sportsman’s Warehouse because it is a sportsman exclusive. Once I bought this rifle it was properly broken in to ensure longevity and accuracy. If you'd like to call me I can explain my process. This rifle comes from the factory already with a Bell and Carlson stock. I then had professionally installed a Rifle Basics trigger that is set right at 2 pounds. I then had the barrel and bolt professionally fluted at Kampfields customs in Sandpoint, Idaho. On top of this rifle is a Burris Veracity 5-25x50 M.A.D attached with DNZ one-piece rings that already have a 20 moa rise built in. This rifle will shoot sub moa groups all day. I have targets that prove this. The rifle has between 80-90 rounds down the barrel is all. This gun is sighted in at 200 yards and is ready to hunt tomorrow. I have hand loaded rounds that I will throw in with the deal. 210 gr Berger VLD bullets and Norma brass. I will also include all ballistic charts and every other paper work I have for round/rifle.

The patent pending integral trigger safety is engaged instinctively and doesn’t take away from the smooth straight pull trigger that allows the shooter steadier and more consistent follow-up shots.Patent pending striker and sear design is optimized for less wear and tear of parts. The lack of a hammer spring also allows a more slimline and higher grip on the pistol giving the shooter more control while diminishing felt recoil.The H9’s unique design is not simply aesthetic. The unconventional nose of the pistol allows for the barrel and recoil spring to sit drastically lower and closer to the hand than heritage designs. This, coupled with its striker-fired design, creates an extremely low bore axis which reduces torque about the wrist when firing and contributes to unparalleled precision in the shot process.Check out more at https://www.hudsonmfg.com/product/Come in and check it out in store at Gun Commanders on Cleveland Highway or visit online at www.guncommanders.com"

It would be great for the competition shooting against the 2011 STI. I was gonna twk this gun and just replace all the parts to make it just as good as an STI as a project. But I haven’t had the time, so I’m gonna get rid of it to focus more on building 300blackout pistol. So in the third photo, you will notice the brass kiss on the top of the slide. It did NOT nick or scratch the finish at all. It’s smooth and you can’t even feel it. But it’s just a tiny little silver crescent there. I’m very anal about describing the details and the condition of my guns, so I have to point that out. I know the gun is meant to be a competition gun and it’s supposed to be filled with wears, but wears bother me. And I have yet to take this gun out to a comp yet. This gun comes from the factory with only one magazine, I bought two extra aftermarket ones, and had to modify the bases a bit. Now they both work flawlessly with the gun so now it will come with 3 mags.Please text me (28l) 773-82 SlX NlNe"

Won't let me post more than 2. Beautiful example of a remington 1903. Not a nick or scratch in the wood or metal, extremely accurate rifle. The sights are not original. The front sights are off of an m1917 and rears are a weaver ghost ring sight. Similar setup to an m1 garand or an eddystone, I'm assuming a competition shooter used it because it is a great sight setup. I have the original sling for this rifle and some ammo. Make offer.
