I used to carry a Glock 27 and found this felt much better to hold and shoot. It features a very useful ambidextrous magazine release. It comes with 2 magazines, the box, book, test casing, test target, lock, registration card, and two back straps. You might think that the price I am asking is a little to high but it is almost impossible to find one of these with the QA trigger. Of course the price is negotiable but please be realistic in your offer. Sorry NO TRADES. You must be over 21 years old. NO FELONS or others not allowed by law to own a firearm.

This is bright, clean ammo. It's corrosive, though, so be sure to clean your rifle well when you're done. Most importantly, this ammunition also comes complete with the very essential en-bloc clips (which can be used over and over). This is great collectable ammo, and of course, if you happen to have one of those neat old Steyr M95 rifles, you can now have some ammo to shoot in it. I am asking $350.00 for all the ammunition. Most of this ammunition, boxes, and en bloc clips are marked with the NAZI War Eagle.The loose ammunition in front of the boxes has surface rust on the clips and a small amount on the ammunution. There are 21 rounds and 4 en bloc clips that have this surface rust. I am asking $15.00 for all the ammunition with surface rust."

This is bright, clean ammo. It's corrosive, though, so be sure to clean your rifle well when you're done. Most importantly, this ammunition also comes complete with the very essential en-bloc clips (which can be used over and over). This is great collectable ammo, and of course, if you happen to have one of those neat old Steyr M95 rifles, you can now have some ammo to shoot in it. I am asking $18/box or $400.00 for all the ammunition. Most of this ammunition, boxes, and en bloc clips are marked with the NAZI War Eagle.The loose ammunition in front of the boxes has surface rust on the clips and a small amount on the ammunution. There are 21 rounds and 4 en bloc clips that have this surface rust. I am asking $20.00 for all the ammunition with surface rust."

I am asking only $1,400 for it which is a steal as they go for $2,300 as I'm sure you all know. It is brand new, never used or mounted. Will pay for shipping too.The Trijicon 1-6x24 VCOG® (Variable Combat Optical Gunsight) is a rugged variable powered riflescope that accommodates close quarter battle (CQB) and long distance marksmanship. It features superior glass quality and light gathering capabilities with zero distortion. The bullet drop compensating and ranging reticles allow for the shooter to quickly and accurately estimate range and apply the correct hold. The first focal plane reticle allows the subtensions and drops to remain true at any magnification. With a forged 7075-T6 aircraft-aluminum-alloy housing, the VCOG is an exceptionally durable and nearly indestructible sighting system. Robust enough for any application, the VCOG utilizes a single AA battery, commonly found across the globe and offers 6 adjustable brightness settings for the LED reticle. When powered by a lithium AA battery (like the one provided), it boasts a considerable battery life of 700 hours at setting 4 (constant on). An integrated dial fin allows easy rotation through the magnification range and a constant eye relief means no head or stock position adjustments are needed. Waterproof to 20 meters (66 ft.).Package Includes:1 Thumb Screw Mount (TA51)1 Lithium AA Battery1 LENSPEN® (TA56)1 Trijicon Logo Sticker (PR15)1 Manual1 Warranty Card"
