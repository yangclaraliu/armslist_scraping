The .458 is a hammer, it drives 300grn hornady JHPs, or Nosler MZ Balistic tips to 1950, and 405grn Rem softpoints at 1650. I used the 405s to drop two wild bulls with one shot each, bang flops, fastest drops ive seen on this critters besides one i hit with a 175grn from my 7mm STW.The 6.5 Is point and click death on smaller game out to 300yds or so, and longer hits are possible but i havent done anything besides shoot rocks father out. The loads i use are 123Amax/SST at 2500fps, and 100gr Balistic tips at 2770. Recoil on this round is also low, and with the muzzle break attatched the same as a hot loaded 5.56specs on the gun Anderson Multi LowerJP reduced power spring kit (totaly reliable)Polished Mil-spec trigger, hammer and disconectorTrigger engagment adjustable Grip screwI cant rember who made the grip thats on it, but it fits well and is comfortable. Also included is the original ATI scorpion i had on the gun, that grip is VERY comfortable if you have large hand, but was hard for folks with smaller hands to use.The stock, is an ATI ultralite, with the cheek riser. The riser gets in the way of the operating handle unless the stock is fully extended, but i prefer the looks of the gun with it on so ive lived with having to open the stock to charge the rifle. If you want to remove it its only a couple screws on each side. Not pictured but included is the larger heavier recoil pad that does a wonderful job soaking up the hit from the .458, tho even with just the padding i put on the back of the regular ati stock its pretty mild.I also have an extra power buffer spring, and extra heavy buffer which is nice with the .458 but not necessary. The grendThe .458 upper is from Radical, and features their upgraded 15"" freefloat tube, as well as the Panzer brake. Ive recently gone to a Hogue non over molde 13"" tube handguard as the pic rails were hanging up on brush. I still have the longer Hybrid rail which can be purchased for $60Bolt is matched to the barrel and is MPI/HPT tested. Ive got probably 300rounds on this upper, and its functioned flawlessly. The scope is a Bushnell Legend Ultra HD 1.75-6x32 with a shotgun doa reticle. The reticle tracks pretty closely to the loads im running in the gun.6.5 Grendel upper is one i put together myself.The reciever is an ultralite smoothside, Spartan from Joebobs. Tbarrel and bolt are from Radical and matched, 20"" 1-8 twist so if your inclined you COULD shoot the heaviest bullets available, but ive stuck with 100-123s. The barrel was turned down to an ultralite profile by Ar15barrels. 13"" Slim profile Matrixarms keylock handguard. I also changed this to 15"" Matrix HandguardThe upper comes with a break that works really well, but is quite load, and an aluminum barrel shroud for use when hunting (or to keep from annoying fellow shooters with the muzzle blast). I also have a thread protector should you want to run without either.Topped with a 1.5-5x20 Brunton Eterna, this scope is lite and offers plenty of magnification for shots out to the edge of what i would consider ethical range for the 6.5 cartridge. Glass on this scope is excellent and the finger adjustable turrets, actually make dailing shots in at range surprisingly easy. I have 4 or 5 mags for the .458, it uses standard 5.56mags. Some of them have modified followers which allows a full 5 rounds in a 10rnd magazine, these will NOT work as 5.56s mags unless the followers are replaced.I only have 1 mag for the Grendel. The front its notched to allow bullets to be seated out to 2.34"" which actually makes a difference in this small case. If you use the longer OAL than it only holds 5-7 rounds, cant remeber off hand. If you use shorter oals or factory bullets, you can fit a full 10. The gun comes with Dies for both calibers. I am keeping the components for the .458, but ill give the buyer what ever 6.5 stuff i have left.Both guns pictures will be changed when i get a chance to take new ones.questions etc drop me a lineREDACTEDKeao"

Got this on an impulse buy. After realizing feeding this beast would be way too expensive, it never saw the light of day. Also wasn't looking forward to weapons maintenance which is another reason why I decided not to fire it. Love looking at it though and imagining myself firing it. It is all black with the synthetic stock. Sells for 1799 at turners plus tax. So I feel $1650 is fair especially since buyer avoids tax on it. Plus it's brand new, so I have no reason to sell for cheaper. I'm keeping it unless I get $1650 cash, and no I'm not interested in anything that you got. This is the only rifle that gets my juices flowing. I'll buy it down the line when I can afford to feed it. I really don't want to have to get this guy out and take pics for someone not serious about buying. In fact, I'm not taking pictures of it, because it's brand new. You must meet at an FFL to see it, ready to buy with cash in hand. Please email me with a number if you are ready to meet to purchase my rifle.

Don't miss this great opportunity to pick up this beauty at a price well below the MSRP of nearly $2,100 plus tax. Having been taken to the range only a handful of times and well cleaned and lubricated with each use, this 1911 Commander remains in great shape. Included is the handgun in its DW hard case, magazines, all documentation and manuals, a lock, and an extra pair G10 starburst grips. I may be reached via email. I generally meet at West Coast Armory in Bellevue but if you have a different FFL you prefer, I'm happy to accommodate."

The gun itself is in pristine condition and works without any problems because I saw my brother take it to some outdoor ranges and use it a few times before going back home and cleaning it every time.I'm looking to get around $600 cash only but willing to negotiate and no trades but it goes without saying you can't have any felonies and trust me I will check for that. If you're interested send me a message and I have more pictures of the gun if you would like to see them.have a good day (^_^)"

The Colt pachmayr grip. Very nice condition. I am not the first owner. This thing looks to have been shot very little. Everything is as it should be for a revolver on this one.and it includes the outer box sleeve. It is not all intact - flaps on one of the ends are missing. But some folks like to have these things."

At a minimum the trigger needs to be finished and adjusted (homemade trigger), and the mounting bolt to the stock should be shortened or replaced.
