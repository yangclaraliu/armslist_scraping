Besides offering the power of the .32 ACP cartridge, it sports a tough and durable blued-steel finish. This double/single-action auto-pistol is perfect for deep concealment or as a backup second handgun.EASY OPERATIONThe controls of the Beretta 3032 Tomcat are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide as well as preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand.CONVENIENT TIP-UP BARREL DESIGNIts tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate, and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range.TIP-UP BARREL RELEASE LATCHThe Beretta 3032 Tomcat‚Äôs barrel tips up (that is, it swings upward pivoting near the muzzle, thereby exposing the chamber); this is achieved by simply operating the tip-up barrel release latch on the side of the pistol.TIP-UP BARRELThe tip-up barrel design has several advantages. It makes it easy to visually check whether the chamber is loaded and it allows for effortless loading and unloading without racking the slide. This last feature makes it particularly ideal for shooters with weaker hands.EASY TO CONCEAL AND SHOOT Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the Beretta 3032 Tomcat were designed to be carried concealed. The lines are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster, pocket, or belly-band without catching on anything. The rear sight is adjustable for windage, so you can easily experiment shooting different loads while keeping your sights on target. All these features have made Beretta small frames like the Beretta 3032 Tomcat a favorite for concealed carry and self-defense. CONTOURED TANGThe tang will gently hug the web of your shooting hand, minimizing the chance of ""slide bite."" Thanks to this and other details, the Beretta 3032 Tomcat will feel ergonomic and efficient in your hands, in spite of its diminutive size.BLUED FINISHThe blued steel finish on this handgun makes it highly resistant to sweat, rain, and powder residues. A tiny workhorse that will give you years and years of trouble-free service.RECESSED MAGAZINE RELEASEThe mag-release button on the Beretta 3032 Tomcat is designed to do two things. First, it positively releases the magazine when you intend to swap it or remove it from the pistol. Second, its recessed design makes it virtually impossible for you to accidentally press it when the pistol is in the holster or while shooting.SPECIFICATIONS-Action: Single/Double-Barrel Length (mm): 61-Barrel Length (in): 2.4-Caliber: 7.65 (32 Auto)-Magazine: 7+1-Overall Height (mm): 95-Overall Height (in): 3.7-Overall Length (mm): 125-Overall Length (in): 4.92-Overall Width (mm): 28-Overall Width (in): 1.1-Weight Unloaded (g): 410-Weight Unloaded (oz): 14.5***** EXTRAS INCLUDED *****MagazinesQuantity 3: Beretta 3032 Tomcat .32 ACP 7 Rounds Blued Magazine (# JM32) @ $13.50 each ($40.50)This 7-round blued magazine is manufactured specifically for the Beretta 3032 Tomcat.

It is an Anderson lower, and an early 70's Colt upper with the oversized forward assist button. Both receivers were sent off to be cerakoated in matching flat black. The barrel is a Windham government profile 1-7 twist. Because the upper is an original Colt style, it does have the fixed handle/rear sight setup that cannot be removed. The triangle handguard is also an original early 70's era handguard. The stock is a fixed stock with storage with military M16 cleaning kit in it. All in all, this rifle took a long time to gather the parts for era specific retro tribute.

695,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7513695,For Sale:  Beretta 21 A Bobcat Inox 22LR,"West Palm Beach, Palm Beach, South Florida",$ 760,"Listed On: Thursday, November 30, 2017",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"OVERVIEWThis model has a stainless-steel slide and barrel. The alloy frame is gray anodized to match the color and finish of the stainless components. The other metal parts (trigger, hammer, trigger guard, safety, magazine, etc.) are black finished.QUALITY POCKET PISTOLThe same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality, and strict quality control that make the 92F, Cougar, and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity, safety, and practical use are their best qualities.PRACTICAL AND SIMPLEUser-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.ADVANCE MATERIALSKeeping an eye on quality helps keep Beretta small caliber semi-automatics out front. Beretta pistols in the 21 Series utilize the toughest of forgings for their barrels, while slides are fashioned from solid steel bar stock. Frames are machined from solid aluminum forgings. The new Inox versions utilize the finest materials, difficult to machine but exceptionally corrosion resistant and durable.TRUSTWORTHY AND PRECISEChambered for .22LR, this compact, rugged, small frame measures just 4.9 inches (125 mm) overall and weighs only 11.5 ounces (325 grams). It features a lightweight, alloy frame, inox steel slide, tip-up barrel, and double/single action. The Bobcat comes with a 7-round magazine for .22LR ammunition.EASY OPERATIONThe controls of the Beretta 21 A Bobcat Inox are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide as well as preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand.CONVENIENT TIP-UP BARREL DESIGNIts tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate, and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range.TIP-UP BARREL RELEASE LATCHThe Beretta 21 A Bobcat Inox‚Äôs barrel tips up (that is, it swings upward pivoting near the muzzle, thereby exposing the chamber); this is achieved by simply operating the tip-up barrel release latch on the side of the pistol.TIP-UP BARRELThe tip-up barrel design has several advantages. It makes it easy to visually check whether the chamber is loaded and it allows for effortless loading and unloading without racking the slide. This last feature makes it particularly ideal for shooters with weaker hands.EASY TO CONCEAL AND SHOOT Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the Beretta 21 A Bobcat Inox were designed to be carried concealed. The lines are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster, pocket, or belly-band without catching on anything. All these features have made Beretta small frames like the Beretta 21 A Bobcat Inox a favorite for concealed carry and self-defense. CONTOURED TANGThe tang will gently hug the web of your shooting hand, minimizing the chance of ""slide bite."" Thanks to this and other details, the Beretta 21 A Bobcat Inox will feel ergonomic and efficient in your hands, in spite of its diminutive size.INOX FINISHThe inox steel finish on this handgun makes it highly resistant to sweat, rain, and powder residues. A tiny workhorse that will give you years and years of trouble-free service.RECESSED MAGAZINE RELEASEThe mag-release button on the Beretta 21 A Bobcat Inox is designed to do two things. First, it positively releases the magazine when you intend to swap it or remove it from the pistol. Second, its recessed design makes it virtually impossible for you to accidentally press it when the pistol is in the holster or while shooting.SPECIFICATIONS-Action: Single/Double-Barrel Length (mm): 61-Barrel Length (in): 2.4-Caliber: 6.35 (25 Auto)-Magazine: 7+1-Overall Height (mm): 94-Overall Height (in): 3.7-Overall Length (mm): 125-Overall Length (in): 4.92-Overall Width (mm): 28-Overall Width (in): 1.1-Weight Unloaded (g): 335-Weight Unloaded (oz): 11.8***** EXTRAS INCLUDED *****MagazinesQuantity 3: Beretta 21 A Bobcat Inox 22LR 7 Rounds Blued Magazine (# JM21) @ $13.50 each ($40.50)This 7-round blued magazine is manufactured specifically for the Beretta 21 A Bobcat Inox.

I am selling one of the last guns I have that is not People's Republic of California compliant as I have to move there for my job. It is in almost new condition, as I have only fired it 30 times from new. It has substantial report for those not familiar with this round, so if you are timid this is not for you. It will come with its box, 2 magazines, extended slide release, etc. I appear to have misplaced the adjustable grip attachments so that is why the low price. You can buy the interchangeable grips from Glock for 16.99 for a complete set if you have big hands. This is an ideal hunting sidearm for the upcoming hunting season or home defense weapon. I do not recommend this as a ccw item as it is large and very powerful. Thank you for looking. Over 21, no felons or anyone else not legally able to own, no shipping, local sale or trade in north Tampa, and lowballs ignored. You know what this is."

Having been taken to the range only a handful of times and well cleaned and lubricated with each use, this 1911 Commander remains in great shape.  Included is the handgun in its DW hard case, magazines, all documentation and manuals, a lock, and an extra pair G10 starburst grips.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with the gun and it shoots amazing. I've put 500 rounds through it and I clean and maintain the rifle regularly. It’s only been to the range twice.I'm including everything that you see in the picture, which includes 2 Magpul PMAG mazines, Magpul bipod mount, bipod, and a Magpul STR butt stock. I am including the original hard case that it came with, the original box it shipped in and all manuals and the gun lock. I'm also including the original butt stock.I am also including 160 rounds of American Eagle 223 ammo, which retails for approximately $50.Asking price is $800, but I’m willing to listen to reasonable offers. Considering that a brand new Saint costs $900 and with the accessories I'm including, it would cost you over $1,000 at your local retailer or gun shop when you include taxes and possibly a background check fee and the additional Magpul accessories included. Even if you could pick up a new Saint for $750 off some website, after including a background check fee from an FFL and assuming you get free shipping, with all the extra Magpul accessories, bipod, and the free ammo, it would still cost you about $950. ***Do not waste my time with low ball offers or tell me how you can buy this gun for cheap off some website. When you add in shipping/FFL transfer fee and background fee, it can easily add anywhere from $25-$100 depending on the FFL and the website. Also, I’m adding additional Magpul accessories with this gun as well as the ammo. Those accessories alone would cost over $185 retail. I sold guns for a retailer for almost 2 years and I’m not some idiot. Anyone that emails me low ball offers will not only be ignored, but your email will be flagged as spam and all future emails will be sent to my junk folder for automatic deletion.***You would need to pay in cash or money transfer via Zelle (it's free if your bank offers it). As a last resort, I can accept credit cards, but you need to pay the $24 in processing fees.To complete the sale, you can either show me a valid CCW permit at purchase (to verify you're not a felon). If you don't have a CCW, then we will need to fill out a firearms bill of sale with your name, address and drivers license number. Sorry, in this day and age I can't just trust you.More information can be found on the Saint by visiting http://www.springfield-armory.com/saint-series/"
