I can add cash depending on the trade! You're looking at a brand new Ruger Predator chambered in 6.5 Creedmoor. I bought this gun less than 2 weeks ago from Academy. The Predator comes with a threaded barrel for a muzzle break or a supressor. It also comes with a adjustable trigger, as well as a more beefy barrel than the regular Ruger American rifles. Since i bought the gun earlier this month I have just realized that i want to go a different direction and get a AR. The selling price is firm. But I am more flexable if you're looking to trade.

I’m pretty set on what I’d like to trade for but all trades and trades plus cash will be considered.Prefer to meet between Hickory and Shelby but can be somewhat flexible. I’d prefer to trade for a Browning X-Bolt in short action, non magnum calibers (.308, 7mm-08, 6.5 etc). Stainless short action Remington 700 or 7 in above calibers. Stainless Ruger 77 in above calibers or a gunsite scout plus cash on my end. I will also consider a new or well taken care of Glock 43 plus a 10/22 or cash. I can add cash on my end for a 43 and a 10/22 takedown. Would consider trading for a 2” 7-shot GP100, though I doubt there are any of these used yet cause they just came out so I could add cash. Again, I realize these are specific, if you have something close, don’t hesitate to offer."

You’ll find yourself amazed at how enjoyable it is to shoot a pistol that’s so small and so powerful. In fact, you might end up spending more time at the range than you planned.The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack turns Springfield Armory®’s single stack XD-S® platform into a mid-sized pistol. The sub-compact frame extends to full-size length when you insert an X-Tension™ magazine, adding capacity and controllability for your time at the range. Use a flush fitting magazine for concealed carry, and you’ll forget it’s there.Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. The .45 ACP is a cartridge that compromises nothing in the power department, and the XD-S® is a concealed carry pistol without compromise. Put an XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™"

I would prefer it to be a revolver, but I would consider a semi-auto as well. Brand and caliber are not important. I recently learned to nickel plate and I’d like to hone my skills. The gun I’m looking for is that old nasty beater that is probably not safe to fire that has been sitting in your safe collecting dust and taking up room.  This gun is for me to practice on, so I’m really not interested in a gun that has real value. Please send me an email if you have what I’m looking for."
