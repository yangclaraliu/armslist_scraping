Holds 7 rounds in the cylinder and if you didn't already know this is one of the few revolvers out there that can actually be suppressed, so it's a pretty interesting design. Pistol works great and still has a good clean bore and overall finish is very nice. Seems to have been rearsenaled at some point in its life likely sometime around WWII so it's still just about perfect.For whatever reason this example is missing the double action fly and spring, both of which are available cheaply ($13 for the fly for example) from buymilsurp(dot)com. Without those two small parts the pistol still works fine but is simply restricted to single action only, which some of these were naturally manufactured as such anyways.Included are the original holster, lanyard, and cleaning tools.Asking $250 for the package deal. No shipping. Lowered the price a little as I figure if you elect to buy the two small missing parts to restore DA function it'll probably run you about $25 from the aforementioned supplier.Contact me via text at: 231-690-067five NOTE: If you've already contacted me about this listing and see this, please shoot me another message as I recently got a new phone and lost all previous contact info!!Thanks"

The overall condition of this rifle is very good/excellent . With the exception of the safety lever, all serial numbers match. The condition of the bore is excellent, essentially perfect to my eyes. The previous owner of this rifle skillfully repaired a cracked wrist as well as reblued the firearm, and frankly his work was outstanding. All and all, this is both a cosmetically beautiful and functionally perfect firearm. I got this rifle lumped into a larger trade, and I already have a couple M1916s, so I am selling this one. Leather sling is included. Don't hesitate to request higher quality pictures or ask questions. I have personally detail stripped this firearm, and I can say with full confidence that it has nothing to hide.A word about Spanish M1916 Mausers:If you are knowledgable about 1916 Mauser's, you will be pleased to learn that this particular rifle was originally purchased from SAMCO in the 1990's. This rifle is NOT one of the bottom of the barrel rejects which recently flooded the market after SAMCO's liquidation sale. Additionally, the previous owner was a knowledgable man and fired low pressure handloads through this rifle, so it was not abused by full power .308 in the way that others like it have been.If you are not familiar with the M1916 rifle, you should be aware that there is great debate on the history, safety, and proper chambering of these rifles. I won't turn this classified ad into a history lesson, but here is the main takeaway: This is a European military rifle chambered for a European military cartridge (7.62 NATO). This rifle is NOT chambered for the American hunting cartridge .308 Winchester. While these two rounds are often considered interchangable in a modern context (and a great many rifles can safely fire both), they are in fact dimensionally different and have inconsisent pressure ratings. In the case of this particular rifle, the consensus is that these slight differences are significant enough, and the rifle antiquated enough, that .308 Winchester is potentially UNSAFE to fire. While a great many folks have fired large amounts of .308 out of these rifles without any recorded consequence, the potential for harm exists, and therefor it is strongly advised that your only use the NATO spec ammunition that the gun was designed to fire (or better still, handloads). Additionally, this rifle is not chambered for 7.62 CETME, as some ""internet experts"" will claim.The bottom line is that the M1916 mauser is a historic military firearm which operates on a 125 year old action. Unlike for example, new production hunting rifles, it wasn't designed to to be idiot proof. So long however as you respect the capabilities and limitations of a small ring Mauser, it is a highly capable and versatile tool. You can, in perfect safety, load this gun to serve you as a full power deer rifle, a rock solid truck gun, a respectable target rifle, or a knockabout plinker."

This is a fantastic rifle with an amazing trigger and smooth bolt. It’s barely been used, I bought it to hunt with but haven’t found the time. It comes with a Firefield 10-42 power scope. Also have 280 rounds of FMJ .308 ammo I can include for $60"
