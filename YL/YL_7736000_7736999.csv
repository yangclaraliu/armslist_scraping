It's pretty much brand new and only 50 rounds down the barrel. I had a Eotech, Trijicon Acog and a Aimpoint at one point mounted on it but sold them. Comes with Magpul 2 flip up sights and vertical grip. This gun just sits in my gun safe. ///////NO OPTICS///////DescriptionThe Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V5 is a semi-automatic tactical rifle chambered in 5.56 NATO. The LW has identical features to the V5 and costs the same too, but the difference is the LW has a lightweight barrel, which cuts a third of a pound.ADVERTISEMENTThe LW uses the Omega X Rail 12 handguards. These handguards are free-floating, so when the barrel heats up and swells they won’t press against each other. It has Picatinny rails running along the top, bottom and sides, which allow for easy mounting of optics or accessories. The top runs continuously and meets with the upper receiver and extends slightly after the front sight. But it is available with fixed sight, flip sights or not sights.It has a mid-length gas operating system, so propellant gases are caught in a tube near the muzzle, the tube guides it back to the bolt and then catches in another tube on the bolt. When the gas is caught, it drives the bolt back. This delays recoil until the projectile has left the bore. Mid-length means that the gas is caught after a medium distance in the barrel, so less pressure is used to push the bolt back (compared to the short-length gas system).Features include a chrome lined bore, a vertical fore-grip, a MagPul buttstock that’s lightweight and adjustable, a cold hammer forged barrel, so a machine carefully carved the grooves in the bore. This process produces accurate and durable rifling.

Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The DA/SA is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG. The DA/SA also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging.

The LW has identical features to the V5 and costs the same too, but the difference is the LW has a lightweight barrel, which cuts a third of a pound.ADVERTISEMENTThe LW uses the Omega X Rail 12 handguards. These handguards are free-floating, so when the barrel heats up and swells they won’t press against each other. It has Picatinny rails running along the top, bottom and sides, which allow for easy mounting of optics or accessories. The top runs continuously and meets with the upper receiver and extends slightly after the front sight. But it is available with fixed sight, flip sights or not sights.It has a mid-length gas operating system, so propellant gases are caught in a tube near the muzzle, the tube guides it back to the bolt and then catches in another tube on the bolt. When the gas is caught, it drives the bolt back. This delays recoil until the projectile has left the bore. Mid-length means that the gas is caught after a medium distance in the barrel, so less pressure is used to push the bolt back (compared to the short-length gas system).Features include a chrome lined bore, a vertical fore-grip, a MagPul buttstock that’s lightweight and adjustable, a cold hammer forged barrel, so a machine carefully carved the grooves in the bore. This process produces accurate and durable rifling. And it has a sling swivel attachment points, so users can attach a combat sling, which allows them to sling it while carrying it at the ready.Daniel Defense recommends the LW for military, law enforcement or personal security.danieldefense_v5nosight0304113 Specifications:Caliber: 5.56 NATOCapacity: 30Sights: Flat topFeatures: Mid-lenght gas system; vertical fore-grip; birdcage flash hider; chrome lined bore; cold hammer forged barrel; and Omega X rail 12 handguard (quad rail system)Action: Semi-autoStock: MagPul adjustableMaterial/Finish: Steel/phosphateScope: Picatinny railWebsite: https://danieldefens…Weight: 6.3375 poundsBarrel Length: 16""Twist: 1 in 7""MSRP $1469.00NO EOTECH INCLUDEDPlease be legal with a Va ID and a CCW or Military to show.

My work on this pistol makes it worth a more in my opinion than a standard new C9 because mine has my enhancements plus wearable parts that have been replaced to make it fucntion as it should nearly new.In fact, new isn't even desireable, in my experience, since all weapons should be used and worked to make them smooth and reliable as possible.I am reducing the pprice by $75 to sell it.My customizations include one cosmetic enhancement: 1-of-2-of-a-kind glossy, durable epoxy finish over Hi-Hoints OEM wood grain plastic grips.The rest of my work is on the frame and enhances the functionality of the weapon: enlarged trigger well, widened and elongated trigger, accessory rail on the frame in front of the trigger well.I very recently installed the tritium vials in the OEM sights, which are not represented in the older picturesThe main enhancement is my trigger work which achieved a trigger with nearly NO travel,no creep no pull, just firing with light finger pressure. I achieved all the functional enhancements using existing parts. I used plastic from another frame to enlarge the trigger well, trigger and add the rail. The trigger work is on existing OEM parts, is a trade secret, But I guarantee that the person who buys this pistol will be surprised and VERY pleased with the trigger performance and that of the weapon. This pistol comes with the rail mounted knife pictured, an 8-round mag and a 10-round mag and the plastic case in the picture. There is a sheath for the knife as well that is not pictured.Terms of warranty: This weapon is covered by Hi-Point's lifetime warranty, which is any owner, no proof of purchase needed. you just need the serial# of the weapon to give them for parts or .

I will not do it before hand due to the possibility of reducing the value of being in completely stock condition currently. There are wear marks where you would expect them on the slide, barrel and grips from riding in a holster for a brief period of time. All wear marks are minimal and could easily be buffed out. Pistol is kept clean and oiled in safe. Comes with three 15 round magazines and an OWB leather holster. This is a fantastic pistol and just feel right in your hand. The trigger is surprisingly nice. I bought it because I love seeing it in movies and had to have it. I got it, took it to the range 2-3 times and put it away. Time to fund other projects. I don't need to sell so I am firm at $500 for everything included. I have ammo to through in on the right offer and will include the one mag of hollow points as pictured. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to see better photos.Currently have an interested party. This pistol is on hold for that sale until 2018.If you are interested, please save us both a lot of time and review the below information. Thanks!Please, be able to have an intelligent conversation about pricing, values, basic guns and ammo information and item descriptions. I try to list everything of importance in my ads and do not want to have a week long back and forth discussion because you cannot articulate an acceptable explanation of your items or questions about my items. If you refer to magazines as clips, cartridges as boolets or send photos of your guns with your finger on the trigger, I will assume we are off to a less than desirable start. Sorry if I sound rude, but I have bought and sold a fair amount from Armslist and the sheer amount of people that cannot seem to follow the golden four rules of firearms safety or use correct terminology is an ongoing issue.If you decide to purchase a handgun from me, I will take down your ID and CPL/PP info, I will fill out the pistol transfer forms as is required by law and I will write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. If you decide to buy a long gun from me, I will check your ID and write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. The bill of sale will include identifying information for both parties and there will be a copy for me and a copy for you. This is only done as a measure of protection for both parties. This is something you should welcome in an honest transaction. The registration paperwork and bill of sale on handguns is not negotiable. I don't like the laws any more than the rest of you but I intend to follow them. If you read this and are still interested and have any questions, please let me know.If you want to test fire a gun that I am selling, that is perfectly acceptable in most cases. I am happy to meet with you at Family Shooters Corral on a weekend with you as my guest or at a range of your choosing at your own expense.Thank you for looking! Check out my ""Listings by this user"" link to the right of the photo above for a look at all of my listed items! I am always listing new items and may not have something posted yet.

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going"

This 106 year old revolver remains in excellent condition retaining 95% of its original colt High Polish finish and the majority of its fire blue finish on small parts. This pistol is of historical significance as it purportedly Belonged to a Philippine insurrection medal of honor winner by the name of George Weed Wallace. There is a date engraved on the left side of June 7th 1912 which is reported to be the date he was promoted to LT. Col. and based on that  I’m assuming this was a gift for that promotion from friends or fellow company members and his initials of G.W.W. Are engraved on the butt bottom. While I have no way to definitively prove it was his except for the fact it was bought directly from the family it makes sense as the dates match up as far as when he lived and served in the military as he was awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry in March 1900 and retired in 1919 from the military. Also this would have been nearly identical to the Colt model 1892 he carried during the Philippine insurrection so it would also make sense that this Type of arm would have been purchased for him upon his promotion. I currently have it displayed as shown below on a plexiglass stand backed by framed information on him and a copy of his citation for the medal of honor. Regardless of its previous owner this is still a very high condition 106 year old colt revolver that is extremely collectible and very desirable in the early colt High Polish finish with fire blued parts. The bore and cylinders are also mint and are a 10 out of 10. As you can see from the photos this revolver displays excellently. Will ship to any FFL or C&R holder in the lower 48. PayPal payment preferred if shipping is required. I have many more pictures I can either text or email to Interested parties. This revolver would benefit greatly from more research to find this american hero’s official military records. If that can be done you are talking about an extremely valuable revolver.
