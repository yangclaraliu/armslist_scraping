Lots of Firepower and a small package. It has the heavier weight threaded barrel from the previous models before it the threaded barrel is a half by 28 thread which is common for 5.56 and can be used suppressed silenced. At this time I have an A2 flash hider on it but it also will come with a compensator that I have had on it in the past...

Textured on both front and back, the profile of the KAG creates a channel for consistent and positive engagement which translates directly into improved efficiency in weapons manipulation and target to target transitions.• Forward rake gives positive retention when using “C-clamp” (thumb over bore) method of handguard support• Works as a rest for supported firing positions• Slight angle without significant bulk adds just the right amount of relief to the wrist without substantially increasing the girth of the handguard• Small profile is just enough to get repeatable hand position on weapon forend• Innovative patent pending attachment method allows for robust clamping and alignment with minimal hardware and slender accessory size• Textured in front and back for positive engagement• Made in the U.S.A. from high quality, impact resistant polymers."

They were cleaned about nine years ago and have not been fired for decades. Each of the bolt action rifles were numbered for storage and inventory when the shooting club was in operation.  Rifles, 2,3,4 and 6 have a front sight and an adjustible rear.  Rifle 1 and 5 are missing sights.  4 each of the rifles have sling mounts and a few have 5 round clips.  A rifle like these are obviously antiques and most are in good or better condition.  Remember, you had teenagers handling these rifles though, there were as carefull as could be safely expected.  Some of them could be worth a lot more than I am asking."

Very beautiful gun, would make a great decoration.  It does need minor work however, it is missing one of the brass locks that holds the barrel pin, the right hammer needs a screw, and the left hammer key is stripped. Other then that, it is in very good condition esp for being so old! The previous owner was a gun nut, and told me it does function, as he fired it once, cleaned it and put it away. I really don't know what the gun is worth, so make me an offer, but please don't low ball me, I have sold and own several antique firearms and know it is worth more then $50....

This is the top of the line model with adjustable sights. Very very rare only made in small quantitys for 3 years. It was discontinued because it has such a fast powerful round in a tiny pistol. Only 50% of the time would it hit target directly and explode and do major damage. The other 50% of the time the bullet would key hole on impact and also due alot of damage. Because of that it was discontinued. If you sent it back to factory they would send you one in 22 magnum with the long rifle cylinder also. Alot were traded in for the 22 caliber version. Because of that and the small numbers that were made make this a very hard to find desireable little handgun. It is in very good condition and was fired very little. Im asking $450 or will trade for a ar15. These are very collectable and selling for $550 plus on the internet.If interested and your a nevada resident email me your number and ill call you back.
