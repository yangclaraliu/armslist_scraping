I bought this carbine new awhile back simply because I've always wanted one, its a blast to shoot; really quiet and very light recoil. It's had exactly 20 rnds through it for a simple test fire, that's all. Cleaned and well maintained, this thing's like an AR, very easy to disassemble. I've had it for awhile and it just sits in the gun room, so looking to possibly trade for something different.

I have here a Bavarian contract (rare contract) Steyr Hahn M1912 made in 1916, serial number 4164, all serialized parts match. No import marks. This was a project gun that is missing a few pieces but is still functional. The safety is missing, and the trigger bar is made from a bent and forged nail (I have no idea when in it's life the new trigger bar was made, but it looks almost as old as the gun and might could have been made in the trenches of WWI or WWII). The gun retains some original bluing on the pistol frame, the front and back straps as well as the slide have developed an old and even patina which is common with all guns this old. The grips are original and in decent shape for the age. Chambered in 9mm Steyr. Bore isn't great, but would probably clean up fairly well. Actual rifling is strong, there is just some pitting in the grooves, not too deep, nothing that would cause the barrel to be unsafe to fire. I really really really like this old gun just to have around, it's uncommon and interesting, but I have so many projects now I have to let some go. I want someone to appreciate this as much as I did and hopefully get all the missing pieces and shoot it. I'd like cash but I'll also consider trades. This gun loads with stripper clips from the top, and has no removable magazine. The gun looks good in the pics, it looks better in person."

BORE IS NICE . GREAT OVERALL CONDITION . PLEASE SEE LISTED DETAILS. The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing full power loads. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.The USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol. Need ffl and will need 50.00 overnite usps,I Will take more pictures for serious enquires.. I Find the person who purchase this Lucky .. Thanks

Do you want to shoot in a more dynamic setting?

10 student limit.

The Intermediate Pistol Course is all about getting comfortable with your firearm. This course will drive the core marksmanship fundamentals required to master the manipulation of your firearm. This course will take you out of the comfortable static shooting most people do at the local range. Emphasis is taken on instilling safety and proficiency with your firearm.
This course will prepare you to properly, safely and effectively unholster your firearm and present it to a threat if such need should arise. The dynamics of shooting at closer distances will be explained and the hands-on drills will drive home the importance of the core fundamentals.
This course is 25% classroom and 75% hands-on and will have you firing your handgun for approximately 6 hours. Manipulating your firearm under new pressures and timed constraints will prepare you for the unexpected. This course will not only teach you the skills, but will also give you the confidence you need to feel comfortable handling your firearm in worst case scenarios. This course is 1 day of hands-on lecture and hands-on drills.

Take a look on the web for more information about this ammo, it is one of the very best defensive options available. 

It is not intended to be your primary plinking bullet, you can (and should) buy the cheaper FMJ stuff to practice your rifle mechanics and marksmanship. This is SHTF, protect-your-life ammunition that you keep for that purpose. If you ever have to reach for your rifle to protect you or yours, this is the magazine you want to drop the bolt on. It has incredible energy transfer, is compatible with short-barrel rifles without issue, yet still has LESS danger of unwanted penetration through walls of a home and into a neighbor's property than pistol caliber bullets. 

With the craze over ammunition eating up supplies everywhere, Hornady annouced they were temporarily suspending production of their high-end defense rounds in favor of increasing production of the more popular plinking ammo that everyone is clamoring for in their shiny new post-craze AR's. As a result, these rounds have dried up online until they restart production.

The Beretta 950 Series of pistols was the Italian gun maker's entry into the ultra compact, small caliber pocket pistol for the latter half of the 20th century. The original Italian Beretta 950B was a .25 acp pistol, imported into the United States from 1952 until the passage of the ""Gun Control Act of 1968"". Beretta had to modify the design to comply with import restrictions and the new ""American"" model had an additional 'thumb safety' and was imported after 1968 as the Model 950BS (""S"" for Safety, however one cannot escape the irony of naming a model redesigned to comply with a gun control law as the ""BS"" model)................"

Noveske is one of the premier manufacturers of AR-15 pattern rifles and this is a perfect example. This rifle features a 16"" Stainless Steel barrel with a 1:7"" twist rate and Polygonal rifling. Polygonal rifling is an innovative alternative to conventional rifling, boasting increased velocity and accuracy, and significantly easier cleaning. The less angular bore profile provides an improved gas seal, decreases deformation of bullet jackets, and has less sharply angled grooves to help prevent deposits of fouling from forming. Noveske's Stainless Steel barrels are made to fill a precision role while retaining flawless function. Retaining accuracy and reliability is a complicated balance in that the chamber needs to be slightly modified from the NATO to improve bullet hook-up in the throat, while keeping to functional properties of the NATO body dimensions. The result is a proprietary Noveske chambering. The steel used is a type of 416r and hardened to about 30 HRC prior to any machining. These barrels are button rifled with Noveske's proprietary 7 PT button. This design and the type of stainless used helps the lead edge of the rifling from eroding as fast as it might with conventional rifling, and the barrels tend to outlast others. The barrel has a bead blasted finish for a matte appearance. A mid-length gas system is used, decreasing heat related wear to critical internal componentry, and reducing felt recoil to the operator. For use in any precision application, Noveske recommends a Stainless Steel barrel for its edge in accuracy and excellent reliability.

The lower receiver is a mil spec Noveske Gen II expertly milled from 7075-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum. It has a mil spec black hard coat anodized finish for excellent wear and corrosion resistance. The magazine well is aggressively flared for quick, easy reloads. An ALG Combat Trigger is installed, boasting a smoother, sharper trigger pull by extensive polishing and a Nickel Boron HardLube coating. The geometry of the sear and trigger assembly has not been altered, and thus reliability is not affected. The trigger and hammer are 8620 alloy steel that has been quenched, tempered, and carbuerized, offering very high surface hardness, and the pins are upgraded tempered 4140 Chrome Moly steel with a Nickel-Teflon coating. Pull weight is typically about 6 pounds, making it compliant with U.S. military specifications. A Mil Spec receiver extensions is installed with a Noveske QD plate and Vltor iMod Carbine stock mounted. A popular Magpul MOE pistol grip is equipped and one 30 round PMAG magazine is included. Noveske branded Troy back-up iron sights are included.

This is a SIG P229 in 9mm, Two-Tone, with night sights that are still very bright, DA/SA, and comes with the original (2) 13-round mags. Any reflection in the images is from the packing oil on the gun. 

The price to buy this gun is $650. No gouging here; I have listed it to sell at a fair price. Check the going prices for NIB P229s and you'll see it's about $200 less than you can get one from a dealer. I'm not looking to make a fortune, I just want to free up the room in the safe and use the money for ammo & supplies. 

No trades and no price reductions. I can meet you anywhere inside I-465 or within 10 miles outside of it. Cash only. I can meet most any day between 8am and 8pm. Buyer must sign a Bill of Sale and have an Indiana DL.

The Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless (the Type IV manufactured from 1926-1944) chambered in .32 ACP/AUTO, is a self-loading, semi-automatic pistol designed by John Browning and built by Colt Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut. Despite the title 'Hammerless', the Model 1903 does have a hammer. It is covered and hidden from view under the rear of the slide. This allowed the weapon to be carried in and withdrawn from a pocket quickly and smoothly without snagging. 

This Type IV Variation features integrated barrel bushing, 3 3/4"" barrel, 8 Round magazine, with a magazine safety. 

Serial Number: 508003 (1931) 

Perfect 100% original factory bluing, checkering on walnut grips is perfect and sharp. After looking over this firearm it is obvious that the only rounds that were fired are the 3 missing from the box of Winchester ""Staynless"" .32 Auto Colt.

Low round count (aprox 3 boxes of rounds). This was obtained from the original owner whom was a Texas rancher. His collection was 2nd to none. This rifle is from his collection.  It also has the original correct Redfield 2X scope that was purchased and installed at the time of the original purchase in 1956. Mounted with era correct Redfield M294 mount. Scope and mount is also a sought after vintage collectible in it's own right.  Again this is one of the nicest, cleanest pre 64 Winchesters you will find. Serial # is in the low 2 million which dates it in late 1954 to early 1956. 

I will consider trading this for the right trade. No ridiculous offers please, this is not a desperate  sale/trade. I will keep it in my collection unless I find the right trade."

836,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3089836,For Sale/Trade:  Cerakote Coating (Most durable firearm finish),"East Orlando, Orlando, Florida",$ 100,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 30, 2014",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am a hobbyist who has gotten into Cerakoting.  I enjoy doing it as a hobby and I am opening up my craft for others to have the opportunity to have customized weapons for themselves.  I am able to coat using any of the colors on the Cerakote website (http://cerakoteguncoatings.com) and I have even produced a few custom mixes for people already. (Tiffany Blue is one of them and the ladies go nuts for it!)

I am willing to meet with you to discuss any questions you might have.  If you are going to have the service performed it is easier to know which color you would like before taking delivery of the weapon so that I can order any colors that I might not already have in stock.  If a color needs to be ordered a non refundable deposit (half of the cost of what you want done) will need to be put down before the color is ordered.

Most turn around time when the color is in stock is 2 to 3 days.  If a color needs to be ordered then it takes about 2-3 weeks. This is why I prefer to order the color before taking delivery.  A week of cure time is needed before gun can be fired.  

If you bring me your weapon fully stripped it will cut down on return time otherwise a gun smithing fee will be added based on the weapon. (This will be done by a gun smith)

I am easy to work with so don't be afraid to make me offers.  I am willing to do discounts if you have more guns coated.  Text is best, if I don't pick up leave a message, and email works too but takes a little longer.  John REDACTED

947,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3089947,Want To Buy:  Want to buy Post-64 Winchester Model 70 LA Take-Off Barrel (30-06)...,"Seminole, FL, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, May 22, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am looking for a Post-64 Winchester Model 70 barrel.

The action that the barrel will mate with is a standard Model-70 push to feed bolt action manufactured in the New Haven Connecticut factory in the early 1970's.

The original rifle configuration as it was made in New Haven, Conn USA was Winchester Model 70-30-06 SPRG on a walnut wood stock, with blind magazine, and jeweled bolt.

I would like to find a barrel that meet the following criteria:
-  A pristine take-off factory barrel left over from a custom gun build would be ideal.
-  With or without iron sights.
-  I am trying to locate a Winchester 70 barrel chambered in 30-06 Springfield.
-  Replacement M70 barrel for Long Action (LA) receiver.
-  Really want a M-70 blued barrel.  (Stainless M70A barrel could work but would definitely require bluing and added expense of additional prep work to blue Stainless steel so I would value a Stainless barrel lower than a blued barrel).
-  The better the condition the existing bluing on the barrel is in, the more the barrel would be worth to me.  
-  22"" or 24""
-  Standard barrel Contour / factory standard contour. (I would consider heavy barrel / bull barrel but would require addition stock work and inletting so it would be worth less to me than a standard barrel.  Featherweight contour would likely be too thin for the inlet contour of the existing stock)
-  I would really prefer a M-70A factory (New Haven, CT) barrel (take off) and not after market but let me know what you have.

-  Does not need to be brand new but should be in good condition.
-  Hope to find a barrel that was removed properly leveraging the correct tools so as to show minimal marring or even better to be free of marring.
-  Bore must be in very good to excellent condition with strong rifling. No bore pitting.  No bore rust.
-  No counter bored barrels.  
-  Barrel cannot be bent and should have no suspect points that would raise concerns about the barrels integrity or the barrels harmonics.  
-  No crown issues.  
-  No chamber issues.

I know gunsmiths and serious shooters often end up with stock piles of factory Remington 700 and Winchester Model 70 barrels that are left over from custom long range rifle projects.  Hopefully this ad gets to the right seller and we are able to connect and come to a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.  

Please send me a message with what you have and what number you'd be looking to get for your barrel.  


FYI:
It is my understanding that although the Pre 64 and Post 64 Model 70's use are the same (.995 x 16) thread pattern, the pre-64 barrels will not work correctly on a post-64 receivers.  The Pre-64 chamber has a cone shaped cut along the chamber entrance and a major extractor cut for the control feed extractor.  The newer Winchester standard / sporter barrels and actions leverage a barrel with a flat cut coming off the back of the chamber.  Thus the Pre-64 and Post-64 Model 70 barrels and actions are not really interchangeable as you can't mix and match between generations."

I have been a member for years. And I've seen this change coming. I weathered the storm in the last big scare, but when it didn't balance back out, I had to say something. 

THE PRICES ON THIS SITE ARE NO LONGER REASONABLE.

Armslist is a great service but we are not being responsible with our listings. Most the handguns on here are so over priced that there are equivalents to each offer at a near by gun store. 

We need to move out of the scare prices from last year and go back to a group of people selling handguns privately with each other. 

Stop trying to rip each other off. Or do a little research on your gun. 

Email me if you want with your opinions. I set up this email just for this entry since I'm sure some people will get offended by this post. Probably the same people that want retail prices for used guns with 1000's of rounds through them. 

THANKS FOR THE FEEDBACK. IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WITH COMMON SENSE OUT THERE. AND IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT CURSED ME UP AND DOWN VIA EMAIL... NICE MOVES... I HOPE IT HELPS YOU SLEEP BETTER KNOWING HOW TOUGH YOU ARE."

This is a shotgun that was produced between 1985 and 1986 as a no-frills version of the Remington 1100, being built to the same quality standard as older Remingtons but lacking the receiver engravings and high-gloss walnut stock of the higher-tier guns. This is a much better made gun than the later budget Express line, none of the metal parts were replaced with plastic and the action is as smooth as any ""real"" 1100. This shotgun was converted into a tactical configuration by a gunsmith and includes:

-Enlarged gas port for increased reliability with the shortened barrel
-Speedfeed IV-S pistol grip stock and synthetic Remington handguard
-enlarged tactical bolt handle
-Remington +2 magazine extension tube, for a capacity of 7 rounds total
-recently replaced the bolt buffers and gas system components

The gun is blued and while the receiver is worn the barrel is in good shape. Sights are a front bead. Is chambered for 2.75"" 12ga and takes all standard 1100 barrels and parts.

Sorry, not interested in trades right now. Looking to get cash but I'm not selling it out of desperation to fund this month's mortgage or anything, lowball offers will not be considered. Thanks!"
