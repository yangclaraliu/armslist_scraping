The collector took pride in his collection and had a lot of rare and unique firearms he had gathered over the years. There is slight wear on the back of the frame but this gun works perfectly and it feels awesome just holding it and even more so shooting it. These rarely come up for sale and when they do they do not last long. Asking $2500 or best offer.

CLICK HERE and HereThe Nambu pistols (南部拳銃 or 南部大型自動拳銃 Nanbu kenjuu or Nanbu ōgata jidou-kenjuu) were a series of semi-automatic pistols produced by the Japanese company Koishikawa Arsenal later known as the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal.[1] The series had five variants, the Type A Model 1902 (also called the Grandpa Nambu), the Type A Model 1902 Modified (also known as the Papa Nambu), the Type B (also known as the Baby Nambu), the Type 14 (南部十四年式自動拳銃) and the Type 94. The pistols were designed by Kijiro Nambu and saw extensive service during the Russo-Japanese War, Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. The Type A was made in very small numbers. Type A Modified and Type B Nambus were never formally adopted by any branch of the armed forces of Imperial Japan but were sold to officers through officer stores. The Type 14 was adopted as an official sidearm. As World War II progressed, and particularly in the final year of the war, in order to speed production, Type 14s began to be more hastily manufactured with a subsequent decline in quality. History[edit] The origin of the Nambu pistol series goes back to a design by Lieutenant General Kijiro Nambu.[2] General Nambu claimed the design originated with experimentation during the ""30 year Automatic Pistol Plan"" of 1897 in Japan.[1] It is probable that the pistol series was influenced by the Mauser C96, after a Japanese commission toured Europe and reported recent developments. The first Nambu type known as the Type A was completed in 1902.[1] The Type A underwent trials with the Imperial Japanese Army but was never formally adopted.[1] Many Original Type As were sold commercially to China and Siam.[1]Coinciding with British customs, Japanese army officers were expected to purchase their own side arms.[2] The Nambu Type A Modified pistol was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1909 and the Thai Army in the 1920s.[2] Most of the Type A Modified and Type B Nambu pistols were produced by the Tokyo Arsenal with a few pistols being produced by the Tokyo Gas and Electric Company.[1] The Type 14 Nambu was produced by the Nagoya Arsenal in either Nagoya's Atsuta or Toriimatsu factories.[3]  REDACTED"

I regret selling this fine piece of hardware but I have to make some choices... need room in the safe.   This Springfield XD9 Tactical is a few years old but still looks great and works like a champ. I keep it clean and treat it nice.  I used a little white model paint and touched up the engraving to give it a little accent and the white fill in of the lettering looks very cool.   I also replaced the back plate with one with an American Flag on it.. looks quite patriotic. I upgraded the rod with one that reduces recoil and I have to say that the gun handles much better. I then added the Crimson Trace trigger guard red laser and bought an extra mag to go with it.   Sale includes:  Original box pistol lock 3 magazines Crimson Trace red trigger guard laser Firing Rod upgrade American Flag backplate ..also features white touch up paint to highlight engraved markings  The gun has been cleaned and is ready for sale.I have plenty of good pictures to send and am willing to meet at an indoor range if you are serious and want to try before you buy.  Please let me know if you are interested. Thank you,  Michael"
