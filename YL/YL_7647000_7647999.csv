Please see pictures for some of the markings and condition. This is an octogon barreled version, which was issued to general enlisted men in the Italian Army.

Not interested in shipping.  Please email me for pictures.  Here is a description of the history of this model;The Bodeo Model 1889 revolver was invented by Italian firearm designer Carlo Bodeo. Based on the Chamelot-Delvigne Model 1873 revolver, it was produced by a wide variety of manufacturers between 1889 and 1925. It was also produced in Spain from 1915 to 1918. The Bodeo Model 1889 was employed by the Italian Army during World War I, the Interwar Italian colonial wars, and World War II."

The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. SureFire's patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree.A new indexing system means this suppressor mounts to a current-model SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous versions, and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area. Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-MONSTER produces minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles.The SOCOM556-MONSTER is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach® lock ring and Cerakote™ ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color.All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm. SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction™ (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use.All SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots. Patented Fast-Attach® design provides rock-solid attachment and easy removal in seconds Identical to the SureFire SOCOM556-RC, but with serrated teeth on the front plate Same revolutionary suppressor technology as SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, winner of US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) extensive and rigorous suppressor trials Provides effective attenuation of sound and dust signatures Minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with unsuppressed weapon regardless of number of attach-detach cycles Compact and lightweight for minimum overall weapon length and minimum impact on handling characteristics Advanced core design to reduce back pressure, cyclic rate, and gas blowback Patent-pending front-plate design and proprietary gas-flow improvements virtually eliminate first-round flash Integrated blast shield increases durability Constructed of advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and stainless steel Redundant-welded subcomponents eliminate parts loosening Tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond and Cerakote™ finish in Black or Dark Earth color"
