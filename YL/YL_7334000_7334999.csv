FFL for transfer/background check is required per state law.If interested please contact me at:Text: REDACTEDEmail: REDACTEDContents for Sale:1x P229 Scorpion1x Pistol Case2x 15rd Factory Mags2x 15rd Nickel Plated Mec Gar Mags2x 18rd Extended Mec Gar Mags

They became a favorite among target shooters and buffalo hunters, and were used by the US Army for a number of years.

When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

The .223 Wylde is a hybrid .223/.556 chamber designed by Bill Wylde to yield the accuracy advantages of the match .223 Remington commercial chambering but without the pressure or reliability failures when using high velocity 5.56 NATO spec ammunition. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56, but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition because case dimensions are the same. These facts lead to the .223 Wylde having SUPERIOR target and varmint accuracy, a compatibility with all .223 and 5.56 NATO ammunition and being a top choice for competition shootrs.

681,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7334681,For Sale:  SIGNAL CANNON 4 GA. Stainless Steel Swivel Gun MARINE Signal Gun 4 Ga. BREECH LOADING CANNON,"Sacramento, Sacramento, California","$ 2,250","Listed On: Saturday, September 16, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,Pistol,"Here is a high quality late 19Th. century style 4 Ga. breech loading signal/salute gun. The material used for the barrel is 17-4 PH H1150 high strength boat shaft material. All of the mounting hardware is made from standard marine grade stainless or nickel steel material. The wooden base is hand rub finished mahogany.
We have one of this model design ready to ship. Made by Beaufort Naval Armorers and available in several sizes, this is ""THE Signal/Salute Gun"", for the 21st century.
This fine piece is fitted with a 'concentric' interrupted thread breech closure who's safety is in the fact that the double entrance modified square thread remains un-interrupted for the locking quarter turn. With this design, the full firing pin engagement is not possible until the proper and safe quarter turn of the breech block is made. The barrel/chamber area of this particular design incorporates the 'male' thread portion of the breech closure. This way, there is no need for an 'extractor' or cartridge rim recess. Simply pull the fired shell out.
I personally have been firing precisely timed signal cannon 'salutes' with no misfires for events and races etc. for forty years. This model has proven to me to be the most pleasing and enjoyable style to operate. It's breech system is so reliable and smooth with just one operational moving part necessary. The breech seal is such that there is absolutely zero 'blow by' of the powder gases, making cleaning an easy one or two minute task.
As you can see, this signal/salute gun is of absolute 'sound' quality with it's minimum of over complicated moving parts. With this, you as well will experience the continuing robust and trouble free operation.
Included, is a very nice stainless steel wire rope lanyard to assist with firing from a safe distance and a spanner wrench so as to safely lock/un-lock the breech. The spanner wrench tool is not necessary for standard loading and firing sessions. Hand operation works fine for that. This smart safety feature is mainly so the owner can secure the breech closure so no one else can easily meddle with or fire the piece without the responsible owner and spanner wrench being present. If you use this on board a boat or on a pier, we will include a nice marine marlinspike crafted lanyard (not shown) so as to secure the breech block from ""Davy Jones's Locker"".
The whole weight of the piece is 36 pounds and will fit inside of a 20X12X12 ID box."

Built on the 3-screw K-frame, this revolver is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge and sports a 6-inch heavy weight barrel without the full lug. It features an adjustable rear sight with plain black blade and a Patridge front sight milled integral to the barrel. This is a ""Pre-Lock"" revolver...no internal safety lock BS. Nor are there any of the cheap-o MIM powdered metal small parts...all forged steel here. Condition is excellent with about 97-98% of the original bright blue finish remaining. There is a light cylinder drag line, a few small handling marks, and a small amount of finish wear to the edges of the muzzle. The case colors on the target hammer and target trigger are strong. The target stocks are in very good shape with just a couple of minor marks but no cracks or chips. The mechanics are in perfect working order with good timing and solid lock-up. The bore is also excellent with bright, sharp rifling. The Model 17-5 is actually somewhat uncommon, manufactured for only about one year before being replaced by the overly heavy full-lug-barrel Model 17-6. According to the serial number, this revolver was manufactured in about 1988. This should be one heck of a tack-drivin' revolver!Buyer pays $20.00 shipping."

Built on the 3-screw K-frame, this revolver is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge and sports a 6-inch heavy weight barrel without the full lug. It features an adjustable rear sight with plain black blade and a Patridge front sight milled integral to the barrel. This is a ""Pre-Lock"" revolver...no internal safety lock BS. Nor are there any of the cheap-o MIM powdered metal small parts...all forged steel here. Condition is excellent with about 97-98% of the original bright blue finish remaining. There is a light cylinder drag line, a few small handling marks, and a small amount of finish wear to the edges of the muzzle. The case colors on the target hammer and target trigger are strong. The target stocks are in very good shape with just a couple of minor marks but no cracks or chips. The mechanics are in perfect working order with good timing and solid lock-up. The bore is also excellent with bright, sharp rifling. The Model 17-5 is actually somewhat uncommon, manufactured for only about one year before being replaced by the overly heavy full-lug-barrel Model 17-6.

Built on the 3-screw K-frame, this revolver is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge and sports a 6-inch heavy weight barrel without the full lug. It features an adjustable rear sight with plain black blade and a Patridge front sight milled integral to the barrel. This is a ""Pre-Lock"" revolver...no internal safety lock BS. Nor are there any of the cheap-o MIM powdered metal small parts...all forged steel here. Condition is excellent with about 97-98% of the original bright blue finish remaining. There is a light cylinder drag line, a few small handling marks, and a small amount of finish wear to the edges of the muzzle. The case colors on the target hammer and target trigger are strong. The target stocks are in very good shape with just a couple of minor marks but no cracks or chips. The mechanics are in perfect working order with good timing and solid lock-up. The bore is also excellent with bright, sharp rifling. The Model 17-5 is actually somewhat uncommon, manufactured for only about one year before being replaced by the overly heavy full-lug-barrel Model 17-6. According to the serial number, this revolver was manufactured in about 1988. This should be one heck of a tack-drivin' revolver!Buyer pays $20.00 shipping."
