Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of brand new, factory fresh Henry H001M .22 Mag Lever-Action Rifles!  Henry lever-actions are known around the globe for their incredibly smooth action and great accuracy, right out of the box. This model features a smooth American Walnut stock and blued finish.

I only have two in stock, and have them priced to sell for just $399.00 each.

 Henry H001M .22 Mag Lever-Action Rifle with 19.25″ Barrel, 11+1 Capacity Tubular Magazine, Checkered American Walnut Stock
The tubular magazine holds 11 rounds. It weighs 5 1/2 pounds and overall length is 37 1/2″. With regard to ballistics, in general the .22 Magnum travels twice as fast the .22 LR cartridge and delivers twice the energy. Various types of .22 magnum cartridges are available from all the major ammo makers.
Clair Rees, who authored a Rimfire Column article in GUNS Magazine, had this to say about our rifle, “I’ve done enough shooting with Henry’s .22 Magnum to know it operates smoothly and reliably. Accuracy is good, too. At 50 yards, it produced 5-rounds averaging an even inch center-to-center with Winchester Supreme jacketed hollowpoints. This great looking .22WMR lever carbine delivers. This is a good buy.”

This P229 has siglite night sights from 2013 manufacture and custom rosewood grips. I have held a 229 with a standard trigger and a SRT, and when you hold the hammer back with the trigger coming forward the reset is earlier on this model and is more inline with the SRT. I cannot confirm it has the SRT, but it sure feels like it. The other thing I can tell you is when you hold this pistol and then hold a cheaper pistol, you know why this one is worth the $.

It comes with 3 factory mags, hard case, lock, and paperwork. This has been in the safe and only to the range once. I am selling because I have to, not because I want to. $750 cash, no trades. Can meet in Columbia or Irmo in 30 minute radius."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a brand new, factory fresh and hard to find Ruger Blackhawk Flattop Combination .45 acp/ .45 colt revolver.  This beautiful revolver features a 4 5/8″ barrel, stainless steel construction, faux Ivory grip, and of course, the 2 cylinders to switch between calibers.

I only have one in stock, and have it priced to sell for just $609.00.

Ruger 5243 Blackhawk Flattop Revolver, 45 ACP / 45 Long Colt, 4 5/8″ Barrel, Ivory Grip, Stainless Finish, 6 Round, Convertible Cylinders
The mid-size Ruger Flattop sixguns are some of the finest packing guns ever produced. The original 357′s and the wildly popular 44 Specials have been highly prized for their smaller dimensions and great balance. Now, you can have this classic revolver in the most classic sixgun cartridge of them all, the 45 Colt.
This is the first Ruger Flattop made in stainless steel with a 4 5/8″ barrel and is the first stainless steel Flattop chambered in 45 Colt. As of right now, this is the only Ruger 45 Colt stainless steel single action revolver with adjustable sights being produced. The regular stainless steel Blackhawk in 45 Colt was discontinued by Ruger several years ago.
As a bonus, we spec’d out these guns to include an auxillary 45 ACP cylinder. This production run will also feature “gunfighter” style simulated ivory grips that Ruger has used on some of their special edition guns, such as the Joe Bowman commemorative. For those of you who don’t like the “cheesegrater” (as some people call them) black plastic grips that have been included on the Flattops, this will be a nicer feel. The front sights on these 45 Colt revolvers are taller than the sights on the 44 Specials revolvers so that there is plenty of elevation available for various bullet weights. On this stainless version, the front sight is pinned into the base so you can switch the front sight out for other heights or configurations that work best for you. All parts, including the gripframe and ejector rod housing are made out of a brushed finish stainless steel.

Bushmaster comes with all factory accessories (box, manual, sling, one mag, and red dot) 

Delton/sniper co. comes with one mag and has been rattle can spray painted. This is not a permanent spray job and will wear off over time, or if removed with acetone. In my opinion the camo pattern is very appealing. The original under coat is a metallic black that I believe may be cerakote. I did not apply this coat of paint and therefore I am not sure."

This gun was made entirely in Germany. Unlike the West German Sigs from decades ago, Sig Sauer recently produced a limited number of German made P226's that were produced with higher quality and craftsmanship than those currently made in New Hampshire.This is one of them. 

This pistol is hard to find and, unlike US-made Sigs, it is serialized in three separate areas - the slide, the frame, and the barrel - and has several German proof marks. Additionally, this P226 has been Durakoted flat dark earth color, has the E2 ergonomic grips, Sig Lite Night Sights, and has an accessory rail unlike other West German-made Sigs from years ago. This pistol comes with (2) 15 round 9mm magazines and functions flawlessly.

I had to select rifle due to Armslist not recognizing .300 BLK as a pistol caliber.  

Reason for sale: I was bit by the Blackout Bug, and eventually realized that I don't have the time to reload and shoot as much as my imagination thought i did.  So I am putting my entire Blackout related Reloading setup up for Sale or Trade.  I built this upper from a Colt 14.5"" SOCOM Upper minus the barrel and muzzle device. So the upper receiver, bolt, and Troy VTAC handguard have been lightly used, all other parts are new.  The Upper and the Troy handguard had been previously spraypainted Tan.  There is a small amount of residual tan remaining, but it can be removed with a little elbow grease.  I've taken the condition into consideration in pricing.

Magpul polymer picatinny rail mounted on the bottom for an angled fore-grip or vertical foregrip.  
NOTE: this handgun has a barrel length less than 16"" and an overall length greater than 26"". This makes it a Title 1 ""other"" firearm.  Therefore, under Federal laws, it can legally have a forward vertical grip.
If the overall length was less than 26"", then it would be a Title 1 ""handgun"" and the addition of a forward vertical grip would make it a Title 2 AOW (tax stamp required).

Or, I'll trade on certain rifles. I'll list my preferences below but don't hesitate in asking on something that not's listed. I'll trade based on values of each others guns and would expect cash difference as I will pay difference for trades worth more than mine.

Ok since I sold the .458 5 or 6 years ago and my dad traded the .303 for a double barrel 20 gauge 40 years ago so I had a gun to rabbit hunt when I was 13. I guess I don't need this ammo. I am tired of moving it around.

This pistol is in outstanding condition for a test Luger as most were beaten beyond recognition and were pitted from one end to the other from the humid Climates in the philliphnes and Cuba and most of them encountered today are mismatched and reblued. This one is all numbers matching and 100% original finish with about 40-50% of its original rust blue finish with a small spot of pitting on the barrel. This gun belongs in a meuseum or an advanced collection. Below is some information about the 1000 test Lugers. One thousand test Lugers (7.65 cal) were delivered to the U. S. Springfield Armory in late 1901. Most were distributed to U.S. Cavalry troops involved in police actions in the Philippines and Cuba. As the American Cavalry troops had used revolvers (Colt .45 and .38) for over 30 years, the small caliber, complex Luger, was viewed with some suspicion and not readily accepted. There were complaints as to small caliber, safety while riding from horseback, and unreliable action. As a result of these reports 50 Lugers in caliber 9mm were briefly tested by the Army in 1904-1906 and three Lugers in .45 caliber were tested. Ultimately the Luger was rejected in favor of the Colt 1911. he characteristics that separate these U.S.-American Eagle-Test Lugers from other Model 1900 Lugers are: the lack of proofs, the lack of a Germany import stamp and the last two digits of the Lugers serial numbers on the right end of the takedown lever (instead of the left lower side) which this guns displays all of. This serial number is also listed on the bannerman sales invoice when he bought all the remaining Lugers that survived testing from the us army ordnance department confirming beyond a shadow of a doubt this is indeed A us test trials pistol. Will consider trades on collectable coins from the 1800s, gold and silver coins or gold and silver bullion. Take I look around at recent auctions and you will see you will never find another of these pistols close to this cheap. I'm willing to ship to any FFL or C&R license holder.

Introduction
Introducing the new Spike's Tactical Gen II billet lower receiver! 
Features

Just when you thought it couldn't be any better we bring you this new cutting edge design. The new Gen II billet lower receiver is based off of our original Biohazard billet lower receiver but with many added features, reduced weight, and enhanced styling. If you want the absolute best AR15 lower receiver on the market then this is for you! 

Gen II billet lower receiver specifications and features: 

- All edges and surfaces have been 3D chamfered to reduce snagging while still maintaining the blocky billet look

- Type III hardcoat anodized finish 

- Integrated winter style trigger guard

- Integrated ambi bolt release paddle. The paddle is machined from 4140 Chromoly bar stock and features a durable black Nitride finish

- Integrated ambi magazine release paddle. The paddle is machined from 4140 Chromoly bar stock and features a durable black Nitride finish

- Oversized enhanced bolt catch. The bolt catch is machined from 4140 Chromoly bar stock and features a durable black Nitride finish 

- Enhanced 6061-T6 billet magazine catch button which features a hard anodized finish

- All paddles are ergonomically positioned and optimized for both left hand and right hand shooters. The paddle surfaces and mag catch button also feature an aggressive textured finish for positive engagement

- Enhanced pivot and take down pins which were designed around the lower receiver for a unique integrated look The pivot and take down pins are machined from 6AL4V Titanium and feature a grey hard anodized finish infused with Teflon for ultra-smooth function

- The pivot and take down pins have slightly larger heads and dimples in the end which allow you to break the rifle down much quicker and easier

- Lower receiver design integrates KNS Gen 2 Mod ST anti-rotation pins. Very low profile and very clean appearance

- Large flared magwell

- Magwell is compatible with all AR15/M16 magazines including the M3 Pmag, Beta C mag, and Surefire high capacity magazines

- Magwell will drop free of ALL in-spec magazines 

- The front of the magwell is textured for an aggressive appearance 

- Low shelf for RDIAS use

- Set screw for adjustable trigger reset

- Set screw for upper to lower tension

- Bolt catch and bolt release paddle are retained with a threaded stainless steel pin rather than a roll pin

- Lower receiver can be assembled without a hammer and punch

- 3D machined Spider logo

- 3D machined bullet pictogram safety selector markings on both sides of the receiver

- Clean milled engraving for all text and information 

- Caliber is marked Multi for use with any cartridge that will fit in an AR15 magwell

- Compatible with 45* BAD ASS, 57* V7, 60* Noveske, and all 90* safety selectors 

- Pockets machined in many areas to reduce weight. The lower receiver design was engineered to put the weight and strength exactly where we wanted it. The end result is a cutting edge billet lower receiver that weighs only 248.9 grams stripped! Now you can have a billet lower receiver with full ambi controls at the weight of a standard forged receiver without sacrificing any strength. 

- 100% Made in the USA and backed by our Lifetime Warranty!

This is a Copy of the Rifle Owned By John Noveske. It is in 5.56 rather than .300blk. This rifle cost over 3k to put together using all authentic Noveske Factory parts. I mention this because some poor broke coward flagged this for being overpriced. My advise is that you do your homework and you will see that to have this professionally built as this rifle is it will cost you 3k or more. This has a Factory Built  Noveske 10.5"" CQB SS Upper that has been refinished in Magpul Foliage Cerakote . The lower was built from Scratch using the exact parts used in the noveske rifle. This is NOT the "" Jonny Rifle"" that is being marketed by noveske currently. Rather, it is a copy of the exact rifle J. noveske owned and used. The Suppressor is a authentic AAC S3R Factory Demo Can that has been permanently attached for the legal 16"" OAL. Guys this Rifle is awesome, light. and rare. $2500 shipped, $2450 FTF in N.C. ( that is reduced by $500)
Please, all dreamers, tire kickers and  Eddie Haskell types just keep moving on to the next item. This is for someone who understands what he is getting, and can afford to pay what it cost. Thank you, we all appreciate it."
