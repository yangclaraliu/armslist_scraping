The factory original blue finish is in excellent condition and the round knob blond walnut stock rates very high as well. The European blonde walnut has a rich wood grain and tiger striped texture. She is fit with the original sporting sight in the rear and a dove tail up front. The rifle also features an 11 round tubular feed system and a 22"" round barrel. The pump handle is grooved and provides plenty of traction up forward.Top of barrel reads: FABRIQUE NATIONAL D'ARMES DE GUERRE HERSTAL - BELGIQUE / BROWNING PATENT DEPOSE. All proof markings that have been stamped into this rifle have been photo documented through the attached images below. Bore shows strong and all mechanical actions are exact. A very nice example from the mid 20th century.The quality of the parts, the fit and finish and the silky-smooth action belie how much it must have cost to produce the Trombone. When you cycle the action, you can feel the engineering / manufacturing build quality. The action is authoritative, it ejects with aplomb, the forearm moves like it's on ball bearings. She feels like a Swiss watch. It is certainly one of the most desired rifles in her class and has a following like few others. She comes to your shoulder like it was meant to be there. It is deceptively petite, but shoots the lights out with uncanny accuracy.                                                                         Browning Trombone HistoryThe FN Browning Trombone is a pump-action long takedown rifle designed by John M. Browning in 1919, patented on 1 August 1922 and manufactured by Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal Belgium from 1922 to 1974. Models manufactured post 1969 had a product code W. The rifle has a .22 caliber chamber, a tubular 11-round magazine, round barrel, wooden semi-pistol grip stock. Models made in the late 1960s featured a dovetail notch for mounting scopes. During the Trombone’s introduction, Winchester was planning to bring out a hammerless .22 pump at the time but couldn't because their design violated several Browning patents on the Trombone. It took Winchester until 1932 to bring out a hammerless pump (the Model 61, of course.) The Trombone design had a feed mechanism similar to the Remington Model 12 and the firing pin and ejector were similar to the Marlin Model 1897. What was original was the locking system. Most hammerless pumps cam the breech block up into a recess in the roof of the receiver."
