This model was built in the early 19080's between 1981 and 1984. It features a 5.5 inch bull barrel, adjustable target sights, adjustable trigger over-travel stop, stipled front and rear grip straps, and checkered Walnut ""military"" style grips. It is considered a ""late"" production model by High Standard after they switched to an allen screw arrangement to fasten the barrel to the frame; rather than a push button like the earlier guns. This example still has 99% of the original factory blue finish remaining and only has a tiny bit of thinning on the top of the slide where it has made contact with the sight bridge. The bore is minty and bright in this pistol. The rifling still has sharp lands and grooves and shows no signs of pitting or erosion. The factory checkered Walnut grips are in excellent condition and are free from any cracks or repairs. The adjustable target sights work perfectly and the safety clicks positively on and off. Everything works on this pistol 100% like the day it left the factory. Both the external and internal condition of this pistol suggest that it has spent the vast majority of it's life in storage and has likely had less than 50 rounds fired thru it. If you have been looking to buy a top-notch .22 target pistol without having to spend a lot of money this is it. I would imagine that this pistol will out-shoot many others costing 3 times as much!"

Everyone knows about the fantastic quality that was built into every firearm, from the select wood to the attention to detail. This one is clean as new with virtually no blue wear. The gorgeous walnut checkered straight grip stock and matching forend rate an easy 99% - no scratches, dents, nicks, or dings. The fine line checkering is perfect. Features a very highly polished receiver mated to a blued 26"" octagon barrel with a great bore. The case colored hammer and fire blued trigger are an added bonus. This one is from my personal collection and you'd be hard pressed to find a better one. They don't make 'em like this any more. Add it to your collection or take it out and shoot it! See my feedback - my descriptions are honest. If you don't like it, you're welcome to send it back for a refund - but you'll be pleased. Feel free to ask questions and I'll respond as soon as I can."

If it had a traditional unit disc - it was held with tack nails vs screws (two faint nail holes), so I put in a condition disc in a cavity with a center hole.Bayonet lug is unserialized and brand new - HVA (Husqvarna) crown.Sling buckle is original and brand new.Sling is original Swedish, about 49"" (as original carbine length) - however its a modified sling - meaning its cut off from a machine gun/SMG sling, BUT, with keeper and great condition, tried to capture in the pictures.Slight counter bore - this was a barrel extension, cut back to original length & recrowned with my original Swedish crown tool.

This is a Face to Face sale.Swedish Mauser Carbine Sporter. caliber: 65x55This is a Carl Gustaf 1907 M94 that was sporterized.Intention was to replace the stock with a small ring Mauser Boyd or Fajen stock, however, with deer season right around the corner seller decided to use 30-30 for a brush rifle. The sporterized stock is original (obviously chopped) so it is serialized to the receiver. Bolt body is also original to the receiver, however everything else on the bolt is new old stock (NOS). The bolt was fitted by a very experienced and well-known gunsmith who specializes in Mauser fittings, so it literally functions better than new. The bolt handle was bent to clear the scope (swept back). The same gunsmith that fitted the bolt skillfully shortened the barrel as well as recrowning it. Barrel measures 16.25” in length. The 11-degree target crown is recessed so the crown is protected. Rifling is strong. Everything is professionally blued or re-blued. Headspace is checked and is good to go (you will have no issues with either surplus M/41 or PPU ammo. Naturally this is a small ring Mauser design, you will NOT want to do anything too fast burning out of it - both safety and accuracy reasons). 3 followers are included. All NOS. Of the two that I blued -one I profiled to close on empty, the other is original shape (blued). The third is not blued- original in the white and brand new. There are no front or rear open sights. The scope is a Redfield 4x with 4-plex reticle. The glass is clear with no scratches. Adjustment has both serrated and slot so you can use either a coin or your fingers to turn.Weak point of this rifle - is the stock and sling. You will most likely want to replace both as seller had intended. Although, if your looking for a lighter rifle for a smaller person (kid) or female this would be perfect as it is very light. Total weight is just under 7 lbs.For those unfamiliar with 6.5x55 - as flat as .270win, with half of the recoil of .270. Cheap 139gr PPU SP ammo would do just fine for plinking and hunting out of this. If you reload, these really like 129gr SST pills via RL-22 or Norma MRP.Will need to be sighted in.additional images of the rifle can be viewed here:http://s1016.photobucket.com/user/audiobahn1/slideshow/audiobahn1/M94%20Swedish%20Carbine%20sporter%2065x55?sort=3"

For sale is a Ruger LCP with a Purple Frame, 2 magazines, a Galco Holster, Original Box, etc. Rather low round count probably less than 10 Magazines (<100 rounds).  To be honest, this is gun is not wildly pleasent to shoot. Its super lightweight, small, and easily carried, which is why its great to carry not great to shoot, its FAR MORE PLEASANT than 357 J-Frame though. The Trigger is a long double action which is good for avoiding unitended discharge for those with poor trigger discipline, but may be off putting for the guys that have Custom 1911's. That's pretty much it I suppose if you have questions please feel free to email.Transaction will occur at Eagle Armory in O'fallon MO, I will cover the $15 FFL Fee."

Allows removal of the dust cover for easy cleaning and also includes a brass deflector that pushes brass out to the right instead of straight up.  This is a $100 mount-Cabelas red dot sight I also have reloading supplies for the 7.62x39 if you want to squeeze maximum accuracy out of this gun.  These include- RCBS full length die set (2 dies)- assorted once fired brass (actual brass cases, not steel)  Some brass is primed with Federal 210 primers- 1 box Barnes .310 cal 123 grain TSX bullets (excellent big game bullet)- 1/2 box Barnes .310 cal 108 grain RRLP frangible bullets (excellent varmint and target bullet)There is nothing wrong with this rifle.  Excellent condition. The only reason I'm selling it is because my 300 BLK does everything this can plus more, and I want to fund another gun.  More pics upon request."

I will not agree to meet without speaking over the phone.National Match 50 BMG - has the match grade 33"" fluted barrel vs. the standard 30"". Comes standard with skid plates for competition use, I have replaced with a bipod and rear monopod for daily long range shooting.I have about 100 rounds through it. Broken in with one shot, clean, one shot, clean for 15 rounds (took 2 seperate 5 hour shooting days to complete) then cleaned after 5 rounds twice (third shooting day). Has since been cleaned after every 5-10 shots. I bought it with the intent to compete, however 2 job changes and 3 states later, I don't have the time to, and also don't believe there are any competitions in my area. I don't expect to get what I paid for it, however I am not in any dire need to sell it. The cheapest I can find it for online is $3,500 before taxes and fees. I am willing to sell for $3,300 for the rifle, however $4,200 is the out the door price, as I will only sell it with the stainless steal case ($500) and the monopod+bipod set up. (Update- Price drop to $3,750, Which is the price I am willing to negotiate down to- This is a fantastic price in my opinion, wouldn’t even be able to get a Standard model for this price).I didn't skimp on the accessories, bought the hard case and the ""essentials kit"" from Allied Precision Arms which was just over $1,000 with taxes and fees. I will drop $100 off the accessories as the case has standard wear and tear. Note that this is the only case specifically designed for the national match rifle, and does not require any parts to be disassembled to put into the case (other than the bolt being removed). I also have about 500 or so rounds I can sell for $3.50 a shot (same cost as the cheapest BMG ammo I could find online, however this is 750 grain ammo I paid $5.00 a shot for almost 2 years ago).I will not ship. I will pay any filing fee to have the ownership document with a licensed firearms dealer.Pre-Purchase fire is encouraged, however I want to discourage people from coming out just to shoot it. I will require a $20 non-refundable deposit on the rifle (that goes towards the purchase price of the rifle if purchased), and $5 per shot fired (My ammo, If you purchase the rifle, you get 2 shots [$10]refunded, and any shots past the initial two are reduced to $3.50/round). Please email me with any questions, I love to talk about it. It is a real eye catcher and conversation starter.Please feel free to call/text me with any questions at 612-961-6413."

This Styer M95 (M95/30) is one of the rare long rifles that avoided being cut down and turned into a carbine. (Estimates are that only about 75k out of the 3.5 million made stayed as long rifles-and who knows how many of those survived 100 years). It was likely purchased by Bulgaria prior to WW2. The original wood stock has tons of character as you can feel each and every grain. If only you could hear the stories this fella could tell. When purchased by Bulgaria the serials were scrubbed and renumbered to their arsenal. It is chambered for 8x54r and certainly not one of those things you ""see every day"". I would love any more info anyone has on it, as Styer information is not as easy to come by as Mauser or Mosin."

The Ruger® Super Blackhawk -Action Revolver is designed specifically to handle the chamber pressures and recoil of the powerful .44 Magnum cartridge. The Super Blackhawk is similar to Ruger's standard Blackhawk model in that it has a solid cylinder-frame made of premium modern steel, and uses all coil springs in the mechanism that retain their power for ultra-durability (instead of leaf-springs). The robust Super Blackhawk features an all-steel grip frame to add weight and balance the sidearm, and the grip is slightly longer than that of the standard Blackhawk to provide a solid grip and disperse recoil over a larger area. The back of the trigger guard has been squared off to give more room for the shooter's knuckles to protect them from punishing recoil. The hammer spur on the Super Blackhawk is lower and wider, and the trigger is wider as well. An unfluted cylinder is also featured to add weight and withstand high-pressure .44 magnum loads. Common to all Ruger Single-Action Revolvers, the Super Blackhawk uses Ruger's patented transfer bar ignition system that provides an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge, allowing the shooter to carry the revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. The traditional western-style grip pattern of the Super Blackhawk is known for aiding in natural pointing characteristics, enabling shooters to instinctively draw and shoot, as well as stand and take fine aim. The rear sight is click adjustable for both windage and elevation, and is protected by integral frame topstrap ribs. The front sight is an improved Patridge type that provides a good sight picture, and allows for snag-free withdrawal from holsters. The Ruger Super Blackhawk Single-Action Revolver represents a great value in a big game hunting or target-shooting sidearm. Made in USA.

Also, please don’t make an offer if your not prepared to follow through. My time is valuable, just as yours is.

Night sights preferred, but not a deal breaker. May need some cash on your end to even out values depending on accessories included. I’m negotiable.

(former Vursan arms company). Stoeger arms factory, along with old and famous US-based arms importing company Stoeger Industries are now owned by Beretta Group (Italy), and thus all Stoeger brand guns are made to strict European quality standards, while maintaining affordable price well below their more famous rivals of 'true' Italian or American origin. The Stoeger model 2000 shotgun is built around the famous inertia-operated action, pioneered and patented several decades ago by Benelli Armi company in Italy. Today Benelli is owned by the same Beretta group, so Stoeger has access to Benelli patents and uses inertia-operated system under license. Compared to similarly configured Benelli shotguns (Benelli Rafaello in hunting versions and Benelli M1 Super 90 in Defense versions), Stoeger model 2000 maybe lacks some refinement in small details and finish, as well as a ""brand-name appeal"", but it is as practical and reliable as its much more expensive Italian-made counterparts. Author of this website can vote for this opinion as I own the Stoeger model 2000 since the year 2004 and barely had any problems with it (there were few failures to fire due to extra-hard primers on certain brand of Russian-made shells). The inertia-operated action makes this gun very simple to disassemble and clean, and provides good reliability with most loads (save for some extra-light loads which may not have enough energy to cycle the gun, as stated in user's manual). The Stoeger model 2000 shotgun utilizes inertia-operated action with rotary bolt locking, similar to that of Benelli M1 Super 90 shotguns. When locked, bolt locks directly into the barrel extension,thus relieving the light alloy receiver from most of the stress,generated by high pressure in the chamber. Return spring is located below the barrel, around the magazine tube. It is concealed within the forend and is connected to the bolt carrier by two action bars.Standard tubular magazine holds 4 rounds, and is loaded through the aperture at the bottom of the receiver. In hunting configurations, Stoeger model 2000 shotguns are fitted with a variety of barrels with fixed or interchangeable chokes and usually with ventilated rib.Defense model is fitted with short barrel with fixed cylinder choke. As with most other self-loading shotguns, barrel on Stoeger 2000 is easily removable and can be replaced in a minute or two with alternative barrel of different profile or length. Two-piece furniture(shoulder stock and forend) is made either from wood (standard or fine grain walnut) or from polymer (black or camouflaged). Buttstock is usually factory fitted with rubber recoil pad."

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.
 
Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols.

Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed steel front sight, picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs.

The GLOCK 19 is a mid-size pistol, shooting the 9x19mm pistol cartridge (9mm Parabellum), a standard military round that's easy to find ammo for anywhere. The Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol utilizes a dual recoil spring assembly that substantially increases service life of the pistol, and helps take the snap out of recoil, reducing muzzle flip for faster follow up shots. A modular back strap allows shooters to instantly customize the grip to an individual shooter's hand size, or to cold weather gloves. Rough grip texturing on the Gen4's polymer frame provides a sure hold on the pistol when hands are wet or sweaty, and the enlarged magazine catch is reversible, accommodating left- or right-handed shooters. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of a plethora of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The dovetailed rear sight is drift adjustable and has a white outline around its notch; the fixed front blade has a white dot. Sight acquisition is quick in any light. The GLOCK 19 Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be for concealed carry or at home. The model 19 Gen4 comes with three standard 15-round magazines or three 10-round magazines that comply with various city or state restrictions on magazine capacity.  Favored for self-defense worldwide Dual recoil spring assembly Modular back strap Rough grip texturing Integral accessory rail Drift adjustable rear sight Reversible magazine catch Comes with 3 magazines"
