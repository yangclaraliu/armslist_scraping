Have 1,000 shipped to your home for $238.95 + 26.34 UPS shipping.  Roughly $266!  Check out other 9mm brands as well as other calibers at gunbot.net.  As the image shows, that's one of the vendors listed at gunbot.net under 9mm.  That's Ammunition To Go's price.  My post here is showing the web site is listing that ammo and they will ship it to your house. Don't reply to me, I don't sell ammo. I'm just helping others by showing alternatives to local high prices. 

I suggest gunbot.net or ammoseek.com to find the cheapest sellers. Sure, some local sellers run some great special sales.  If in a pinch when local are low, just pick the caliber you're shopping for first, then sort by price per round, then pick the brand you want, amount, and price. Click on the link. It will take you to that vendor's site. I posted a photo as an example. You can filter out steel case and reloads as well at gunbot.net.  By the way, some ammo sites are definitely cheaper than others on shipping costs.  It was nuts during the shortage, it seems to be getting better now.

I hope this is helpful."

Bolt action tube fed full sized 22 rifle. 

It is chambered for .22 short, long or long rifle ammo. 

Looking through the safe I've decided to part with a couple firearms that I simply don't get out enough so I thought I'd see if there is someone out there that maybe is looking for them.

These were known for their dependably & accuracy & this one has held up extremely well. 
Functions GREAT, action is smooth, the ejection strong & is as accurate as the one pulling the trigger.

The stock is 1 piece walnut with a pistol grip & a hard rubber butt plate. There are no cracks or repairs, just light handling marks. The wood has nice grain & finish; a great looking piece of furniture. 

Thanks for looking.

I don't mark them up just and negotiate down.  I just don't have a lot a extra time to do so.

Feel free to ask any questions you may have, although if the posting is still up it means no one has committed to it. 

-- Once its sold, and paid for I'll remove it right away, if its being sold & shipped or someone is on the way to pick it up, (committed to purchasing) I'll update the listing as - ""Sold Pending Funds"" in the title and body."

Looking through the safe I've decided to part with a couple firearms that I simply don't get out enough so I thought I'd see if there is someone out there that maybe is looking for them.

These were known for their dependably & accuracy & this one has held up extremely well. 
Functions GREAT, action is smooth, the ejection strong & is as accurate as the one pulling the trigger.

The stock is in GREAT condition, the wood has nice grain & finish; a great looking piece of furniture. 

Thanks for looking.

I don't mark them up just and negotiate down.  I just don't have a lot a extra time to do so.

Feel free to ask any questions you may have, although if the posting is still up it means no one has committed to it.

For trade: Taurus PT99 AFS 9mm

Hey guys and gals:

I recently lost out on a smokin deal to get a 1911 and have been kicking myself since. 

It is a stainless steel slide/nickel-plated (I believe) framed 9mm patterned after the Beretta M9 style if pistols. Does not have the tactical rails. Comes with five total magazines: 4-15 rounders and 1-30 rounder. Also comes with a Fobus holster (not pictured... nothing special). 

The good: Gun is in great shape visually, and very good shape functionally. I've personally never had any issues with it except with one finicky mag made for both Taurus and Beretta pistols.

The bad: This is the line from Taurus that uses adjustable rear sights. A common problem is that they do not hold up to the recoil of the action and eventually break. This one is no different. The securing nut for the windage screw is stripped (got it that way) and a detent for the adjustment is missing. I have gotten it to where the blade no longer moves and feels fairly stable, but have not yet gotten to range test it. Replacement rear sight assemblies are also fairly hard to find. A gunsmith actually recommended I find slide center and ""Loc-Tite the piss out of it."" Maybe some other time, lol.

The ugly: Nothing! I think it's a damn sexy gun! I WOULD keep it... but the 1911 bug is rooted in my veins! 

Looking for an entry level 1911, like an ATI, S.A.M., or RIA (to be similar in value). Really would prefer military style (plain grip safety, 5in. barrel, parkerized/blued finish, etc.). I can include 9mm ammo if needed to seal the deal, but cash reserves are too low to offer anything like that (I'd probably just buy one new from CTD otherwise).

Might (heavy emphasis on might) also possibly be intersted in a nicer semi-auto .22lr pistol to plink with and train new shooters.

If gun sits waiting on a trade, would sell for $450 (can include ammo at below retail for extra cash)
Thanks! Don't worry, I'm done now."

From Trijicon:
Keep on target using the Trijicon TA31F ACOG 4x32 Scope w/ Red Chevron BAC  Reticle with its Flat Top Adapter. This rifle scope by Trijicon features the Chevron reticle designed to be zeroed using the image tip at 100 meters and the width at the base is 5.53 MOA which is 19"" at 300 meters. This allows range estimation for silhouette targets. The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Scope w/ Dual Illuminated Red Chevron .223 Ballistic Reticle & TA51 Mount features Dual Illumination (Fiber Optic provides daylight illumination and tritium illuminates reticle at night). The ranging reticle is calibrated for 5.56mm (.223 cal) flat-top rifles out to 800 meters. Trijicon ACOG 4x32mm Riflescopes are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bind on Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. Trijicon 4x32 ACOGs combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Although Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Tactical Scopes w/ TA51 Mount have many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding. Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions - without failure-prone batteries.

Great little CCW, glovebox, or purse gun. .380 might not be the beefiest caliber, but ballistic gel testing shows that defensive rounds from these guys are way more than enough to get the job done. Full metal frame means low recoil for such a small package. Fun shooter, great for someone used to the 1911 platform and wanting something a little more concealable. If you have something of higher value I can add on a full catalog of gunsmithing services and I have other items up for trade as well"

Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides.

Fully amdixtrious controls swappable charging handle. Comes in the box with everything a Sig rifles comes with. 1400 call or text with any questions REDACTED

Introducing the SIG556xi, rewriting the standard for modularity, reliability, and performance for the modern rifle platform. 

Based on the legendary SG 550, the SIG556xi will change the way military, law enforcement, and responsible citizens look at adaptable rifles. Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. 

A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part. 

Polymer handguards accept all Magpul® light and rail kits, while the aluminum and carbon fiber handguards accept 2”, 4”, and 6” M1913 rails. Barrels are available in 10”, 14.5”, and 16”. Truly ambidextrous, the SIG556xi features an ambi safety selector, magazine release and user swappable charging handle (right- or left-handed). Optional receiver end plates allow for the use of either AR receiver extension tubes and buttstocks or M1913 compatible stocks"

Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration

FMJ or jacketed softpoints are fine. has around 50 rounds through. if i was to take a cash price in the condition its in with low round count would be $1450.

Trades just offer, worst i can say is no. with that in mind be realistic on your trade. im very easy to deal with and will respond politely.

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

657,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3258657,For Sale:  WWII 1940 Lee-Enfield Military Rifle,"Midlothian, Richmond, Virginia",$ 350,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 8, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"WWII 1940 Lee-Enfield Military Rifle,.303 caliber Enfield rifle, Mark III, Serial # 14XXX on both receiver and underside of wood. Crown over “G.R.” = George Rex (George VI, King of England during WWII), manufacture date “1940” + “Sht.L.E” = Short Lee Enfield (short magazine) + star + “III.” =  Mark III, (made 1915-1953). Manufacturer’s mark “M” = Maltby, Royal Ordinance Factory in Maltby, Yorkshire, “BSA” under stacked rifles on bolt = Birmingham Small Arms logo, a number of proof marks and inspector’s marks on metal and wood.

History: At the outbreak of WWII, BSA was the only factory producing rifles in the UK. During the Battle of Britain in 1940 the BSA factory was bombed several times by the Luftwaffe, destroying the machine shops and stopping rifle production.  The British government and BSA immediately established “shadow factories” throughout Britain to increase arms production in areas less vulnerable to German air attacks. The Royal Ordinance Factory was then established at Maltby and produced Enfield rifles. I believe this rifle was one of those produced early in the war during the Battle of Britain.

*Many of the available Enfield rifles are either non-military commercial rifles made for export, or unserviceable arms “sold out of the service” to the civilian market. All of these will have civilian or export markings, obliterated proof marks, or non-war time dates. Others were cut down, “sporterized” and converted to hunting rifles. This is an original 1940 WWII battle rifle. The rifle of course shows use, but everything functions properly. (I purchased this rifle privately as a collectible from an older gentleman I know, who told me he purchased it in the early 1970s from the WWII vet who brought it back in 1945.)

The MAS Modèle 36 was a military bolt action rifle. First adopted in 1936 by France and intended to replace the Berthier and Lebel series of service rifles, it saw service long past the World War II period. It was manufactured by Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne (MAS), one of several government-owned arms factories in France. Because production was initiated late in 1937, not enough MAS-36 rifles were available to arm French infantry when the war broke out in September 1939. Mass production finally caught up after World War II and MAS-36 rifles became widely used in service during the First Indochina War, the Algerian War and the Suez Crisis. Production ceased in 1952."

This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** Hogue® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil.
