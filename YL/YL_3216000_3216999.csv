This is a solid rifle and it is a fair price, especially considering you will not be paying taxes on it like you would if you got it at a retail store.  Please don’t send low ball offers.  I am not desperate to get rid of this gun but I do want to thin my collection a bit.  I have only put 120 rounds through it (4 full mags).  That being said it is a good rifle and it is well into its “Break-In”.

If you are interested contact me and we can make some arrangements. I am not really interested in trades at this time as I want to use the cash for another build but if you have something interesting I will listen. I will strongly consider trading for a Kriss V Special Duty pistol or SBR (not the CRB) or even a Chiappa Rhino 50DS in .357."

Description:
The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 AUTO offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands."

He was quoted as saying, ""The Winchester .405 is, for me personally, the 'medicine gun'.

The date of manufacture is 1922 and it was owned by a professional hunter named Clem Baxter who was comissioned by the South African Government to hunt rogue elephants in the early 1900's.  He later retired to Arizona.

The rifle shoots very accurately and the action is smooth.
It has all original components and has a flip style site for 100 yards and 200 yards.

Additional photos are available upon request.

I am not desperate to get rid of this gun but I do want to thin my collection a bit.  I have only put 120 rounds through it (4 full mags).  That being said it is a good rifle and it is well into its “Break-In”.

If you are interested contact me and we can make some arrangements. I am not really interested in trades at this time as I want to use the cash for another build but if you have something interesting I will listen. I will strongly consider trading for a Kriss V Special Duty pistol or SBR (not the CRB) or even a Chiappa Rhino 50DS in .357."

The weapon light is a Elzetta C Charlie 333 900 lumens light. This is the brightest light you have ever seen mounted to a weapon. Check this light out on YouTube its totally blinding at night and even disorienting during the day. Elzetta calls it the scorcher. These are expensive lights not like the Chinese crap on here. The best part of this awesome rifle is the Aimshot LS8300. Try to buy or find onr of these. This one was sent to me by a friend who is a SFO in Afghanistan. They are only sold to SOCOM and other elite SF on military POs only no longer sold to LE Agency's. You can follow the beam even before dark and after dark it looks like something from STAR WARS. Its the brightest dot and beam you have ever seen. It will definitely get you in trouble. Comes with two tail caps one pressure and one click cap and zero tool.

I am including the Leopold Deltapoint that you see mounted in the picture. This is a $400 value in and of itself. Condition of the gun is 9 out of 10 inside and 7 out of 10 outside. Has holster wear and could definitely use a fresh coating. This gun drives tacks with the red dot. I have only put 200 rounds through so I could zero in the red dot and get a feel for it. It helps a ton with speed and accuracy.

The reason I'm selling this so cheap is because I don't have any accessories with it. No mags. No box. You'll have to go spend $25 a mag if you want them. Wish I had some to give with this package but that's why I'm selling it so cheap! This is a fantastic value for a gun that runs great and includes the sight which costs what I'm asking for the whole package.

The Smith & Wesson Model 500 is a five-shot, single action/double-action large caliberrevolver produced by Smith & Wesson, firing the .500 S&W Magnum cartridge, a .50 caliber bullet.
It is built on S&W's largest frame, the X-Frame, which was developed because none of S&W's existing double-action frame designs could handle the muzzle energy and pressures generated by the .500 S&W cartridge.[2] It is the most powerful production revolver in the world today, and it is being marketed as being ""the world's most powerful handgun"" by the manufacturer.[3] There are a few other larger revolvers like for instance the Pfeifer Zeliska .600 Nitro Express revolver, however none of them are a ""production"" revolver. The Model 500 can fire a bullet weighing 350 gr ( 22.7 g; 0.8 oz) at 1975 feet per second (602 m/s) generating a muzzle energy of over 3,030 foot-pounds force (4.1 kJ).
Articles, statements, and opinions vary widely on this firearm. Any of the available bullet weights can be relied on to take game at a range in excess of 200 yards (183 m), a feat matched by only a handful of other handguns.[citation needed] The advanced design of the firearm helps in counteracting recoil felt by the shooter. This includes the sheer weight of the firearm, use of rubber grips, the forward balance, and the use of a compensator. On certain S&W Performance Center models the compensator is replaced with a full muzzle brake.
Like most big caliber handguns the Model 500 is suitable for sport and hunting applications. The high energy of these rounds make it possible to hunt extremely large African game successfully.[4

In the world of combat tested and approved firearms SIG Sauer is among the top of any short list. SIG Sauer firearms are used by law enforcement, military elite military units, and lawful citizens with concealed handgun permits. If you are not familiar with SIG Sauer the next logical question is where have you been? Since 1853 SIG Sauer has been providing shooters with firearms with the unquestionable reliability and durability they demand. After all SIG Sauer was born for defense with German precision and attention to detail.

P556 Pistol features a 10"" button rifled barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7"". The flash suppressor uses a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The optional flip up front combat sight is adjustable for windage, rear for elevation. The receiver is made of high strength steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron finish. The Picatinny rail features a SIG Sauer Mini Red Dot sight that works in concert with the optional front combat sight. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The pistol comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR magazines.

606,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3216606,"For Sale:  New: RPP Marlin Big Loop Lever for pistol grip models 308MX, 336, 338MX, 444, 1895","11115 Mills Road, Suite 122 Cypress, TX 77429, Houston, Texas",$ 139,"Listed On: Thursday, June 26, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Our Ranger Point Precision custom loop lever for Marlin pistol grip rifles fit models: 336, 308MX, 338MX, 444, 1895. Levers come with plunger assembly and are ready to be installed. Occasionally, minor fitting may be required. 

The levers are precision, CNC machined steel alloy and are KG Gun Kote mil-spec coated for superior wear and corrosion resistance in one of three colors: Stainless, Gun Metal Blue or Flat Black.

Our custom Marlin big loop lever design puts functionality first, with a strong secondary emphasis on style. We felt that current offerings placed far more emphasis on style without addressing practical concerns. To wit:

1) Current ""big loop"" offerings incorporate a loop that is very tall and and with a pronounced curvature. So despite an overabundance of vertical clearance, gloved fingers feel bunched and removed from the grip. Our lever follows the grip curve and adds room fore and aft.

2) The overly tall design of current levers has two effects that we don't care for: a) it creates an odd lag time when opening the action, while the hand leaves the grip and the fingers travel downward before smacking abruptly into the lower rung of the loop; and b) the loop adds significantly to the height dimension of the rifle and becomes the lowest point. Finish scratches are inevitable, and handiness is sacrificed to style.

3) Our design introduces additional space into the trigger guard area, where others do not. Gloved fingers are a pretty tight fit in factory trigger guards. That should make anyone nervous when the hammer is back. We also decreased the dimension separating loop and guard, allowing the fingers to sit naturally, close together.

4) Aesthetically, we designed our lever to blend more naturally with the lines of the stock, complementing rather than contrasting the attractive curve of the pistol grip. Our design may not pop out as much other big loops, but we feel that it presents pleasing, natural lines that look right and feel great.

Spring steel by a NW Ark maker,"West Fork, AR, Fayetteville, Arkansas",$ 200,"Listed On: Saturday, July 5, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Thank you to all who contacted me! Ck our website at mineralmountain.com for great northwest arkansas handmade knives and axes

This is about as different as any knife I have listed in a good while. Walked into my office a few days ago and I traded for it. It was made by a local NW Arkansas knifemaker who styled himself ""lyzrd"" and that is the way he marked some of his blades. Others were marked MSI like this one. He made maybe 50 or so back in the late 80's to mid 90's. All were made from high carbon spring type steel and were excellent users. I cant tell you when this one was made; but, it is in fine unused condition, ready to go into combat.

I guess I would call this a Japanese style blade due to the armor piercing type point. Nice balance and feels like it would do a fine job on wood or bone. Crafted from high-carbon steel and torch hardened with an oil quench. The sword is 29 1/2 inches long with a 19 inch blade. It is 2 inches at it's widest, 1 1/2 inches at the choil, and 1/4 inch thick. 2 1/2 inch long by 1 inch wide double steel guard pined to the blade. 

Handle material looks to be black micarta slabs pinned to the tang and covered with a dark green paracord wrap. Interesting tie job. Blade cover is black kydex with brass grommets and no belt loop. It is very minimal with no closure down the spine so if you are planning to carry and use the sword you probably should think about having another sheath made or be ready to create a tie for your gear. Not that hard to do.

It has the feel of the G.I. pistols of World War One and World War Two, but with a magazine capacity of 13 rounds for the kind of firepower many GI's wished they'd had.

It's a full size 1911, but with a slightly wider frame to accomodate a double-stack 13 round magazine. The frame and slide are forged steel, with a parkerized finish that's tougher than anodized. The 5"" steel barrel is oxidized as well.

Unlike other G.I. models, the Hi-Cap has black polymer grips instead of wood. It has the same spur hammer, as well as the flat style grip safety.

The solid trigger is 100% GI-style, with a pull weight of 5-6 pounds. The magazine has a plastic extension to aid in reloading.

With all of these features, and a lifetime warranty, this is the pistol for anyone who wants extra firepower combined with a period look.

This particular air gun functioned perfectly but as the hobbyists started fiddling it was found that touching up the crown could increase accuracy.  It did.  It has also had the barrel bent a bit to ease the zero on the scope.  Out of the box it was firing just a bit high for the scope to sit comfortably in the middle of its adjustment so it was bent slightly down.  No other imperfections are on this rifle besides maybe a scuff or scratch on the stock.  Everything is in perfect working condition and has been treated like my favorite toy.  I am selling because I have since replaced it with a much more expensive gun.  
The Trail NP All Weather air rifle, from Crosman's Benjamin brand of guns, features a durable, all weather wood stock and rugged break barrel design. The 0.22 caliber weapon provides 16% more downrange power than common 0.177 calibers, and an impressive 23-foot-pounds of muzzle energy fires at velocity speeds of up to 950-feet-per-second (FPS).

Note:It is common-practice to shim a scope for sighting-in.
Break-barrel pellet rifles such as this one, require a different holding practice vs a traditional pneumatic pellet rifle.  The gun should be held using the “Artillery Hold,” which is basically just letting the fore arm of the rifle rest on an open palm vs holding the gun tightly"".

About Crosman
In 1923 in Rochester, New York, Crosman was founded as Crosman Arms Company. From its inception, Crosman's principal products were airguns and airgun ammunition. During the 1950s, new accounts included Sears Roebuck & Co., Montgomery Ward, and Western Auto, all of which sold Crosman's products under their respective brand names.

In 1966, Crosman introduced its own Crosman brand airgun, the Crosman Pumpmaster 760, which has sold more than 11 million units to date. Crosman Corporation is now an international designer, manufacturer, and marketer of Crosman pellet, BB, airsoft rifles and pistols, Copperhead ammunition, and Benjamin pellet rifles and ammunition.

Exchanged a few text yesterday Wednesday 06/25/2014 and made arrangements to meet at Pasadena Turners today Thursday 06/26/2014 at 11:00am. I waited at Turner's for 30 minutes and kept texting and calling the buyer with no response. I eventually left Turners and returned back to work. At 12:15PM the seller calls me ""...ey bro...I just woke up...let me change and check with work...I'll let you know when I'm 15 minutes away from Turners"" I told him I am no longer interested in purchasing a gun from such irresponsible person and hung up.

I understand traffic and other occurrences that are out of our control but not even a courtesy ""SORRY"" when you woke up at noon on a weekday, knowing that you had an appointment an hour earlier is unacceptable.  

I don't even want to know how much the gun has been abused or even if it's ever been cleaned. Buy or contact this seller at your own risk!!! He sounds in his 20's, most likely Armenian or some other middle eastern descent with a thick accent, lives in Hollywood and this is his number: three-two-three 204-64 three eight

But IT IS made out of heavy duty steel and very secure. Expanded metal (see through) or 16 gauge steel.   I designed it to be mounted to the concrete floor. A regular lock fits through the clasp and a cover protects the lock from bolt cutters.  I know it works great because someone actually broke into my house and did not get my AR because it is solidly attached to the concrete foundation.
