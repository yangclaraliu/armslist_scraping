So this beautiful GEN 3 Glock 26 has Trijicon HD night sights, in my opinion BEST iron sights on the market! Great sights, I could not say one bad thing about them. Next I have a STAINLESS STEEL GUIDE ROD, which helps reduce recoil. It is 3x the weight of the cheap factory plastic GUIDE ROD. Great addition! Lastly I added the GHOST EXTENDED MAG RELEASE & EXTENDED SLIDE RELEASE. Both add a day and night difference to releasing a MAG & releasing the slide. I HAVE ALL THE STOCK PARTS AS WELL THAT I WILL GIVE YOU. I want to stress that this is a brand new gun that has never been used!! You will be paying the same price as a normal Glock 26 with a value of $770 with the gun and all the extra parts!! This my loss your gain!! Deals like this are hard to find!! I will only sell to a buyer near by, or if your willing to come to my general area of SACRAMENTO so we can do the transfer at a local shop!! My name is Taylor, I can be reached by phone or txt at REDACTED. THANK YOU!!"

The trigger breaks very cleanly at about 2.5lbs with no pre travel or over travel. This is a very nice shooting and accurate target pistol.

It fires and cycles without issue (I've fire both Holllow Points and Ball Ammo... all brands cycled fine). 
Significant cosmetic dings and scratches.Slide stop will engage with an empty magazine, but does not engage after final round fired and will not hold the slide back without the magazine in place (My guess is the previous owner used the slide stop as a a slide release and wore it down).  Replacement slide stop can be had for between $25 and $35 if you shop around online. It is a simple swap (push out the old one using a punch as a slave pin and push the new one in, pushing the slave pin back out).  The price reflects the cosmetics and the worn out slide stop.

Let me know what you have to trade I love revolver colt troopers mk4, smiths, dan wessons, but will read any trade. Thanks it's the high gloss stainless model as well not the more matte looking stainless which made it a little more expensive. I'm a fan of the pretty high gloss."

The subcompact Glock 29 Gen4 offers superior versatility with the high performance 10mm round and a 10-round magazine capacity. With reduced dimensions compared to the standard size Glock 20, the subcompact Glock 29 is also suitable for concealed carry. The Gen4 offers a more aggressive grip pattern to allow a more secure purchase on the pistol, even with gloved hands, and the modular backstrap design lets the user adapt the grip to hand size. This model features a dual-recoil spring assembly which noticeably reduces felt recoil while simultaneously increasing the life span of the assembly. The enlarged reversible magazine catch easily accommodates left- or right-handed operators. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment."
