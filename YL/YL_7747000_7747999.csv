This little guy is awesome, and a blast to shoot!  (Especially if you have an AAC Prodigy or similar sound suppressor and sub-sonic rounds--you don't need any hearing protection and can shoot anywhere!)  I built this gun a few years ago, but have not shot it in ages since I was living in a different country where I couldn't keep it with me.  Now that we've got a kid on the way, I'm clearing out my collection to build up the baby fund.  Thanks for looking."

We tend our feeders and keep salt and minerals out year round and have strategically situated stands and ground blinds to offer shots from distances of in-your-face out to 230 yards and beyond.We are situated in the Special Southwest Zone where unlike other elk zones in Oklahoma, there are no elk quotas. This means that you do not have to go online every morning and check if the quotas have been filled to determine if the season has been closed early. The 2017 hunting season in the Special Southwest Zone has produced more than twice the number of elk than in all other six zones combined!We have only one 3 day antlerless hunt remaining to be filled in January. Cost is $1500. Don't miss your last chance of this season to put some excellent table fare in your freezer. I'm expecting this last hunt to sell quickly so please contact me soon to choose from available dates.Half of the cost of the hunt is required to hold your spot. All game laws will be followed and a contract will be signed and notarized before your hunt begins.Consider booking your Fall 2018 hunts now!"

Trijicon Night Sights are the reliable choice for all light conditions, providing superior illumination and impressive accuracy. Trijicon Bright & Tough Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, Trijicon has designed these tritium night sights to accomplish this with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Three tritium-filled phosphor lamps provide the illumination for the Trijicon Smith & Wesson Rear Night Sight. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Trijicon S&W M&P Night Sights feature a unique shock- resistant design that is patented by Trijicon.The Apex Polymer Forward Set Sear and Trigger Kit features a solid polymer trigger body, with center pivoting safety. This kit will set the trigger break point farther forward than the factory trigger assembly as well as, significantly reduce the uptake and over travel. It produces a trigger pull very similar to that of a 1911 but in a polymer frame striker-fired pistol. The Polymer Forward Set Sear & Trigger Kit boasts a smooth trigger pull throughout the break. The rounded trigger face provides the user with a comfortable surface for the firing finger. The kit comes with two (2) trigger return springs; one designed to produce approximately a 4.0 lbs trigger pull (silver spring), and one to produce a 5.0 lbs trigger pull (green spring). These two options give the end user the ability to customize their trigger pull for their specific needs."

Price is $1750.  Additional Info: The Manticore Arms buttpad is curved however the top is the same length as the factory replaced buttpad. So theres no actual lose in length replacing the buttpads, just shape. The barrel was removed from the Tavor, all barrel components were pressed off the barrel. Then the barrel was lathe turned and threaded 1/2x28. The flash hider and barrel were drilled separately to assure proper hole depth in barrel. The flash hider was installed on the barrel, a hardened pin was inserted in the hole to permanently attach the barrel. Finally the pin was tack welded in place."
