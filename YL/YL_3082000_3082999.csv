Do you want to shoot in a more dynamic setting? 

The Intermediate Pistol Course is all about getting comfortable with your firearm.  This course will drive the core marksmanship fundamentals required to master the manipulation of your firearm.  This course will take you out of the comfortable static shooting most people do at the local range.  Emphasis is taken on instilling safety and proficiency with your firearm.
This course will prepare you to properly, safely and effectively unholster your firearm and present it to a threat if such need should arise.  The dynamics of shooting at closer distances will be explained and the hands-on drills will drive home the importance of the core fundamentals.
This course is 25% classroom and 75% hands-on and will have you firing your handgun for approximately 6 hours.  Manipulating your firearm under new pressures and timed constraints will prepare you for the unexpected.  This course will not only teach you the skills, but will also give you the confidence you need to feel comfortable handling your firearm in worst case scenarios.  This course is 1 day of hands-on lecture and hands-on drills.

Converted Russian Molot 7.62x39 Vepr Rifle

This rifle is the civilian version of the RPK light machine gun. It was made at the same factory as the RPK. It looks and functions like your standard AK47, but it has a thicker receiver and a chrome lined barrel, which let's you fire rapidly for longer. The barrel is 16.5 inches and includes a slant muzzle brake.

I converted it to accept standard AK47 magazines and drums. I also changed out the stock and hand guard. The stock is collapsible.  The original stock and hand guard are included. I am also including the scope mount. The scope is not included, I just stuck it on there to show what it looks like with a scope. Four 30 round mags and one 20 round mag are include. The forward grip is also included.

I am asking for $1200 obo.

Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety. Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft-grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip RXâ¢ and Ultragrip DXâ¢ represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes.

The wait list to buy one of his barrels is something like two years long. This barrel is threaded 5/8x24 and is 0.75"" thick at the gas port. The barrel is built on a Stag Arms blank. High-quality craftsmanship and precision is evident by looking at the threading, crown, gas port, etc. The feed ramps have been polished.

I purchased this barrel new in November 2013, used it to build a pistol upper, let the upper sit in my safe for 6 months, and then I disassembled the upper and decided to go with a different length. This barrel is brand new, unfired and hasn't had so much as a round put into the chamber. There is some minor wear on the exterior finish from assembly and disassembly, but nothing major and nothing that won't be covered up by the handguard. $200, cash only, no trades. Price is FIRM. Buyer must pick up in downtown Dallas or in NE Dallas near the Arboretum. Thanks for looking."

Similar to the Magpul CTRÂ®, the ACS also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy*. Dual, rear accessible, water-resistant battery storage tubes and an integral storage compartment in the butt of the stock provides multiple storage options. The ACS comes standard with a 0.30"" thick rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

This is a limited edition Glock 19 with the EXO finish by FailZero. This unique, breakthrough technology creates a permanently lubricious surface, harder than the substrate itself, which eliminates the need for grease, oil, or any wet lubrication for the life of the weapon. Unlike films, conventional coatings and applied lubricants, it will never rub off, never flake off, never build up crud. EXO Technology eliminates wet-lubrication failures of critical components, giving you an ""active weapon advantage"" under all conditions. (http://www.taloinc.com/glock.htm).

Comes with box, Talo Exo papers, and 2 15 round magazines.

This is the gun of guns. If you want a piece of American history here it is. Most folks know this gun after Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry made it famous. Now this one is one of the 8-3/8"" variety rather than the 6-1/2"" but for all practical purposes I think the 8-3/8"" is a better choice. With the longer barrel you get a better sight radius, better velocity, and will extend your hunting range if that's your game. The 8"" guns seem to tame the recoil a little better as well over the shorter tubes. The 29-5 was the first model that came with the endurance package standard so this one is here to last. These guns are only going up in value but unfortunately I need some extra cash at the moment so she needs a new home."

Has small discrete import mark under the muzzle that you really have to look for to find. It also has a hairline crack in the handgaurd but it is still very solid. This is apparently pretty common thanks to the brass posts that fit the handgaurd to the stock.  I don't know too much about the gun or their history as I'm more of a bolt action guy, but I've fired a few rounds through it and boy will it put a smile on your face. Shot a couple inches high at 50yds but centered.  As I said, I'm more of a bolt action guy so I'm looking to free up some cash for a nice military Ross rifle, and unless you have one you'd like to trade, I'd prefer a cash deal. Thanks for looking and feel free to email me if you have any questions."

CM Russell Tribute Rifle

THIS ISSUE IS CLOSED

Honoring Americaâs âCowboy Artistâ

Through his unforgettable paintings and sculptures, Charles M. Russell brought to life the beauty and drama of the American West as only an ex-wrangler like himself could.



Left side of receiver features one of Russellâs classic paintings, âBuffalo Hunt,â as a pair of Indian hunters on horseback take aim at a buffalo.



Right side of receiver features a scene from Russellâs painting, âThe Jerkline.â   A drover snaps his bullwhip, guiding a team of horses as they pull a heavy wagon uphill.  To the right is the self-portrait âCharles Russell on Neenah,â showing the artist enjoying the Western scenery as he rides one of his favorite horses.



Each rifle is handsomely decorated in 24-karat gold artwork against a special blackened background for maximum contrast. Barrel bands, lever, trigger, hammer, and hooded site are decorated in 24-karat gold.



The stocks are laser-carved on both sides. The shoulder stock features Russellâs signature and his buffalo skull logo, along with a quiver of arrows and an inverted tomahawk. Inscribed is Russellâs quote to a friend, âThe West is deadâ¦you may lose a sweetheart but you wonât forget her.â  The left side also features Russellâs âRed Man of the Plains,â while the right side features âBuffalo in Winter,â surrounded by scrollwork.   The forearm features Russellâs initials and the dates of his life."

Restrictions apply on ammunition shipments to non dealer civilians, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy.308 ammunition, or most any center fire ammunition from commercial US manufacturers runs well over a Dollar a Cartridge. Even practice ammunition, mil-spec loads made by Federal, Winchester, and Remington all approach that dollar mark. This listing is for One Case, 20 Boxes, or 1000 rounds of excellent quality practice ammunition for only 25 cents a round; and buyers may take any number of extra full cases we have on hand at the same per-box price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is German manufactured practice ammunition that the German Army and Security Agencies use in their G3 Rifles, that we know and love as the HK91. Manufacturer is Deutsche Angestellten Gewerkschaft, DAG, with facilities in several cities in Germany. Construction is one piece molded thick polymer case with a bullet that detaches during firing. Firing is achieved by the steel case head and berdan priming system. Since its case head measures .445 diameter, compared to the normal .469 for .308 ammo, extraction may be an issue in some rifles. The Germans have a roller-less bolt assembly adapter for their G-3 rifles. It does not produce enough pressure to cycle the action on most The payload is the 10 grain range blue polymer bullet, and this ammunition performs similarly to the originals at short ranges. It is potentially lethal out to 300 meters. This ammunition is Not corrosive at all, and any polymer fouling is much, much easier to remove from a bore than copper fouling, any day. Most important, recoil is negligible. It comes 50 cartridges per box. Weâre offering it by whole cases, 20 Boxes, 1000 rounds, each only $ 199.00.

RIFLE & BIPOD are NOT included. Restrictions apply on direct ammunition shipments to non-dealer civilians, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for 2,000 rounds of ammunition, 3 metal HK91 / PTR91 / Cetme 20 shot magazines, and one conversion kit to fit any HK91 type rifle. .308 ammunition, or most any center fire ammunition from commercial US manufacturers runs well over a Dollar a Cartridge. Even practice ammunition, mil-spec loads made by Federal, Winchester, and Remington all approach that dollar mark. This listing is for 2 Cases, 100 Boxes, of German manufactured practice .308 Winchester caliber ammunition along with the apparatus that makes the rifle cycle with it, a factory Heckler & Koch Lightweight Bolt and Gas Tube Assembly. This package also includes a total of 3 Twenty Shot HK91 Factory Magazines in Very Good Condition. HK91 Rifles, and their corresponding top quality US Made PTR-91 rifles work well with this assembly. Egyptian made CETME rifles work as well with this as they do with any ammunition, possibly even better. This setup is what the German Army and Security Agencies use in their G3 Rifles, that we know and love as the HK91. Ammunition Manufacturer is Deutsche Angestellten Gewerkschaft, DAG, in Germany. Cartridge construction is one piece molded thick polymer case with a 10 grain polymer bullet that detaches during firing. Firing system is Berdan priming in a steel case head. This ammunition is tailor made for the HK 91, since its case head measures .445 diameter, compared to the normal .469 for .308 ammo. The replacement lightweight bolt and gas tube utilize the polymer cased ammoâs lower pressure to cycle the action. The payload is the 10 grain range blue polymer bullet, and this ammunition performs similarly to the originals at short ranges. Test reports show 5 MOA accuracy at 100 meters. This ammunition is potentially lethal out to 300 meters, and it even has tactical applications from its highly reduced ricochet factor. This ammunition is Not corrosive at all, and any polymer fouling is much, much easier to remove from a bore than copper fouling, any day. Most important, recoil is negligible, and the lightweight bolt is easy to install and remove. Normal replacement pricing on a genuine HK Bolt assembly like this with 100 boxes of military practice ammunition will be upwards of $2500.00. For mathematical convenience, the ammunition is 20 round box equivalent pricing of $2.90 for 20 rounds; $17 apiece for the magazines, and $58 for the conversion kit. Weâre offering this entire setup, however, for only $ 399.00. for civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 20 shot magazines are restricted to law enforcement, $15 off but no magazines. Includes California, Chicago Cook County IL, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey.

Restrictions apply on ammunition shipments to non dealer civilians, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for TEN Boxes, a full factory case, Total of 500 cartridges or rounds. Buyers may take any number of extra 10 box cases we have on hand at the same per-case price and with no additional shipping charges. Ulyanovsk Machinery Plant began ammunition production in 1917, and the firm served as a principal supplier to the Soviet Military for many years. After the dissolution of the USSR, Ulyanovsk began selling on the US Commercial Market in the late 1990s under their own name. More recently, their product has come packaged as simply, Brown Bear ammunition. Here is Brown Bearâs Military Load, number A919RFMJ. Caliber is 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Construction is laquer coated steel case, not reloadable and with Berdan type priming system. Bullets are lead core bi-metal jacket, 115 grains. Out of a 5 inch Beretta 92, factory specs show a pretty warm 1235 feet per second muzzle velocity, with 390 foot pound vicinity muzzle energy. Garbage mouthed pistols like the CZ75 series, 92 Beretta, Ruger P series, Kel-Tecs, Smith & Wesson 39 59, and Tokarev type pistols like our Zastavas, all like this stuff. So do the well made 1911 Armscors. Glock and Sig, we are told, do not recommend steel case ammunition.
