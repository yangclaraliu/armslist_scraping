Fit with the factory’s folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor.Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics.

They were also the sidearm of the Spanish Army and Navy until the 1960's. It is chambered for 9mm Largo and 38 ACP. For loading 38 acp you can use the same case as the 38 Super but you cannot load it to 38 super specs as it would hurt this gun. 9mm Largo brass is available from Star brass. Several companies are offering loaded 9mm Largo. I shoot mostly 38super brass loaded to 38 ACP standard loads. IT is an awesome collector and fun shooting gun. I am selling this one because I have four others so that is how much I enjoy shooting them. They are so much fun to shoot and very accurate. AWESOME GUN!!!This Gun comes with two magazines. Astra 400 magazine on ebay avearge around $43.00 dollars. Will shoot 9mm Largo which is 9x23 and 38 Super loaded 38 acp loading. Will not shoot full heavy loaded 38 Super. Price is FIRM! Please do not make offers you know I will reject. Remember it does not eat and does not have to be sold. I love to shoot it. Also you will have to meet me at exit 109 Old Peachtree Road on I-85 North in Lawrenceville. Look on Gun Web Sites you will see selling in $400 to $600.

The innovatively designed LCR (Lightweight Compact Revolver) has a monolithic frame of aerospace-grade, 7000 series aluminum; a streamlined fluted stainless steel cylinder; and a stainless steel barrel insert, threaded into the aluminum frame. The frame is finished in non-reflective matte black, optimum for self-defense weapons. To keep overall weight to a minimum, the LCR uses a polymer grip frame that houses all the fire control components. The LCR has a concealed hammer that prevents the gun from snagging while being drawn rapidly from a holster, pocket, or purse, allowing the firearm to function when an emergency situation calls for it to be purposely fired from inside a pocket or purse. The double-action trigger pull on the LCR is as smooth as silk, which is due to Ruger's refined trigger geometry and spring rates."

Specifics: The Ruger® LCR® Double-Action Revolver makes a lightweight, fast handling concealed carry gun that is quick to get on target. The innovatively designed LCR (Lightweight Compact Revolver) has a monolithic frame of aerospace-grade, 7000 series aluminum; a streamlined fluted stainless steel cylinder; and a stainless steel barrel insert, threaded into the aluminum frame. The frame is finished in non-reflective matte black, optimum for self-defense weapons. To keep overall weight to a minimum, the LCR uses a polymer grip frame that houses all the fire control components. The LCR has a concealed hammer that prevents the gun from snagging while being drawn rapidly from a holster, pocket, or purse, allowing the firearm to function when an emergency situation calls for it to be purposely fired from inside a pocket or purse. The double-action trigger pull on the LCR is as smooth as silk, which is due to Ruger's refined trigger geometry and spring rates."

776,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7759776,For Sale:  Chinese Norinco SKS-M (Takes Regular AK Mags from the Factory),"Dade City, Florida, United States",$ 575,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 10, 2018",Rifles,no type,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"PLEASE READ THE WHOLE AD BEFORE CONTACTING ME. IT WILL SAVE US BOTH A LOT OF TIME. THANK YOU!I’m offering up my unmolested Chinese SKS-M with original wood and all matching and original parts. The only exception is the scope mount/dust cover combo that mounts the scope to the rifle and the muzzle brake. I do not have the original dust cover but they are available and cheap and are not a serial numbered item. The brake is only pinned on so can be removed if you like. This SKS-M comes with the original 30 round Chinese flatback mag and the attached Leapers scope and mount. This rifle is in excellent shape, as are all my guns. I’m meticulous about care and cleaning of all my guns and this one will not disappoint. Bore is shiny and bluing is nice, especially for a military rifle of this age. They only made two types of SKS’s that take regular AK mags, the SKS-D and the SKS-M. This is the M model that has the shorter carbine length barrel. Some people call this version of the SKS “The Poor Man’s AK” because of the factory acceptance of normal AK mags. It would be at home as a hunting gun with a 5 round mag or a Zombie Killer with a 20,30,40,75,or 100 round mag. These seem to be more accurate than a AK so having a scope on it is really a good idea.  I can send additional pictures to SERIOUS buyers or we can just meet so you can see it in real life. These are no longer imported. In fact no Chinese guns are imported which makes them go up in value year to year. The regular SKS’s that sell for $400 now used to sell for $69 before the ban if that tells you anything. I have more than one Chinese firearm for this reason, an the fact that they are superior to most other SKS’s and AK’s. Since I own Chinese AK’s I have Golden Tiger 7.62x39 ammo and various extra AK mags that’s I can sell if the buyer so chooses. I am only interested in a local sale. If it doesn’t sell I will put it in Gunbroker where it is sure to sell. I’m listing here first so I don’t have the hassle of shipping it.The only trade I’m currently in the market for is a Mossberg SPX Tactical Shotgun. Might be interested in other trades, doubtful, but doesn’t hurt to ask. Prepare to meet at a gun shop, police station, or populated area with cameras and prepare to fill out a bill of sale. I respect your privacy but I will be covering my butt while doing so. If that’s a problem, I understand, but there is a reason behind the madness, and it’s not to tell Big Brother what you’re buying, you can be sure of that. I’m very easy to get along with but I don’t have the time or patience for people who are backyard gun dealers or people hoping I’m the idiot that doesn’t know what my gun is worth. My time is valuable so only serious inquiries and serious offers will get a reply. Be patient for a reply as I generally don’t have my phone duct tapped to my head. I generally check my emails and messages several times a day and I will reply ASAP, just let me know how late in the evening I can contact you or I will not contact you after 9pm. If your a looking for a gun just to flip it then I know you will want to pay far less than it’s worth so you can sell it for what it’s worth, so just keep walking. All Federal and State gun laws apply, so If you are not a Florida resident, have a felony record, or cannot for any reason buy a gun at your local gun store then don’t think you’ll buy one from me either. Thanks for looking,Jim"
