12,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7607012,For Sale:  EOTech 518.A65 HOLOgraphic Sight,"West Little Rock, Arkansas, United States",$ 250,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 21, 2017",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This site was purchased by new new from a local gun shop.I used it at the range a a total of three times.It has always been stored in the case.As close to new as you can get in perfect working order.Price is firm.Stuff from the vendor:The EOTech 512.A65/1 holographic sight is as close to military-grade optics on a rifle sight as one can get. It’s a versatile gun sight that helps you maximize your peripheral vision and increase your depth perception when shooting. Used for hunting or close contact combat, this sight is reminiscent of the sights used for first-person shooter games. It works with the one-inch Weaver dovetail mount. The EOTech tactical offers great engagement with the target and decreases the time it takes for target acquisition so that you begin shooting faster and improving your chances of hitting your target. This is a robust sight, and it absorbs shock and vibrations well so that you don’t get full kickback. The EOTech 512.A65/1 model is 5.6 x 2 x 2.5 inches with a weight of 11.5 ounces, making this a lightweight yet durable holographic red dot sight. It boasts a 65 MOA circle dot and a .5 adjustment at a range of 100 yards. It also has a 30-yard field of view to ensure you hone in on distant targets. The transmission holography is 100 percent parallax free, meaning you don’t shoot out of alignment with your target should you slightly change the angle through which you look through the sight. The holographic reticle is fog-proof and has an anti-glare coating to prevent vision disturbances while aiming. Anti-scratch and shatterproof laminate of the reticle window make this a durable, rugged tactical sight. Hunting in the rain isn’t an issue because the EOTech holographic sight is submersible up to ten feet, allowing you to hunt in shallow waters or practice underwater shooting without damage to the weapon sight. The EOTech 512 provides plenty of eye relief as you choose between shooting with one eye closed or both eyes open. Keeping both eyes open gives you greater peripheral vision and depth perception, so the unlimited eye relief is a great benefit of this scope. The sight operates on two 1.5V AA batteries. It supports lithium, alkaline, and rechargeable batteries for plenty of power options. You get 1,000 hours of continued use with lithium batteries and 600 hours of continued use with alkaline batteries. Save battery life by taking advantage of the auto shutdown mode. This mode automatically shuts down the holographic site after eight hours, but you can manually program the red dot sight to shut down after four hours. The auto battery check causes the reticle to flash when there is only 20 percent battery life left, ensuring you always have time to replace your batteries. Because this is a holographic model, it does not have extensive magnification optics. You can magnify targets up to one time, but the reticle gives you precise aim even without an extensive magnifier. The complex reticle accepts the laser and reflects it in a way that gives you optimal aim without needing to zoom in too much. Combine that with the 65 MOA and you have a versatile, speedy sight that improves your shooting performance even without night vision compatibility.Product IdentifiersBrandEotechModel512.A65/1MPN512.A65/1UPC672294512653Key FeaturesTypeHolographicField of View at 100 Yard 90 ftField of View at 100 Meter 28 mTechnical FeaturesEye Relief 999 in.Reticle Pattern Circle, DotDot Size65 MOA, 1 MOAReticle ColorRedFinish Black"

I'd like to have something semi auto possibly or if you have a 22mag and money that would be preferred as well as a 22-250... But willing to trade for other guns 243,270,30/07,7mm,300 etc... My possible lose is your gain since I've basically tagged out. It's a good gun and perfect for a gift to you from you. I'm open to negotiate.. looking to sell with the first good offer or trade or whatever... I also have 2 brand new Lock on stands in the box ready to be put on a tree. No it's not Walmart. They are 2 different sizes with camo cushions: prefer to sell or trade both for good climber. Technically I have 3 and could part with it as well as climbing sticks that I also have the box too.. So guns,stands etc. Trade both for range finder or??? Both toward a gun and boot. Taking offers on the 2 stands. And could make it 3 new stands and new sticks . Just tell me what you have?...Price is valued at 300 for trade 275 cash. Negotiable 865:318:4420"

I bought this gun from the original owner here on arms list about two years ago. He had this SP-01 and a Compact and he decided he liked his compact better so he sold me this one. Since then, It has been one of my competiton guns and has served me well. I have recently upgraded to a Shadow 2 so this one is really just sitting in the safe. It comes with 3 sets of sights; the stock ones, an adjustable set with fiber(i cant remember but I think these are made by dawson), and a  dawson fixed set with fiber. The front sight that is currently on the gun is cracked but I will replace it for the new buyer if they wish. The guns internals have been polished to improve the trigger as well as a cajun gun works kit installed. It has competition hammer spring installed in it at the moment with the CGW firing pin and firing pin spring and lighter trigger return spring. It has a very light double action trigger pull like you would expect out of a competiton gun. I reload my own ammunition and it runs federal primers 100% but some of the harder primers like CCI it does not like. If you would like to shoot factory ammo out of this gun you will probably need to put one of the other hammer springs included back in the gun. I can install this for you if you would like. This gun comes with all the factory parts, springs, some spare springs, original case, and owners manual. It comes with 2 factory CZ magazines and a blade tech holster with the teklok adapter on it. The gun and holster are IDPA and USPSA legal just in case you were planning on buying it to get into competition. I have done some custom polishing of the sides of the gun as well as the hammer and trigger. They did not make one like this from the factory as far as I know. There is grip tape on the front and back of the grip, it comes off easily if you would like to take it off. If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them for you. I would prefer to sell the gun outright but there are a few guns that I would be willing to trade for. If I do a trade keep in mind, I am not going to pay new prices for a used gun. GUNS I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TRADING FOR: M&P 2.0 COMPACT, S&W 586 L-COMP revolver, Evil Roy .38 single action revolver, Sig  P238, Draco AK style pistol.I DO NOT WANT ANY AR-15s or anything With a ""SIG BRACE"""

A long list of technical features that have never been incorporated into semi-automatic shotguns combined with durability and reliability has made the XLR5 a favorite with target shooters. The engineers at FABARM are now applying the same philosophy to making a specialized waterfowl model. At the heart of the high performance XLR5 platform is the revolutionary Pulse Piston™ system that acts as a progressive brake thereby eliminating any valve system and allows for the function of varying types of ammo. This equates to a system that is simpler, contains less parts, is easy to clean and inevitably more reliable. Additionally, the braking of the pulse system progressively slows the action with heavy loads reducing felt recoil. Most significantly the reduction in recoil and enhanced reliability is achieved in what is the fastest cycling Semi-auto hunting gun on the planet at .31 of a second for five rounds. To maximize down range performance we have incorporated FABARM’s proven TRIBORE HP™ barrel design into the XLR5. This tapered bore allows for reduced recoil and improved pattern performance. We have even created a special competition choke tube, the EXIS DK, tuned for non-toxic ammo in the most popular pellet sizes. This choke in combination with the TRIBORE™ barrels allow the XLR5 to do what no other hunting shotgun can, use up to extra full choke without any negative effect on the firearm. As an assurance of strength and durability every FABARM XLR5 is tested by the Italian National Proof House to the highest possible rating of 1630 BAR. If pure performance is the heart of the XLR5, the extensive list of user friendly features are the brains. The oversized trigger guard, safety, magazine cut off and extended bolt handle are purposely designed to allow for full control of the firearm with even the bulkiest winter gloves. The competition bred LR (Long Rib) concept has a top rib that increases the sighting plain by 4 1/2” and allows the shooter to see down the rib with a more comfortable head-up posture. To reduce glare we have masked off the top surface of the rib to provide a camo free matte black finish and added a high visibility fiber optic front sight. Water and mud can destroy a shotgun quickly. To reduce the possibility of rust and corrosion the barrel extension and bores are chrome plated. We have also PVD coated the bolt, nickel plated the chokes and covered the external metal surfaces with camo for added protection. The synthetic stock is also coated with a Soft Touch camo process to create a rubberized feel.

The ST 12"" Side Loading Flare Launcher features the latest in design and manufacturing technology. Parts are CAD designed and CNC machined from solid billet material rather than the typical stamped and welded construction of other launchers. The 6061 and 7075 aircraft grade aluminum components are anodized in Type III Hardcoat black for maximum durability and ease of maintenance.
Additional components are built from 1018 cold rolled steel and plated with a Mil-spec black oxide finish. The proprietary STZ push button cylindrical breech lock design is 3 times stronger than existing lever lock systems. The Havoc is designed to mount on any Mil-Spec rail system. Installation simply requires sliding the launcher onto the bottom rail of the hand guard and tightening two set screws which are included."

A possible veteran of the Second World War, the rifle may have remained in service through the Korean Conflict before being sold to Malaysia where it served with the Malaysian Police prior to being released as surplus at the end of the 20th Century. A favorite of collectors, the Jungle Carbine was designed for the Airborne and saw limited production during the war, with the only known wartime usage occuring during Operations Market-Garden and Varsity, as well as limited service in the Pacific Theatre during 1945. An excellent weapon, the Jungle Carbine was tagged as the replacement for the standard, 25""-barreled No.4 rifle, before complaints surrounding a wandering zero spelled the end of production in 1947. Despite the criticism leveled at the rifle's accuracy(as well as its legendary recoil), the No.5 Jungle Carbine was well-loved by the troops that carried it and the weapon remained in limited service with British and Commonwealth forces until the 1970's. One of the very first of this model manufactured, this early, 1944-dated No.5 would be a superb addition to the advanced or dedicated Enfield collection.Condition:Very good with the carbine having no sign of refinish or refurbishment. Stoving has dulled with flaking and oxidation spotting, and overall coverage is around 70%. There is no rust or pitting on any metal surface. Markings are well-struck, nicely preserved, and correct, with import mark present on the barrel, FMP(Malaysian Police) mark on the buttsocket strap, and matching numbers found on the receiver, bolt, furniture and barrel-the magazine being a correct replacement from a post-war No.5. Walntut stock shows heavy wear with the cartouches on the pistol grip faded, as well as a coat of lacquer applied for jungle/humid climate service. Rating as very good, there are no cracks or chips, the buttplate is pliable and in good repair, and the forend is numbered matching to the rifle. Mechanically excellent, the bore rates as near excellent-bright with strong, well-defined rifling and no rust or oxidation. There is a trace of residue built up along the sides of the lands and very fine pitting visible only with magnification, in spots of the grooves(see pictures). contact us on hoxworth.james001@gmail.com or +1 859-740-9763"
