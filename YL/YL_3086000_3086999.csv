I took this on trade from a buddy of mine.  He bought it as a impulse buy.  He had never shot a shotgun before but loved the way this one looked.  After the 2 of us put 10 rounds through the gun he decided that he most certainly was not a shotgun guy.  Since that day the gun has been broken down, cleaned, and oiled.

Winchester and Browning are now sister companies to each other and their parent company is FN.  This is the first FN design in the Winchester line of shotguns.  

It has:  18.5"" chrome barrel, aluminum receiver that is also chrome lined.  Duel action arms, sling attachment points, both a brass bead sight and a Tru glo green fiber optic clamp on sight ( gun comes from the factory with this)

The finish on this gun is awesome.  Combine that with the rotating bolt and you have one of the smother and fastest pump guns out there.

I am looking for a Remington 870 synthetic tactical.   All my shotguns are remington and would like to keep all my parts interchangeable. 

Let me know if you have any questions

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It was been developed from Kel-Tec's highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters. 

The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The blued slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular inner frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The grip is checkered black polymer. Original Soft Case included.

Very tough choice, but decided to sell my near brand-spoankin' new Remington 1911 R1 Enhanced Crimson Trace Edition 5"" .45 ACP. Bought brand new & only got a chance to do a quick disassembly, inspection, clean, lube, reassembly, and a 3 mag function check at 25ft (one mag Federal 230gr FMJ, 1 mag Speer Gold Dot 230gr HP, and 1 mag Hornady Critical Defense 185gr FTX). First 2 mags with factory black serrated rear/front hi-viz fiberoptic sights, and last mag with the CT laser. Loved the red fiberoptic, really stood out in daylight! Pistol functioned flawlessly all 24 rds.and resulted in one fist sized hole dead center of target. No adjustments made to rear sight or laser even. Dead on out of the box! Had back surgery next day so cleaned it and has sat in safe since then. Stumbled upon a new Springfield Loaded MC Operator at a DEEPLY discounted LE/MIL price and couldn't resist getting it. Really wanted another stainless 1911 tho, so either the Springfield or Remington has to go. I still haven't even shot the MC Operator yet, decided to keep it strictly for sentimental reasons. Hope I'm not selling the wrong one! Just judging from the 3 mags I got to shoot, I could easily see the R1 Enhanced Stainless finding it's way into my holster :-)

 I've had this for a year and I'm looking for something a little bigger. It has about 100 rounds through it. It is clean and well-maintained. I will include 2 magazines and I'll throw in 200 rounds of 22lr to get you started. It comes with a plastic case and trigger lock. The tip-up design makes it ideal for someone (i.e. ladies) who may have trouble racking a slide. They are $300 new (with only one mag and no ammo) so I'm pretty firm on the price of $250.00.

This most excellent rifle looks and shoots as great as it looks. The over ninety percent stock and finish make this one a particular interest to a collector or someone that has always wanted one of these. The gorgeous gloss walnut furniture and fine checkering make this an exceptional addition to ones already nice collection or someones first rifle. This it not your ruger 1022 rifle. It is something else and special. The trigger is a single satge trigger that is crispt and clean braking every time. The sights are kind of like big game sights. The stock and forearm with the checkering of this deluxe model just says high quality of a age and years gone by. This fince rifle was made in 1963 or 1964 abouts. The fit and finish of the parts are just like new. The rifle has a few cosmetics as like all things used some would be. The rifle is the only usa made rifle that takes 22 long rifle, 22 long, or 22 short. I have run all three lengths through it and it runs like a sewing machine.
These are going for over 600 and up on gunbroker in less of a nice condition as this one.

Had 5 shells fired through it to confirm functionality. Gun accepts 25 round drums, 12 round, 10 round and 5 round mags. 

This is a steal for a new factory converted Saiga 12, with collapsible stock, quadrail and two 10 round mags. I have $90 in the mags alone when you consider shipping costs.  

This exact model is on Guns America for $1600. The only difference is their gun had an updated Gas Puck. Updated Gas Puck allows the gun to run low brass more effectively. 

I bought this one month ago new in box. I have the factory 5 round mag. I also have 2 10 round Pro Mag (Midway).  Promag cost $40 each. 
With only 5 rounds through it the gun is brand new.  I am looking to trade for a NIB or almost New AR 15 or AR 10.

I have done a few upgrades including:

2. Upgraded to a Wolff firing pin spring
3. Upgraded to a match barrel with chamfered bore for smoother chambering of round.
4. Upgraded to a black squared slide that can handle higher pressures (the rounded slides are weaker and had problems handling higher power ammo)
5. Both magazines were upgraded with +15% strength Wolff mag springs

That's over $400 worth of upgrades. I have only put 50 rounds through with the new barrel and slide. 

I'm selling it for way less than it's value because I'm moving to Florida at the end of the month and need the extra gas money.

The wait list to buy one of his barrels is something like two years long. This barrel is threaded 5/8x24 and is 0.75"" thick at the gas port. The blank and barrel extension came from Stag Arms. High-quality craftsmanship and precision is evident by looking at the threading, crown, gas port, etc. 

The feed ramps have been polished. I purchased this barrel new in November 2013, used it to build a pistol upper, let the upper sit in my safe for 6 months, and then I disassembled the upper and decided to go with a different length. This barrel is brand new, unfired and hasn't had so much as a round put into the chamber. There is some minor wear on the exterior finish from assembly and disassembly, but nothing major and nothing that won't be covered up by the handguard. $200. Price is FIRM. Will trade for an 8"" or 8.2"" barrel (can add cash on my end). Buyer must pick up in downtown Dallas or in NE Dallas near the Arboretum. Thanks for looking."

Description
The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
      The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Beretta 96A1: Ultimate Tactical Firepower

The 96A1 is an evolution of the legendary 92FS (M9), one of the world’s most successful pistols for military, law-enforcement and self-defense use. Chambered in the powerful .40 S&W, it comes with three 12-round magazines to deliver impressive firepower for any tactical use. It is safe, accurate and reliable while offering easy operation, accessorization and disassembly; and its durability is further enhanced by a recoil buffer that greatly diminishes component stress. A pistol that bears the unmistakeable Beretta looks, it is the ultimate choice for shooters wanting a professional-grade personal- or home-defense pistol that can also be easily adapted for concealed carry.


 Accurate and Reliable

The cold-hammer forged barrel on the 96A1 is designed to deliver great accuracy out of the box, while the dovetail-mounted front sight is easy to adjust to always keep you on target. The barrel is encased in an open slide typical of Beretta’s 90-series pistols; besides reducing weight and backward-momentum during firing, this design maximizes reliability and virtually eliminates “stove-piping.”


Durable and Made to Last

With the 96A1, the hard-hitting .40 S&W comes back stronger than ever in the 90-series lineup. We have worked in conjunction with law-enforcement experts to make this pistol shrug off tens of thousands of full-power rounds with Beretta-style durability. The brand new recoil buffer that is machined right into the action of the 96A1 essentially acts as a cushon against the stress between moving parts, greatly boosting the service life of this powerful pistol. Also, the Bruniton finish on the metal is designed to be corrosion resistant to give worry-free maintenance even after all-day concealed carry in scorching-hot conditions.


 Easy to Accessorize

The 96A1 comes with an integral Picatinny rail on which users can easily mount a variety of tactical accessories--such as tactical lights, aiming devices or even both. Additionally, the front sight is dovetail-mounted, meaning that it is adjustable for windage and can be easily replaced with an accessory front sight of the user’s choice. If you love the unmatched performance of the Beretta 92FS or M9 and want a few extra tactical features as well as the extra power of the .40 S&W, the Beretta 96A1 is your ultimate choice."

It is in excellent condition, only a very slight scuff on the barrel. It doesn't appear to have been shot much. It will come with the OEM hard case, paperwork, factory rings and whatnot.

I swapped out the sights with some Williams Fire Sights which are excellent (I will include the OEM sights). 

Also swapped the trigger return spring which really smoothed out and lightened up the trigger. I left the OEM hammer spring in place for reliable ignition. 

It also has a very very nice, new Galco Kodiak shoulder holster, and two speed loaders. 

I'll throw in a couple of boxes of Hornady XTP's as well

Trade value for everything is $850. Cash price is also $850 as I would rather trade. Cash can be added on your end to even it up, or other things could be added to even it out."

Do you want to shoot in a more dynamic setting?

10 student limit.

The Intermediate Pistol Course is all about getting comfortable with your firearm. This course will drive the core marksmanship fundamentals required to master the manipulation of your firearm. This course will take you out of the comfortable static shooting most people do at the local range. Emphasis is taken on instilling safety and proficiency with your firearm.
This course will prepare you to properly, safely and effectively unholster your firearm and present it to a threat if such need should arise. The dynamics of shooting at closer distances will be explained and the hands-on drills will drive home the importance of the core fundamentals.
This course is 25% classroom and 75% hands-on and will have you firing your handgun for approximately 6 hours. Manipulating your firearm under new pressures and timed constraints will prepare you for the unexpected. This course will not only teach you the skills, but will also give you the confidence you need to feel comfortable handling your firearm in worst case scenarios. This course is 1 day of hands-on lecture and hands-on drills.

I just would rather wear a good belt and pack my 1911 Commander and put in the extra effort because I just prefer that gun.
I've put 50 rounds of PMC 115gr 9mm through it to break it in and then ran 6 rounds of Speer GD 115gr to be sure it functioned.
The gun's been sitting in the box since August after a thorough cleaning. Everything is good to go on it and everything in the pictures is included in this sale.
I'm asking $400 but will consider offers. I can throw in two boxes of Speer GD 115gr, but missing the 6 rounds I used for test firing if you need me to sweeten the deal.
I'm not in a big hurry to sell and won't be accepting any low-ball offers on this gun.

These Tactical pistols are some of the best shooting 45's out there. This gun is as close as you can get to the Mark 23 without paying $2000. It features a Match grade trigger with an adjustable trigger stop, high profile adjustable target sights for windage/elevation, a threaded barrel for a suppressor, the o-ring barrel, and HK's ""Hostile Environment"" blued finish among other features.

 This particular gun is in great working condition. The slide looks fantastic showing some extremely light signs of use. No scratches or dings on the slide. The threading on the barrel is untouched, as far as I can tell. The only condition issue are as seen in one of the pictures on the back of the polymer grip where it looks like someone gouged the bottom of the grip a bit. Needless to say, that does not affect the precision or functionality of the gun and is purely cosmetic.

 The pistol comes with 1 ten round magazine with an upgraded magazine spring (a Wolff +10 spring)!

This price is only for the pistol and magazine.  I have an original Eagle Industries tactical case (black) that I can include for an additional $100 (these cases sell for between $100 - $150).  This particular case is missing the suppressor pouch, but is a great useable example of these sought after cases.

 Feel free to call, text, or email. Nine 20- Four70-1275. I prefer a local CC permit holder sale in the Appleton area.

While it can be used in an AR15, its NOT a standard AR15 BCG so please don't email me about how you can pick one up for $99 at Uncle Bobs Gun Emporium dot com.  These are not currently available, YHM had pulled them from the retail website and us using them to fill contract orders for full rifles.  SO... if your looking for a direct replacement M16 BCG for your full-auto gun, or you just want to take advantage of the overbuilt quality and slightly slower cyclic rate for an AR15, this is your part.

Price is firm, fair, and already well below retail.  Please don't bother contacting me unless you have the cash in hand and can meet within 2 days of making contact.

-Rebadged High Standard. These were sold through Sears 1955-1963.
-9 shots.  Even today most of the Taurus, S&W, Charter, etc modern competitors only have 6-8 shots.
-Excellent shape mechanically. Locks up tight as can be and fires every time.  This is a good strong gun so load up your high velocity ammo and blaze away.  Since it's a revolver you can also load up your .22 Short CB's and pop away without any issues.
-Finish is decidedly worn. Has some holster wear and if the aluminum frame was blued/anodized/whatever it isn't now. I can see hints of a black color on parts of the frame and trigger guard but most of it is worn shiny. The barrel, hammer, trigger, and cylinder are still blued but show considerable wear. It was someone's tool box, glove box, or tackle box gun and lived a life of use with care. Works great, but not pretty.
-Has a 1 piece boot grip style plastic grip that is in good shape.

-Comes with what is marked a Lefty Lewis Custom Maker belt holster. It is a Charter Oak Co-Pilot holster:
http://bellcharteroakholsters.com/demon3.html
The holster isn't meant for this gun but it fits and retains it well. I thought about keeping it but my J frame slides right out of it. Someone must have fit the holster to the 88.  It alone retails for $130 before shipping.

I like this gun but find myself never shooting it.  It sits in the safe and never gets used.  I'd like to pass it on to someone that can use and appreciate it.  It's not pretty but it works perfectly and locks up tight.

You can find High Standards like this online but the snub nosed variants with the small grips are much harder to find.  Someone recoil shy?  Need a general purpose trail/glovebox/kit/hiking gun?  This thing fits the bill!

$200 Or Best Reasonable Offer but cash only.  It is in Lexington.  Sold to legal residents of KY who can prove such and who can lawfully own and possess a firearm."
