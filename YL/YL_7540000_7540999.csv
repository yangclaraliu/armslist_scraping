It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately.Lowball offers will be ignored. Loacted in Prattville."

You seem to not want to talk To people rather you want to talk Down to people. Its no wonder why the gun community gets such a bad rap since so many lack the ability to communicate with one another in an amicable way. You jerks make demands, not requests. You just say no rather than no thank you. You tell people how it will be rather than how you would prefer it to be. I bet your wives love that about you. Probably the reason why I bang so many married women. Your wives get sick of you being an asshole all the time so they seek out someone who knows how to treat their fellow human being. My advice, be nicer. You get a lot more with honey than you will with vinegar."

Just be reasonable.I have an original Pennsylvania Plains Rifle .36 Cal, Original beautiful curly maple stock and brass fixtures. The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match.  It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace. There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. I am willing to part with the old dog for the right deal. I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Hard to price history - Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

Face to face, cash only, and not loloking to trade.The Ruger® SR9® Semi-Auto Pistol provides shooters with a low-maintenance, rugged, and reliable handgun. This SR9 has a stainless steel slide, with a low-reflective brushed finish, that reduces the risk of corrosion when worn next to a perspiring body day after day. With its lightweight, slim design, the SR9 semi-automatic pistol is comfortable to carry and quick to deploy. Its ergonomic grip has an easily adjustable, reversible backstrap to accommodate individual shooter's hand size. The SR9 features a structurally rigid, glass-filled nylon grip frame that reduces recoil and enhances handgun control, and the front of the frame has a built-in Picatinny rail for modern handgun accessories. The high-visibility 3-Dot sight system provides quick and easy target acquisition, with adjustment for elevation and windage. The SR9 utilizes a trigger with a safety lever that prevents firing unless the center of the trigger is completely pulled. A loaded chamber indicator can be seen or felt, providing confirmation of a loaded or empty chamber. An external extractor enhances reliability, and the ambidextrous manual safety and magazine release are easily reached and actuated during stressful situations. The Ruger SR9 Semi-Auto Pistol with Stainless Slide is quick and easy to fieldstrip and reassemble without tools. Comes with 2 flush-fitting 17-round magazines. State compliant model comes with two 10-round magazines. Made in the USA."

555,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7540555,For Sale:  Limbsaver Deadzone DZ-32 Limited Edition Compound Bow Package lot extras,"South, Grand Rapids, Michigan",$ 600,"Listed On: Saturday, February 10, 2018",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For Sale is a pristine condition Limbsaver Deadzone DZ-32 Limited Edition Compound bow. items included in the listing:Limbsaver Deadzone DZ-32Plano hardcaseTrophy Taker drop away arrow restHHA single pin distance adjustable sight with illumination optionCamo stabelizerParacord wrist slingTreelimb 5 arrow quiverThree Whitetail carbon arrowsThree fixed blade broadheadsTwo mechanical broadheadsTarget mechanical broadhead simulatorTarget tips and other bits and bobsEditors' review from CompoundBowChoice.com:In 2008 Steve Sims and his Limbsaver company, which have been known for making high quality archery accessories, decided to design and manufacture their first bow. In doing so, Steve wanted to combine the advantages of his proprietary NAVCOM vibration dampening material with some innovative bow designs to create a quiet, efficient, easy to shoot bow that is virtually vibration free and build it with high quality materials. The Limbsaver DeadZone 32 (DZ 32) was the product of this creation and still remains a popular bow in the Limbsaver line-up.FinishThe DZ 32 is outfitted with a top notch fit and finish. The G1 Next Generation Camo looks incredible. This finish is designed to withstand the elements and never fade or wear off.RiserThe DZ 32 employs a nearly straight riser, making this bow very easy to point, aim and hold on target. Limbsaver was able to reduce the mass of the 6061-T6 aluminum riser while giving itself more strength by placing cut-outs in a waffle design. The added strength comes from the modified I-beam structure of these cut-outs which in effect reduces riser flex.Limbs and Limb PocketsThis rig benefits from using the best vibration dampening concept available to become the epitome of smooth drawing, quiet and a virtually vibration-free shooter. To accomplish this feat the design team had 3 pre-requisites: the opposing action of parallel limbs would reduce hand-shock, they also wanted to reduce the mass and length of the limbs, and minimize limb travel. The limb pockets on the DZ 32 definitely deserve our attention. The 6061-T6 aluminum limb pockets extend beyond the riser, increasing balance and reducing noise and vibration. Limbsaver also incorporates a Rolling Fulcrum system that is not just for draw weight adjustments, with this system any shooter can effectively press the bow with just two allen wrenches and make string adjustments in the field.GripThe DZ 32 comes with both a wood grip and black side plates for a slim grip. The wood grip is fatter but does have a thin neck thanks to the thumb grooves. This grip allows the shooter to have more control over the bow, which could be good or bad since fatter grips tend to produce more hand torque. The slim grip reduces the possibility of hand torque giving most archers more consistency and accuracy. Eccentric SystemThe High Efficiency Active Transfer (H.E.A.T.) Cam system optimizes energy transfer to the arrow at each draw length allowing for maximum speed. The DeadZone 32 advertises arrow speeds of 325-330 fps IBO. These speeds are quite impressive considering how smooth of a draw cycle this bow has. The ability of this bow to be this fast and this smooth comes from its hybrid modular H.E.A.T. cam system. They actually use two different sizes of Cams to allow overall draw length adjustments of 25-30 inches in half inch increments. A smaller cam is used for shorter draw lengths of 25 - 27.5, while a larger cam is used for the longer draw lengths of 28 - 30 inches. Adjustments do not require a bow press, only the use of allen wrenches making this bow very user friendly even for someone who may not have a lot of experience with archery equipment.Draw Cycle and ShootabilityLimbsaver gave the DZ 32 a very smooth draw cycle with a solid back wall. The 80% let off allows any archer to hold at full draw for lengthy periods of time, whether you are waiting for that big buck to step into a shooting lane or just trying to zero in on the ""X"". Additionally, upon release there is no noticeable hand shock but there is the slightest noise factor without the addition of a stabilizer. Once a quality stabilizer is added this bow becomes one of the quietest bows on the market.Silencing PackageThe DZ 32 takes advantage of Limbsaver's proprietary NAVCOM vibration control products to help keep this bow quiet. This bow comes standard with 6 string leaches, 2 Ultramax Limbsavers, cable guard dampener and integrates a strip of NAVCOM into the riser shelf. All of these components combine to give this bow a very quiet, soft feel while still producing some impressive numbers.Limbsaver DZ-32 vs DZ-30, DZ-36, and SpeedzoneLimbsaver manufacture 3 other bows based on the DZ 32 design. These bows are the DZ 30, DZ 36 and the SZ 34 (Speedzone). They each have their own specific purpose. While the DZ-32 is the best ""all-around"" bow in the line-up, the Limbsaver Deadzone DZ-30 is a lighter weight and shorter model designed for the tight hunting situations and the Limbsaver Deadzone DZ-36 is designed to be more forgiving and to allow for finger shooting. The Limbsaver Speedzone SZ-34 is made with raw speed in mind, this bow still maintains a fairly smooth draw but incorporates a Hyperdrive speed module into the cam to produce an impressive IBO of 350 fps. Of their selection this rig is most noteworthy for being an all-around bow that can be used for any archery activity.Best UsageThe Deadzone 32 is quite a good all-around bow that is best suited for hunting but it would hold its own shooting 3-D also. The forgiving 7 1/8"" brace height combined with the smooth draw cycle and ease of holding on target truly make this bow a shooter in most senarios.ValueOne of Limbsaver's goals is to make high quality products but keep the cost down so that anyone who wants to shoot their bows can afford to. The DZ 32's MSRP of $749.99 is less than most archery companies are selling their top end bows for. When you consider some of the technology Limbsaver has incorporated into this bow it really becomes a great value for the money.SummaryThe DeadZone 32 is the Do-it-all bow suited for every archer. This bow utilized a lot of new technology that the archery world has not seen previous to Limbsaver. These technologies combine to produce vibration-free performance in a smooth, well balanced and quiet bow with a tough look that can shoot arrows at 330 fps. This is easily fast enough to take down any game you are after. Not to mention this may be the easiest bow to tune on the market since it does not require a bow press for anything. There is not much negative to say about this bow. Shooters may hear a small amount of noise upon release if there is no stabilizer installed, and at full draw this bow may want to creep forward on you a bit, but that is typical of most bows with IBO speeds over 310 fps. Limbsaver's company motto is ""Products That Work"". Well, the DZ 32 sure fits the bill."

For this rendition the words ""Union"" and ""Confederate"" replace those words. These guns have carved ivory grips featuring high relief US and CS on the grip side panels.
