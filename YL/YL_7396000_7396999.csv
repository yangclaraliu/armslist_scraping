Browning's most lasting innovations - the Model 1911 and the 380 ACP cartridge - into a modern, lightweight pistol. Unlike most of the modern ""pocket pistols"" that chamber the snappy 380 ACP cartridge, the 1911-380 is slightly larger to better manage recoil for improved control that makes follow-up shots faster and more accurate. The longer barrel increases bullet velocity for more downrange punch and improved acccuracy. The grip is compact, yet is long and wide enough to allow the shooting hand full purchase for added shooting comfort.   Specifications:  Item Number: 051901492 UPC Number: REDACTED02 Caliber: .380 Auto Barrel Length: 4.25"" Overall Length: 7.50"" Weight: 18 oz Magazine Capacity: 8 Sight Radius: 5.375"" Barrel Finish: Matte Receiver Finish: Matte Front Sight: Combat White Dot Rear Sight: Combat White Dot Barrel Material: Steel Checkering: Molded Receiver Material: Black Composite Trigger Finish: Matte Black Trigger Guard: Matte Black Magazine Type: Single Stack Trigger Material: Alloy Trigger Guard Material: Composite Case: ABS"

Taurus Security System (TSS)s:  Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with their revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. The releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.  Loaded Chamber Indicator:  Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

But I didn't want the mag-tube sticking out all the way to the end (shorter ones handle better). The answer to this was the Nordic Components upgrades. -- I also wanted it to be 100% RELIABLE with low-recoil 00-Buck and low-recoil 000-Buck. I wanted to even be able to cycle reliable with low-recoil loads while not pulled fully into my shoulder. The answer to this was OR3GUN's products.MODIFICATIONS:1) Nordic Components -- MXT Shotgun Magazine Extension Kit +2 since the OEM extension is known to hang up. (cost $75.50)2) Nordic Components -- Shotgun Barrel Clamp with Tac Rail, since I wanted a place to mount a light (cost $52.74)3) OR3GUN upgrade kit -- I got the CSP/ASR Set - Competition (Polished), Marine Spacer Tube - Competition (Marine Blue), Competition Forearm Retainer - FIELD Fit (Pitch Black), the Enhanced Bolt Release - Tactile (Pitch Black), and the enhanced reliability follower. The CSP/ASR set and MST help it feed low-recoil with 100% accuracy, and everything else is just a nice upgrade. (cost $165.50)4) 8 nice dummy rounds ($15), installed a sight rail ($15), and a butt-stock shell holder ($10).5) I smoothed out and polished the edges of the carrier latch to a mirror finish (this makes it feed much more smoothly, and eliminates any chance of feeding issues).TOTAL SPENT -- $718.74 (plus $50-75 other stuff)...so I have over $750 in the gun making it as handy and reliable as possible. I've only shot 10rds of the lowest recoiling and lightest slugs I could find, and 25rds of birdshot through it. Everything cycled perfectly EVEN when I held the gun away from my body to see if it might short-stroke (limp-wrist)."

The 4"" Service Model is a slim and ergonomic pistol that packs even more amazing capacity. Featuring the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 Service Model is ready for duty, a day at the range and even concealed carry. With high visibility low-profile sights and a slim-contour frame, the XD Mod.2 Service Model is feature packed full sized double-stack pistol. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry's slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2 offers 16+1 rounds of 9mm. The noticeably slim profile and other features combine to make the Mod.2 Service Model a pistol that offers excellent ergonomics and serious firepower in a suprisingly concealable full sized handgun. Plus, you can choose between two attractive finishes - all black, or bi-tone. Like all XDs, the Mod.2 Service Model is loaded with saftey features. The striker status indicatior, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System all work to make the XD Mod.2 Service Model a safe and easy to use pistol. And of course, GripZone ergonomics set the XD Mod.2 apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2 Service Model on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD Mod.2 4"" Service model, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you'll probably find that you've got a new favorite pistol.

This allowed the shooter to keep the long sight radius of a rifle for accuracy, but keep the carbine length barrel for maneuverability. The proximity of the gas port to the muzzle, however, played havoc with timing and made reliability a hit or miss proposition. Advances in AR technology have produced reliable carbine and mid-length gas systems, that can be hidden using low-profile gas blocks. This allows for a front sight base to be pinned in the rifle position for the longer sight radius without the worry of the unorthodox gas port location affecting operation. We use the term ""mock"" to differentiate our dissipator from a cut-down rifle length version. Our Hammer-Forged Mid-length dissipator uses a ""Machine Gun Steel"" barrel that is thick chrome-lined for durability and high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected.Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system. A2 style profile barrel is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected. Barrel is finished off with a pinned F-marked front sight post in the Rifle position with sling swivel, rifle length handguards, and an A2 flash hider.Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer. Brand new new never fired. Includes upper, full bolt carrier group and charging handle. No trades and local purchase only. We must meet face to face no shipping. Price is $300. REDACTED"

This is a brand new in box, with the factory lifetime warranty,Jimenez Arms all tu-tone T-380 pistol. This gun is probably the best kept secret in the firearms industry. I only saw my first one a while back, when a private security contractor (Blackwater type) sold it to me. While I have sold hundreds of Jimenez Arms J.A. 380 pistols, this oneis much different and i.m.o. improved over the under-rated J.A. 380. I took it to the range, and it was more accurate then a Ruger Mark II, Taurus PT111, and a Beretta Model51. This was the consensus of mytwo companions and I. They are both accomplished shooters. After that experience, I immediately added the T-380 to my revolving new firearm inventory. The first customer that saw the used T-380 purchased it. The pistol feels great in the hand. Recoil is very restrained. The factory sights are outstanding. While a little bigger then it's sister J.A.380, the J.A. T380 is still good for conceal carry. Holds 7 rounds in the mag, unlike the J.A.380's 6 round magazine. The J.A. T-380 is based on the JA NINE and J.A. LC380 but in a slimmer package. Like the J.A. LC380, the J.A. T-380 has aneasy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features make this pistol super accurate, and a whole lot of fun at the range.

Much more than just their take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidely CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who's picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it - it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that 'brick-in-the-hand' feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. Designed to minimize creep and stacking, the P-10's trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5lbs and rebounds with a short, positive reset, meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with their legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The 'C' in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fire guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.

GLOCKs nDLC provides tougher, more durable protection than previously used finish. The nDLC finish is exclusive to the GLOCK manufacturing process. The nDLC finish increases protection against corrosion and scratching and improves the ability of the pistol to function in degreased or adverse conditions. The nDLC finish will be exclusive to Gen5 pistols at this time. GLOCK Marksman Barrel -The GLOCK Marksman Barrel (GMB) features new barrel rifling which delivers improved accuracy.

The absence of finger grooves improves the ability of the pistol to deliver a consistently comfortable grip to a wider range of consumers, regardless of their finger size and whether or not gloves are worn. Ambidextrous Slide Stop Lever. The ambidextrous slide stop lever makes it easier for gunowners to quickly, safely and comfortably manipulate the slide whether they are left-handed or right-handed.

This gun is by far the most accurate .22 that ive ever had the pleasure of grouping. would not hesitate to shoot out to or beyond 100 yards with it. Gun has been well cared for. It's primarily been used for pest control and the occasional squirrel or rabbit hunt. Would like to get 275 for the gun.

I can be contacted at twosixzero-2onefive-55ninethree. ps. would like to see a concealed carry permit or a valid drivers license upon purchase."
