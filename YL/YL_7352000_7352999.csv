Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV). Includes factory case, two magazines, manual, and lock.

The engraving features several hunting dogs, one on the barrel tang, one on the lock plate, and an engraving of a tiger on the trigger guard. The lock is also marked “ZAOUE” and inlaid in gold.The overall condition of this piece is very good. The barrel has turned an even brown over time. The engraving is well done.

Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.    And I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" .   I would receive and cash USPS money order before getting it well padded and boxed and shipping it out via USPS."

Not looking for trades unless it’s heavily in my favor.The pistol is in 9.5/10 condition. It’s been fired about 200 rounds. The only wear visible is around the barrel lug corners and even then, it’s minimal.This is an extremely rare version of the P-09 model. 50 of each in 9mm and 40 S&W were produced for the Army MHS Trials program. CZ decided to not submit last minute and sold the pistols to CZ employees and then finally to the general public.This specific model was originally (supposedly) owned by an employee at CZ Customs. He converted it from a mediocre DAO to SAO. The original DAO parts are included with the pistol. It can also be converted to DA/SA with a deco king lever install.Included with the pistol is 3 10 round OEM 40 S&W magazines. I can include the OEM high cap magazines if you’re LEO/FFL/ out of state. All other original accessories are included. Box, manual, target, cleaning brushes etc.I am looking to get $950 OBO cash. Feel free to make an offer."

The process starts with the brass being sorted to ensure LC is all that is used, then the brass is cleaned to remove any dirt, carbon, or grease. This ensures that there are no obstructions on or in the brass that can interfere with sizing and trimming. On a Dillon Precision Machine each case is deprimed using a Dillon Universal Decapping die, then primer pockets are swaged and uniformed removing the military crimp and ensuring the primer pockets are not over sized. Next, each case is sized and trimmed on a Dillon RT1500 well within SAMMI specifications of 1.368 -.020 (1.348 to 1.368) which will allow you to reload several times before needing to trim. Next, the overall dimensions are checked with a precision case gauge and calipers to ensure maximum quality. Approximately once every 20 - 30 cases processed are sampled to maintain integrity of the specifications. Next, the flash holes of each case are de-burred and inspected to ensure there are no mixed head stamps. Next, the brass is cleaned in a wet tumbler with stainless steel media ensuring each case is cleaned inside and out.As this is ""once-fired"" brass, some cases my exhibit minor dents from previous firing, however, I do my best to remove all cases that do not have a like-new appearance.

TALO Had FAIL ZERO coat the slide and barrel with nickel boron coating. Nickel boron provides a hard, durable surface (40% harder than chrome) and permanent lubricity to metal substrates, allowing firearms to operate without oil or grease. EXO coated components last longer, clean up easier, and require minimal maintenance, while increasing relaibility in harsh environments (sand/dust, hot/cold, suppressed fire, frangible ammunition). TALO tested one of these to evaluate their failure rate. They ran 5,000 rounds through it with no malfunctions or lubrication.This Glock 19 TALO EXO is in lightly used to near perfect/mint condition. I put about 100 rounds through it, cleaned it, and it's been sitting in the safe for years. I recently put brand new Wilson Combat Vickers Elite Battle Night Sites on it as well - $112.00. It comes as a package with three new Glock OEM magazines, three new Magpul PMAG magazines, three new Magpul PMAG Floor Plates, a new Ghost Inc. 3.5 Connector, a Ghost Inc. Grip Plug - installed, but new, a Glock OEM extended slide stop lever, and a Glock OEM extended magazine release - both installed, but new.Price is $550.00 cash firm - looking to fund another project.

This particular revolver was manufactured some time between 82 and 86, but has been fired minimally, taken care of well, and stored well oiled. The bore on this little hand Cannon is Preston's, though I  say that when I took the pistol out of storage (it was a gift from my mother who herself was too afraid to even fire it once) a small piece of the handle came off. Even so, I would highly recommend switching out the handle on a revolver with this much recoil with something a bit softer. The barrel on this fire arm is 6.5 inches long, and I must say it is a true tack driver, it will be as accurate as you are. It's a beautiful piece of equipment, but I am looking to break into the AR market and would either like to trade it for one or sell it for cash in order to buy one. I am very open minded when it comes to trade, so if you're interested let me know what you've got, worst I can say is a polite no. Like I said, particularly looking for Ars, AR pistols, .357 revolvers, and compact or subcompact handguns. Thanks a bunch for your time, I hope we reach an honerable trade or monetary agreement.

Kimber Stainless TLE II, 45 ACP
Today, law enforcement officers around the country, including such elite units as LAPD SWAT, carry Kimber Customs. Military units with the option to chose pistols that can actually do the job trust Kimber with their lives. American shooters have made Kimber the best selling brand of 1911 by a huge margin.
 
A stainless steel version of the pistol carried by LAPD SWATThe Stainless TLE II .45 ACP is a stainless steel version of the duty pistol carried by LAPD SWAT. Important upgrades from the Kimber Custom Shop like Meprolight night sights and 30 lines-per-inch checkering on the front strap are also included. Based on the Kimber Stainless II, it has standard features like match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid stainless steel for additional resistance to the elements. A 1911 fi ts almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the authority of the great .45 ACP cartridge, the Stainless TLE II is an all-around top choice for duty, concealed carry or personal defense.
- Match grade chamber and trigger
- Low profile night sights are mounted in machined dovetails for strength and have rounded edges that will not snag
- Full-size frame is machined from solid stainless steel for strength and long life
- 5-inch match grade barrel and bushing for unequaled accuracy
- Front strap checkering (30 lines per inch) ensures positive grip, regardless of conditions
- Stainless steel frame and slide for additional resistance to the elements
- Extended magazine release button for faster operation
- Beveled magazine well for quick and positive loading
- Polished breech face for flawless feeding and extraction
- Lowered ejection port to ensure unobstructed ejection and reliability
- Extended thumb safety to encourage high-hand grip placement"

This crossbow has not been shot since TenPoint rebuilt it which includes new limbs, cams, cables, and strings. They also put in an improved safety and trigger. It has 4 or 5 arrows with it, but to leave it new, it still has the tag on the strings. I will remove it and sight it in if you wish, otherwise it is unshot, assembled, and ready. $275, the new Invader is $600 from a store.***I contacted TenPoint to get the details as to what the issue was on these crossbows as it was wide-spread. The original cams were egg shaped and it caused too much stress in one point on the string. This caused to string to break and in turn destroyed the limbs. So the new design of the round cams resolved the issue and then it was rebuilt in the factory back to new condition."

I'm selling my titanium gold Desert Eagle, chambered in 50 AE, model number DE50TG. This gun has fewer than 50 rounds put through it, and the finish has no scratches, dents, or deformations at all; it is practically brand new. The gun will come with the factory hard case, instrcution manual, dvd manual, disassembly tool, 27 rounds of Hornady 300gr XTP hollow points, and a gold base-plated magazine (now discontinued from the factory).I am not willing to ship the gun, as I've had difficulty with that in the past, so please do not contact me unless you're able to purchase the gun in person at a Colorado FFL. If you're in a neighboring state and want me to drive to you for the exchange, message me and we'll work out some details.I'm not really looking to negotiate on price, either. The gun retails for $1900, and I feel my price of $1500 reflects the gun's condition while still giving the buyer a nearly 25% discount off factory new."

This Luftwaffe rifle is serial numbered 2889i. All numbers are matching except the front band E/655 (7313) and cleaning rod (64). The band spring is not numbered and is proofed mark E/26.The bolt and all its parts are numbered to the rifle. The bore is bright and shinny. There is some very, very slight corrosion on a few areas of the rifling which may come off with a good cleaning. The bore is stamped 7.9 on the barrel and my 7.92 bore gauge will not enter the bore due to very little wear. I would rate the bore as excellent. For a combat rifle the stock is in excellent condition with only some minor dings and scratched. The stock and hand guard have never been refinished or messed with in any way. The light walnut stocks are extremely hard to come by. The stock and hand guard are numbered to the rifle in the barrel channels and on the bottom of the butt area of the stock. The stock and hand guard have E/63 proof marks which can be clearly seen. The blueing has worn thin in places as can be seen in the photos, but still remains very strong over almost all of the rifle. The trigger guard and floor plate are machined and proof marked E/63. The butt plate is stamped E/63 and has the serial number. The rear bands is numbered to the rifle and E/63. The original sling has an Eagle ink stamp proof mark and the manufacturers stamp imbedded into the leather. I can only make out the name “RUDOLPH” in the stamping. The frog also has a manufactures stamp and I can only make out SEIBOU “62”. The rear sight is number to the rifle. The cleaning rod is an original WW2 10” issue. This rifle came directly from the veterans family many years ago. This is an excellent collector grade example of a pre-war German Luftwaffe rifle that will enhance any collection. It is very hard to find one in this condition. This sale must be to a FFL dealer or C&R license holder without exception. Payment of a postal money order or bank cashiers check must be received in 10 days of auction closing. Shipping and insurance will cost an additional $45.00. This firearm is being sold as a collector item only. As with alI curious and relics firearms I advise that a qualified and certified gun smith inspect this rifle prior to firing it at your own risk. A three day non fire inspection period from the date received will be granted. If the rifle is returned in the allotted time and in exactly the same condition as sent a refund will be returned less shipping and handling."
