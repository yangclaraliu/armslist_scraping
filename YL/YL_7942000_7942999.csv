A lucky G.I. was able to capture this completed pistol with it's original issue ""AKAH"" holster and bring it home. Most late war AC marked PPs have mismatching numbers because they were assembled using spare parts from the factory after Germanys surrender, but this example was actually completely finnished by the last Walther employees, making it one of the last ever made by Walther for Nazi Germany.

I believe this makes it not a 1903, not a 1903 A3, but a 1903 Modified. The rifling is in surprisingly great shape despite it having what I think is the original barrel.

The 336D was made exclusively for Davidson’s in 2000, before the Remington buyout so the quality is still up to Marlin standards. Designed to be a ""Guide Gun"" version of the Marlin 336. It features a beautifully figured straight grip, checkered walnut stock and a 18 ½” ported barrel. This rifle is in like new condition and was acquired from the original owner who claimed that it is unfired. This model was only produced in 2000. This gun has absolutely no problems and does not appear to have seen any use. Receiver and barrel have 100% of the original blue with no thin spots or wear on the high points. The walnut stocks are in excellent condition with the original satin factory finish intact; the checkering is sharp, deep, and unworn. There is only one small handling mark and you really have to look to see it (See pictures). The butt stock is equipped with a factory rubber pad with the Marlin logo. Comes with the original box, lock and all paperwork. MORE PICTURES AVAILABLE ON REQUEST."

The gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws.
The IC-SPR with one-piece Monoforge™ upper design includes an integrated rail-base that is stronger and lighter.  The 12” user configurable rail system with individual rail sections allow the shooter to place accessory rails where they are needed while maintaining its low profile ergonomic fit and function.

Our IC-SPR uses LWRCI™ manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that are 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter.  The increased surface area reduces heat – speeds up cooling.  Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity.
