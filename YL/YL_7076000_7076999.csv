See the Bersa website for more details.After breaking in the pistol (<300 rnds), I haven't had a single failure to feed or eject. It has worked great using all sorts of ammunition including hollow point.As you can see in the pictures, the feed ramp is a little scuffed up. This occurred when I put the spring on backward and the gun became jammed. A gunsmith un-jammed the gun and polished the slide as best he could. This has had no affect on the performance of the pistol, again no failures to feed or eject. Great little .380 ACP that has served me well. Only selling it because I just don't use it anymore and I'm trying to cut down on the number of guns around the hosue.Will require someone with current CHL or FFL Transfer at expense to buyer."

I plan on (Hopefully) upgrading to a Benelli and will no longer need this. From the Mossberg web site: Dual gas-vent system, quick-empty magazine release button for easy unloading, drilled and tapped receiver. Select models feature LPA Ghost Ring Sights and picatinny rails. This is one of those models that has both.
This one also has a few extras:
* Nordic Components Barrel Clamp * The Barrel Clamp has been dipped in Kryptek Typhon to match the rest of the shotgun. The clamp and the dipping was $75 alone.* Stacra Tech barrel clamp gasket. This is high heat and keeps the clamp from scratching the finish.  * Extended oversized charging handle.* GG&G low drag aluminum magazine follower.* Wolff Extra Power Magazine Spring
There are over $135 in extras on this
There are just over 125 rounds through this shotgun.
There are a few negatives: This does not have any choke system. There are some scratches on the gun but they almost match the pattern and are subtle unless you know where to look.
This shotgun can run any loads. I have run cheap WalMart stuff, expensive 00, and a few slugs. Mostly I did this to make sure there were not any issues before the warranty ran out. Then I put it in the safe and it hasn’t been used in close to a year.
Since this is just a shotgun I will only need to take a picture of your ID. No shipping. Please do not ask. Cash only."

I also have a 9mm.  They were developed with the help of one of the Glock minds. I never was very consistent with my Glock.  With this it's extremely accurate and easy to aquire the target.The Steyr S-A1 striker-fired pistol is a sub-compact, semi-automatic, double-action handgun available as the S9-A1 chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum or the S40-A1 chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson. The smallest of Steyr’s pistol line, the S-A1 has a 3.6” (91mm) barrel and the same short overall length as the C-A1 but features a short grip for ultra-concealment.As with each model in the Steyr A1 line of products, the pistol features a low bore-axis which minimizes recoil and improves control while the ergonomic grip offers optimal control for a variety of hand sizes. The lower frame of the gun offers a standard slide-lock thumb tab, right-handed magazine ejection button and pivoting break-down lever. A key-operated manual safety feature is located next to the break-down lever and 2 keys are provided with each pistol. An integrated Picatinny rail allows for simple mounting of a laser or light and slide-racking grooves on the back of the slide allow for a firm grip when manually operating the action."
