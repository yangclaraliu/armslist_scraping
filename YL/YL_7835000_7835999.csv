I've only put about 200 rounds through this gun but I'm not the first owner so I can't say the exact round count but it's always been cleaned after each use and sits in the safe. Not looking to trade. Shoot me a text if interested. 541-two 3 two-1 seven 00. Thx for looking.

Wood looks to be crack-free, with some dings on the body from use. Buttplate has a few typical dings, with some deformation of the wood around it. Action is smooth and still needs the residual Cosmolene cleaned out. Magazine locks up tight and the bolt hold-open functions correctly. Not much wear in that area,Overall a great collectible rifle. Shipping available. Ask for more pictures. The Egyptian Rasheed Carbine (also ""Rashid"") was born from the Hakim Rifle which, in turn, was born from the Swedish Ljungman AG-42 semi-automatic rifle line. The Ag-42 rifle was produced for the Swedish Army during World War 2 (1939-1945) and entered service in 1942. The weapon was a gas-operated, repeating rifle system utilizing the local 6.5x55mm cartridge. After the war, the Egyptian government secured the rights to the rifle and purchased the required machining tools for local production of the type - this becoming the Hakim Rifle of the 1950s with chief changes being its now-adjustable gas function and chambering for the 7.92x57mm Mauser. The Rasheed was a further-developed form of the Hakim though shortened into a more handy carbine form. Production numbers totaled only 8,000 units and adoption occurred in 1960."

This rife has never been fired and I am the original owner. The Rifle has authentic Russian redwood furniture installed and is an absolute beauty. As you all may know the trade restrictions with Russia that were instituted last year have banned all Russian made weapons from entering the country, so getting your hands on one is becoming increasingly harder. I'm primarily looking at trading rather than selling for a Zenith z5-rs, Scar-L or Scar-H, or a Ruger Precision Rifle. But if cash is what you have i'm asking 2,000 firm. No more, NO LESS. If you try to lowball me you will be blocked. Call or text REDACTED with your offer. Thanks."

I have transitioned back to a compound bow the last month of bow season, but held onto to crossbow just in case my shoulder counldn't handle it. It has a Nikon Bolt XR BDC 60 scope on it, purchased for $159.00. This is an excellent crossbow and hard hitting. I've harvested 6 deer with it. It has a 155-lb draw weight combined with its long power stroke of just over 15"" to produce a sizzling 330 fps. Comes with soft case, sling, quiver, 5 bolts, and broadheads. Asking $550.00. I would entertain trades trade value $650. If interested, please call or text Mike at REDACTED. Stock image attached, actual pictures available on request.Local purchase only, I won't ship. Cash sale only, not interested in bogus checks or money orders."

I have never taken this gun to the range, but, it has killed a handful of snakes and two hogs; so I know it is capeable of killing despite it's overwhelming good looks and geriatric age. There is absolutely no pitting, dents or signs of abuse to the frame or to the crown for that matter. The firearm has spent 98% of its life with me, in its holster, in my gun safe. The finish on the grip is still in almost perfect condition with just the slightest amount of imperfections visible up close. This is probably about as close to a new 1977 Colt Trooper as I have ever seen."
