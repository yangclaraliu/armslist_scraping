""The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots."" LWRC WEBSITE"

A traditional and reliable pattern that will give years of reliable use, the Magnadot is more turtle than hare. Easily opening the formidable 3.63-Inch half serrated blade with one hand gives you a sense of power. The Magnadot includes a lockback feature and is one of the oldest locks in use today. It's a great mechanism that locks up very securely. The lever on the back edge of the handle catches in the tang of the blade and locks it, while with one press on the back of the lever, unlocks the blade in this ambidextrous and safe to operate feature. The glass reinforced nylon handle is high strength, abrasion and impact resistant. The handle also offers a chemical resistance to common chemicals such as motor oil, transmission fluid, and methanol. Magnadot... it is happening big. This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in manufacturing and materials.

Product info:  Beretta 92 FS 9mm JS92F300M

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil delayed blowback system which yields; faster cycle times exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table door etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols this design provides the energy to the firing pin virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter is spring loaded so it’s either positively ‘on’ or ‘off’ . The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

I bought this rifle about a year ago before I deployed and set it all up.  I bought a Remington 700P when I got back, so I am selling this one.   I never got around to bringing this out to the range.

The scope has been mounted using the scope and ring/mount manufacturer’s specifications for torque and locked into place with lock-tite.  The scope has been leveled before and after installation to ensure 100% crosshair level.  I have boresighted the scope to 50m for initial zeroing (and barrel break-in if you so choose).

This rifle is completely ready to bring out to the range and zero with minor adjustments.  This rifle has the Remington X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger.   If you do your part, this rifle will shoot sub-MOA groups.

Bore,wood and metal in good condition
An improvement over the original, 1889, version of the Schmidt-Rubin rifle, the Swiss M1911 placed the locking lugs in the middle of the bolt, rather than at the rear, strengthening the action and allowing a more powerful cartridge to be used. This is a straight pull bolt action.  The 1911 and 96/11 rifles are characterized by exceptional accuracy and were made with excellent craftsmanship. The fact that Switzerland remained neutral through both world wars ensured that they are in far better condition, on average, than the rifles of other European nations from that vintage. Good surplus ammo available for about $.50-.60 a round."

Walnut stock is very good with exceptional grain pattern, and shows little wear. Top rail is grooved for a scope, and the action works good. Comes with sling swivels, this model no longer made has become collectible as it looks like the M1 military carbine. Chambered for the .22lr. 

The Marlin Model 99M1 is a short carbine with the same tubular magazine and action as the Marlin 99 and 99U. The main difference is the 99M1 has a walnut stock and hand guard and an 18-inch barrel to make it look more like a US military M1 Carbine. Marlin introduced the 99M1 in 1964, in hopes that the resemblance to the US M1 carbine would appeal to the thousands of WW II veterans who had trained with and carried into combat the larger caliber US M1. The 99M1 was a success and over 160,000 were sold before production was discontinued in 1978.

This is INCREDIBLE factory new, high-performance, precision-manufactured, SS109 steel penetrator, lead-core ammunition loaded exactly to NATO specs.

THIS IS AMAZING AMMUNITION - These are nothing like those PMC X-TAC ""light armor piercing"" green tip rounds... these are PENETRATOR rounds and have unbelievable accuracy and destruction.  This same ammo has been manufactured and sold to the U.S. and foreign Governments for use in combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other foreign theaters of war.

This ammunition is powerful enough to penetrate up to 3mm (0.12 in) of steel at 600 meters & up to 12mm (0.47 in) of RHA steel at 100 meters. 

These rounds are not cheap range fodder.  These are battle rounds that are moisture sealed to military specifications for long term storage.  The ammunition is manufactured in Romania, by Uzina Mecanică Sadu, which is an ISO 9001:2008 (Certificate 154-C) and AQAP 2110 certified manufacturing facility.  They have been manufacturing high quality ammunition for 75 years and have been supplying our armed forces and our allies overseas to this day.

These are NOT reloaded ammunition!  These are 62 grain full metal jacket SS109 5.56NATO rounds that are brand new from the factory, boxer primed, and in a beautifully sealed brass case.  If you reload your ammunition, after you fire off these rounds you will find the brass some of the best you can use for reloading.

All postings are immediately deactivated once they are picked up from me, so if you're reading this there is no reason to ask me if it's still available.
