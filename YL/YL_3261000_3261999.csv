I've been carrying it for awhile but its in good shape with no issues. Exceptionally light and easy to carry, which is very nice with summer in full force, you can slip it into your pocket and forget about it. +P rated, tight lockup and good timing, and has a shrouded hammer that keeps it snag free but still allows you to cock it for single action fire. Its had a trigger job to lighten the trigger up a bit and aftermarket scalloped grips for easier use of speedloaders. Comes with its case, keys, and paperwork and I'll include 2 HKS 36 speedloaders. 

I'm picking up a different revolver so I'd like to trade this for a subcompact or pocket sized handgun in 9mm or .40. Primarily looking for a Glock 26 or 27, Ruger SR40c (not interested in the SR9c), newer model Beretta Nano, maybe a S&W M&P9c or 40c, or similar. No Tauruses or calibers aside from 9mm or .40 please. Can include some .38 special or maybe a little cash for the right trade.

Prefer to trade but will sell for $380 if wanting to just buy it.

Nice gun, but it does not fit my needs (I shoot sporting clays) and would rather sell it to some one who wants a good field gun rather than have it modified.

Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration

I have not made the effort to correct the problem because I only use it as a range plinker anyway and besides not locking open after the last round they feed reliably.

The Glock 26 G4 9mm Bodyguard is similar in size and weight to the small frame .38 snubnose revolver. The G26 fires the powerful 9mm cartridge while possessing 11 rounds, that is the combined capacity of a 6-shot Detective Special and a 5-shot Chiefs Special, with much less recoil and more deliverable accuracy at a faster rate of fire. The 4th Generation of the Glock Safe Action Pistol brings revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple back strap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands.
The surface of the frame is the Gen4 Rough Textured frame scientifically designed, real world tested.
Internally, the Gen4 Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodated left or right handed operators"

in the last year / 7,500 miles the following has been done to it.

-new heads
-twin electric cooling fans installed
-new shocks all around
-posi-lock 4X4 system installed
-new brakes all around

other stuff on the truck:

-2 new BFG all terrain TA/KO tires with less than 7,500 miles. The two on the front still have about 50% tread left. mounted on Mickey Thompson classic II rims. 33X12.50R15
-stainless tool box and bed rails.
-Flowmaster 40 series cat back dual exhaust
-K&N intake
-Comes with set of factory size rims and tires
-kicker speakers all around with component system in doors and 3 ways in the rear


truck needs some work though:

-a/c compressor will need to be replaced. I had the system vacuumed and it is solid and holds, but the compressor itself is shot.
-radio cuts in and out, it's the radio, not the truck. I put the radio in a different vehicle to test it out and had the same problem.
-speedometer will cut in and out. I've replaced the wheel speed sensor on the rear axle already. it causes the brake lights to stay illuminated on the dash, and it only works when it wants too. Just a loose wire on the axle that needs to be fixed.
-check engine light comes on and pops a code for the gas cap.

The Knight's Armament Corp. Upper Receiver Extending (URX) Rail system is one of the most trusted tactical free floating rails on the market, given that KAC invented the railed fore-end in the early 90s. Using a proprietary barrel nut, the URX II and III feature a slick design which requires specialized tools for installation(KNAC20495 Barrel Nut Wrench-not included), but yields one of the lowest profile rail profiles available. This rail is the same rail featured on the SR-15 Mod 0, and is well suited for carbine length rifles with low profile gas tubes.  It features a built in front sight which makes this one of the most low profile rail systems on the market. This unit was installed on a project rifle but never completed. NOTE: This fits CARBINE-LENGTH BARRELS ONLY."

The rifle is listed as Used but is in EXCELLENT condition. The rifle comes with 5 30RD Mags, Bayonet, Cleaning Kit, Magazine Pouch, Sling and owner’s manual. We purchased this from a distributor thinking it was factory new, but a tag on the rifle indicated it was used. We believe it is new but may have used parts installed by the importer but this is only speculation. If it is used as stated, it's in great shape!  We Ship Fast! All shipments are fully insured at no extra cost to the buyer. Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. Our semi-auto version features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non-reflective finish. Will not operate with AK 47 mags. Comes with Five 30 rd. mags. Bayonet, Cleaning Kit and Mag Pouch. Barrel: 16.25"" with a 1:9.5 twist, Overall: 27"" (stock folded), 35.5"" (stock extended), The Century VZ2008 Rifle functions much like other semi-automatic rifles in that once a loaded magazine is inserted and the bolt cocked, the operator needs only to pull the trigger and the mechanism fires a round, ejects the empty cartridge case and feeds another fresh round in to the chamber. The barrel is fitted with a slant-style muzzle brake to reduce muzzle flash when firing. Specifications: Caliber: 7.62x39 -- Effective Range: 2624 Feet -- Approximate Muzzle Velocity: 2312 fps -- Practical Rate-of-Fire: 40 shots per minute -- Length with Stock Extended: 35 ½” -- Height without Magazine: 6 ¼” -- Length with Stock Folded: 27” -- Barrel Length: 16 ¼” Inches -- Weight with Empty Magazine: 7 lbs -- Rear Site Adjustable"

The guns I would be most interested in are the beretta px4 storm, glock 19 gen3, or an fnp 9. I am open to all offers so let me know what you have. As far as price I'm looking for a gun for $300-350 so please don't send me offers for your nib gun."

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance.

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

Brand new Sig Sauer P320 Carry 9MM pistol with medium grip featuring SIGLITE night sights with (2) 15 round magazines, holster, and safety lock all in a convenient hard-sided carrying case. 

Introducing the P320, a polymer-framed service pistol designed from the ground up with the input of law enforcement officers. The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. 

Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. 

Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. 

With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.

Brand new Sig Sauer P320 Full 9MM pistol with medium grip featuring SIGLITE night sights with (2) 17 round magazines, holster, and safety lock all in a convenient hard-sided carrying case. 

Introducing the P320, a polymer-framed service pistol designed from the ground up with the input of law enforcement officers. The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. 

Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. 

Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. 

With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.

Desert Eagle XIX 44mag is an amazing firearm, as long as you shoot 240gr brass loaded rounds. also NO cast loaded rounds, due to the polygonal rifling and the gas system can get lead fouling. FMJ or jacketed softpoints are fine. has around 50 rounds through. if i was to take a cash price in the condition its in with low round count would be $1450.

Trades just offer, worst i can say is no. with that in mind be realistic on your trade. im very easy to deal with and will respond politely.

Burchard Behr was granted a Swiss patent on March 4, 1898 on this design. He also received: British patent no. 11998 (in this Behr is described as a Russian citizen living in Bendikon, Switzerland) USA patents 627,966 and 630,478 Swiss patent 16440 German patents no. 98,382 in 2. /11. 1897, No. 102 624 on 5. /3. 1898 and No 104 616 on 23. /11. 1897. The German patents were taken in the name of Miss Valleri Schlapal of Zürich, for unknown reasons. On the cylinder is written that Behr had Belgian patent (no. 13421) and Russian patent. The Pistols were produced buy J.P.Sauer and Sohn from 1899-1914.

New Aimshot LS8300 Green Laser??? The only other one of these I have ever seen sold on GB for 859$ about a month ago. This one was sent to me by a close friend who is a SFO serving in Afghanistan. They are only sold to SOCOM and other Elite SOF on military POs only you can contact Jeff at aimshot in Atlanta to verify. This is the brightest laser you have ever seen day or night at night It looks like something from STAR WARS will definitely get you thrown under the jail. Yes it will light a match. Comes with two tail caps one pressure and one click plus zero tool. This laser makes the rest of them look like they came from Wal Mart! Thanks for looking."
