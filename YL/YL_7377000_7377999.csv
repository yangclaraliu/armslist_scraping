I do not need help in selling so no phishing scams. $400 FIRM & CASH ONLY.  Must have a valid driver license with either a current Nebraska Purchase Permit or a CCW- NO EXCEPTIONS.
The GLOCK 36 packs 6 rounds of .45 Caliber AUTO stopping power in a package that fits the hands of most any user. In the SLIMLINE™ design, GLOCK has incorporated the use of a single stack magazine. The G36 measures only 1.13 in. in width which makes controlling recoil very simple. The G36 is easy-to-use, hard to see, and tough to face.
The GLOCK® G36 is a slim and trim, subcompact semi-auto pistol designed specifically for concealed carry use. The G36 is a carry gun shooting the .45 ACP pistol cartridge, a standard military round with proven knock down power. The GLOCK G36 Slimline has a frame made from the same high-strength polymer as other full-sized GLOCK semi-automatic pistols, though it uses a single stack magazine, greatly reducing the width of the grip. The slide's internal and external dimensions were also modified to reduce the pistol's weight, and the muzzle end of the slide is tapered to aid in quick one-hand re-holstering. The frame has checkering on the front and back straps, providing a non-slip surface, and finger grooves on the front strap and a finger rest on the front of the trigger guard aid in fire control. The Safe-Action trigger system makes shooting in high-stressed situations infallible. The milled steel slide and the barrel are treated with matte black Tenifer finish for extreme resistance to wear and corrosion. The Tenifer treated steel and polymer frame make the pistol impervious to corrosion caused by perspiration and humidity when carried close to the body. All GLOCK pistols fieldstrip easily without the use of tools. The GLOCK G36 Semi-Auto Pistol is a reliable, easy to maintain firearm that's comfortable to carry all day.

I have a new and upgraded AR-15 SPR chambered for 5.56 / .223 with .223 Wylde Barrel that I would like to sell or trade. This rifle is new and has not taken to the range nor fired. Round count on rifle is zero.
Parts:-  Matched PSA Upper and Lower with Palmetto Start Armory (PSA) Logo Rollmarks on both receivers.  (This is a premium build rifle and not an entry level budget 'Daily Deal'.)-  Barrel upgraded to an accurate premium grade 16"" barrel chambered in .223 Wylde with A2 Birdcage Flash Hider-  Mil-spec Carpenter 158 steel, Shot peened, High pressure tested and Mag Particle Inspected Full Auto Capable Bolt Carrier Group-  Magpul SL-K Stock - Mil Spec (in Black)-  Magpul MOE carbine Handguard (in Black)-  Yankee Hill Machine YHM-9395 Folding Front Sight / Gas Block-  Ambidextrous Safety Selector-  Ambidextrous AR-15 Rear Sling Mount Adapter Loop- (2)x Mags- Rifle Case
Not familiar with the .223 Wylde barrel chambering? 
The .223 Wylde is a hybrid .223/5.56 chamber designed by Bill Wylde to yield the accuracy advantages of the match .223 Remington commercial chambering, but without pressure or reliability failures when using high velocity 5.56 NATO spec ammunition.  The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56, but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition because the case dimensions are the same. These facts lead to the .223 Wylde having superior target and varmint accuracy, a compatibility with all .223 and 5.56 NATO ammunitions, and being a top choice for competition shooters.
Is there a compelling reason to switch to a Wylde chamber? Well, the most obvious reason is that you can fire .223 ammo without giving up accuracy and 5.56 ammo without worrying about excess pressure. Sure, you can fire .223 ammo all day from a 5.56 without worrying about pressure problems thanks to generous chamber size, but if you really want to tighten those groups that .2240 freebore diameter helps. In fact, .223 Wylde chambers are known for extreme accuracy, which is better on the whole than what you can expect from a standard 5.56×45 chamber.Buyer / Trade Partner Requirement: Anyone I conduct a transaction with must have valid Florida Driver's license / ID.  I will not sell to anyone under 21. I prefer working individuals that are CWP holders.  Individuals I work with must be willing to fillout paperwork and sign a bill of sale.

I will include 10 En Bloc clips, and if you wish to purchase some ammo I will sell some old surplus Hirtenberger 7.62x51 $10 for a box of 20. Also included is a GI sling, a plastic case, and an instruction manual. The stock is new and carries the CMP cartouche. I haven’t yet applied any oils or stains to it.Here is the CMP’s description:“CMP Special (.308) M1 Garand. This is a completely refurbished rifle consisting of an original M1 Garand Springfield or HRA receiver, new production Criterion barrel, new production American Walnut stock and handguards, and new web sling. Receiver and most other parts are refinished USGI, but some parts may be new manufacture. Receiver may have pitting. A .308 spacer block is installed to prevent the loading of a .30-06 round into the chamber.”Note: the second photo shows the white spacer block.I am only selling because I already have a standard (.30-06) M1 Garand from the CMP and for whatever reason figured the .308 would be a very different rifle. I put 40 rounds through it at Plantation Rifle Range and it’s been sitting ever since.Possible trades (with cash considerations):M1A (Scout model preferred)PTR91 / FN FAL"

I do have more pictures of higher quality availble to show you. This is a 1988 Taurus model 66, 4 inch barrel, 6 shot, 357 magnum revolver. It is a hand cannon. The gun is chambered for 357, so it also shoots 38 special and 38 special +p without any problems. The gun is tight and operationally perfect. I literally picked it up on Friday, September 8th 2017 from the gunsmith where he applied a hot satin blue finish and installed a new firing pin. So the gun is good to go. It is missing the rear sight however as i just haven’t taken the time to get one for it. This gun does come with a Folbus paddle holster as well. This particular gun is very well known as one of Taurus best revolvers. I highly encourage you to look it up for yourself. I am in Maryville and will only meet in Maryville due to transportation complications. Must be willing to sign a bill of sale for both of our records and safety. Only trades I will accept are a sccy cpx-2 in any color except pink, or Ruger lcp with ss slide. Maybe others, but those are the main 2. Thank you."
