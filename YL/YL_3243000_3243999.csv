Del-Ton has a wide array of configurations, from $699 basic models to their top end $1,300 models, but a buyer can choose from their entire line of AR accessories to order the gun exactly how they want it. The version I chose was the 5.56 Nato Sierra 316/MOE, which is a standard 16‚Äù H-Bar barreled Mid-length gas system AR-15 rifle with a Magpul furniture package and a price of $863.



 many name brand manufacturers, Del-ton DTI lists all the specs of the rifle so you know what you are getting and that the rifle is of goodquality and assembled with a high degree of attention to detail.

Specifics of a Dti Del-Ton Mid-Length 5.56 Rifle
When it comes to picking options for a basic AR-15, I caution everyone not to go nuts. For the average shooter, some upgrades are not worth it in a home defense, training, and plinking gun that will never shoot beyond 100 yards.



For example, a 1:9 twist barrel for the 5.56/.223 caliber rifles will deliver virtually the same accuracy at 100 yards as an upgraded 1:7 twist barrel, and unless you have an extreme aversion to weapon cleaning or intend to subject the AR to extended humidity, a chromed barrel is really not needed.

Fit, Finish, Function, Features, and Value
Many folks gauge AR fit by how well the upper and lowers fit together, and my DTI rifle did not offer any wiggle between the receivers. The rest of the parts all fit well and were properly installed with milspec staking of the castle nut and gas key staking.



All the parts were consistently and appropriately phosphated or hard anodized. From a finish perspective, it was nice that the DTI upper and lower anodizing matched perfectly, but I am of the opinion that if all parts are properly finished, then it really should not matter whether the parts match from a cosmetic perspective. Throughout the rifle there were no tool marks or burrs, and the rifle finish was of very high quality.

The Del-Ton AR-15/M4 rifle provides the same functions and feel as any standard AR-15/M4 rifle, so there are no surprises there. After over 500 rounds through the gun, the DTI took the beating and operated perfectly. Throughout the 100 round break-in, the Del-ton seemed a little tight, but never failed to feed, function, or fire. At the range, even a mixed magazine of eight different rounds of 5.56 and .223 ran though the Sierra perfectly.



The trigger was a notch above standard M4 quality and feel, meaning it is not a great target trigger feel, but it was plenty serviceable for a service rifle and was better than most gritty stock AR triggers.

Magazines are one of the most critical and sometimes most problematic accessories affecting reliability. To assure the highest reliability possible, DTI includes a Magpul PMAG magazine, which have become the poster child of durability and reliability. I added one extra mag to to order, but DTI included a note that they were running low on their regular Magpul Pmags and provided me with a windowed version instead as a substitution ‚Äî no complaints from me there.



Feat and ordering
If you are familiar with the standard controls of an AR-15/M4 rifle, then you will have no surprises with the Mil-Spec DTI-15, which has everything in the right place. My perspective on DTI rifles is that you get a bit more for your money and a higher quality rifle than comparable brand name rifles.

With one phone call, they walked me through my wish list and took my credit card info. You can order any firearms parts from any business, including DTI, and have them shipped directly to your home, as long as the part is not a serial numbered FFL registered part.

If it is a serialized FFL registered receiver or complete rifle in my case, the process is still simple. Order what you want just as normal, but have your local gun dealer fax over their FFL information to Del-Ton. After your rifle is shipped from DTI to your gun dealer, your FFL dealer will call to let me know your receiver or rifle is in and ready to pick up. Usually your local dealer will charge $10-$25 for the FFL paperwork. In my case, the whole process was quick and painless, and I had a made to order gun in my hands in just under three weeks.



Like many companies, DTI now offers a customer rewards program which accrues points with each purchase. Add them up over time, and you can get free stuff by buying stuff, which is pretty cool. I now have a little over 900 points that I can use toward my next purchase.

Accuracy Testing
Although every barrel has its own unique accuracy, my general observation has been that 1:7 twist barrels shoot tighter groups with heavier bullets, and standard 1:9 twist barrels shoot tighter groups with lighter bullets. This was certainly the case with the DTI-15 with my optional heavy 1:7 twist barrel.

I used my Burris Fullfield II 2-14 scope for testing and was able to test a variety of rounds, ranging from handloads to inexpensive and high end factory loaded ammunition.

100-yard average groups

HORNADY TAP URBAN 55GR = 1.4‚Äù
WOLF FMJ 62GR = 1.3‚Äù
WINCHESTER FMJ 55GR = 1.8‚Äù
FEDERAL MATCH 69GR = .82‚Äù
HANDLOADS HORNADY AMAX 75GR = 1.1‚Ä≥
I was very happy overall with the accuracy of the Del-Ton DTI-15, but I caution everyone to buy this type of gun based more on reliability vs. accuracy. I have experienced zero malfunctions from the rifle in well over 500 rounds and only two quick clean and lube jobs. Almost any quality AR will shoot sub-1‚Äù groups at 100 yards. It is just a matter of figuring out the ammunition it likes best, and from my experience, no two rifle barrels are ever the same.

With more realistic rifle optics of a Trijicon 1-4X scope and Eotech 912, the groups obviously opened up without the higher magnification. With care, the Trijicon 1-4X scope nearly matched the accuracy of my higher magnification Burris scope, but I was surprised to find that careful bench shooting with the EOtech sight would still deliver sub-2‚Äù groups with almost any load, even with limited magnification.

Final Thoughts
The Del-Ton DTI-15 is a great rifle at a low price, and from my perspective it sacrifices nothing other than a brand name. The rifle shot well, I had a good customer service and ordering experience, it has a lifetime warranty, and it‚Äôs made with 100% made-in-America parts by people right here is the good old USA.

Introduction

The Spike‚Äôs Tactical billet upper-Gen II receiver is not just another different cosmetic alternative to forged upper receivers but it‚Äôs actually designed with functional upgrades that aren‚Äôt available on other billet upper receivers!

We machine this bad boy out of 7075 billet Aluminum and finish it in a durable Type III Hardcoat Anodized finish. Of course, we cut the M4 feed ramps before the Anodizing process to avoid reliability issues down the road. We also flared the side walls of the receiver to eliminate accidental bolt release problems and we also machined the upper receiver in a way that lets you use the popular Magpul BAD lever or other aftermarket bolt catch levers which most other billet upper receivers don‚Äôt let you do. Because of our beefier design, it allows for less flex than forged upper receivers.

We also play nice here at Spike‚Äôs Tactical and because of that, we machined our billet upper receiver to accept most aftermarket rail systems as well as pre-install the forward assist and the ejection port door. Just like how our billet lower receiver utilizes set screws to retain everything in place, the forward assist is held in place with a set screw for easy disassembly if you ever need to in the life of this upper receiver.

Our billet upper receiver matches our billet lower perfectly, but it also works great with standard forged lowers so it‚Äôs fully up to you on which receiver you want to use.

Get one today and make your next build the envy of everyone at the range!

Equipped with Tru-Dot Day/Night sights. No thumb safety.

It will also include one 10+1 round mag, one 12+1 round mag, and a Boyt 10"" canvas handgun case.

I purchased the gun from a local dealer about 2 years ago. I have only put about 200 rounds through it.

Soft recoil. Pretty smooth trigger pull. I've never tested it, but I believe it to be 8 - 10 lbs. The grip is a bit longer than comparable compacts (which was the biggest reason I chose it over several other options in the first place). Good accuracy within 30 feet.

I was told by the dealer that it previously belonged to a US Marshall officer.

Straight from the pages of history comes the new Citadel M-1 carbine. Built to the exact speciÔ¨Åcations of the G.I. model used by U.S. infantrymen in both WWII theaters of battle and in Korea, this reproduction riÔ¨Çe comes to you chambered in the fun and economical .22 LR cartridge. Used by officers as well as tankers, drivers, artillery crews, mortar crews and other personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand riÔ¨Çe, the M-1 carbine weighed only 4.5 to 4.75 pounds. The Citadel M-1, made by Chiappa in Italy, weighs in at 4.8 lbs. ‚Äì nearly the exact weight of the original. Barrel length and OAL are also the same as the ‚ÄúUnited States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1‚Äù, its official military designation.

Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration

Impossible to find, I had to wait 6 months for Four Seasons to order one for me. 

 I didn't shoot it much, maybe a few boxes of ammo. I will include a dozen or so moon clips as well. Obviously comes with the box and everything that came from the factory new. I am also including a Hogue monogrip which I found much more comfortable than the stock wood grips. 

What is the difference between this and the Jerry Miculek signature model? Well, it has a polished finish, not that awful bead blasted finish that gets terrible burn marks on the cylinder after a few rounds. The cylinder is shorter and the barrel is slightly longer so the bullet spends less time unsupported which leads to better accuracy. It gets a full Performance Center treatment including a trigger job and overtravel stop. It also has black finished controls for a nice contrast. 

We will split the transfer fee at Blue Northern in Ayer, Precision Point in Woburn or Four Seasons in Woburn. I do not have any FA-10 transfers available.

4-16x30mm Millett illuminated reticle scope with Warne mounts and receiver rail. You can count the moon's pimples with that scope. Got a better or smaller scope in mind? I also have a second Gamestalker one piece mount for a 1"" scope.
The factory trigger has been professionally tuned, and breaks at 3.5 lbs, doesn't have even a hit of-creep, or over travel. It's as crisp as a cold apple.
