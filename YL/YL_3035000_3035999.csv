Troy Industries 12"" MRF Drop-In Battle Rail 2-Piece Quad Rail Handguard AR-15 Rifle Length- (mounted but never used)

The Troy Industries MRF Drop-In Battle Rail Handguard is a 2-piece, non-free floating upgrade that installs in seconds to replace an AR-15's standard polymer handguards. The MRF drop-in quad rail utilizes Troy Industries' patented clamping design for a rock solid installation, making use of the rifle's existing barrel nut, delta ring assembly, front sight base and round handguard end cap. Machined from 6061 hardened aluminum and given a mil-spec anodized finish for durability, the MRF provides true M1913 Picatinny rails at the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-o'clock positions for the mounting of tactical accessories. For greater versatility, quick detach sling swivel sockets are incorporated into the 3-o'clock and 9-o'clock rails for easy sling attachment. Made in the USA.

A perfect gift for Mother's Day! This very solid little pocket pistol looks gorgeous and functions perfectly. Check out the pics and email with questions. If you have a pistol packin' mama in your house she will surely love this little sweetie. Or buy it for your own vest pocket to protect you on your riverboat gambling runs. The Spanish were known for making high quality pistols, especially in peacetime when there weren't a hundred gunsmiths rushing out military orders for one of the WW armies of Europe and especially guns made in the Eibar region, and this little semi is a fine example of both. The nickel plating is in excellent condition and the slide and mag feed work like new. The proof contains the code letter D indicating this gun was made in 1931. It is a nice collectible pistol that will only go up in value while the dollar depreciates and Wall Street steals your savings.

This is a C&R gun and I honor C&R licenses."

All these items came from AIRSOFT replica guns and should not be used on firearms! Perfect for airsoft and airgun use. Screen mask won't fog up and allows maximum ventilation. Also could be used for chainsaw/arborist work. 

Mock supressor is a Tanio Koba custom airsoft ""silencer"" for airsoft M11 sub machine gun.  It is full aluminum and even has a foam and spring ""baffle"" system to ""silence"" the airsoft pistol even further although it is mostly used to disguise an extended inner barrel. Absolutely does not suppress or silence real firearms. Came off an old KSC M11 but will probably fit other brands. If you are into airsoft M11, check out my m11/submachine gun shoulder holster also on armslist. 

AR/m16 Carry handle and mounted scope came off a ISC metal airsoft rifle it is a 4x20 affair.

AK/RPK scope mount came from a custom metal RPK project, G3 mount is all metal from a custom G3
 Lastly there is a 3/8 dovetail to picatinny adapter for airguns.

This is ""the pistol"" to carry in harm's way! Its features include our new fully machined one piece mainspring housing and magwell, similar to the one featured on our Falcon, but with a lanyard loop cutout to ensure that you and it will never become separated. It has a ball cut radius under the cocking serrations and has a serrated slide top. The slide stop is cut flush with the frame. The slide stop hole on the right side of the frame has been chamfered to make extraction of the slide stop easy, while preventing it from accidentally being backed out."

I originally purchased this rifle when it was put together on a different plastic stock. I purchased it for 400. I installed a bullpup stock that I bought just over 200 and added a buffer recoil pad (to reduce recoil). The barrel still has a lot of life left in it. Shoots very accurately and flawlessly. 

The upgraded bullpup stock shortens the SKS about 5-6 inches from the previous length. I originally built this because I enjoy learning the different weapon platforms and I thought this would be a great shooter. Absolutely no surprises, this rifle shoots beautifully. The few times that I took it to the range, there is always a small audience behind me trying to figure out what I'm shooting. If you have friends or family that shoots, or you just want to show someone up that is different from what everyone else has, then this is the rifle for you. Or if you just like to have fun and blast away with inexpensive steel ammo, then this is also for you.

 Replacement parts for the Norinco are cheap and are plentiful because of U.S. companies making compatible parts between all of the SKS platforms for all the different countries who manufacture it. The overall recoil is very manageable, if you wanted to take someone with a small frame to range they would have a blast without any concerns of injury.

 I decided to charge 800 because although it cost me about a 100 more than what I am asking for, I figure that whoever wants to buy it will have to pay for the transfer and background check fee. So I cut the price down from 900 to 800 to help cover the cost of those transaction fees at whichever local gun shop we commit our transaction.

What is in this packaged deal?

1 Norinco SKS with a custom bullpup stock

800 rounds of ammunition (40 rounds of PDX1 Defender, 40 rounds of winchester white box brass, and the rest of the ammo is Tulammo steel cased)

5 20 round magazines 
3 30 round magazines
2 40 round magazines
(all magazines are reliable)

20 stripper clips (for quick ammo loading)

1 steel ammo can with 7.62 markings.

NOTE: Magazines will be disassembled and provided to purchaser as parts kits, exactly how the gun shops in Colorado sell the magazines. This rifle is 922r compliant the entire stock kit is made in USA as well as the magazines and buffer pad that I installed.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

This is a brand new ,unfired gun still in the case with every single thing Kimber sent along.
It went straight from the gun dealer to my safe, and has only been out for me to install the Crimson Trace Master Series Laser grips on it. I HAVE NEVER fired this weapon.
I bought it because I loved the comfort of the bobtail grips it has, you will too!
I put it away as a present to myself and left it in the safe.
I came across another one that had been fired when I was trading guns with a man I know and I bought it to actually shoot. I left the new one in the safe and I shot it instead.
I will include the 4 new in package Chip McCormick mags as well with the gun, and laser grips. I have more in it than I'm OFFERING IT FOR, and I will consider nice trades of other firearms. Not interested in junk, or broken guns, but I will certainly trade for lower value guns, whether one or multiples. I'm a gun hobbyist, so shoot me some pics of your stuff and lets see what we can come up with as far as a deal goes. Please be realistic and fair and I will be too. 
If you haven't shot a 45 with bobtail grips and frame, you are welcome to come shoot my pre -fired TWIN to this gun at my place and see how the NEW one will shoot and feel while firing. Where else can you do that ? 
You can always email me, but texts are best, or call my cell phone.
I am available til 9pm for calls, or texts anytime are okay.
I can travel some to meet for the right deal, BUT not going to go in a direction too far away from my usual paths. I will work with you within reason.

I typically make a walleye/bass jig 1/4 oz and a Pan fish/trout jig 1/32 oz I use bass proshop eagle claw jigs. I use Eagle claw treble hooks sz 8 and sz 4, but again I will do a custom order for even 1 treble hook. EXCEPTION if you want a gamakatsu hook or another super expensive hook or jig the price will go up and I will want the payment first. 

Prices pretty simple any size any style 2$ each or 3 for 5$ I will ship just add .25c per jig and I will ship as soon as payment clears. I prefer post office money orders. reply by email or text or call

I will also meet at the French Island Kwick trip, The Kwick trip by Hardees, north side shopko and the landings in that area at my convenience, I cant be running all over at the drop of a hat for 2$ but I don't mind meeting up.

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, a Magpul MBUS backup sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

Gun is less than a year old and only been fired 3 seperate times. Gun was never fired before conversion.  Brand new pre-conversion. Still have all the old parts and springs

This gun originally was a remington 870. I used the ""Bullpup unlimited"" shotgun conversion kit. If you're interested look up the YouTube video on it. Looks absolutely awesome and turns heads at the range. Reliability of the remington 870 with the benefits of a tactical shotty. I have a very bright flashlight attached and a laser sight for quick no scopes. Reflex red dot sight on top with different crosshair options as well as red or green option. Also added an extended mag tube to hold two extra shells

Awesome gun and I hate to part ways with it but I have a feeling I'll be shooting some cool stuff where I'm headed.

Some info about the PTR91KF --- I bought it brand new in 2010 or 2011, I can't remember which... It has the Thompson Center Match Bull barrel, that PTR used to issue with their rifles. The gun has way less than 500 rounds through it (.308 is spendy). Overall, the gun is in excellent shape. Just google PTR91KF to get an idea of what it looks like.

Now, for what i'm looking for: I want an FAL. Doesn't matter who makes it, what model it is, or anything like that."

More facts :: Built around Beretta's latest PX4 modular technology, the Beretta PX4 Storm .40 S&W Full Size Pistol delivers large frame firepower that can be customized for different shooters. Utilizing Beretta's strongest pistol action, the PX4 Storm's unique rotating barrel and locking system reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise by releasing recoil energy radially. The gun's chrome-lined barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance. Beretta keeps the PX4 Storm light with a corrosion resistant, fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame that includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating provides superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. White 3-dot sights provide quick acquisition of the target."

I hand picked it myself for having 95% original H&R parts, a butter smooth action, the original rack # on the stock, and a shiny bore in excellent condition. I don't have a ton of options in mind to trade for, but I might like a 1911 of some sort (prefer RIA, no Kimber). I am not interested in anything chambered in .40, no hunting firearms, no archery/BP, and no cheap brands (HP, Taurus, ring of fire handguns, etc). Other than that, feel free to shoot me an offer. It will come with 3 clips and the instruction manual. You can text me at 865-7six6-7555 for the fastest response. PLEASE NO EMAILS! Thanks and God bless!"

Wrapped in a smaller package, at 4.5 ounces, this ACOG is perfect for fast-moving tactical teams operating in close quarters or for speed-oriented competition venues. This very compact model provides weapons like the M16/M4 with excellent fire control capability. Targets are easier and quicker to acquire through the 1.5x16 models because of the larger field of view (7.4 degrees) and eye-friendly design."
