Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesnt have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season.

However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season.

This German made revolver is sufficiently small to be stowed just about anywhere, and would make a great pistol to teach the very young or small shooters to shoot an actual firearm. Gun is very pleasant shooting enough that you or your little shooters will wish you’d brought more ammo to the range.
PLEASE note that this revolver is only designed to shoot .22 short.
PLEASE do not attempt to use it to shoot .22 long or .22 long rifle (also known as .22LR).
Gun only. No packaging or original printed materials included.
Great as-is, and would make a light and nicely sized purse or glove box gun. [In the event of a home defense situation, empty your .45 but have this swinging in a sock, just in case the perp gets up despite having 7 or 8 holes!]
$120 or first reasonable sounding offer.
No waiting, No sales tax, No shipping charges.
Buyer will need to quickly show me a valid TX Driver’s License or TX CHL, and sign a simple Bill of Sale indicating only that you showed me your current DL and or CHL.  -> Nothing besides your name and the gun info will be on it.
Gun was transferred through an FFL, meaning I cleared the NICS, making both me and the gun clean.
Bill of Sale will prove you legally own it and protects you henceforth.

For sale: one USED FEG Model APMBP Semiautomatic Pistol in .32ACP (7.62mm). Blued steel slide. You decide the condition.I am not the original owner.
A unique feature of this Hungarian pistol is that the frame is made of an Aluminum-Titanium alloy, making it not just lightweight but extremely durable. For its time and even now, this is a highly advanced construction. According to FEG enthusiasts and elsewhere online in my research of this pistol prior to buying it, its design actually improved upon some of the features of the gun that it is based upon: the venerable Walther PP.
Of historical note, this particular gun’s most recent service was with the Mishteret Y’Israel, the Israeli Civilian Police. As such, it was likely regularly used and properly maintained.
Gun is very accurate, and pleasant shooting enough that you or the little lady will wish you’d brought more ammo to the range.
Gun and one 7-round magazine only. No packaging or original printed materials included.
Great as-is, and would make a light and nicely sized purse or glove box gun.
$230 or first reasonable sounding offer. Will consider ammo plus cash.[ I know that these and the Makarov type pistols used to go for $99 all day long, but those days are gone, and I myself missed out.Their magazines are now scarce, and range from $50-70 on eBay and elsewhere.If you've priced the gun and mags on the main online sites recently, you know what I mean. :)If you happen to have mags for this already, I'd be happy to sell just the gun at a lower price. ]

No FFL transfer fees.________________________________________________________________________________Buyer will need to quickly show me a valid TX Driver’s License and CHLand sign a simple Bill of Sale.-> Nothing besides our names and the gun info will be on it.I’d be more than happy to send you a copy so you can see what mine looks like.
Gun was transferred through an FFL, meaning I cleared the NICS, making both me and the gun clean.

Riot/Home Defense  Takedown 19"" barrel.  John Moses Browning design. Pump action. Tube magazine. External hammer.  19' takedown barrel. Checkered steel buttplate. No trigger disconnector so this shotgun IS capable of 'slam fire'. A feature that was and still is very popular with military and law enforcement. Slam fire means it is not nessesary to release the trigger to reset after firing. Just hold the trigger down and continue to pump the action, it will fire every time the action is pumped. Very useful if you are outnumbered in trench warfare, riots or protecting your family from home invasion. This shotgun is also popular with Cowboy Action Shooters. Serial number 816___. All numbers matching. Manufactured in 1931. The 19"" barrel is marked 'MOD' for the choke, which leads me to believe it is not the original length. Very nice condition for age. Smooth shiny bore.  Beautiful patina. Nicely checkered stock. A joy to shoot, like any John Browning gun.$650.00 obo  NPHX  602-405-one758  Private sale. Legal citizens only.

Research Beretta J92M9A3M for exact features. Based on military feedback, Beretta has designed another member of the M9 family, the M9A3 9mm pistol. The M9A3 delivers all of the critical features that today's combat professionals require in demanding environments. The redesigned pistol features a reduced-circumference grip, universal slide design with a universal sadfety decocker , an extended threaded barrel, a beveled magazine well, oversize mag-release button, a 3-slot Picatinny rail, front and back strap checkering, reduced circumference grip with thin grip panels as well as a wrap-around backstrap grip (included, not installed), and 3- sand-resistant magazine for maximum firepower. The M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law enforcement and consumers demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to perform exceptionally in any tactical or home defense situation. Proudly made in the U.S.A. M9A3: Evolution of the Tactical-Pistol Concept With the M9A3 semiauto pistol, Beretta has created a coming-together of all the tactical and functional features that today’s combat professionals may require.   From Vertec-style thin grip to universal slide design, from a beveled magazine well to oversize mag-release button, from a 3-slot built-in Picatinny rail to high-capacity capability for maximum firepower, the M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law-enforcement and VIP-protection professionals demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition.   Vertec-Style Thin Grip for Instinctive Pointability The Vertec-style vertical grip of the M9A3 offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent.   Versatility and easy Accessorizationr Easy to Use and Maintain The M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds, and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over.

DISCREETLY IMPORT MARKED ON FRAME. The Colt Python is a .357 Magnum caliber revolver formerly manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut. It is sometimes referred to as a ""Combat Magnum"". It was first introduced in 1955, the same year as Smith & Wesson's M29 .44 Magnum. Now discontinued, the Colt Python targeted the premium revolver market segment. Some firearm collectors and writers such as Jeff Cooper, Ian V. Hogg, Chuck Hawks, Leroy Thompson, Scott Wolber, Renee Smeets and Martin Dougherty have described the Python as the finest production revolver ever made. The Colt Python was first introduced in 1955 as Colt's top-of-the-line model and was originally intended to be a large-frame 38 Special target revolver. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra metal. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. Originally, Colt manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up for the duration of the hammer strike. Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. The gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity. Starting in the 1970s each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser and was the first mass-produced revolver to do so. In October 1999, Colt Manufacturing Co. announced the termination of its production of Python revolvers. The Colt Custom Gun Shop continued making a limited number of Pythons on special order until 2005, when even this limited production was terminated."
