This gun is a dream to shoot, very accurate and is a very soft shooting 9mm. Please do some research on the price of these custom glocks, they are not cheap and you pay for the quality and customer service of Agency Arms. I am looking for custom glock 19s, Ar15s, cash, ar10s, I'm open to a lot of trades, trades plus cash aswell. My number is 9O4-365-372O. My cash price is 1250 which is a incredible cash price, obviously trade value will be higher."

But to find this rifle, in this condition, is very unique and very one of a kind. Before K-var ran out of stock on this rifle, they were retailing for roughly 2k. Before the election they were even more.I will pay for shipping on my end for the agreed price I have posted to a legal state (sorry lib ran states, you voted those people in and now you face the consequences) legal buyer (ccw/non-felon) ffl receiver once all funds have cleared my bank. I'll include an olive Russian millitary sling at no additional cost. If you purchase locally I will subtract what I budgeted for shipping. Note if you are local I will ask for Nevada id and ccw. Do not waste my time, and yours for that matter, if you do not meet the elegibility requirements. To liquidate this rifle is not an urgency for me. I've had this for a while and if I do not receive what I want for it, I can always put it back in my safe for down the road. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me thru email and I will respond as soon as possible. Shipping is available, but you have to meet my requirements as listed above. Armslist only allows you to post three pictures. I have more I can forward if requested.Trades??? The only trades I would be interested in would be a black 20"" LWRC 308 or a black Scar 17 with cash of course added on my end. Thank you for your time.

Comes with Crossbow, 3 Dot Red Dot Sight, Quiver, Bolts, Flashlight/Laser, Strap, Bipod, Cocking Rope. Nothing wrong with it shoots perfectly.Text (615) 861-0863Info from barnett:One of the most important things to remember when introducing someone to the world of crossbows is having a bow that fits the person well. There are many crossbows that claim to be for the youth shooter, but few fill the gap between youth and adult hunter. The Recruit Compound is specifically designed to fit the smaller framed hunter and offers enough adjustment to grow with that hunter. The compact Recruit Compound is the perfect size for youth and women, making it easy to handle while still having enough speed for the hunt. At 300 fps,130 lb draw, and 80 ft lbs of KE, this bow can take down any game the hunter would like to peruse. Adjustable cheek piece and butt stock gives the shooter the option to keep the bow as they grow and easily make any adjustments needed. The crank cocking device can easily be installed so anyone can use this bow. We didn't want to leave safety to chance either, so we decided to put the same 5-1 safety system in this bow with the same trigger system as our standard Barnett bows."
