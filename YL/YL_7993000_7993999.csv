The Tusk’s handle is precision machined from two slabs of solid titanium. One end houses a Plain Edged blade ground from LC 200 N steel—a nitrogen-alloyed tool steel that offers extreme toughness and superior corrosion resistance—and locks open via a sturdy Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L.) mechanism."

The same type of anti-seize, high temperature, water resistant, no run, copper grease found in a brand new Glock off the assembly line. When you buy a new Glock you are NOT suppose to clean off the copper grease, you are suppose to let it ware off over time by itself. This special grease serves two very important purposes. <br>The first reason is it works as a smoothing agent as you break it in your gun. Copper is a much softer metal than steel and the grease is a lot thicker than basic gun grease, these two factors give more protection than standard gun grease for parts with metal on metal contact that take lots of abuse. <br>The second reason Glock applies this is because when they make a new gun there is no way to know how long it may sit on the shelf before it is sold. This grease is ideal for long term storage because will not run like typical gun grease or gun oil. This grease can also be used in other firearms in place of regular gun grease or to pack in your some of your spring to keep moisture from rusting them up. This can also be used in other firearms as well. Just a dab of this at a time because a little of this copper grease goes a long way. Place a small drop on the rails and some other metal on metal contact areas or anywhere else you would use traditional gun grease.<br><br><br>Keywords: 9mm, 9 mm, 9MM, 9 MM, luger, 9x19, 9 x 19, 10mm 10 MM, .40 Cal, 40 cal, 40 S&W, .40 S&W, .357 sig, 357 sig, 357sig, .357sig, .45 auto, 45 cal, .45 ACP, 10rd, 10 rd, 10 round, magazine, magazines, mag, clip, G17, G 17, Glock 17, factory, OEM, Austria, polymer, Gen3, Gen4, Gen 3, Gen 4, Gen-3, Gen-4, Body armor, bullet proof vest, steel plate, Ceramic plates, Kevlar, Tactical Vest, MOLLE, Plate Carrier, flak jacket, ammunition, brass case, steel case, rounds, round, rd, rds, 223, 556, 55gr .223 cal, caliber, 5.56 mm, AR15, AR-15, AR, 15, M4, M-4, M16, M-16, , 9mm, 9 mm, 12 gauge, Saiga, SKS, AK47, AK-47, AK 47, 9x19, 9 x 19, .357, Sig, 40 , .40, S&W, 45 Cal .45 Auto, Mini 14, AK, AK-47, AK-47, AK 47, Tactical, sporter, Tapco, SKS, Carbine, Bulk, Ammo Can, Oath Keepers, Militia, Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, CSPOA, stockpile, Prepper, preppers, WROL, SHTF, JIC, teotwawki, Survivalist, hoard, hoarding, bunker, in the woods, Center Fire, Rifle Cartages, Full metal Jacket, FMJ, case, 20rds, 20rd, Box, Nato, Bushmaster, Colt, DPMS, Stag Arms, Windham, Rock River, 20, 30rds, 30rd, American Eagle Tactical, PMC, Lake City, Tula, Federal, Independence, Monarch, Winchester, Remington UMC, Daniel Defense"

Dual momentary pressure switches and constant toggle on the side body.https://www.surefire.com/illumination/weaponlights/handgun/xc1-led-weaponlight.htmlIdentical to the current generation, except the output lasts for an hour/hour and a half and put out 200 lumens, all from a single AAA. No paying $2/3 for a single CR123, this light uses commonly available AAAs - I've even seen Lithium AAAs at gas stations. Battery change is easy and doesn't require removing the light from the gun. The beamshot is honestly incredible for the bezel size and depth - perfect edge to edge, even lighting and flawless distribution - no 'hotspot' or dark zones. Perfect for a house gun, the spill is fantastic and can light a typical interior room without fading out.Fits standard 1913 rails, and sits flush beneath a Glock 19, Sig P229, HK VP, Springfield XD, Compact 1911s, and M&P fullsize perfectly without extending past the muzzle. Numerous images online, just search your gun's name and ""Surefire XC1"". Very popular for holster makers, so no issue paying extra for a custom one-off holster. If you're looking for a good hoster for a M&P fullsize + XC1, PM me.I'll accept trades for new/good condition Griffin Offset BUIS/Magpul MBUS PRO Offset BUIS.

Stevens Arms & Tool Company's entry into the center fire lever arena. Although some sources claim that there were 26,000 of these guns made, it is more likely that only about 5,000 were made. It was produced (or at least cataloged) from 1911 through 1917 and serialized with at least one other Stevens gun during that period (which accounts for the high production number). It is a unique design, capturing the best features of its competitor’s guns (Winchester and Marlin) at the time. It was tapped on the top of the receiver for a scope or target sight, ejects to the right and is very esthetically pleasing with its 22"" barrel and 2/3 magazine. Apparently sales did not go well which accounts for the relative scarcity of these rifles. This gun is in excellent condition for its age. It is chambered for the 35 Remington cartridge. The metal is in exceptional condition with the bluing better than 85% remaining on the receiver and barrel. The magazine tube and forend cap show thinning blue as does the bottom of the receiver from carrying. Overall, the gun is in great condition for its age. There is no box or original paperwork with this gun."
