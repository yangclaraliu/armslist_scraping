This rifle was made in 1939 at the Koishikawa Arsenal in Japan. It is a Pacific Theatre battlefield captured rifle. This is fact. The rifle has a chrysanthemum symbol on the barrel breach that indicates that rifle belonged to the emperor as did all Japanese arms. All rifles surrendered by captured soldiers were defaced on this symbol. It was their way of not letting the emporers symbol be captured. This rifle is intact and was picked up off battlefield or from deceased soldier. Its rare and adds a premium to these rifles. This rifles bolt, breach, receiver, and barrel are in working order and can be shot. They are extremely aqccurate. It has never been shot since bring back from WW2. When cleaning, I took the butstock plate loose and sand fell out! I have it and will be included. It has original cleaning rod and all numbers matching gun. I knew the man that owned this rifle. His grandson sold it to me after his passing 5 years ago. The stock is not cracked. They were made in 2 pieces and dovetailed together from cherry wood. Has cool battle scars/dings in Stock. Overall very clean and in guarenteed working condition. You could be the first to shoot this weapon from the war. It is 80 years old this year. I have researched this rifle for weeks and will provide all research papers with it and sources. Here's your chance to own a historical rifle from the Axis side.

No trades, they don't seem to work for me. Cash only, Buyer pays ffl transfer fees.Thanks for lookingMore Info:The P220 Legion is an enhanced version of the gun that started it all for modern day SIG. Finished in a proprietary Legion gray coating and featuring custom G-10 grips with a Legion medallion, the P220 Legion is improved in nearly every way. The stainless-steel slide sports SIG SAUER Electro-Optics X-RAY high visibility day/night sights as well as front cocking serrations that provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm or conducting press checks.The P220 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip and a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. The P220 Legion also features low-profile decocking and slide-catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most. The P220 Legion ships with three 8-round magazines."

Rarely used safe queen. I’m asking $6,000 OBO. Email me for pictures, questions, or if you’d like to see it. Cash or certified check only. Below is a description of the rifle and its history. Knight's Armament Company SR-25 Match Rifle, chambered in 7.62NATO. This rifle was manufactured before the '94 ban. This rifle has been fired less than 200 rounds. It is everything you want it to be. The SR-25 (Stoner Rifle-25) is a designated marksman rifle designed by Eugene Stoner and manufactured by Knight's Armament Company. The SR-25 uses a rotating bolt and a direct impingement gas system. It is loosely based on Stoner's AR-10, rebuilt in its original 7.62×51mm NATO caliber. Up to 60% of parts of the SR-25 are interchangeable with the AR-15 and M16—everything but the upper and lower receivers, the hammer, the barrel assembly and the bolt carrier group. SR-25 barrels were originally manufactured by Remington Arms with its 5R (5 grooves, right twist) rifling, with twist 1:11.25 (1 complete turn in 11.25 inches or 286 millimetres). The heavy 24 in (610 mm) barrel is free-floating, so handguards are attached to the front of the receiver and do not touch the barrel. First military purchase was spearheaded by the U.S. Navy in the early 1990s; the first operational deployment and use of the SR-25 sniper rifle was with U.S. Navy SEAL snipers supporting operations in Somalia in 1993. The rifle is 100% original parts. Item is used but in excellent condition."

Looking for a buyer who will love this firearm like I have. If it means anything, this was my personal firearm that traveled with me through out my military career. It has been to various posts both domestic and abroad. Go Army!

2 BARRELS: (1) Heinie 45 ACP Drop In Compensator with 5.5” Stainless Steel Barrel and Bushing. (2) 5” Barrel with custom fitted bushing and polished throat.
+ Extended magazine release+ Extended ambidextrous safety+ Light-weight trigger+ Wilson Combat matching hammer and sear+ Wilson Combat ""Group-Gripper"" (google it!)+ Beavertail+ Beveled magazine well w/ flat mainspring housing+ Checkered front strap+ Checkered trigger guard+ Adjustable sights with FAT front sight+ Flared ejection port+ Front serrations+ Brand new Cerakote+ Some original parts (for parts that were replaced). If there in the “parts” picture, they are yours with the sale.+ SUPER CRISP trigger** It’s not a ""light"" trigger (it’s about 5 lbs), it’s just that the trigger has virtually ZERO play before or after hammer activation. Combined with the Wilson matching hammer/sear, this is my most prized customization. Pulling the trigger is like breaking a thin rod of glass. When the trigger moves the hammer falls; and when the hammer falls the trigger stops moving. Reset is tactile and audible. Must feel!
AS IS:
The magazine well is scratched from use on the underside. See pictures.
Be warned: I have removed the Series 80 drop safety mechanism. This interfered with how I wanted to tune the trigger. I still have the plunger, but the upper and lower sear levers are gone. You can replace these for a few bucks and get the safety working again if you wanted…but definitely not worth the sacrifice in the trigger feel, IMHO. Up to you, of course, if you buy.
The rear sight adjustment screw gets loose sometimes. Seems to be holding in there for now, but it has come loose before.
There, of course, may be other issues I’m not aware of, and I take no responsibility for issues not listed here. Gun is sold “as is.”"

Features include a 11.5 inch chrome lined, 5.56mm NATO barrel that is manufactured to military specifications. Attached to the muzzle is the Knight's Armament 3 prong flash hider. New on the Mod 2 is a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil. The gas block no longer uses taper pins or set screws but is held on by a castle nut which allows for an air tight seal. Keeping with the air tight theme, the unique gas tube uses a compression fitting where it meets the gas block. This is very similar to what is used in automotive hydraulic brake lines. With these two features you won't have to worry about gas system leakage which can cause malfunctions, especially with lower powered ammo. On the opposite end of the barrel is Knight's Armament's proven E3 round-lug bolt which both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. The bolt is desigend to outlive the barrel. The E3 bolt rides in a full auto carrier. Surrounding the barrel is Knight's new URX 4 keymod handguard, 10.75 inches in length. The extended length handguard allows for a forward grip which makes moving from target to target much faster. The keymod handguard will accept all standard keymod accessories such as hand stops, rail covers, light mounts or picatinny rail sections. One 5 slot picatinny keymod rail section is supplied with the rifle. The URX 4 handguard design increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case. *NFA rules apply, must ship to an FFL dealer with an SOT. Included:  Knight's Armament SR-15 E3 CQB Rifle (7) Keymod rail panels, black GI aluminum 30 round magazine with Knight's Armament follower (where legal) 5 slot picatinny keymod rail section Knight's Armament logoed padded hard case (2) KAC QD sling swivels Magwell block with lock Owner's manual     Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: Knight's Armament SR-15 E3 CQB Mod 2 Gun, 11.5"""

It boasts a more forgiving sharpness and eye clarity for positioning fore and aft, and left and right. Using modern alloys and machining techniques the weight has been reduced by 20%-25% without affecting durability or optical performance. Most scopes have three or four potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area. The Fullfield II has but two. These leak paths are sealed with special quad seals rather than low-tech O-rings. To change magnification, turn the entire eyepiece, which is now integral to the power ring. A European-style adjustable eyepiece is easy to use and requires no locking mechanism. Burris has moved the adjustment system rearward to better accommodates mounting situations. Also, the eyepiece is shorter, allowing even more mounting flexibility. The Fullfield II has also improved long-range marksmanship. The lower part of the crosshair has ballistic lines that compensate for bullet drop from 100 yards to 500 yards for many common hunting cartridges-itâ€™s called the Ballistic Plex. This is an ultra-bright varmint/target scope or for long-range big game hunting. -Power: 6.5X-20X -50mm Clear Objective Diameter -Reticle: Ballistic Mil-Dot -Color: Matte -Field of View 100 Yards: 17 feet (Low) 6 feet (High) -Exit Pupil: 7.2mm (Low) 2.6mm (High) -Click Adjustment Value 100 Yards: .25 inches -Max Adjustment 100 Yards: 30 inches -Weight: 19 ounces -Length: 14.5 inches -1â€³ Tube"

Features include a 16 inch chrome lined, 5.56mm NATO barrel that is manufactured to military specifications. Attached to the muzzle is the with Knight's Armament 3 prong flash hider. New on the Mod 2 is a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil. The gas block no longer uses taper pins or set screws but is held on by a castle nut which allows for an air tight seal. Keeping with the air tight theme, the unique gas tube uses a compression fitting where it meets the gas block. This is very similar to what is used in automotive hydraulic brake lines. With these two features you won't have to worry about gas system leakage which can cause malfunctions, especially with lower powered ammo. On the opposite end of the barrel is Knight's Armament's proven E3 round-lug bolt which both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. The bolt is desigend to outlive the barrel. The E3 bolt rides in a full auto carrier. Surrounding the barrel is Knight's new URX 4 keymod handguard, 14.5 inches in length. The extended length handguard allows for a forward grip which makes moving from target to target much faster. The keymod handguard will accept all standard keymod accessories such as hand stops, rail covers, light mounts or picatinny rail sections. One 5 slot picatinny keymod rail section is supplied with the rifle. The URX 4 handguard design increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case.
