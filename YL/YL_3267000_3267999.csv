I don't have the original wooden grips, but I have a pachmayr grip on . Which actually makes it extremely comfortable to shoot, and ifor someone with really  large hands like me, makes it much easier to shoot. I also have a hogue rubber monogrip still in the package, and a handmade leather shoulder  holster that  comes with it.  In the condition it's in this pistol is worth around $500.

(IHC) for the US military in 1954. There are no import parts or marks anywhere on this rifle.  Performs and cycles flawlessly and is in very nice original condition. The IHC receiver has rare postage stamp markings. The original USGI issue LMR barrel (Nov. 1954) is shiny, in good condition and is accurate to the US Army's specifications at time of issue. (IHC did not manufacture barrels and LMR barrels are considered the best USGI barrels on Garands.)  The Bolt, Op rod, and Gas plug are all stamped IHC. All metal has original finish. There is no rust or pitting anywhere. The walnut stock has IHC lot number stamped inside barrel groove.  As you can see in the photos the stock is beautiful and does have evidence of US armory ""eagle"" cartouche as well as the ""circle P"" on handle. 

Included with rifle is 10 ammo filled enbloc clips with 80 rounds of 150 grain 30.06. Also included is a hard shell rifle case. 

M1 Garands manufactured by IHC are very rare and the most difficult to obtain of all four Garand manufacturers. To find one with this many original IHC parts is very rare. This Garand is not some piece of junk you find at gun shows. It is a complete functioning weapon that would still pass inspection at Parris Island. It is something that you will be proud to own and pass on down.  If you know an International Harvester tractor or truck collector please pass this along - I am selling for economic reasons and will entertain reasonable offers -Thanks.

Looking through the safe I've decided to part with a couple firearms that I simply don't get out enough so I thought I'd see if there is someone out there that maybe is looking for them.

Thanks for looking.

Feel free to ask any questions you may have, although if the posting is still up it means no one has committed to it.

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Has side rails that can be added and removed as needed. I also have the original stock, magazine, handguard, bayonet, cleaning rod, and magazine release. I am including the flambeau hard shell case, and all packaging I still have. Also have about 140 loose rounds I will include.

  I have never had a misfire, misfeed, failure to eject... Etc... Not one single time when I pulled the trigger, it wouldn't fire. I have owned this for 4 years now and just dong get out and shoot it anymore. So I figure if I'm not using it, maybe someone else would.

Now to the faults, 2 that I know of, do not affect the looks, shootability or accuracy at all!!

1. The pistol grip on the tactical stock has stripped. I have filled it in with epoxy and reset the screw. But if you tear it all the way down for some reason, you would need to fill in that stripped hole again. Easy fix.

2. I never got around to putting a new pin in the handguard where it holds the new tactical  handguard to the metal. Again does not affect the looks or function. If you have the gas tube locked in place the handguard will not move. Again a very easy fix if so inclined to do so. 

I am not desperate to sell and will not entertain low ball offers. This is a great functioning, accurate rifle. I'm asking 550.00 obo. Cash only, not looking for trades. Please call or text me at REDACTED if you would like to check it out. I have plenty more pics as well."

 Shop more Noveske products The Noveske NSR Handguard is the smallest, lightest customizable handguard available for the AR-15. The bare handguard without any additional rail sections mounted is only 1.48"" in width. The continuous top rail allows you to mount iron sights, optics and any other accessories without additional rail sections. The KeyMod system allows users to customize the handguard with rail sections and direct mount accessories. The handguard is constructed of aircraft aluminum and finished with a Mil-Spec hard coat black anodizing. The handguard is secured to a steel barrel nut with 4 T25 Torx fasteners. Installation requires a 1-1/6"" crows foot wrench (not included) for the barrel nut; standard AR-15 barrel nut wrenches will not work with this handguard system. The NSR will work with Heavy Profile barrels and a maximum size of .875"" diameter low profile gas blocks when located under the handguard. SwitchBlock equipped barrels will work, when the gas block location is outside of the handguard. This is rail system is not compatible with gas piston conversions. 

The KeyMod accessories are easy to install from the outside of the rail. The system uses captured hardware so the accessory can be installed with a turn of a wrench, no more fishing backer plates down a forend or completely removing the handguard system to install or adjust rail sections and accessories as is common with other modular rail systems. The KeyMod rail sections have integrated recoil lugs and a v-block design which help properly align the rail sections and ensure that recoil forces and stress do not sheer the attachment screws. This attachment system is much stronger than most customizable systems on the market. KeyMod rail sections and accessories are not included with the handguard and must be purchased separately.

Wood is in great shape as well as bore and no rust. This is an improved choke barrel. I can include 2 boxes of 22lr ammo with cash sale of my asking price. Call or txt 316990156zero.

Update: I've met 4 people now to sell this shotgun. 2 said ""Oh, I didn't realize it wasn't a vented rib barrel."" 1 said ""Nah, I'm really looking for a different choked barrel."" and 1 didn't show up to the meet. I've sold other guns through here with no problem but I'm sick of screwing around. It's a waste of my time and I don't appreciate it. Here's the facts:

1. I'm selling because I have another shotgun so this one is just collecting dust. Saving up for a Sig rifle.
2. No rust
3. Bluing is all good except for normal wear on the tub and the very end of the barrel.
4. Wood is in excellent shape, normal wear can only be seen if held up to a light at the right angle.
5. I bought from my dad 3 years ago who bought it from a dealer used.
6. Improved choke non interchangeable barrel
7. Is not vent rib (don't know if people just imagine there is one when they look at the pics or what)
8. Is not a magnum
9. Action is smooth and solid

You can always tell if a gun has been taken good care of and this one has. If you want a nice shotgun that doesn't cost a fortune this is your gun. The guy who was looking for a different choked barrel had the 400 in cash and agreed that it was worth the 400, it just wasn't what he was looking for."

I'd put it at 98% condition. Its close to perfect. I've put approximately 160-200 rounds through it. The gun has three rails for mounting lights/lasers or a fore grip and also has a collapsible stock. This is the zombie version with the ZMB logo and is somewhat rare.  It comes with 40 rounds of 30-30 and kwik site scope mounts. The scope mounts are see through and are specifically designed for the Mossberg 464 and allow the shooter to use the iron sites in addition to the scope. The scope seen in the picture is not included. I have no interest in trades. I will only accept cash. Serious offers only. Thanks for looking!

Got this knife as a gift. was my EDC for the past 4 months although i have found i personally prefer a smaller knife. Has some signs of use on the blade but nothing that affects its quality. More pictures can be taken per request. 

If your not familiar look up reviews, people rant and rave about this knife and its durability which speaks for itself. I have nothing bad to say about this knife whatsoever

Designed around Benchmade’s patented AXIS™ locking mechanism; an ingenious creation touted as quite possibly “the strongest folding lock ever,” this ultra rugged tactical folder offers all-out, no compromise performance and utility. Its unique locking mechanism is not only extremely tough, but it also makes for one of the smoothest opening folders in existence. The tanto-style 3.4’’ BT2 coated blade is constructed of 154CM, an American made premium grade stainless steel known for good corrosion resistance and noted for its ruggedness and edge-holding quality. These folders featured G-10 handles with stainless steel liners. A removable, reversible, black metal pocket clip offers the choice of left or right side clip mounting

 USP Tactical
 Enhanced versions of the USP, the USP Tactical models are designed for users who need the features found on the HK Mark 23, but in a more compact pistol. Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with a rubber O-ring, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights.
 The .45 ACP model of the USP Tactical is constructed on the USP45 frame. The 9 mm and .40 S&W Tactical models are built on the USP 9mm/40 caliber frame. The 9 mm variant, known as the USP9 SD, has a slightly different set of features.
 Features & System Characteristics:
•Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile (no O-ring barrel on 9 mm variants)
•High profile target sights 
•Match grade trigger (not present on 9 mm variant)
