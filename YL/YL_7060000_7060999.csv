I plan to go 38 Super so I can't really use these magazines anyways so I figured I'd sweeten up the deal some! What this one comes with is it's original grips and some original Colt hard rubber grips from the 1991 models. I really really like these hard rubber grips! Also it comes with all the magazines you see here. 2 original Colt magazines, 3 Checkmate magazines, and a 10rd Wilson Combat magazine (which cost $40 itself!). YES I WILL SHIP IF NEEDED!!!

TT33-Tula Tokarev model 1933      Type: Semi-automatic pistol   Place of Origin: Russia   Date Created: 1930   Weight: 840 g   Length: 196 mm   Barrel Length: 116 mm   Ammunition: 7.62 mm x 22 mm Tokarev   Action: Single action, recoil-actuated   Muzzle Velocity: 420 m/s   Feed System: 8 round box magazine    The 1933 Soviet TT (Tokarev-Tula) was a standard military side-arm in 1930-50s. It uses a high-velocity round with good penetration capability. The bottlenecked cartridge, essentially a souped-up 7.63 Mauser, gives a flat trajectory but, being common to longer-barreled submachine guns, also a considerable muzzle blast. For the ease of production, the locking lugs are lathed rather than milled and so encircle the barrel. The grip angle is not conducive to point shooting. Sights are quite good for slow fire (if difficult to pick up in low light) but the inherent accuracy is surprisingly poor. An eight-shot group of 3"" at 21ft is typical. However, the rate of fire, the power of the cartridge and the reliability represented a big improvement over the previous Soviet sidearm, the Nagant. The safety visible on the left of the frame was fitted to comply with BATF edict requiring an external safety on imports. In fact, the normal safety of the TT33 is the half-cock notch. The retrofitted safety should not be relied on for cocked and locked carry.  History The TT-30 is a semi-automatic pistol developed by Fedor Tokarev for the Soviet military to replace the old Nagant M1895 revolvers in use since tsarist times. The TT-33 (Tokarev-Tula) was adopted in 1933 as an improved design of the TT-30, and was widely used by Soviet troops during World War II. Mechanically and externally, the TT-33 is very similar to John Browning's blowback operated FN Model 1903 automatic pistol in design and function, combined with Browning's short recoil principle and a much simpler hammer/sear assembly with an external hammer. This assembly is removable from the weapon as a single unit and includes cartridge guides that provide reliable functioning. Production of the TT-33 in the USSR ended in 1954, but copies were also made by China (as the Type 51, Type 54, M20, and TU-90), Poland and Hungary (as the M48), as well as an export version for Egypt (the Tokagypt 58 chambered in 9mm Parabellum), Yugoslavia (as the M57 and M70A) and North Korea (as the Type 68). At one time or another most communist or Soviet bloc countries made a variation of the TT-33 pistol, until it was eventually replaced by the Makarov in military service. Norinco, the People's Liberation Army's state weapons manufacturer in China, manufactures a commercial variant of the Tokarev pistol for many years. It was chambered in the more common 9mm Parabellum round as well as in the original 7.62x25. It features a safety catch, which was absent on Soviet-produced TT-33 handguns.  Chambering: 7.62x25mm TT (7.63 mm Mauser) Type: Single action Weight: 910 g Length: 116 mm Capacity: 8 rounds   The Tokarev TT (""Tula, Tokarev"") pistol was developed as a result of continuous trials, held by the Red Army in the mid- and late 1920s. Red Army looked for a new, modern semiautomatic pistol to replace obsolete Nagant M1895 revolvers and a variety of foreign semi-automatic pistols. One of the most popular foreign handguns, purchased in numbers during 1920s, was the famous Mauser C96, and the Red Army really liked its powerful 7.63mm cartridge, which, in slightly modified form ,selected for its future pistol of domestic design. Red Army tested several pistols of various designers, and in 1930 eventually selected the design of the famous Russian arms designer, Fedor Tokarev. During 1930 - 1932 Red Army procured several thousands of new pistol, and after initial field testing requested several improvements, which resulted in the adoption of the model 1933 Tokarev pistol early in 1934. This pistol was manufactured in increased numbers prior to the Great Patriotic War. Before July 22, 1941, about 600 000 TT-33 pistols were delivered to Red Army. During war pistols were made in increasing numbers. In 1946 the TT was slightly modified to cut production costs, and its manufacture in USSR finally ceased circa 1952, with the adoption of the more modern 9mm Makarov PM pistol. However, TT served with the Soviet Army well until 1960s, and with the Soviet Militia (Police) - until 1970s. During late 1940s and 1950s USSR also supplied some of its new allies from Warsaw pact with licenses to manufacture TT, and it was produced in China, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia, in more or less original forms. Most military TT pistols of non-Soviet manufacture were also in 7.62mm, with some commercial export versions available in 9x19mm Luger, and fitted with some sorts of manual safety. For its time Tokarev TT was a formidable weapon, with good penetration and effective range. It was of good reliability and easy to maintain. What it lacked most was the manual safety, and its grip shape was not too comfortable. The Tokarev TT is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses Browning swinging link system, borrowed from the Colt M1911 pistol, modified to simplify production. The single action trigger had no safeties, other than disconnector to prevent out-of-battery fire, and a half-cock notch on the hammer. The only safe way to carry TT was to always have an empty chamber. The hammer unit was made as a single unit, easily detachable for cleaning and maintenance. Some years later Swiss designer Charles Petter developed similar system for the French Mle. 1935 pistol. Steel magazine held 8 cartridges. Fixed sights were factory zeroed for 25 meters. Grip panels were usually made of plastic or wood (wartime production).REDACTED"

American Eagle ammunition is marketed as precision practice ammunition, and though it is inexpensive, it offers an uncanny accuracy on par with the more expensive brands. Like all Federal ammunition, Federal AE223BK .223 ammunition is manufactured at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (LCAAP) in Independence, Missouri, which is an interesting aspect of the ammunition in itself. LCAAP is a government-owned, contractor-operated munitions facility that was originally established in 1941 for the manufacture and testing of small arms ammunition for the United States Army. Since 2001, it has been operated by Alliant Techsystems and is the largest manufacturer of small arms ammunition for the U.S. Army"
