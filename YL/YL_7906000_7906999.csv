Please click link below. https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/crkt-elmer-roush-pack-axe-2-92-in-blade-edge-11-25-in-overall-length-2748/ Description Pack Axe Designed by Elmer Roush in Brasstown, North Carolina Veteran designed, tested, and approved. Elmer Roush spent 18 months in Vietnam. So when his vision for a new axe comes to fruition, itâ€™s inspired by more than just aesthetics. The Pack Axe is refined down to the minute details and wilderness-ready on every last level. â€œCut effectively, chop effectively.â€ Those are the two simple objectives Elmer Roush set out with when he took to the drawing board. From his workspace in Brasstown, North Carolina, he achieved them to a T in the Pack Axe. But it didnâ€™t happen on the first go. Elmerâ€™s style is all experimentalâ€”make it too big and too long, then pare down until it feels just right. Some may say itâ€™s a bit unorthodox, but after holding the Pack Axe, weâ€™re believers. Itâ€™s an all-around outdoor-savvy axe with a hot forged 1060 carbon steel head complete with a hammer finish. Sitting snugly atop a highly ergonomic Tennessee hickory handle, itâ€™s at once good looking, durable, and compact enough to be lashed to a pack for journeys miles from anywhere. A leather sheath (sold separately) completes the smart, rugged carry. Perfectly portable, seriously serviceable, the Pack Axe is further proof that Elmer is at the top of the pack.

I bought this thinking my cross eye dominant kids could grow into it and I could re-learn to shoot lefty as I am cross eye dominant, too.Realistically, they won't be growing into it for a few years and converting this into a 20 ga makes more sense. I'll just convert my M2's safety if I want to convert to Lefty.Never used for hunting, but I did do an initial clean/lube on it and have taken it to the range twice to break it in. It cycles hunting loads and light target loads without issue. Light, handes well, and can hold up to 6 shells total (5+1) if you hunt out of state. Synthetic ""furniture"" with a good grip, so should be pretty durable in the mountains. Has three chokes. I have only used the IC on. Take Beretta/Benelli Mobil chokes, so seems interchangeable with CZ-USA chokes if you already have one of those. I have the box though it is just a basic carboard box. Has been handled, but in ""like new"" condition.Thanks for looking. Cash local sale preferred. $425, obo."
