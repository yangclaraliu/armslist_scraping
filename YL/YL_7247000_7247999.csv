It has night sights and comes with 3 mags, lock, box, and 20rds of HP ammo. The 2nd is a Glock 42 in excellent condition, it was purchased new by me a few months ago and has 300 rounds through it so far. The only notable wear on it is most of the finish has worn off the side of the slide release, as can be seen in the picture. It comes with everything as new, the case, paperwork and lock, and comes with 5 magazines and 2 tango down extended baseplates. I'm primarly looking for a P220 carry but would consider a full size as well. SAO would be ideal but DA/SA is fine as well. Doesnt have to be in perfect cosmetic condition or have night sights, but must have an external extractor and clean frame rails. The best way to reach me is by text to REDACTED, have my CCL and can sign a bill of sale if desired. I will want to see a valid ID for my records since both of these pistols were purchased under my name. FTF in the Winfield/Wellington area preferred but willing to travel as far as Wichita for the right deal. If the listing is still up it's still available. Single sentence 'is it still available' emails will be ignored due to the sheer amount of scam spam I have been receiving that way. ABSOLUTELY NO SHIPPING."

Text for faster response REDACTEDBrief history. This is not a throw away Saturday night special! This is a hand made masterpiece. All made by one man and new ones are $799 if you can even find one. The quality is world's better than Bauer or Frasier and equal or better than Browning /fn.   Basically psp made parts for fn and when the gca68 happened Browning couldn't import the baby so they sold the rights to psp. Psp now known as psa now makes the actual fn Browning badged baby's that get exported back to Belgium and other countries. These can go up to several thousand dollars for the more unique ones but this is just a basic stainless that sells new for $799. My price is practically giving it away so is very firm."

Chambered for 9mm this pistol appears to be 100% period correct, non-import marked, with all matching numbers on the frame, slide, barrel and locking block. The original mixed blue and phosphate finished components appear correct, in overall excellent condition but do show some minor wear, spotting, and fading. Mechanics appear to be excellent. The matching number barrel is excellent and bright with strong lands and grooves. The original black grips appear to be un-chipped or cracked and show wear consistent with the rest of the assembly. The excellent condition magazine appears to function properly and shows wear consistent with the rest of the assembly. Magazine is a properly finished, later war variation for Walther, marked ‘P. 38v’ and Walther inspected E/359.

Unfortunately, while the magazine is set it, it is a bit loose, not allowing the slide to close unless fully pressed in. It has cosmetic issues being reblued over old pitting most notably on the straps and some areas of the slide. Internally, it is excellent with an excellent bore. Grips are in excellent condition and the trigger and sights have that nice plum color. All markings are clear including serial, slide legend, and Crown proofs on the slide and barrel.The interesting thing about this pistol is that it comes with a fifth variation RSHA magazine that is in excellent condition with some use noted. Unfortunately, the pistol itself is not an RSHA being made shortly after the end of the 2nd Variation run.Selling for $550! Will ship to FFL/C&R Holder or DealerPlease ask if you have any questions!

Only reason I'm selling it, is I recently bought a Steyr AUG which I enojoy shooting better, and I really have no reason for two 5.56 guns, as I'm mostly a handgun man.It fires great, handles great, and due to the 10.5 inch barrel it is very loud and very fun at the range. This also makes one hell of a home defense weapon due to it's small size and light weight. Firearm is almost new, only put about 100 rounds through it and put it in the safe. Only mark on it is where the bolt release button is, the pin was a pain to get in and I knicked the metal a little bit, nothing too crazy. Below I'll give you a list of the parts, and how much they cost me so you know this is one hell of a deal.AR-15 Pistol Build:Spikes Tactical Spartan Lower Reciever ($125)PSA 10.5"" 5.56 Nitride 9"" M-Lok Freedom Upper ($230)PSA MOE Lower Build Kit with SB Tactical Brace ($180)PSA Premium 5.56 Nickel Boron BCG ($100)Geissele Airborne Ambi Charging Handle ($97)Magpul BAD Lever ($35)Magpul MOE-K2 Pistol Grip ($20)Magpul M-Lok covers ($20)Strike Industries LINK AFG ($45)Daniel Defense Sight Set ($125)Vortex SPARC II Red Dot ($200)Magpul PMAG 20 round ($15)Magpul PMAG 30 round ($15)That totals up to a little over $1200. This is before shipping, tax, and FFL fees which adds about another $100.I'm only asking $800 for this. Huge loss for me, great deal for you. Price is FIRM. I'm in no rush to sell this, I just probably won't use it much so no real point in letting it sit in the safe. Willing to consider all fair trade offers. If you have something you'd like to trade, just let me know. Worst I can do is say no eh? If your trade offer is more valuable than mine, I am willing to add cash if it's something I want. Please note my trade value might be a bit more than my cash value, depending on what you're trying to give me. Things I'm looking for (but I'll consider all fair offers): SIG 1911 Fastback Nightmare, CZ Scorpion Pistol, CZ Scorpion Carbine, Kel-Tec RDB, Beretta 92A1, PS90, FN Five Seven. As I said above, I can add cash if I have to.What I'm NOT interested in trading for: Other AR-15's, .40's, black powder, bolt actions, 1911's (unless they're bobtail/fastback), shotguns, or any non-firearm related items.According to Michigan state law this IS a pistol, but the ATF released a letter saying it's fine to shoulder the brace. Pistol means you must be 18+ with a purchase permit or CPL. I'm located in Northville. Willing to travel a bit, but nothing crazy. FTF only, I don't trust shipping firearms.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time.Thanks for looking! ~ Mike"

That was before Benelli applied Italian engineering and style to this most American of shotgun designs and the innovative Nova Pump took the market by storm. Doubters predicted that American shooters would never accept a gun that replaced the traditional wooden buttstock and separate external receiver with a single unit that encased the steel action directly in lightweight, weather-resistant polymer. They couldn’t have been more wrong! American shooters flocked to the stylish, ultramodern 12-gauge and for more than four years the Nova Pump has established an unchallenged reputation of dependability —— capable of handling everything from dove loads in the autumn haze to thumping waterfowl loads in driving rain. Shoot the Benelli Nova —— you’ll never think about pump shotguns in quite the same way.Condition: FACTORY NEWKTP SKU: 11197571"

These things are impossible to find and when you do find one, they usually have the ugly adjustable sights on them. 
 
I searched high and low to find one with the standard sights that was in good shape. 
 
It has the original matching serial numbered box, Smith wax paper, three factory mags. (2 mags are 8 round and 1 is 9 round). Mag base says Smith & Wesson on bottom, also has side decocker. Very accurate pistol. Serial number begins with TCH83xx. This does have the mag safety so it will not fire without the magazine. 
 
I bought it, cleaned it, put 100 rounds through it, cleaned it again and its been living in my safe ever since. 
 
I love the single stack 3rd gen S&W 9mm's, and I hate to see this one go, but I have my eyes on a new project."

This gun is a very accurate colt clone, because it's the same weight, size, and feel of those original colt .45s. I don't think it's possible but to paint a picture of the size, it could be re-bored to .45 colt caliber. Very heavy for a 22. No recoil at all because of this. BUT the best part of this revolver is how freakin beautiful it is. The frame is case-hardened steel, not just colored, but actual case hardened. The rest is blued steel. The gun is practically unfired, to my knowledge I was the only owner out of 2 previous to fire it, and only around 100rds at that.The company Jager is an Italian company similar to Uberti and is known for making high quality firearms. Imported by CAI Now the year is hard to find exactly, I've looked it up and my guess is it's somewhere between 1975-85, because of the cylinder pin safety. The revolver does shoot quite low, as a lot of fixed sight revolvers shoot low or high, but it's pretty easy to adjust.no low-ballers, CASH ONLY, face to face meeting, ptp preferred.
