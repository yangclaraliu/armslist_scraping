These old revolvers where copies of the S&W and Colt revolvers. The action seems to work but the cylinder rotates freely when the hammer is not pulled. It does lock into place once the hammer is cocked and seems to function correctly. The grips are made of wood and are both present with some decent checkering. The cylinder release is in front of the cylinder which is a little different as well. The serial number is located at the bottom of the grip.

Its angled front and rear serrations offer plenty of grip without getting hung up on your holster and the small top serrations help to reduce glare. The window cuts on the top edge of the slide round out the slides highly customized look.

This particular gun looks near perfect!From Beretta: ""It incorporates all the advantages of the revolutionary A400 concept--low profile action, light weight, lightning-fast follow-up shots, low recoil, easy maintenance--and combines them with the classic looks of blue steel and walnut stock. But even here, Beretta has an eye towards innovation, offering updated lines and checkering, as well as a contrasting-color receiver. The A400 Xplor Action defines performance and versatility in a semiauto. The A400 is a gas-operated action that was built for speed, reliability and versatility. Featuring the Blink technology, it is capable of firing 4 shells in less than 1 second, giving you the fastest follow-up shots of any shotgun on the market. Also, with this shotgun you can safely fire lead and steel shot, as well as chamber the best shell for the job regardless of length (2 ¾” to 3”) or power (mild for target to hard-hitting for hunting). Last but not least, the A400 action is light and trim, making this shotgun’s balance, swing and pointability an absolute best in its class.""

It was a factory demo gun that was checked out by Beretta's gunsmiths and comes with a 60 day warranty. This is a great way to get a solid shotgun and a discount price! This particular gun looks near perfect!From Beretta: ""It incorporates all the advantages of the revolutionary A400 concept--low profile action, light weight, lightning-fast follow-up shots, low recoil, easy maintenance--and combines them with the classic looks of blue steel and walnut stock. But even here, Beretta has an eye towards innovation, offering updated lines and checkering, as well as a contrasting-color receiver. The A400 Xplor Action defines performance and versatility in a semiauto. The A400 is a gas-operated action that was built for speed, reliability and versatility. Featuring the Blink technology, it is capable of firing 4 shells in less than 1 second, giving you the fastest follow-up shots of any shotgun on the market. Also, with this shotgun you can safely fire lead and steel shot, as well as chamber the best shell for the job regardless of length (2 ¾” to 3”) or power (mild for target to hard-hitting for hunting). Last but not least, the A400 action is light and trim, making this shotgun’s balance, swing and pointability an absolute best in its class.""

This particular gun looks near perfect!From Beretta: ""It incorporates all the advantages of the revolutionary A400 concept--low profile action, light weight, lightning-fast follow-up shots, low recoil, easy maintenance--and combines them with the classic looks of blue steel and walnut stock. But even here, Beretta has an eye towards innovation, offering updated lines and checkering, as well as a contrasting-color receiver. The A400 Xplor Action defines performance and versatility in a semiauto. The A400 is a gas-operated action that was built for speed, reliability and versatility. Featuring the Blink technology, it is capable of firing 4 shells in less than 1 second, giving you the fastest follow-up shots of any shotgun on the market. Also, with this shotgun you can safely fire lead and steel shot, as well as chamber the best shell for the job regardless of length (2 ¾” to 3”) or power (mild for target to hard-hitting for hunting). Last but not least, the A400 action is light and trim, making this shotgun’s balance, swing and pointability an absolute best in its class.""

This particular gun looks near perfect!From Beretta: ""It incorporates all the advantages of the revolutionary A400 concept--low profile action, light weight, lightning-fast follow-up shots, low recoil, easy maintenance--and combines them with the classic looks of blue steel and walnut stock. But even here, Beretta has an eye towards innovation, offering updated lines and checkering, as well as a contrasting-color receiver. The A400 Xplor Action defines performance and versatility in a semiauto. The A400 is a gas-operated action that was built for speed, reliability and versatility. Featuring the Blink technology, it is capable of firing 4 shells in less than 1 second, giving you the fastest follow-up shots of any shotgun on the market. Also, with this shotgun you can safely fire lead and steel shot, as well as chamber the best shell for the job regardless of length (2 ¾” to 3”) or power (mild for target to hard-hitting for hunting). Last but not least, the A400 action is light and trim, making this shotgun’s balance, swing and pointability an absolute best in its class.""
