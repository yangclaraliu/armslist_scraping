They are of phenomenal quality and precision.The pistol has about 200 rounds through it and is in 9.5/10 condition. The only flaws i can see are slight barrel lug wear around the corners and one of the magazines has a slight mark on one of the basepads. Other than that, its pristine. The slide finish is extremely durable and looks even better in person.The pistol started out as DAO from the factory but has been upgraded to SAO. A simple decocking lever install can turn it into DA/SA. All DAO parts are included.The pistol comes with 3 10 round 40 S&W OEM CZ Magazines. I can include the original high-cap magazines if you are LEO or out of MA state.

About the pistol:In my sincere opinion, the XD Mod.2 Tactical is one of the two finest full-sized, polymer-framed, striker-action pistols on the market (the other being the Walther PPQ 5""). Its features and advantages are best described in comparison to the category's benchmark, the Glock 17:-The sights on the Mod.2 Tactical are a big upgrade over the Glock 17, consisting of a fiberoptic front sight and a novak-style combat rear sight. Combined with the longer sight radius, the sights on this pistol offer faster aquisition, increased precision, reduced potential for snag, and decrease the temptation to spend more money on upgraded sights.-The full length 5"" barrel provides extra velocity.-The added slide mass and full length recoil spring dampen recoil, smooth out handling, and reduce muzzle rise. This is a soft shooting pistol, and an easy pistol to shoot well.-The fit and finish of the Mod.2 is far superior to Glock. Although it doesn't make the gun more or less functional (both pistols are essentially 100% reliable), the Mod.2 feels and looks like a nicer pistol.-The ""GripZone"" ergonomics on the Mod.2, while questionable in their branding, are extremely functional. Whether you are gripping this gun with skin or with gloves, it feels as though it melts and conforms to the grip.Condition:The condition of this item is about as close to like-new-in-box as a used gun can be. The internal wear clearly tells the story of this gun: 500 rounds, tops. This combined with the fact that it is properly lubricated is about the only thing which will distinguish it from a new firearm. The gun has no abnormalities to disclose, what you see is what you get. Included with the pistol is the original hard case, manual, and (2) factory ten-round magazines. Also included is a ruger pistol lock.Ownership History:I am the only owner of this pistol. I purchased it new in early 2017, and payed around $530 out the door. That is still a good price for a new one, box stores have these listed upwards of $600. I have fired it approximately 400-500 timest exhibits flawless XD reliability. Whether you are on a one or two way range, you can expect this gun to be as reliable as any quality polymer/striker fire gun on the market. So why am I selling it? I'm a C&R collector first, and a shooter second. Sue me. I bought this modern weapon to practice with, but it turns out I'm less committed to training than I thought. I'd rather just sell I can finish refurbishing an old Mauser. ***I will not respond to messages which appear to be spam, or request an unlawful transaction. I have priced this item so that after the cost of a CBI and transfer, your total cost will be exactly $400***"
