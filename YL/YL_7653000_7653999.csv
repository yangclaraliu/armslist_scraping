The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

It is believed to be a pre-1920 era with a serial number of 798485. The rifle was stored in doors, in a secure gun rack for nearly 30 years with little to-no-use during that time. The rifle does not come with amunition. Was cleaned and appraised by Deer Creek Gun Shop in Marietta, GA. Unfortunately, I do not have any more information as the previous owner of this Remington 22 is no longer alive. CASH only. We will meet in a public place during a time which is best for both of us. A bill of sale will be written up with your name, address and driver's license which we both will sign; one copy for you, one for me. I will need to verify your identity with a driver's license as part of the sale. I am located near the corner of Johnson Ferry and Shallowford Road. I will NOT ship, no exceptions. If you have any more questions about the gun you are more than welcome to ask but I will only be able to tell you what I visibly can confirm. I believe this rifle is in working order and Deer Creek Gun Store did not give me any reason to believe otherwise. Photo album with more photos can be found at: https://imgur.com/a/x16S3"

Beretta .380 Cougar pistol serial number E55937 was made in Italy and comes with the original box and cleaning brush. This handgun is a leftover from an Estate and unfortunately I don't have any details on the history or past usage. The gun was recently cleaned and appraised by Deer Creek Gun Shop in Marietta GA. They did not give me any reason to indicate there were any problems with the gun. No ammo is included. One one side of the barrel, an imprint reads ""Pietro Beretta - Gardone VT Cal 9 Corto"". The gun was stored boxed, inside (climate controlled) and was rarely used (if at all) over the last 30 years. Unfortunately, I do not have any more information as the previous owner of this pistol is no longer alive. CASH only. Meet at my house in Roswell, GA; I will NOT ship, no exceptions. A bill of sale will be written up with your name, address and driver's license which we both will sign; one copy for you, one for me. I will need to verify your identity with a driver's license as part of the sale. I am located near the corner of Johnson Ferry and Shallowford Road. The box reads .380 Cougar but I did not know which caliber to select from the choices nor did I know what type of ""Action"" this pistol is so I guessed. If you have any more questions about the gun you are more than welcome to ask but I will only be able to tell you what I visibly can confirm.

I am not original owner. It isn't pristine, has some scratches, etc, but it shoots great and is built like a brick poophouse. Unsure of round count, but it looks like it has been toted around more than shot.  Rifling is clean and clear.  Hoping to sell this in the next few days, so my crazy good price is 800.00 for the carbine, magazines, and all the ammo. I can meet within 30 minutes of Lincoln Co. The ammo alone probably cost close to that much at some point, so this is a stupid good deal."
