The blotches on the right side of the stock are some tape that I couldn't easily remove as I ran out of ""goo be gone."" I promise it will come of in a couple minutes if you have some, or something similar to clean it with. I am creating this on Sunday and cant get to the store as I leave for Africa tomorrow. Sorry, it is just some plastic tape that my shipper insists on using to label each item when sent to me. Ugggg. I found this in South Africa and it was bought from a local family, so it was undoubtedly used in one, or both, Boer Wars and certainly likely took hundreds of game animals. Made, and marked by, by Robert Jones of Liverpool. 30"" Top of barrel is fully matted to reduce glare. Checkered splinter fore-end with real horn tip. Engraved action, trigger-guard & lever. Chequered straight grip stock with heart shaped (real silver) oval escutcheon on top of butt. Initials are RTB or R ? B. Top of action has been recessed to facilitate feeding of 3,25"" case. Good original condition with good bore. Some pitting in front of rear sight, see pics, but old and not deep. Unusual to encounter a Martini rifle in this Express caliber as 95% or MH rifles are .577-450 with about 5% (of commercial models) being Westley Richards .500-.450 No 1 or No 2 neither of which is in the same class as the 3.25 inch Express. I have never seen another in this long Express Cartridge. If I recall the .450 Black Powder Express was in the same league as the .45-110 or .45-120. Firearm has seen use but wood is solid (has some unusual wear on left side of butt) and in good shape other than nicks,dings and scratches as seen after 120+ years of use. The stock is dark but nicely figured and would clean up well in my opinion. Maybe a good restoration gun? NOTE on the side safety, a small percentage of Commercial Sporting Martini Rifles have the side safety which are notorius for NOT working. This one does work but I would have the gun checked by a qualified gunsmith since it is an antique. It is nice though to find a side safty that seems to work as designed! BONUS. Barrel marked, ""Henry Rifling"" and ""Express 3 1/4 Case."" The history of .450 BPE (from Wikipedia): In 19th century Britain there were a large number of straight .450 cartridges developed of varying case lengths up to the 3¼-inch version. The .450 3¼-inch Black Powder Express was developed in the 1870s and quickly became a very popular black powder sporting cartridge, manufactured in the UK, France, Germany, Austria and Canada.[1] The cartridge was readily available in both BP and Nitro for Black versions well into the 20th century,[1] and second hand rifles can still be obtained quite easily. The cartridge has survived to the current day as the .450 Nitro for Black, the same cartridge loaded with mild loadings of modern smokeless powder, carefully balanced through trial to replicate the ballistics of the Black powder version. Oval form flat-topped barrel with rear sight graduated to 1000yds.*** ***ADDITIONAL INFO ON AFRICAN EXPRESS SIGHTS: This rifle has the typical SOUTH AFRICAN ""express"" sights of African rifles known as ""African Sights."" These sights were on many sporting long arm in Southern Africa (Rhodesia, The ZAR and OVS Boer Republics, German West Africa, The Cape Colony and others) during the mid to late 19th century. They were not really for shooting game as a .577-450, .500-450 or the .303 was not usable as a 500-1000 yard hunting cartridge but it is believed by some that these sights were either unofficially required by Britain, The Boer Governments, or they simply became a standard of “fashion” with the idea being that civilians could stand and fight with the military as volunteers or as militia. The sights allowed groups of civilians to lob ""volley fire"" on the massed natives who generally attacked in large, noisy and well advertised groups. This African tactic of “noise and numbers” worked quite well on other natives but Europeans, Afrikaners and the English had a nasty habit of holding their ground and firing large caliber, heavy bullets, in quantity, from long ranges which often caused horrific damage on the indigenous peoples. These sights allowed the lobbing of rounds from such long distances. Military rifles almost always have long range sights but these sights on civilian arms are fairly unique to Southern African sporting rifles. An oddity of this tradition of ""volley sights on every rifle"" carried through to even .22 rifles and .22/.410 combination guns. When I lived in South Africa I observed many .22's with sights to 300, and even 500 yards!"

Characteristics of this particular LAW 12: 
- Flawless action , finish is very good condition  with a few scuffs and scratches, bore and chamber are perfect, gun functions very reliably. I will provide you with a close-up picture of every scuff/scratch if requested (they do not show up on pictures that show the entire gun, the most significant ones are on the foregrip as pictured, and armslist limits me to 3 upload pictures).
-Detachable European walnut wood stock (most LAW 12s available on the market have the cheaper synthetic stock)
- Magazine extension (total mag capacity is 8+1)
- post-recall push button safety (lever safety was RECALLED by Franchi and is NOT safe)
- Weaver rail scope mount (very hard to find, I will also include non-rail-length trigger assembly pins in case you want to remove the rail)
- Very well maintained. Recoil buffer and foregrip buffer have been replaced and are in excellent condition, O-ring is in excellent condition. Maintenance performed by a professional gunsmith. It has never experienced a failure to fire, and only once experienced a failure to feed after I accidentally overtightened the screws holding on the weaver rail. Upon loosening, it fed properly.
