The FX-9  comes standard with a 33 rd double stack GlockÃ�Â® style 9mm  magazine. When we designed the FX-9 our goals were Reliability , Affordability, and familiar controls for the user.

The FX-9 is machined from billet material, anodized type III aluminum components . Steel components are full hard nitride and nickle boron nitirded including the barrel,bolt,ejector,last round hold open,feed ramp and extractor for extended wear properties and corrosion resistance.

The upper and lower receiver are more than 1.00Ã¢ï¿½Â³ shorter than a standard AR-15 upper and lower receiver making it more compact and lighter than a standard mil-spec AR-15 design.

Features Include-

LIMITED LIFE TIME WARRANTY

-Chambered in 9Ã�ï¿½19
-7.375Ã¢ï¿½Â³ Free float M Lock Rail  With an 8.25 Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ barrel

-compatible with KNS precisionÃ�Â® AR-15 trigger pins. 

We do not recommend using aftermarket lighter weight triggers, if you wish to try an aftermarket trigger group we recommend keeping your factory supplied trigger group nearby for re-installation as it has more disconnector engagement built into it than a normal mil spec trigger group or after market trigger group  .

The FX-9 upholds Xtreme reliability with a wide range of ammo including many hollow point designs for self defense and full metal jacket .

We do not recommend the use of non jacketed ammunition as unprotected lead can cause fouling and buildups that plated and jacketed bullets do not.



Do Not use aluminum case ammunition in your FX-9 !!



We recommend starting with the following ammunition.

This rail system is built stronger and more stable than previous designs due to the absence of a removable bottom rail. The modular layout allows an end user to fully customize exactly where to place accessories without the use of specialized tools, small parts, or additional forces applied to the barrel. URX 4 includes two QD sling swivel sockets at the rear of the rail. The URX 4 is currently available for 5.56 rifles in 8.5”, 10”, 10.75"", 13”, and 14.5” lengths, and is equipped with Knight’s unique IBN mounting configuration. The idea was to create a more modular, and thus more serviceable, rail system that still maintains its strength and stiffness. Th IBN system torques the rail onto the weapon and allows the rail to act as the barrel nut. This design was developed to increase stabilization and provide a simpler solution that requires less specialized tools to install and maintain. A full array of modular accessories, iron sights, and panel kits utilizing the Keymod mounting brackets have been developed specifically to accompany this rail system. With the introduction of the URX 4, Knight’s Armament Co. demonstrates its continuing determination to intelligently design effective products.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: KAC - KNIGHT'S ARMAMENT URX 4 IBN RAIL 5.56MM 10.0"" LENGTH"

This rail system is built stronger and more stable than previous designs due to the absence of a removable bottom rail. The modular layout allows an end user to fully customize exactly where to place accessories without the use of specialized tools, small parts, or additional forces applied to the barrel.

The IBN system torques the rail onto the weapon and allows the rail to act as the barrel nut. This design was developed to increase stabilization and provide a simpler solution that requires less specialized tools to install and maintain.

This is a piston driven, low recoil with a side charge handle similar to a scar or a tavor. This rifle is in a league of its own and is extremely hard to find especially in MA. I'm not sure but I assume there not on the list for MA complaint any more but this one is grand fathered in like your ar 15. The design of this rifle is more reliable and accurate then an ar. I ordered this in 2012 I didn't get it in from sig tiill end of 2013 over twelve months to get it in they don't make a hole lot of them this one is number 555. This rifle does take your standard ar 15 5.56 magazines.which I have a few to go with it. There is a few models of the sig 556 I believe this is the swat patrol rifle it's called it was mass compliant at the time I'm not sure how but the stock is pinned and it's not a real flash suppressor maybe. Most models you couldn't get in this state and some of them are a lot cheaper then this one was or is so if you go to look them up remember it's not a base model, it's registered in this state, in like new condition, and in hand. This rifle comes with adjustable and removable front and rear sight with rear peep that has 100-200-300 meter adjustments. Has sling mounts, the inserts that go on the wrap around Rail system for mounting accessories, and a redfield red or green adjustable dot scope. I've probably put less then 500 rounds down range with it , it's sighted in now for a hundred yards. Can be adjusted to shoot single shot. My wife even shoots this thing great hitting baseball size steel plates at 100 yards consistently and she never shoots with me. The rifle has just the right weight to stay on target for extremely fast rate of fire. It's just balanced and designed better then any AR I have owned or shot. I will throw in a few 30 round mags and a ten along with a 100 rounds. There's one shiny spot behind the slide where the spent brass hits in the same spot every time I've looked at others they all get it with use. The only reason I'm considering selling this rifle is to get something new like a tavor or scar, just for a change. I love this rifle and you will to I believe it has lifetime warranty from sig would have to check. I do not need to sell this rifle so do not low ball me via email or text your wasting our time. I don't think I've seen another one of these in MA before there not easy to come by. With the rifle, scope, magazines, 100 rounds and soft case I will let go $1800 cash firm."

This slide has approximately 3,500 rounds through it and been an absolute rock star. The included barrel has only had the factory test rounds through it, so it is virtually new (I've been using an aftermarket barrel). This is a great deal if you are looking to get into red dot optics on handguns, especially if you want to use a Trijicon RMR. Please note, this is for a stripped G19 Gen4MOS slide, so you will need to have a Gen4 glock frame to mount the slide on and the slide internals."

It's about time I got rid of most of my guns and this one is definately on the chopping block.
