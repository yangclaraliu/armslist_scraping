I will meet half-way between where I am (Burlington), and where you are in Raleigh, that amounts to a 25 minute drive each (roughly). I have a (what amounts to) new, and in the box, limited edition (made one year only) 1980 gold-plated ""Oliver Winchester"" Commemorative Winchester lever action rifle. It has a factory gold plated receiver, gold plated forend cap, and gold plated lever, it also has a gold ""Oliver Winchester"" signature enlayed into the side of the barrel. The gold receiver is engraved all over.This is a numbered rifle (in the 3000's), of a limited run produced only that year(1980). It also has a ""Oliver Winchester"" medallion embedded into the side of the butt stock. It has a octagon barrel.All of the manuals and paperwork are like brand new, and are included, in the box. The box has some wear marks where it has been stores and has rubbed other surfaces. Very nice but not as pristine as the paperwork. The rifle is still wrapped in the wax paper that they protected it with in 1980.It is the finest rifle that I have ever seen. The figured wood is grade ""A"", and it is finished smooth like glass; the checkering is magnificent.The gold is brilliant, and the engraving is everywhere, and of superb detail.The box is a piece of artwork, and it by itself and without the rifle, was selling online for $160.00. the box was designed exclusively for this Limited Commemorative Rifle.It is ready to shoot, if you must :)Or preserve.It is the 38-55 caliber. Which is the diameter of the 38 special round, while being longer than the 30-30 round, which makes it a deer/elk/bear round. It was the most common rifle round in America before Winchester introduced the 30-30. It is still easy to find ammo, as it is sold about everywhere, and it is not anymore expensive than other hunting rounds. I will include one collector's box of ammo with it, which is also in a box that is more of a work of art, than it is a container.I have tons of pics of everything, from every angle. I will send them if you are serious with $850 on hand.Price cannot be negotiable. I cannot take trades, there is nothing to trade it for. I just want cash to offset a portion of what I invested into Christmas"

She shows a few faint (barely seen) marks of wear (some of which may be factory production marks). The Stock and Forend (with their colors/hues/grains) really stand out on this one and definitely catch your eye and draw attention (look at those patterns)! Simply put, the Stock & Forend look fabulous. The Stock has (1) tiny surface mark on its left side (near the recoil pad; not rough, but smooth) and goes largely unnoticed (may be a small factory production mark). There are (2) faint surface marks (lines) on its underside (near recoil pad; not rough, but smooth) and go largely unnoticed and in most angles of light you can barely see them. The checkering is superb and it sits tight and perfect to the receiver. This stock is Close to New (99%+) and is Excellent Condition and looks amazing with its patterns/colors. The Forend looks nearly flawless (nothing serious here; one tiny surface scratch near where it sits on the barrel; when assembling from take-down to assembly). The Forend still easily rates 99%+. The Receiver looks amazing and there are virtually no signs of wear. Its underside looks awesome and the Trigger-Guard shows no wear (eye-catcher too with that Gold BuckMark Logo). As expected with light use, the receiver and the bottom (rear) portion of the barrels show a few light signs of being taken-down and assembled (light signs on contact points; indicating little use). The Barrels look amazing and the Browning Bluing (from the Miroku Plant in Japan) doesn’t disappoint (shines and shines; gotta love that quality-control from Japan)! Its Raised Vent-Ribbing looks amazing and its Front and Rear Sights sit perfect and tight along its topside. The bores show light signs of use, but they are super clean and shiny. As expected, the Browning Action on this O/U doesn’t disappoint; nice, tight, and crisp!"

Two-tone, all metal. You determine the condition.
Among Sig fans and collectors, this gun is interesting because it was imported when SigArms first began American operations in Tyson’s Corner, VA. It is thus a very early gun, as indicated by the stamping “Made in W. Germany”.
Not only were these initially imported in smaller numbers, the two-tone variants were even fewer.
It has been ultra-reliable, and would make a hard to beat carry or family defense gun.
Comes with Sig plastic box, factory grips and five hi-cap magazines. I've installed the wrap-around Pachmayr rubber grips, which is very hand-filling, but will also include the original Sig plastic grip panels.
$550 or first reasonable sounding offer. Might consider trade for an AR or AK.
No waiting. No sales tax. No shipping charges. No FFL transfer fees.
Buyer will need to quickly show me a valid TX Driver’s License or TX CHL, and sign a simple Bill of Sale indicating only that you showed me your current DL and or CHL. -> Nothing besides your name and the gun info will be on it.             I’d be more than happy to send you a copy so you can see what mine looks like.
Gun was transferred through an FFL, meaning I cleared the NICS, making both me and the gun clean.
Bill of Sale will prove you legally own it and protects you henceforth.

I bought it as my primary CC but have decided to switch to a different weapon and caliber. Also included is a high quality kydex IWB holster that was molded specifically for the gun. It clicks into the holster and how snug or loose the fit is can be adjusted. I am not interested in trades, cash only $350. The essentials package new from Buds and other bargain online stores is 425 and the kydex holster was $80. So please no lowball offers. Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale and present identification, I will do the same."

For sale: Reliable USED Kareen KA-MkIII Semiautomatic Pistol in 9mm.Two-tone, all metal. You determine the condition.I am not the original owner.
The Kareens are essentially Israeli renditions of John Moses Browning’s famous Hi-Power pistol. They have a bit more metal in them, and some, including myself, prefer their lines. Kareens are very accurate pistols.Serial numbers match on frame, slide and barrel.
I’ve had actual Hi-Powers and these shoot softer, which says a lot.I’ve also paid twice as much for Hi-Powers.
It has been ultra-reliable, and would make a hard to beat carry or family defense gun.
Comes with two hi-cap magazines, and is fully compatible with Hi-Power magazines (and many parts).I’ve installed the cool-looking white textured grips, which is then contrasted by the slip-on rubber, but will also include the original plastic grips.
$300 or first reasonable sounding offer. Will consider ammo plus cash.
No waiting, No sales tax, No shipping charges. No FFL transfer fees.________________________________________________________________________________Buyer agrees to quickly show me a valid TX Driver’s License and CHL firstand sign a simple Bill of Sale.-> Nothing besides our names/signatures and the gun info will be on it.I’d be more than happy to send you a copy so you can see what mine looks like.A Bill of Sale will protect us both.
