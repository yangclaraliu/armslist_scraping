 Factory New

 The Bounty Hunter single action revolver has been sold in the USA for over 20 years. Made in Germany and available in 22LR /22WMR, .357 Mag, .44 Mag and 45 LC, it is simply one of the best single action revolvers produced. You can purchase a more expensive, or a famous brand, but you won’t be getting a better single action firearm. The Bounty Hunter is a traditional 6 shot single action revolver with traditional resting notch, but it also has a transfer bar and recessed chambers for shooting safety. Our 22LR/22WMR version is on a full size frame unlike our competition. So you can practice your Cowboy Action Shooting with rimfire or go plinking with our 6rd or 8rd rimfire cylinders. There are a lot of single action revolvers out there but none better than The Bounty Hunter from EAA Corp.

Lightly used 2010 MISSION BY MATHEWS UX2 COMPOUND BOW. We bought this for my son in 2010 - it is lightly used as he did not do a lot of hunting or shooting with it. its currently set at 27"" draw and 60lbs weight. Bow is Right Handed.

We have upgraded to a newer Matthews bow for him (...for the life of me, I don't know why but he SWEARS he will use this one more!!)...so, I'm selling his old one to help recoup some of the funds spent on the new bow. It comes with everything you see in the pic (bow, peepsight, whiskerbiscuit, 3-pin sight). Sorry but no arrows come with it...what you see is what you get. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this bow - it is like new condition and needs nothing but arrows to shoot it...If you have questions, give me a shout! I'll do my best to answer them quickly! 

===================
The factory info and specs are as follows:
The Mission UX2 introduces the all–new patented 2CPW modular system, the most innovative cam system for introductory bows on the market. The addition of perimeter weights to the cams makes the UX2 so smooth and quiet, it matches the feel of typical competitors' parallel limb bows. Draw length adjustability ranging from 22 to 30 inches, combined with 70% let off, makes the UX2 a smart choice for any bowhunter.

I Paid $1,100 for the Rifle when I purchased it new last fall.  The rifle is in excellent condition with less than 100 rounds fired through it.  I have spent just over $1,400 In accessories that are listed above.  Total I have around $2,500 in everything listed.  I'd like to get around $1,800 OBO.  Please feel free to make me an offer, worst I can say is no.  I'm not sure on the price so I just threw out a number at $1,800.  I will entertain all offers. I will accept small trade offers with cash.  For example I'll entertain a $300 gun with $1500 in cash as I need the money.  I can meet face to face if you are local or will ship the rifle if the buyer pays the shipping and FFL transfer fees.  Please text only to REDACTED, My name is Cory.  Thanks for looking and please don't hesitate to make me an offer!  Can send more pics, please just let me know what you are wanting to see.  God Bless"

Each is for use on the Forster brass trimmer either classic or original trimmers.  The .223 set is unopened and in wrapper.  The 308 set has been used to process about 15-20 pieces of brass.  These are a great way to cut brass processing time by combining trimming, chamfer and deburring all in one step.  See below picture for drill setup that can make your .223 and 308 brass processing a breeze and save you a lot of time as you process bulk amounts of brass.  I have to sell to buy some new dies so the price break is to your advantage.  These are new on Midway USA for $62 each plus shipping.  I will sell to you for $45 each.  If you buy both together I will give you free shipping.  If bought individually I will ship but you pay small USPS flat rate shipping (approx. $5.80).  See reviews on Midway USA as they are very strong reviews and there are Youtube videos showing how fast the drill setup with these mounted on your trimmer can work."

Glock discontinuing their “C” model line of compensated pistols. If you’re in the market for a Glock “C” you better try and jump on one now.

GLOCK compensated pistols are equipped with an integrated compensator, rendering the weapon even more controllable during rapid fire and allowing an improved hit pattern. The compensator consists of two longitudinal openings in the barrel and slide of the pistol arranged in ""V-position"". This minimizes front sight blackening through powder gases.

Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol.  The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger.  Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.

Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.

The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands.  The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.

Additionally, the 5R Cut Rifled Match barrel features a Target Crown to maximize the accuracy of this barrel.

This recess provides protection for the important crown of the bore, and also serves an important role of providing a path that will not adversely affect the trajectory of the projectile. As a bullet travels through the barrel, gasses are also traveling before and behind it. The gases traveling in front of the bullet can become turbulent if captured within a flash hider or other type of muzzle device. This effect is negligible in most scenarios, but in long-range precision shooting, a target crown barrel is one more tool to increase accuracy."

Thick hide and lots of bone makes a kill on these pretty difficult.  Not a problem with this stuff, great penetration and expansion reliability.

The weapon light is a new Elzetta C Charlie 333 900 lumens wapon light. Elzetta calls it the scorcher. Its the brightest light you have ever seen mounted to a weapon. It sits in a new Elzetta ZSM mount with side rail. Here is the best part of this beast it has a new AIMSHOT LS8300 laser. This one was sent to me by a close friend who is a SFO serving in Afghanistan. They are only sold to socom and other elite sofs. You can check with Jeff at Aimshot in Atlanta for verification. They don't even sell these to LE Agency's any more! It has the brightest beam you have ever seen and at night it looks like something from STAR WARS!

Read a little more about the P30 below:

P30
A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures."

P95 series pistols easily field strip for cleaning, without the use of special tools, into five major subassemblies. Ruger offers several ambidextrous variations on the proven P95 series double-action design. Operating features on all centerfire models include a firing pin block that prevents firing unless the trigger is completely pulled and held fully back. Manual safety models incorporate a manual ambidextrous lever that, when engaged, prevents firing unless the lever is in the ""fire"" position. Decock only models allow safe return to their ""at rest"" mode when either ambidextrous decocking lever is depressed. Picatinny rails for laser or light.

I've wanted a display board like this for a long time so I finally decided to start making them. It holds an AR-15 style rifle on a magazine that is affixed 2 1/4"" off the board. To remove your weapon, all you need to do is press your magazine release and it will pull right off the board.

This is to display your rifle and the gun in the picture does NOT come with the board.

The paint on the board is designed to mimic the CARC paint that covers military vehicles and the board itself is made from high quality 3/4"" sanded poplar plywood. The board comes with a self leveling wall mount that has a 200lb capacity.

I have a few designs I've already made but if you contact me with a design you'd like, I will do my best to put it on a board for you. I can make the board pretty much any size you'd like up to 4'x 8' but currently they're about 36""x 43"". They can be made to hold the weapon vertically with the muzzle up or down.

There are many adjustments for the scope so it may need to be calibrated correctly to clear up the lines.The stock is either a military stock that has been cut down or an aftermarket stock. There is a small crack on the rear tang and a small repair at the end of the stock that has been re-glued.
The bore looks excellent and has a mirror shine to it. It looks like it will be a great shooter.
I got this rifle in a trade, but I have no use for it so it's up for sale. I haven't shot it and I know almost nothing about the 1903a3 rifles. Let me know if you have any questions and I will do my best to answer them.

Full specs listed at the links below. The Tactical Custom ll has great reviews and are known to be highly accurate pistols that run perfectly right out of the box. Like all the Kimber Custom models it has their ""melted"" treatment, all sharp edges and corners are dehorned/smoothed out. It only weighs 31oz which is less than a S&W with Scandium frame but recoil seems no different to me than on heavier guns. By far the nicest 1911 I've ever had and the quality of it is evident as soon as you get it in your hand. Only has a few hundred rounds through it so it is just broken in. It runs flawless, I shot a box of 100 through it last weekend without a single hitch. $1000 cash or partial trade plus cash on your end. You won't find a better 1911 than this one for the money. If you are interested and serious, please reply with a phone number to contact you on. 

Comes with low profile night sights (that still glow like new), flared mag well, match grade barrel, match grade trigger, full length guide rod, match grade stainless steel barrel bushing, ambidextrous safety, front strap checkering, skeletonized hammer and trigger and more all straight from the factory on this high end model. 

The fit is awesome on this pistol and the trigger is super crisp. It also has the premium KIMPRO ll finish and has been upgraded with a Wilson Combat mag and nice set of custom VZ grips. I'm sure I am probably forgetting some things but all the details and specs are at the links provided below.

Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration
