Bore is like new. About 99% of original finish remaining. Hard to upgrade this very late war rifle. Other pictures available.
There are two kinds of 30 Cal. carbines … . One that loses its value over time ( a commercially made rifle ), and one that is an investment….that is, it will at least HOLD its value, and likely INCREASE in value over time. ( a genuine U.S Carbine .Caliber 30 M1 rifle , made during WWII). You DO get what you pay for
As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   
The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…"

There are two kinds of 30 Cal. carbines … .

( a genuine U.S Carbine .Caliber 30 M1 rifle , made during WWII). You DO get what you pay for
As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   
The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…"

UsedDescription:Description The K-80 Pro Sporter features a Floating Rib suspended higher above the barrel than conventional Sporting Clays and Skeet competition shotguns. The higher rib design and corresponding higher stock allow the shooter to keep their head in a more erect position on the stock, thereby increasing sight range and allowing for quicker target acquisition, reduced neck fatigue, and reduced perceived recoil. A specially designed adjustment wheel fitted to the rib allows the shooter to select a flat shooting 50/50 POI or a slightly higher 60/40 POI by using a sight picture of bead behind bead. Both POI settings are approximations and can differ slightly. A higher POI of 70/30 is also possible by using a figure eight sight picture. Changing your POI to your personal preferences is as simple as using the adjustment wheel on the rib of the Pro Sporter. By loosening the set screw and lowering the rib down you can achieve a higher POI. Barrel lengths of 30? and 32?, both complete with Tapered Flat Adjustable Floating Rib and standard Titanium choke tubes add flexibility to your choice of game. The K-80 Pro Sporter transitions easily between all of the clay target disciplines offering the versatility and performance of Krieghoff. This pre-owned Krieghoff Gold Renaissance is in excellent condition. Features a 32? pro sporter barrel and 8 Müller choke tubes. Schnabel forearm and Monte Carlo stock with adjustable comb.What’s Included?This gun includes a Krieghoff hard case and all standard accessoriesAbout Michigan Shooting Centers, Inc.Our story started back in 2001 when Pat Lieske, a professional sporting clay shooter and instructor, started Michigan Shooting Centers.

Ltd. Toronto, Canada Model: No. 2 MK 1* Serial Number: 1T4132 Year of Manufacture: 1944-1945. There were 93,528 T prefixed pistols made between Sept. 1944 and Sept. 1945. Aug. –Oct. 1945. The total made for China, having CH prefixes was either 63,395 or 66,960. Caliber: 9mm Action Type: Semi Automatic pistol with detachable magazine and magazines disconnect. Markings: The left side of the slide is marked “MK I* / BROWNING FN 9MM HP INGLIS CANADA”. The left side of the hammer is marked “D”. The right side of the frame above the front of the trigger, the right side of the slide below the port and the right side of the barrel at the port are marked “1T4132”. The right side of the frame above the trigger and the slide behind the port are also marked with a “Crowned Crossed Flags / D C / P”. The DCP mark is a Dominion of Canada Proof. There is an import mark stamped above the grip panel on the left side of the frame: “GEMCO PRINCETON, NJ”. Barrel Length: 4 5/8” Sights / Optics: This pistol is mounted with a Patridge style front sight with a serrated rear face that is dovetailed into a raised base on the top of the slide. The rear sight is a square notched rear sight fixed to a raised boss on the back of the slide. Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are checkered black plastic, and the left grip is cut-out on its lower rear corner for a lanyard ring. There are several light handling marks and small dings in the smooth borders. The checkering shows light wear from handling and previous use. There are no chips or cracks. The grips rate in about Very Good overall condition. Type of Finish: Black Painted Finish Originality: Other examples have been seen with this finish, the finish was likely applied over the original finish at the time of import. Bore Condition: The bore is grey, and the rifling is sharp. There is light erosion in the bore. The barrel is not unsafe, no deep pitting. Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 80% of its metal finish. There are scratches on the black paint and some sections have chipped off. The leading edges are grey from finish loss. The gun has normal operational wear from previous military use. The gun has been in and out of arsenals and traveled 1,000 of miles. The gun has wear typical with this loose transportation and handling. The backstrap has a hand-painted “25”. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are dull but clear. Some of the proofs are light. Overall, this handgun rates in about Very Good to Fine condition. Mechanics: The action functions Correctly. We did not fire this handgun. As with all used firearms, a thorough cleaning may be necessary to meet your maintenance requirements. Box, Paperwork & Accessories: The holster is Green Military Canvas and appears to be correct to the pistol. There is an additional magazine in the holster. The holster baseplates are marked “JI” and “PA”. The holster is marked on the inside flap, it is too difficult to read. Our Assessment: This is a Canadian High Power semi-automatic pistol made by Inglis during WWII. Inglis was making the Bren machine gun for the British but had never built pistols. The Chinese were in dire need of weapons to fight the Japanese and wished to acquire 180,000 Hi-Power pistols. The Chinese gave Inglis a couple of pistols to reverse engineer and Canada also receiver drawings from the British after agreeing to pay a royalty to FN. By the end of January in 1944 the first production pistols were completed. The Chinese never took delivery of all of the pistols, and many were acquired by the Canadian Army. The British were also interested in pistols for their covert forces such as the Special Operations Executive and ordered 50,000. There were about 93,528 pistols made expressly for the Canadians and British and these received a “T” serial number prefix instead of the “CH” prefix used on the Chinese guns. This is one of those 93,528. This is a great package for the collector of WWII weapons, and those used by Canada in particular. CA Legal or CA Private Party Transferable: This handgun CAN be transferred as a dealer sale in California. This handgun CANNOT be sold as a Private Party Transfer (PPT) at our Simi Valley shop. All cartridge firing handguns (even C&R's and antiques) sold to a California resident must be DROS'd. This does not apply to out of state residents. Alicia Roadifer"

The weapon is based on the SPAS-12, and has similar pump-action/semi-automatic firing modes. In semi-automatic mode a gas piston drives a bolt carrier and rotating bolt. In pump-action mode the same components are driven by sliding the fore-end backwards. Pump-action mode is required to reliably fire low-pressure (less lethal) ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. Switching between firing modes is done by pressing a button above the foregrip, and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards. The barrel is chrome lined and features screw-in choke tubes.[2] Unlike its predecessor, the SPAS-15 is fed by a detachable box magazine. The gun features a folding stock and a pistol grip safety. Amongst Italian troops the weapon is known by the nickname ""La Chiave dell'Incursore"" (the key of the commando) because it is used to blast the locks of closed doors. In 1994, the United States banned the importation of the SPAS-15 with close to 180 shotguns imported. This is a very rare firearm to have in your collection.Ashley jackson"

No phone/text. If you don't get a reply make sure you sent your email address.There's a lot more in this listing than a gun. It includes the gun, 3 barrels(two .38 Super and one .22lr), 3 springs, 2 slides, 2 mags, 2 triggers(stock and adjustable), a 2-chamber compensator, and a +2 mag extension to make the stock 18rd mag a 20rd mag.A 20+1 Witness in .38 Super is hard to beat. The .22LR slide conversion makes trigger time even more fun. Trigger time in either caliber is genuine as this uses the exact same frame no matter which caliber you're shooting. You can get in alot of live fire training on a .38 Super as far as trigger feel, break, reset, etc. by shooting .22lr  This an original EAA Witness made in Italy. It's a great combination of serious ballisitics and high capacity. Where the average gun runs out of ammo, you have several more left and where the average gun isn't penetrating, a .38 Super punches through. Hundreds of dollars in upgrades include an extended and threaded target barrel with polished ramp, 2-chamber compensator, Hogue grips, an aluminum trigger with adjustable travel stop, and a set of LPA 3-dot click-adjust target sights. LPA is the international standard for handgun sights and are also made in Italy. The compensator tames this right down. It kicks like a light .380. The reduced kick on the comped barrel uses a much lighter spring so you can rack this with two fingers. The original flush fitting factory .38 SA barrel is also included.As described this also comes with basically a second gun with the .22lr conversion with slide, barrel, spring, and magazine. Swap the slide and the mag and you have an Italian .22lr pistol. The .22lr makes it a gun that everyone can shoot. Someone can learn with the .22lr and graduate to .38 Super in light loads and then +P loads. One other thing about the Witness. No other double stack feels quite like it in your hand. If you ever have to defend yourself with a handgun this is arguably a first choice because of the great ballistics and the high capacity If you're local you have a cost advantage of no shipping fees, no FFL fees, no FFL transaction process, and you can see the gun during purchase instead of after.No trades or exchange of services. Just cash.NOTE THAT WHEN YOU CONTACT A SELLER ON ARMSLIST THE SITE SENDS YOU AN INITIAL EMAIL REQUIRING YOU TO CONFIRM YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS. IF YOU USE A RANDOM EMAIL ADDRESS YOUR MESSAGES WILL NEVER GO THROUGH."
