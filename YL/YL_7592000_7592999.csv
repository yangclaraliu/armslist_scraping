Its supposed to be more accurate and obviously more compact. It has about 150 rounds through it and shoots like a dream. I have never had a single malfunction of any kind with this gun.  The recoil is similar to a 12 ga with bird shot(seriously). The Concussion however is a whole different story.

Fits Remington 722 and 40x as well. 
Lightly used. Mounted on a Begara B-14 HMR (remington 700 clone) for two range sessions. I shot sub half MOA. Rail locks up solid with no wiggle. I purchased this rail with the intention of transplanting my scope with qd rings from rifle to rifle. That was naive of me. Now that I know I have a great rifle, scope combo, I am no longer needing the rail as I'm going with a fixed base/ring combo.
Highly rated and made in USA.
Will include allen wrench, mounting screws (I think I even have the original packaging as well).

It Works AMAZING! (That means I’ve used it, some people can’t pull that from the context clues. How would i know if it works if I haven’t used it?) My price is $450 FIRM. Sorry to be an A-hole, but I don’t care if you have a problem with my price. Seriously. If you “think” you found it cheaper IN STOCK... BUY IT! Don’t waste anybody’s time trying to argue about it. This beats the $600-$1,000 they’re going for on GunBroker and eBay. The reality is NOBODY HAS IT IN STOCK. There’s an 8 week lead time which is only getting longer. Most online shops are saying they are “unsure if they will be restocking.”Sure you can try and pay for it on Franklin’s sure and wait, who knows if they’ll get banned before you get it though. That’s why people are getting away with selling these for as much as $1,000, because people are willing to pay the extra amount to get them before they’re banned (they probably will be, sadly). The ONLY “partial” trades I will consider are Geisselle High speed national match and Super Dynamic 3 Gun triggers. Not as fast as the binary but I don’t really care about shooting full auto fast, I’m looking for a little more precision in my trigger. I’ll also consider 2,500 rounds of BRASS cased 9mm ammo (Factory loads only). No monarch or TulAmmo please.Let me know if you’re interested in the actual trigger.

As I recall, I made effort to protect the nylon from USGI M16/M4 magazines chewing through the bottom of the pouches by improvised cardboard ""pocket liners"" so aluminum corners couldn't rub against nylon. I hand-sewed a red cross patch on to a pocket flap to mark the medical pouch.  If undesired, this is easily removable, without damaging the chest rig, by way of a seam ripper.  I sewed it on with dental floss.  Black permanent marker makes the dental floss blend in nicely with the black background of the patch. For those who may care, this individual chest rig is an Afghanistan veteran. To my knowledge, this chest rig is immediately compatible with the Velocity Systems Plate Carrier/Flak Jacket.   I have all the pieces this came with, to include the back strap, velcro backing of main body, the bungee loops for over the magazine compartments, and the main H harness/shoulder harness piece.Please note that I am not selling any magazines, body armor, or ammunition in this listing.   Magazines or Ammunition pictured here are only for size reference and visual aid purposes.I took the following description of the product from SKDtac.com where I originally bought this product in year 2014: The UW Chest Rig Gen IV is a low-profile mission focused vest built to be ambidextrous and designed to carry the following:  -4 ea 5.56mm magazines, 2 pistol magazines, up to 2 small radios (PRC-152/MBITR)-2 GP pockets, Loops to route antennas, wires and hydration bladder tubing-The H style harness is removable via 4 one inch ITW-Nexus side release buckles and designed to be mounted to the front of the Low-Profile Armor Carrier. Elastic is provided for cable management and antenna relocation.-Built in map pocket with a VELCRO® Brand closure-100% Made in the USA ------------------------- I'll exchange this product for cash. No personal identification necessary for this item. Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.     And I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" . I would receive and cash USPS money order, or would receive payment via the Square Cash ""Cash App"" before getting it well padded and boxed and shipping it out via USPS. And buyer would need to pay for shipping."
