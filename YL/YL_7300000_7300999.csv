I will ship to your FFL for an additional fee.  Price listed is minimum.  If the ad is up, it's still available.  I take my ads down within hours of completing a deal.I have for sale or trade my PSA PA-10 308 AR style rifle.  This is a PSA FACTORY built upper ""kit"" (meaning it came with everything for the lower) and I purchased one of their stripped lowers.  I assembled the lower (which is as easy as eating a piece of pie for a fat guy).  It had some cycling issues at first but I've changed the buffer and it shoots 147 grain 7.62x51 Nato fine now.  The rifle has an 18-inch stainless steel barrel with a midlength gas system, standard A2 style flash hider, mil-spec type trigger and a standard CAR style stock.  It comes with the pictured Magpul 25-round PMag.  I did upgrade the grip to a Magpul pistol grip (doesn't fit the 308 as well as it does the AR15 platforms, but it's MUCH better than the A2 pistol grip), if you want the A2 back on it, I'll be happy to put it back on for you.  It does have some marks from lounging in the safe for months upon months, but that's it.  Never hunted with it, took it to the range, shot it, cleaned it and put it away a few times.  That's pretty much it.  I've shot between 1 and 1.5 MOA at 100 yards with Remington 150 grain Core-Lokt ammo with this.  Haven't made the time to dial it in any closer.  I've run around 100 rounds through this and find myself shooting my Savage 10FP or my M1A if I shoot 308's and I prefer hunting with my 6.8 or 223.  It DOES NOT come with the scope and mount for the price shown.  The scope is a Primary arms 1-8X ACSS reticle in an Aero Precision ultralight mount.  You can add these to the purchase for an additional $400 (retail is around $500-550).  Willing to meet within a reasonable distance of Huntersville and sell face-to-face in accordance with applicable laws. Will ship to your FFL after clearance of payment and receipt of signed FFL copy.  Please email me with questions.Here is the way it will work if you want it shipped (No negotiation on this). -You send me funds for the agreed upon price plus shipping/insurance, nothing more, nothing less-Funds MUST clear prior to shipping, period, this may take a week or two depending on what payment you send. Funds in excess of the agreed upon amount will not be cashed and will be returned to sender.-Your FFL sends me a signed copy of their license, I verify it with ATF, I contact them to verify you have gotten approval for the shipment-I send the item to your FFL and you are responsible for it from thereNo sales to California or other severely restricted states without prior approval.

Its seen some use but as said it functions flawlessly. Soon as i got it i shipped it to factory for the function conversion and they did a full test, cleaning, and checking while servicing the firearm. Cosmetically it has some finish wear and a few dings but nothing that will impede use or function. It held up beautifully in the comps i ran with it and accuracy is what you expect from a SIG if not a touch better."
