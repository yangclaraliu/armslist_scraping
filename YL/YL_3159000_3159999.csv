Description: 
If you're looking for the highest quality and most durable Lower Parts Kit on the market with all of the upgrades, look no further. The Spike’s Tactical Enhanced LPK was designed for the end user who demands the most longevity possible out of the parts in their rifles. The core of the Spike’s Enhanced LPK is the ST Battle Trigger which is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron to give the Battle Trigger a very smooth and crisp trigger pull that breaks at around 5 lbs and gets even smoother the more you shoot it.

The Battle Trigger is held in place via KNS Gen II Mod II Anti-Rotation pins which keep the hammer and trigger pins from walking out (a problem in some 9mm ARs and full auto M4/M16s) and keeps the pin holes from enlarging and “egg-holing” after years and years of use. And we’ve also included an Ambidextrous Safety Selector, our ST Billet Trigger guard with set screw, and an Ergo grip.

The Spike’s Enhanced LPK also features a Mil-Spec bolt catch, mag catch, and mag catch button. As well as utilizing Mil-Spec detents, plungers, pins, and springs. We also include quality spiral roll pins for the trigger guard and bolt catch as well as a ¼” allen screw and washer for the Ergo grip.

This is the best Lower Parts Kit on the market that you can put in your lower. Everything is here that you need to save you money on parts and shipping costs. Order one today to bring your lower to its fullest potential.

311,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3159311,For Sale:  A weekend of shooting fun!,"Madison Lake, Mankato, Minnesota",$ 75,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 17, 2014",Events,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Read this if you enjoy shooting guns!!  Are you bored with the typical range session?  Standing still and shooting paper no longer interest you?  We have the solution!  A couple buddies and I sat down one day and decided to change the way we shoot.  We all had the tacticool rifles and pistols.  We had a pile of ammo suitable for a Zombie invasion.  We had vests, holsters, and other gear.  But we never put all this stuff to use the way it was intended.  We started up a club and named it RAC FRAG, or Responsible Armed Citizens, Fun Run And Gun.  We made custom steel targets.  We made shooting stations.  We set up a course that involves running from station to station and shooting the steel targets at various ranges.  We transition from long range rifle targets to close up pistol targets, and back again.  You can't help but smile when you hear that BANG on the steel plates.  Every gunner gets videoed and timed on their run so it puts a touch of stress into the mix.  This course teaches you how to set up your gear, make quick mag changes, shoot while on the move, and shoot while shaking and out of breath.    We found a fantastic piece of land near Madison Lake MN that we leased to hold our events. Here is a link to my worst run of the day during our last event to show you we are not super tactical operators and you have nothing to be intimidated by:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG9hslsjdRw        We are all having an absolutely superb time doing this.  If you don't have guns and you want to run with us, we have plenty of guns for you to borrow at no cost as long as you pay for the ammo.  Our next big shoot is Saturday, June 28, and we are also going to camp out and shoot all day Sunday too for anybody that might want to join us.   Cost is $75 per person, or $120 to camp overnight and have another day of shooting fun.  We have a generator on site, a portable toilet, and a grill for whatever you want to bring to cook.  We are looking for more people to add to our club so if this sounds like something you might be interested in, respond to this ad and lets chat!  Please let me know if you have any questions or if you want more info.  Check out our website for more pics and videos:   http://rac-frag.weebly.com/  Feel free to register on our home page for our June 28 shoot to hold your spot.  If you register, you will also be placed on our mailing list for regular FRAG updates.  Thanks!!  Cody"

Used and very well maintained with a total of 30 documented shots between the factory and me. This gun is A-1 BAD! There are certain weapons when you put them in your hands you know they are heart breakers and life takers and this is one of them. At nearly 12 lbs it's a beast that's not easy to get through the brush but to be frank this beaut wasn't made to take animals of the four legged variety. 
  See the pic that shows the initial factory 3 round zeroing, that's three shots in .23 or sub 1/4 MOA! I have not found one SPR in any config documented from factory better, you want accuracy here it is. It took me a long time to find a rifle in any config with that kind of documented accuracy out of the box. It's a rock solid, no flash, hide in the shadows tac-driver. If you know about these rifles then you know what you're looking at is something you are not going to find often. 
  The weapon's always functioned flawlessly and throws bullets down range like a dream. Scope not included. The accessories that are included are a set of Leupold QD 1"" rings, two sets of BlackHawk Twist lock sling swivels for use in any of the rifles 6 QD locations, one set in the standard sling swivel config and one set in the HK snap hook config. Also included is a tactical sling, and a Harris BRS swivel action bipod. An advantage the A5M TBM models have over all the other SPR models is that, while some of the other SPR models do use a magazine setup instead of the longer to load and less efficient hinged floorplate design, the A5M TBM's all come with a 5 round magazine instead of the non-TBM standard 4 round Magazines. Also having the TBM setup on the A5M enables the weapon to use factory FN ten rounds magazines, a full 150% higher firing capacity than the hinged floor plate and standard magazine models (both at 4 rounds). Here along with the standard 5rd TBMag I've included an extra 10rd FN Manufactured TBMag. 
  Bottom line this thing is a beast and you will NEVER find a better out of the box bolt action rifle. Here's a link to the FN USA website page on this exact weapon, http://www.fnhusa.com/l/products/rifles/spr-series/spr-a5m/ . $2,500 cash OBO.

European American Armory Bounty Hunter Revolver Single Action Army .22LR /.22WMR 4.75"" Barrell, Nickel Finish

The Bounty Hunter single action revolver has been sold in the USA for over 20 years. Made in Germany and available in 22LR /22WMR, .357 Mag, .44 Mag and 45 LC, it is simply one of the best single action revolvers produced. You can purchase a more expensive, or a famous brand, but you won’t be getting a better single action firearm. The Bounty Hunter is a traditional 6 shot single action revolver with traditional resting notch, but it also has a transfer bar and recessed chambers for shooting safety. Our 22LR/22WMR version is on a full size frame unlike our competition. So you can practice your Cowboy Action Shooting with rimfire or go plinking with our 6rd or 8rd rimfire cylinders. There are a lot of single action revolvers out there but none better than The Bounty Hunter from EAA Corp.

WINDICATOR - The small frame, double action revolver is universally excepted as one of the most useful and most effective self defensive pistols in firearms history. Regardless of an individual's level of skill, most experts agree that when it comes to self defense, keeping it simple makes the most sense. Five words best describe the Windicator: Simple, reliable, durable, accurate, and affordable. Weihrauch has been producing the trusty ""Windicator"" pistol for over 25 years, and it has not changed at all. It is an excellent choice for concealed carry, home defense, or duty backup. Windicators are available in .357 Magnum on a steel frame with a 2"" or 4"" barrel, or .38 Special on an alloy frame with 2"" or 4"" barrel. (See specs below for this item.) Standard features include: Internal firing pin block, Coil mainspring, Grooved target trigger, Serrated cylinder latch, Low profile non snag sights, and Rubber target grips.
Standard features include:
* Full Power in a Small Frame
* Grooved Target Trigger
* Non-Snag Design

The Modifications:

The rifle comes from the factory with a stainless steel National Match Medium Contour Barrel, trigger group, and National Match front and rear sights.

The original color of the stock and handguard was what I like to refer to as “bullet sponge black”, and was changed to Light Woodland Green. 

The handguard was clearanced and siliconed to the front ferrule and rear of barrel to keep it from moving/rattling (a National Match accurizing modification). 

The gas cylinder was shimmed so that the gas cylinder lock would start to tighten at the 4:30 position (another National Match accurizing modification).

This is what it cost me to build this rifle. This is a great rifle at a great price! There were many hours spent installing the above parts, and would have easily been over $300 in labor fees to have a gunsmith build this rifle. This expense is not included in the price. The rifle has been function checked with exactly 20 rounds of ball ammo to ensure reliable function after installation of all Nation Match upgraded parts."

Magazine is factory Blue Steel 19 shot, 19+1 Capacity. The Magazine’s Plus 2 plate bears the maker’s name, Mec-Gar; Trigger is black finished .350 smooth faced in the 5 pound vicinity with minimal felt creep.

Since that time, my interest in history and my desire to make knives have continued to grow. I became a full time bladesmith in 1988. My inspiration continues to come from frontier America - a time when the equipment a person carried meant sustenance and survival. I strive to be innovative, while maintaining a recognizable style.

Model K10/22TD Takedown .22LR 18.5 Inch Stainless Steel Barrel Adjustable Sights 10 Round Includes Backpack-Style Case
This rifle separates into two halves for convenient transport and storage options. Barrel and forend easily separates from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need adjustment after the first reassembly. Lockup is secure and repeatable ensuring an accurate return to zero - even when receiver mounted optics are used. Shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide extra storage. Padded, single-shoulder strap. Gun features include a black synthetic stock and forearm, an 18.50 inch stainless steel barrel with six grooves and a 1:16 inch right hand rifle twist. Clear matte finish. Adjustable rear sight and gold bead front sight. Ten round rotary magazine included. Weighs 4.67 pounds and is 37 inches long when assembled with each half being less than 20.25 inches when disassembled.
 The Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America's favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

  Taken in on trade, we really weren't sure what to do with it. Functions beautifully, but it's just so darn ugly! Clearly a daily carry for quite some time, it's worn, scratched up... just all around rough looking. So it sat on the workbench while I debated it's fate, finally it's up for sale.

   It's a cool gun, basically a S&W version of the Walther P99. Frame is made by Walther, slide by Smith. One of it's remarkable & unique features is the fact that it has a decocker, combining the simple reliability of the striker fire pistol with the benefits of a DA/SA gun. Chamber a round, push the button on the slide, and the trigger resets to the forward position. Great for carry, gives the first trigger pull a long, heavier feel, with all following shots having a short, crisp pull.

   Toss it in the glovebox, camp gear, tacklebox, or drag it around on your hip. You certainly don't have to fret about keeping it pretty, it's far too late for that!

The V50SS-300 rifle features a massive SAE 4150 receiver and a three lug bolt with a 60-degree bolt throw, cock on opening action, a shell holder type extractor for absolutely positive extraction, and a machined aircraft grade aluminum stock. The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel is 36” long, has 8 grooves, 1-15” right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system for absolute safety. This rifle also features a high efficiency ""shark fin"" muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be “Tuned” to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the “sweet spot” for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a “primary extraction” cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The stock is machined from aircraft aluminum bar stock. This stock is made to machine tool tolerances and is completely impervious to climate and temperature. It is attached to an aluminum buttstock with a shock absorbing recoil to further reduce felt recoil and allow the shooter to comfortably shoot all day.

A bipod mounting rod is threaded into the stock, securing the oversized recoil shoulder and locking the recoil shoulder to the stock for increased accuracy. A heavy-duty M14 type bipod is also included in this package. This bipod is constructed of heavy duty STEEL, not aluminum, as are other bipods. This bipod will hold up to heavy duty use! It features adjustable steel legs, which adjust for length, a baked on black enamel finish for long lasting corrosion protection, an allen screw lock, and it folds up for transport.

Specifications: Overall Length: 52"" / 1321mm Barrel Length: 36” / 762mm Barrel Twist: 1-15"" / 1/381mm, RH, 8 groove Weight: 30.0 Lbs / 13.6 kg Recoil: 19 ft/lbs / 2.62 kg/m / 25.7 Joules    I never fired it and dont know where too go too shoot it!

Best I can tell it's manufactured between 1919-1932. 
I bought this from my grandfather years ago, but never wanted to shoot it because it's in such perfect condition especially considering the age. The blueing and the stock seem to be the quality you hope for in today's high end rifles. It's a heavy barrel, scoped (I don't know anything about the old scope on it). I hope for this rifle to go to someone who will take care of it and appreciate the quality and craftsmanship. It's far cry from today's .22 cals.
If anyone has some knowledge to share on these old guns I would be happy to hear what you know.

Shoots consistent 1 inch groups.  With steady use of the iron sights.
Has a Colt Bull Barrel Upper with a target crown, on a Bushmaster lower.
This rifle was made for accuracy, back when everything was not put out as fast as possible.
Not made in the second and third shift of a company.
Have used this in 600 yard competition, with some pretty good scores.
And I am not even a very skilled long range iron sight shooter.
Have an example of a target shot at 100 yards, with a 3 shot group measuring 0.580 inches.
Pictured is :
-AR 15 Rifle.
-100 rounds of 75 gr match grade ammo. The heaviest bullet that will fit in the magazine.
-Black AR rifle bag.
- 1 Ten round magazine, for shooting from the prone position.
-1 30 round magazine.
-1 Ten round magazine that looks like a 30 rounder.
If you ever wanted a match grade rifle, one that shoots better than your 16 inch barreled AR. This is your chance.   Have too many guns, Just need to make space.
No Trades needed.

The Ruger P95 is a semi-automatic large-frame pistol chambered in 9mm. The P-Series have been available in the US since 1987 and are marketed as economically priced all-purpose pistols.
The P-95 uses a short-recoil, locked-breech system where the backwards force is absorbed by the slide rather than the frame. Although there are many locked-breech handguns, the P-Series uses a design similar to the SIG P220 and 1911 pistols.
It has a black polymer frame, stainless steel slide, and a double-stacked 10- or 15-round magazine.
Ruger recommends the P-95 for self-defense, tactical and sport shooting.
