If you reply asking if I still have it I will not reply back. I WILL NOT DELIVER!EDIT* I moved the safe to my living room and noticed the bottom has started to rust. I can sand it down and use rustoleum on it or you can buy as is. The rest of the safe is in good condition. This does not affect the door of the safe, unless a thief is going to break in through the bottom of the safe it is still good. . 
$550.00 - I am selling my overflow safe, I no longer need it and am going to be moving in a few months – want to go ahead and sell it now rather than pay extra to have it moved.
It is a Cannon Safari 48 Gun Safe. 40” wide, 24” deep and 58.5” Tall. Weighs around 625-650 pounds. Cannon does not make the Safari Series any longer, the closest I have found is the Shield Series which does not have the accessories/pistol/rifle holder built into the door. The door has a place for pistols, a rifle, 2 accessories pockets and a pocket for paperwork. The shelves on the right side can be removed for more long rifle storage.
You will need to bring a truck/trailer, blankets, straps, appliance dolly and a few people to help you load the safe. I will get it to the front door of my downstairs apartment which is near Wethimer and Wilcrest (West Houston). There is about a 4” drop from my apartment to the front patio and about a 6” curb drop, other than that fairly easy to move.

LaRue Targets are made of the highest quality materials and are produced on computer numerically controlled (CNC) machinery that gives consistent high quality. The overall dimensions are 28 inches high, 32 inches wide and is made of 3/8 inch steel plate that is hardened to 500 Brinell. Silhouette plates are rated to accommodate 7.62mm NATO, but have been shot them with .300 Winchester Magnum at ranges as close as 200 meters without ill effect. LaRue targets are battery powered and will cycle through approximately 1,800 down and up cycles before requiring a recharge. After being hit, the target returns to the upright position and automatically shuts off until the silhouette is again hit and knocked down. This is the primary reason for the systems long battery life. It also precludes having to turn the targets off and on, although there is a master on/off switch. The targets are weatherproof and can be left out without damage. Users have reported leaving LaRue targets exposed to the weather over a year's time without affecting their operation. LaRue Tactical stands behind the quality of its targets and will repair or replace any target that is found to be defective. Military & Law Enforcement agency sales only Some of the main advantages over traditional targets are: Battery Powered. Automatically resets 1800 times between charges. Man Portable. 72 lbs total weight. Self Contained. No assembly required, no set-up, no hoses, no wires! Battle Tough. 3/8"" thick 500 Brinnell target. Withstands .223s and .308s. Weatherproof.

My wife and I are looking at buying a house, so im thining the collection to help fund that. Other wise I would not be selling it. The guns has a number of upgrade parts, some for the basic .45acp configuration, and some for running the .45 SUPER loads I use.Parts that are in the gunPowder River Sear, and Match/Target triggerSpringer precision 1911 guide rod with wolf 24Lb, and 28Lb extra power recoil springsWolff extra power Firing pin spring Wolff extra power Magazine spring in one mag, stock spring in the other (didnt find the mag springs necessary so did change the second one)5.71"" Threaded StormLake match stainless barrel with LoneWolf .460 Rowland muzzle break, recontoured for the smaller XD slide. I did this myself, so its not perfect, but does look pretty good. TPA SIG Fully adjustable, white outline, target sights.Parts included with the gunstandard XD 5"" barrelStandard hollow recoil spring guidWolff heavy weight Recoil spring guide18Lb stock spring20Lb Wolff extra power spring....This can be used with standard ACP loads, as well as lower end .45Super loads. CMB Razor tactical muzzle brake. This break looks cleaner on the pistol than the LW brake does, but dosent do as good a job at attenuating the recoil generated by top end .45Super loads.Ok so a little history on the pistol, and the reason for the parts etc.Ive owned the gun for a while, and have spent quite a bit of time and energy on it. The pistols fun, accurate, and with the correct loading VERY powerful. The parts ive added are all basicly to duplicate the .460 Rowland, but with a standard .45 ACP chamber, which allows the use of regular ACP rounds without swaping barrels (cause taking off the muzzle breaks is annoying). With the different guids, and springs, the gun can be tailored to run reliably with anything from regular 230 ball rounds at 850 upto (and exceeding, tho i never felt the need), 230s loaded to 1250FPS in the correct .45 super brass. Right now the gun is set up with the LW break and 24# spring, which allows it to comfortably handle all but the weakest .45ACP ammo, as well as what became my standard loadings of 200grn XTPs at 1250 (the 230s didnt seem to work any better and recoiled quite a bit more). I will include my load data, reloading dies, and what components i have left.thanksKeaoREDACTED"

Its a pretty rare quad and it makes a lot of torque and it will pull just about whatever. It would make a very good work or farm atv or even pulling quad. It gets very good fuel mileage around double that of a gas sportsman. It only has right under 1500 miles on it so very low for the year and for a diesel motor. It has independent suspension front and rear and is shaft driven. It runs and rides good and is an automatic tranny with high and low range and reverse. The tires have half tread front and rear and no dry rot or weather cracking. It does need a battery but can jump start it and being a diesel it runs just fine with no battery. It could also use a new seat cover as well. If your looking for something different or an atv to match your diesel truck this is it. Bill of sale only.
