All FLEX TLS components mount and remove from the gun in seconds—without tools. The FLEX tactical shotgun features a 20"" cylinder bore barrel with a bead sight, and a 6-position, adjustable stock with a full pistol grip, and tri-rail tactical forend. An anti-reflective finish on the barrel, receiver, and magazine tube resists corrosion. The U.S. Military's choice of Model 500 and 590 pump shotguns for combat attests to the design's reliable function and durability. The Model 500 pump-action shotgun uses dual action bars, dual extractors, an anti-jam shell elevator, and a large locking lug for a solid steel-to-steel, bolt-to-barrel connection. Sling swivel studs are standard. Shooters can reach the top-mounted safety quickly with the thumb of either hand, making it naturally ambidextrous.

Hornady Black - Avg velocity 2654 fps with an SD of 20 fps and extreme spread of 82 fpsHornady Match - Avg velocity 2670 fps with an SD of 37.6 fps and extreme spread of 143 fps.  I really exptected the Hornady match to perform better.  I think I got a bad batch.  I literally had a dud.  Ran it through my rifle twice and nothing.  If I keep this rifle I will most likely try this ammo again just to be sure.  Groups were good, right at an inch, but the Black grouped just slightly better.Federal Premium - Avg velocity of 2676 fps with an SD of 19 fps and extreme spread of 69 fps.  I ran two boxes because the first box I messed up with the chronograph data and didn't have definitive/reliable data.  This ammo shot the best.  I had one group right at a half inch (3 shot group though).PPU Match - 2731 fps with an SD of 21.5 and an extreme spread of 82 fps.  Consisitent ammo, but consistently produced poor groups.It's a great/fun rifle but I've decided I want to build another bolt gun.  I just have a preference for bot guns.  I would like $1,000 for the rifle as described and pictured.  The magazine pictured is actually a 6.8spc magazine and not included (I used it for pictures for the Cerakoter).  I have 2 5 round magpul magazine that will be included.Any questions please let me know.Local sale only.  I will not ship."

Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.FOR ADDITIONAL PICTURES: http://www.israel-arms.com/product-p/us128774b.htm  Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear. When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic with a protective coating for complete corrosion resistance. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.Visit our website for additional pictures of this rifle: https://www.bugoutguns.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=US128774B"

In fact, the Scarab uses modified M10 magazines (an extra cut added in the top side to match with its mag catch) and is threaded for MAC barrel extensions or suppressors. The rate reducing mechanism from the vz.61 is absent (no surprise, as the Scarab is semi-auto only), and the FCG is a copy of a basic AK FCG.  The upper assembly is stamped and folded like a MAC, and the bolt is designed to be extremely simple to manufacture. Includes One 15 round magazine and a very nice Pleican Style Case."
