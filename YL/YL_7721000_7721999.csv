It runs and drives but does need a little work to run perfectly (nothing major, just needs the carbs tuned). I rode it throughout the summer and into the fall and as of right now it has about 53,000 miles on it which is pretty good for an antique bike like this one. It has a brand new seat, an internally coated gas tank so it will never rust, 4 cylinders, and front and rear disc brakes. Back in September it did tip over in a parking lot going about 5-10mph. Besides some minor cosmetic damage (a scuff on the exhaust pipe and a small dent on the gas tank which I believe can be filled in and painted over) it didn't sustain any serious damage. Other than the carb tuning all it will need put it on the road is a new points cover (which I do have on hand and will probably put on myself), and a new lens for the front right blinker (which I also have on hand and will probably put on myself). This is a very powerful bike and I'm looking to replace it with something smaller and a little more off road friendly."

Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.
First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.
Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.
Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.
Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.
It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

494,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7721494,For Sale:  AK-47/AKM barreled action (For parts only),"Suwanee, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 300,"Listed On: Monday, December 18, 2017",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have for sale here a barrelled action for an AK. The receiver is an IO receiver, the barrel is unmarked, but I believe it is a US barrel. The rest of the parts appear to be surplus. I bought this action locally with a project in mind, however it never amassed to anything, thus why I am listing it here. The condition is not exactly the best, but I believe it is serviceable. The threads look to have been damaged at the front by the previous owner. Despite this, I have been able to thread on a muzzle nut, slant brake, and TAPCO '74 style brake easily. The detent for holding on a muzzle attachment however is stuck. I have read however it is not too difficult to fix this (knocking out a pin and replacing the spring if I am not mistaken). The gas tube latch has been broken off, how I do not know. However it does still retain a gas tube fairly well, however I would not condone shooting it with the latch broken off. You could, but I personally wouldn't. Onto the safety area, it looks like someone drilled two holes in an attempt to make a two position selector although this is not a full auto as it does not have the hole for the third pin (although interestingly someone did use an axis pin in place of the center support rivet, unless it is an incredibly smashed rivet, I honestly cannot tell). The trigger guard is wobbly, however the catch for the magazine works flawlessly. I have tried various magazines and all worked very well except the russian slabsides, they were exceptionally tight and one I had to tap out gently using a rubber mallet.  The barrel, despite the thread discrepancy, has a good crown and is in great shape inside. These condition issues are why I am selling this as parts only, although there is a receiver. I could saw the receiver into sections though if the buyer wanted. Or if you want to take another route, you could as well build a shooter of sorts. The fate of this action is up to the buyer.
 
Onto payment, etc. Forms of payment I accept are cash and money orders. I would accept paypal, however they are a royal pain I honestly choose not to deal with. For shipping, etc. I can ship to an FFL if needed, however I prefer face to face transactions as it is simpler. However I am totally flexible. I am asking $300 or best offer. If you have any questions or concerns you wish to have addressed, feel free to contact me! Thank you for looking. If I made any goofs I apologize, as this is my first armslist listing."

I'm selling:
4 New-In-Plastic Sig OEM p220 .45 Auto magazines, 10 round capacity,
4 New-In-Plastic Sig OEM p220 .45 Auto magazines, 8 round capacity,
1 Used Sig OEM p220 .45 Auto magazines, 10 round capacity, and
1 Used Sig OEM p220 .45 Auto magazines, 8 round capacity, 
 
The 10 round magazines hangs out the bottom of the grip of the pistol and have that removable plastic sleeve around the base. 
 
I am not selling any ammunition pictured here.  Ammunition in the photo is for size reference only.
 
Condition of the USED ones:
""very good."" Probably in Excellent condition, but I'll low-ball it and call them ""very good."" I have been the only owner of these. These have probably each been loaded and fired through the gun 4 to 5 times. I did not clean them afterwards.
 
Condition of the New-In-Plastic ones:
I purchased these brand new, from Aimsurplus.com, in year 2015.  Since then, they have been nested together in a cardboard box, doing nothing.   I have been the only owner.   I was pleased to discover, upon purchase and receipt, that each magazine comes in a thin layer of light oil, wrapped in plastic, and then placed into yet another, larger layer of plastic that bears barcode labeling and hole for hanging on store shelving.  Thus, they stored fabulously and rust/corrosion has not been a concern.   So their condition is ""like new"" to ""new in plastic"".  Caveat: as likely discernible in my photos, there are some spots of wear/abrasion to the thin plastic packaging from shipping.
 
I purchased these back when I was convinced that somebody who wanted to trample fun and freedom was going to get elected for 2017 and my few favorite toys were going to become very challenging to get supplies for.   Whoops, more battle rattle sitting around than I really want now.
 
Let my mistake be your gain.
 
At the time of this writing (13 November 2017), Aimsurplus.com, PalmettoStateArmory.com, and 44mag.com are all out of stock for these; natchezss.com wants $40.99 for an 8 Round OEM Sig P220 magazine, and sigsauer.com wants $44 for either an 8 Round or 10 round OEM Sig P220 magazine!
 
I'll sell my New-In-Plastic ones for $30 per, such that you can get New Sig OEM magazines at around Glock prices.   I'll sell the used ones at $25 per, such that you get Sig OEM magazines at bargain pricing.
 
I'll exchange for cash. No personal identification necessary for this item. Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.    
 
And I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" .   I would receive and cash USPS money order before getting the order boxed and shipping it out via USPS.  And buyer would need to pay for shipping.
 
I now accept Square Cash (Cash App) as well as USPS money order.
 
I will not ship magazines to California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York.
 
I took more pictures than the 3 I am able to post on Armslist with my free account.  If you want more pics, please let me know and I can email them."

1 Used Sig OEM p220 .45 Auto magazines, 10 round capacity, and
1 Used Sig OEM p220 .45 Auto magazines, 8 round capacity, 
The 10 round magazines hangs out the bottom of the grip of the pistol and have that removable plastic sleeve around the base. 
I am not selling any ammunition pictured here.  Ammunition in the photo is for size reference only.
Condition of the USED ones:
""very good."" Probably in Excellent condition, but I'll low-ball it and call them ""very good."" I have been the only owner of these. These have probably each been loaded and fired through the gun 4 to 5 times. I did not clean them afterwards.
Condition of the New-In-Plastic ones:
I purchased these brand new, from Aimsurplus.com, in year 2015.  Since then, they have been nested together in a cardboard box, doing nothing.   I have been the only owner.   I was pleased to discover, upon purchase and receipt, that each magazine comes in a thin layer of light oil, wrapped in plastic, and then placed into yet another, larger layer of plastic that bears barcode labeling and hole for hanging on store shelving.  Thus, they stored fabulously and rust/corrosion has not been a concern.   So their condition is ""like new"" to ""new in plastic"".  Caveat: as likely discernible in my photos, there are some spots of wear/abrasion to the thin plastic packaging from shipping.
 I purchased these back when I was convinced that somebody who wanted to trample fun and freedom was going to get elected for 2017 and my few favorite toys were going to become very challenging to get supplies for.   Whoops, more battle rattle sitting around than I really want now.
 Let my mistake be your gain.
 At the time of this writing (13 November 2017), Aimsurplus.com, PalmettoStateArmory.com, and 44mag.com are all out of stock for these; natchezss.com wants $40.99 for an 8 Round OEM Sig P220 magazine, and sigsauer.com wants $44 for either an 8 Round or 10 round OEM Sig P220 magazine!
I'll sell my New-In-Plastic Sig P220 mags, as well as my very-little-used Used ones, for $35 per magazine.
I'll exchange for cash. No personal identification necessary for this item. Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.    
And I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" .   I would receive and cash USPS money order before getting the order boxed and shipping it out via USPS.  And buyer would need to pay for shipping.
I now accept Square Cash (Cash App) as well as USPS money order.
I will not ship magazines to California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York.
I took more pictures than the 3 I am able to post on Armslist with my free account.  If you want more pics, please let me know and I can email them."

785,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7721785,For Sale:  HK 5.56x45mm magazines,"Merrimack, NH, Greenville, South Carolina",$ 35,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 7, 2018",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have for sale, not for trade, 4 Heckler and Koch 5.56x45mm Magazines, made in Germany, 30 round capacity, steel-bodied.  These are for AR-15, M4, M-16 rifles.  I don't know if they are compatible with other rifles/magazine wells.
$35 per magazine.  
Full disclosure time: 
Being steel, these are heavy in weight.
I have not been using these, (I don't know if I've ever actually gone shooting with these particular 4) so I can't truly attest for their functionality beyond loading 2 rounds of .223 in each magazine to get pictures of the fit of the feed lips.   I have no reason to believe they don't function.
I see in the pictures that two of them have the front most portion of the magazine base plate dented.
One of these shows significant wear to the finish.
I have not spotted rust on any of these.
Each of these is likely to have spent 7-14 months in Iraq, getting placed on chicken wire, fabric, and sand barriers two to six times a day during weapon loading and unloading, have been bounced around inside of Humvees, scratched, and coated with moondust.
The wear on them is probably all administrative and day to day things, with some trips to the rifle range for practice or qualification.
I imagine each one of these wants to be disassembled and given a good cleaning with an air hose or better yet, a little bit of light oil and a swabbing from a rag to get dust and grit out of them.
They probably spent months at a time loaded with 28 to 30 rounds while deployed. I don't believe that is any problem for the spring steel, but I mention in case that's a concern to a buyer.  I want to mention everything that might come to my mind as a concern if I were to go buying things from private sellers I've never met before on the internet.

I'm selling my New, Unused, Safariland 6280-7712-551 holster.   I bought it new, directly from the manufacturer, that is to say Safariland, a couple years ago (back in 2015 if memory serves me) back when I thought I was going to get a railed Sig P220 and make it my go-to handgun.THIS HOLSTER IS DESIGNED FOR RIGHT-HANDED DRAW .  THIS IS A LIGHT-BEARING-PISTOL HOLSTER - MANUFACTURER SAYS IT WILL NOT RETAIN THE PISTOL WITHOUT A LIGHT ATTACHED.When I filled out the ""holster finder"" thing on their website to get this, I said it was for a Sig P220 with Surefire X300 Attached.  With this listing, I am including a good picture of the label so a buyer can see all the info the manufacturer printed on the packaging in case a buyer wants to contact the manufacturer to have technical/compatibility questions answered.  For instance, to ask safariland what other lights fit inside this holster attached to the Sig pistol.Condition: New-In-Plastic to Like-New.  I bought this new from the manufacturer.  I never holstered a gun in it, and have no reason to believe the manufacturer did either.  Caveat: the packaging shows signs of shipping and storage.This is an SLS holster.  (It's got the bale and does not have the ALS system)My price is $105 for the product shipped via USPS flat rate box.  (a $13.65 Value to the buyer)
 Note: I am not selling any ammunition with this listing.  Just the holster and its packing.   Also, the dollar bill pictured is not for sale (unless you really want it and then I can raise the price by a dollar for you, but then i'd have to go and flatten out another nice new dollar bill).  The dollar bill is in there for size reference only.
If we meet for the sale/exchange:  I'll exchange for cash. No personal identification necessary for this item. Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.    
However, I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" .   I would receive and cash USPS money order, or Square Cash (the Cash App) before getting the order boxed and shipping it out via USPS. 
I now accept Square Cash (Cash App) as well as USPS money order.
I took more pictures than the 3 I am able to post on Armslist with my free account.  If you want more pics, please let me know and I can email them.If you're a Sig P220 gunner, or if you are shopping for someone who is, please check out my other listings with the BARGAIN pricing I have on New-In-Plastic and some used, Sig P220 (.45 Auto) Magazines.  Order all at once and lower your shipping cost.
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product."
