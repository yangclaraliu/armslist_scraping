Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

This rifle comes in Good, Mostly Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. There is a moderate amount of rusting, and pitting on both the receiver, and down the length of the barrel. However, that is it! This rifle features a wood stock that is completely unblemished, and free of any severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, nicks, cuts, gouges, staining, or discoloration. This rifle features a gold trigger, as well as the original sights, as the rifle has not been drilled and tapped so that a rifle can be attached. The insided of the receiver also shows some rusting, and other wear. All of which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and saw regular usage. Despite the visible wear, this is still a fantastic rifle, that would make a great addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this firearm, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

For sale: Very nice USED Walther P-38 Semiautomatic Pistol in 9mm.
Beautiful blued finish. Steel slide. Alloy receiver. Made in West Germany.It's Post War, so leave your Nazi treasures in the safe and shoot it instead.Matching serial numbers.You decide the actual condition.
I am not the original owner.
There are two things I readily appreciate about this pistol: first is the complexity of the engineering, which is yet coupled with utmost reliability of function. Being of a military heritage, it had to be designed and engineered to a high standard. Next is the beautiful bluing, which is no longer found in non-custom current guns; and, to me, only surpassed by the old Smiths and Colts. For the most part, because of EPA regulations, the chemicals needed to blue guns traditionally are now only used in Mother Europe!
Gun comes with two 8-round magazines. This is a show piece, not a high-capacity lead sprayer. ;)
$500 or first reasonable sounding offer. Will also consider the combination of cash and ammo.
No waiting, No sales tax, No shipping charges. No FFL transfer fees.________________________________________________________________________________  Buyer agrees to quickly show me a valid TX Driver’s License and CHL first and sign a simple Bill of Sale. -> Nothing besides our names/signatures and the gun info will be on it. I’d be more than happy to send you a copy so you can see what mine looks like.A Bill of Sale will protect us both.

This rifle features a wood stock, which looks absolutely beautiful, even after almost 40 years! It does have some minor wear, such as light scratches and scrapes, as well as a couple of minor nicks. This rifle's receiver does show a bit more wear in the form of minor rusting and pitting, as well as some staining/discoloration. There is also some rusting visible inside the receiver's chamber, and lighter spots down the length of the barrel. Both are free of any major signs of pitting. This rifle comes with a side-mounted rifle scope already attached, as well as it's original sights. This is a fantastic rifle, still, all these years later, and would make an excellent addition to anybody's collection.

The upper and lower are both hardcoated anodized, film coated and lined as per MIL-SPECs at the time.  This is the same finish used on the original rifles.  The 12.5"" barrel has a MIL-SPEC profile with a pinned and welded ""moderator"" muzzle device (a flash suppressor since BATFE has stated that the moderator is a Class III device).  The barrel has a 1:12 twist, is chrome lined, and Parkerized externally.  The plastic handguards, A1 style front post, tear drop cartridge forward assist, and carry hand rear sight are period-correct.  The sling and pistol are actual Vietnam era USG issue parts.It comes with a Vietnam era type cleaning kit, 20 round GI issue mag, three 30 GI round issue mags, an Operation and Preventence Maintenance manual from the Vietnam era, and the factory shipping box.  I  carried a XM177E2 in my LOACH in RVN and it feels and shoots like the original.  I fired one 30 round magazine through it after I bought it to ensure operability and it's been sitting in the safe ever sense.  I'm asking asking $1100 in cash--NO trades please.  The buyer must show valid good guy VA ID and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  I will only sell to a  VA resident.  I live in Alexandria, but I'm willing to drive a reasonable distance to make the sale.  Thanks for looking!"

This gun is phenomenal and absolutely everything it is advertised to be; unfortunately, the V-Bob grip doesn’t fit my hand and I can’t seem to adjust my aim. The V-Bob is the Commander size and the bobbed grip makes this gun excellent for concealed carry. It is in great condition and hasn’t even reached the 500 round break-in period. There is some minor wear on the frame from the slide-stop lever due to breakdown and cleaning. The gun is in great condition and functions flawlessly. MSRP is $1,695 and since I can’t adjust to the grip, my loss is your gain. I am available by phone or text at REDACTED. I am not interested in any unsolicited sales or stories.Terms are face to face and cash only...no options. Must be 21, have FL ID/DL and prefer a CCW."

There are no major flaws/defects to be found, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, nicks, cuts, staining, rusting, or discoloration. This shotgun features a beautiful dark wood stock, that ends in a replacement soft rubber buttplate. Unfortunately, it is not the original buttplate, and is actually from an Ithaca shotgun. This shotgun's receiver and barrel are in fantastic condition, with no signs of rusting, staining, discoloration, or pitting either on the outside, or on the inside! This shotgun features a rail system that has been attached to the top of the shotgun, so that a scope or other optic can be easily added, as well as a ported 22"" barrel. This is a fantastic shotgun, that would make an excellent addition to anybody's collection.
