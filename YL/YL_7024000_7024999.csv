The M77 is designed on the basis of the AK-47 rifles from the USSR.The rifle's action is operated by a long-stroke AK gas piston modified to handle the .308 cartridges. A 3-position gas adjustment ring, located behind the gas block, can be twisted to increase or decrease the level of pressure directed into the piston so that the rifle can cycle a variety of surplus and factory-fresh ammunition.The 19.70” cold-forged barrel has a threaded muzzle with a steel thread protector welded in place to prevent the attachment of flash hiders or other muzzle accessories. The iron sights are of the standard AK variety. The front sight post can be adjusted for height and windage using an AK sight tool while the rear sight leaf is optimistically notched for shots out to 1000 meters. The bolt handle and selector lever are found on the right side of the receiver and operate in typical AK fashion, as does the magazine release. Since the bolt does not have an internal mechanism to lock it open, Zastava opted to cut a bolt notch into the selector lever. While holding the bolt open, swing the lever up into the Safe to catch the bolt. When the lever is moved back down into the Fire position, the bolt will close. This was a handy feature out on the shooting range. The steel bow trigger is rounded and comfortable to work with. With a smooth, grit-free pull, the trigger required 4-pounds 8-ounces of pressure to cycle. The upper and lower hand guards are constructed of a black polymer, as is the thumbhole shoulder stock. Some thumbhole stocks leave much to be desired, but the M77's Monte Carlo-style stock is well-designed. The grip is hand filling, a rubber buttpad successfully mitigates felt recoil, and the raised cheek piece provides a comfortable fit when shouldering the gun. These rifles are rare to see for sale. These rifles will not be imported into the United States ever again. Great weapon for any bodies collection. I also have 700 rounds of .308 that I will throw in for an extra price. The rifle also comes with a new dual rail steel side mount from Century International Arms.SpecificationsDistributor: Century International Arms Manufacturer: Zastava Arms Model: M77 PS RifleAction: Adjustable Gas-Piston Semi AutoCaliber: .308 Win.Receiver: Stamped Slant-Cut AK Type ReceiverStock: Black Polymer Thumbhole with Rubber Butt PadHand Guards: Black PolymerSights: AK Type AdjustableBarrel Length: 19.70”Overall Length: 40.55“Weight: 8 lbs. 10 ozs. with empty magazine Capacity: 10+1 rounds and 20+1 roundsTwist: 1:12” RHRifle Grooves: 6Accessories: (2)10-Round Magazines, (3)20 round Magizines, New Century International Arms dual rail steel side mount in the box, Original Box and Owner's ManuaLSold as is with absolutely no returns.

This may be one of the only only Sig MCXs for sale in all of CA right now so check it out. Please only respond with a fair $ offer or a reasosbile trade.  Unlike every other firearm on the market, the SIG MCX was built for optimum performance with the 300BLK cartridge and a suppressor. The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes polymer magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing for side-folding stocks. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. https://www.sigsauer.com/store/sig-mcx-patrol.html"

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. Designed to minimize creep and stacking, the P-10’s trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5 lbs and rebounds with a short, positive reset, meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1.Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.Payment Options:The quickest and easiest method of payment is moneygramm/westernunion or money order. (although paying by money order does significantly delay the shipping time). IF YOU PAY BY MONEY ORDER etc THEN YOUR SHIPMENT WILL BE DELAYED UNTIL IT CLEARS THE BANK, *NO* EXCEPTIONS.We prefer payment by moneygramm/westernunion .

Email me a very detailed description of your firearm or if you have more than one email a list with a detailed description and pricing or an idea of how much you need to get out of your trade or trades. Please do not be afraid to tell me about your trade and all you have with it, remember I only know what you tell me. Include a price and photos if possible.
