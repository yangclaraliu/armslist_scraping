A perfect candidate for SBR (Short Barrel Rifle) *, the SLR-104UR rifle is a brand new Bulgarian stamped receiver rifle that is built from all original brand new factory parts and premium quality US made components, from its hammer forged chrome lined barrel to the original Bulgarian Arsenal mil-spec. stamped receiver.

The folding buttstock makes the SLR-104UR compact rifle for carrying easily and locks in its extended position rock-solid and provides all the comfort you need during shooting. The lower handguard comes with Arsenal, Inc.'s stainless steel heat shield, which helps keep your hand cooler when shooting. 

Throw an optical scope on this baby and the SLR-104UR, equipped with a double-stage trigger group, becomes an accurate sharpshooting rifle. Or, cut down the barrel and get a mean looking Krink for yourself *."

Gun Point Custom Shop Proudly Presents this Outstanding State of the Art KAC Knight's Armament Real Deal Military M-110 SASS. P/N: 24123 NSN 1005-01-534-3841. Super hard to get. This is a Military test. Yes this package comes with the suppressor P/N: 24611 SR-M110 NSN 1005-01-542-4487 (not swhown as it is pending transfer from KAC) P/N: 24611 SR-M110 NSN. Leupold MK4 LR/T Matte Scope 3.5-10X40mm M2 Illuminated TMR Reticle. Government contract.

Winner of the U.S. Army award as one of the “Best 10 Inventions” of 2007, the M-110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System (M-110 SASS) is a precision 7.62mm NATO caliber, gas-operated rifle that is highly acclaimed for its battlefield performance. The rifle’s inherent accuracy, quick-change 20-round magazine, ambidextrous controls, abundant MIL-STD-1913 rail mounting capabilities, and highly effective sound suppressor system all contribute to the system’s combat success. Like the Mk11, the heart of the M-110 system is a 20” Chrome Plated 5R Cut barrel. To meet Army requirements for service in the current theater of operation, a durable flat dark earth colored coating is applied over standard protective finishes. 

US Military Standard (NSN) The US Military codifies all standardized material items of supply with what is known as a National Stock Number or NSN. Any item that they classify this way is given a 13-digit nomenclature signifying its role. Knight’s Armament is proud to have earned slots with the US Military by creating efficient, effective, reliable, and intuitive products that our Nation’s war fighters utilize on a daily basis. Everything from sling mounts, rail cover panels, magazines, and rail adapter systems, up to various Signature Reduction Devices, and the M110 series of sniper rifles have earned a spot with the US Military and assigned an NSN. Only through the highest quality materials and manufacturing processes, coupled with testing and tolerances which far exceed government standards has KAC been able to secure these spots. This same level of quality and care is available to every one of KAC’s customers 

Ambidextrous Controls Knight’s Armament designed this system to give shooters the maximum amount of options in their controls. Under this design all of the weapon’s major controls can be accessed from either side of the lower receiver. Left-handed shooters see the immediate benefits of being able to access the weapon’s controls in a more intuitive manner; however, there are a number of other benefits that right-handed shooters will enjoy under this system. 

Competition shooters benefit from these controls from the increase of speed that is achieved through components such as the right-side bolt catch. Trainers enjoy the variety of options because they can watch their trainee from either side of the weapon and even manipulate the weapon’s controls from the non-operating side. KAC has also introduced modifications to the design such as the scalloped safety selector switch. This allows a lower profile for the selector switch on the non-operating side of the receiver which helps to relieve any interference between the switch and a shooter’s glove or hand. For the maximum amount of configuration and operation options, Knight’s Ambidextrous Controls offer a sure solution. 

Two-Stage Match Trigger All of the weapons available from Knight’s Armament come equipped with a 4.5lb, 2-Stage Match Trigger. This type of trigger mechanism uses a system where, during the rearward squeeze of a trigger, it cycles through two stages of resistance 
The first stage is a ‘no-poundage’ stage where hardly any resistance is felt during the rear-ward squeeze. There is a center point at which point resistance is felt and the second stage of the trigger begins. At this point, 4.5 pounds of force is required to squeeze the trigger through the second stage and cause the weapon to cycle. 

Our 2-stage trigger is meant to inform a shooter of exactly where their weapon is going to fire. This bolsters a firer’s confidence and can also assist in reducing trigger jerk, thereby increasing accuracy. The 4.5lb 2-Stage Trigger from Knight’s Armament is a highly calibrated and smooth component that is sure to be a welcome addition to any setup. 

Presented in Hard Coat Type III Mil-Spec Finish. This is the latest in the line of KAC Knight's Armament that features a 2 Stage KAC Trigger. These units are no longer in production and will be most collectable !! 



This unit will provide outstanding reliability and accuracy for any tactical or sporting situation. This unit incorporates the latest in KAC technology. The KAC rifle line is known the world over for it’s rugged & reliable system taking the AR10 platform to a New Level! Bid with confidence as you will not be disappointed! You are good to go!

Have reloading dies, cases, and some loaded ammunition for it. I sunk way too much money in and am just looking to recover some of the cost!

The FN SCAR is the semi-auto only version of the newest service rifle of U.S. special operators. Light, fast-handling and quick shooting. The FN SCAR 17S is chambered in 7.62x51mm (.308 Win.) and features a free-floating, cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel with chrome-lined bore. Fully-ambidextrous operating controls on both models instantly adapt to any shooter and any shooting position. The receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail and three accessory rails enable the mounting of scopes or electronic sights, plus tactical lights and lasers. The telescoping, side-folding polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length of pull, and is available in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) or matte black.

I bought a black slide for it because I like the look a little better.  It has had a mild trigger spring job done which helped the trigger pull a lot.  I'll include the original spring with the gun.  I also have a Fobus paddle holster that goes with it.  I'd like to trade for either a single action revolver in 38/357 or .44 mag or a center fire rifle.  30-06, 308, 270 etc…  I'd prefer a sporterized 03-A3 but I'm not too picky just no junk.

It includes the comfort pad.  Extremely comfortable holster.  I only buy this brand holster for IWB carry because of the comfort and adjustability.  This will not fit the gun if the laser is attached.  I'm kind of wary about lasers dying when you need them most, so I don't use them.  The second holster is something I bought just because.  It's a Sneaky Petes holster made for the P938.  This holster will allow you to leave the laser attached.  Both Holsters were 60 dollars each not including shipping.

The Winchester Model 1897 evolved from the Winchester Model 1893. The Model 1897 and 1893 were both designed by John Browning. The Model 1897 is an external hammer shotgun lacking a trigger disconnector giving it the ability to slam fire. This means that the user can hold the trigger down while pumping the shotgun and once the pump is returned to the forward position the gun fires. The gun itself is classified as a slide action pump shotgun."

I have a third car that I do not need, and honestly I just don't like driving a front wheel drive car.  It is in excellent mechanical shape and good cosmetic condition.

I am looking to see what kind of trades are out there.  Looking to see what sort of Firearms someone might want to trade for my car.

Your trade value should be in the range of about $2600-$3800.  You can add cash if your firearm value isn't there.  Im fairly open, but i don't want utter crap like Hi-Point, Jennings, Cobra, etc.  Honestly Im looking for a nice mix...doesnt need to be 1 gun worth 3k.  Perfectly happy with a bunch of 400 dollar guns.  Ideal would be a S&W M&P 15 Sport and a couple handguns.

Anyway, here are the specs on the car:

Title is CLEAN/CLEAR in hand, notarized, and ready to go.

2004 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS. 182,950 miles. Power windows work, air works, heat works, power sunroof works, cruise, radio, etc...EVERYTHING works as it should. Runs, drives, stops perfectly. Clean clear title in hand.

*Braided steel clutch lines
*Newer OEM clutch
*New clutch slave & master cylinders
*All braided steel brake lines.
*Side motor mounts are poly (does create a little vibration at idle.
*Front motor mount is brand new OEM, but I also have a solid poly front mount I will include.
*Exhaust is stock and looks brand new.
*HID projector headlights
*Short throw shifter with upgraded bushings & shift cage.

Everything looks clean and functions perfectly. There are a few blemishes on the exterior but nothing crazy. Weird square crack on front bumper, ding on top of passenger door, and ding behind driver door.

No leaks, no trouble codes or lights, currently registered and emissioned.

Everything is as it came from the factory except, I did add a, still unused, Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot optic (as shown in the pics). It also comes with a new Aluminum USGI 30 round mag, a MagPul rear BUS (Back up Sight), NiB Bolt Carrier Group, Upgraded ACT Trigger Group, MagPul furniture, etc. This rifle is brand new, and everything included, is unfired. 

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of, if not the, best mid-level AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests? 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2rG8xXfDbg

This is the premium model, meaning it has the CHF (Cold Hammer Forged barrel), chrome lined pretty much everything, etc. The barrel for this firearm is made by FN (the same barrel that is used for the S.A.W. fully auto machine gun that the US Military uses. You can't find a more dependable and quality AR, with this many high end features, anywhere near this price point...period! I have a Colt and a Daniel Defense AR15 as well, and this PSA is easily on par with both these rifles from a quality standpoint, and that is stock. This AR has many upgrades, making it that much more reliable, easier to clean, etc. 

To recap, here is everything included in this package:
-	Premium Model Carbine, chambered in 5.56/.223
-	CHF (Cold Hammer Forged Barrel) with chrome lined barrel and chamber (1 in 7 twist – can stabilize any available 5.56//223 round out there).
-	Upgraded ACT trigger group (makes the trigger pull much smoother and crisper for increased accuracy and rate of fire)
-	Upgraded NiB (Nickel Boron) complete BCG (Bolt Carrier Group) – NiB is self-lubricating and much easier to clean than standard chrome lined BCG’s. 
-	Upgraded MagPul hand guard and rear BUS (Back up Sight)
-       Upgraded VLTOR BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle (Extremely well made, durable, and much easier to charge the weapon in adverse/stressful situations)
-	Brand New Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot optic. Mounted and co-witnessed with sights
-	New BlackHawk modular carrying case – plenty of room for extras, like mags, ammo, etc. 
-	Everything was fully installed and tested at the factory, with the exception of the optic which I added later, but never used.
-	Owner’s manual and original box that it came in from the factory


Price for the entire package is $1025. Remember this rifle, and everything included, is still unused.

Must be 18 to purchase with valid ID. FTF only, no shipping. CCW owners preferred.

Everything is as it came from the factory except, I did add a, still unused, Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot optic (as shown in the pics). 

This is not one of the ""economy"" entry level PSA AR's. This was custom made by PSA per my specifications. It has only the best components and various high up upgrades typically found in top level AR platforms (like POF, LWRC, etc.). 

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of the best AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests? 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2rG8xXfDbg

This is the premium model, meaning it has the CHF (Cold Hammer Forged barrel), chrome lined pretty much everything, etc. The barrel for this firearm is made by FN (the same barrel that is used for the S.A.W. fully auto machine gun that the US Military uses. You can't find a more dependable and quality AR, with this many high end features, anywhere near this price point...period! I have a Colt and a Daniel Defense AR15 as well, and this PSA is easily on par with both these rifles from a quality standpoint, and that is stock. This AR has many upgrades, making it that much more reliable, easier to clean, etc. 

To recap, here is everything included in this package:
-	Premium Model Carbine, chambered in 5.56/.223
-	CHF (Cold Hammer Forged Barrel) with chrome lined barrel and chamber (1 in 7 twist – can stabilize any available 5.56//223 round out there).
-	Upgraded ACT trigger group (makes the trigger pull much smoother and crisper for increased accuracy and rate of fire)
-	Upgraded NiB (Nickel Boron) complete BCG (Bolt Carrier Group) – NiB is self-lubricating and much easier to clean than standard chrome lined BCG’s. 
-	Upgraded MagPul hand guard and rear BUS (Back up Sight)
-       Upgraded VLTOR BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle (Extremely well made, durable, and much easier to charge the weapon in adverse/stressful situations)
-	Brand New Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot optic. Mounted and co-witnessed with sights
-	New BlackHawk modular carrying case – plenty of room for extras, like mags, ammo, etc. 
-	Everything was fully installed and tested at the factory, with the exception of the optic which I added later, but never used.
-	Owner’s manual and original box that it came in from the factory


Price for the entire package is $1050. Remember this rifle, and everything included, is still unused.

The rifle came in .308 WIN NIB. I took the .308 barrel off (included, NEVER FIRED), and ordered a stainless Shilen match barrel in .243 1:8 twist. I had it cut back to 22"", and crowned to 11-degrees with a 45-degree chamfer cut. I've put about 50 rounds through the rifle, and it consistently shoots the 107gr Nosler Custom Comps at 1/2 to 2/3 MOA at 100 yards. It also shoots the Hornady 75gr V-Max equally well! The scope is a Leupold VX-R Patrol scope 3-9x40mm Firedot, TMR mil/mil scope. It is mounted in Leupold QR 30mm rings. The rail is what comes on the Savage rifle and from what I've read it's supposed to be a 20moa rail but did not see any markings on the rail one way or the other. It's a standard M1913 Picantinny rail. The Accutrigger came from the factory set at just a little over 1lb - and in a word it is: awesome.

Only one in stock, buy it now!


Manufacturer: Dan Wesson (CZ-USA)

Model: 715

Caliber: .357 Magnum/.38 Special

Capacity: 6 Round Cylinder

Barrel: 6"" Heavy with Ventilated Rib

These are NEW for 2014 limited run, Pre-Production 715 revolvers from Dan Wesson


Returning to regular production late summer 2014, the 715 is as it was before -- designed and built to be the most accurate, rugged and versatile revolver on the market. Shipped with a 6"" barrel, the new shroud is designated the HV6, a heavy vent shroud profile that tames the .357's recoil very well.

The double action trigger is short and relatively light, while the single action is light and crisp. The target-like SA trigger pull made the Dan Wesson revolver a favorite among competitors and hunters, and the tradition continues in the 715.

Barrel assemblies and grips are easily swapped by the shooter, and the 715 accepts grips and barrel/shroud assemblies from 15-2 model and newer revolvers.

The original Dan Wesson revolver improved on the accuracy and service life of the traditional double action revolver design in a few ways. The tensioned barrel of the DW interchangeable barrel system enhances accuracy, pulling the barrel tight like a guitar string, enabling it to vibrate at the same frequency every time. The forward crane latch, located in front of the cylinder and paired with a rear ball detent helps to ensure proper cylinder/barrel alignment during firing. Superior to the rear locking designs of other revolvers, it adds to the accuracy of the 715."

From HK USA website:

USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

Noveske's chrome lined barrels are cold hammered forged and made with the material callouts and manufacturing process for the M249 Machine Gun barrel.

The cold hammer forging process work hardens the steel around a rifled mandrel, which creates the lands and grooves. The barrel is then chrome lined to the spec for an M249 Machine Gun barrel, which is about twice as thick as that of an M4 barrel. The end result is a rifle that can be run hard day after day. For any high round count, high temperature, heavy shooting, we recommend our chrome lined barrel.

  S&W's production of a large N-frame revolver in .44 Magnum began in 1955; the Model 29 designation was applied in 1957.[1] It remained primarily the province of handgun enthusiasts, some law enforcement personnel and hunters until 1971, when Clint Eastwood made it famous as ""the most powerful handgun in the world"" in the movie Dirty Harry. After the movie's release, retailers had trouble keeping the Model 29 in stock.[2]

At the time of its introduction, the Model 29 was the most powerful production handgun. There were a number of custom, or wildcat, calibers that were more powerful, as in the old Howdah pistols of the 19th century. Elmer Keith's achievements in maximizing the power and performance of the .44 Special was the inspiration and driving force behind the introduction of the .44 Magnum by Smith & Wesson. His intention for the new round was for it to be used in sidearms for hunters of large, dangerous game, rather than for self-defense, though with today's specialty cartridges, it can be a good defensive round.[3]

The Model 29 will chamber and fire .44 Special cartridges, as the .44 Magnum was developed from the .44 Special. The Magnum case is slightly longer to prevent magnum rounds from being chambered and fired in handguns chambered for the .44 Special.

In the late 1990s, Smith and Wesson discontinued production of many models of revolvers, including the 'basic' Model 29; since then, at various times, the model, in limited or 'custom' configurations, has been manufactured in as many as 10 evolutions.

Doug Turnbull is considered the premier restoration company for Colt products using the same finishing process as Colt Firearms. There is a slight 1/8” takedown scratch under the slide stop that no doubt occurred after restoration. All parts are correct for the pistol including matching slide numbers. The top of the receiver rear is marked with an “S”. The Verified “VP” proof w/ “P” is on the upper left side of the trigger guard. The Assembler Code “69” is on the upper right side of the trigger guard. The hammer is the long style. The barrel is polished under the ejection port with “Colt 45 Auto” on the lower left side with an “R” on the left lug and an “S” on the barrel bottom in front of the lug. The bore is excellent.

Barrel:   A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.

In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.

The Special ultra lightweight profile barrel  has a conventional .750"" gas block diameter, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.

It seems a lot of people know what this is. If you want just the rifle you can buy one for 999$ so please don't bother me. As far as finding a Aimshot LS8300 good luck! The rifle is brand new in the box along with a new Trijicon Tri Power sitting on a new LaRue LT_150 quick release mount. Also has a Elzetta Charlie C 333 900 lumens weapon light in a Elzetta ZSM mount with optional side rail. Elzetta supplies these lights to SF units and other military contractors its the brightest light I have ever seen on a rifle. Last but not least is the Aimshot LS8300. Try to find one of these. They are only sold to SOCOM and other SF units on military purchase orders only. They are no longer sold to LE agencys. If you need conformation on this call Jeff at Aimshot in Atlanta. This is the BRIGHTEST LASER I have ever seen not like the crap that's out there now. It will light a match 2ft away from the unit. You can follow the beam for miles at night and the dot is unbelievable bright. Comes with zero tool and pressure switch cap as well as regular tail cap. If you can duplicate this rifle for 2100 you can have this one for FREE! Thanks for looking.

(upper description from PSA)...
Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feed ramps, and a carbine gas system. The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested. The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.

I will not meet you at my home or yours, unfortunately there are some folks out there wanting to do harm and we do not have the time to ""get to know"" one another. Hate to do this but you will need to provide your own ammo for test fires. Seems that folks like to make me drag all my guns out, haul them to the range, shoot up my ammo and then not buy anything. Ammo and gas ain't cheap so do not waste my time.
