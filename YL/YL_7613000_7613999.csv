Really, that is why i haven't used it... it is just top notch.It is a very early model. Just after Weatherby moved manufacturing from Germany to Japan. It is a rare 9 lug action on a 30-06, which means it is one of the first models off the line at the new Japaneese factory (as all other 30-06 models have a 6 lug bolt). This means it was held to the highest quality standards since the inception of the Mark V.Need to sell for financial reasons.

Besides the upper rows of MOLLE being replaced by Velcro there are other differences between this model and the commercial variant such as:The shoulder straps being laser cut Multicam material instead of the standard Coyote Brown materialThis JPC also lacks the integrated magazine pouches on the front and instead simply has 3 rows of MOLLEInstead of the cummerbund wrapping entirely around the body and attaching via Velcro under a center mounted flap they attach under flaps that are on the included side plate pockets much like a maritime CIRAS.This version of the JPC comes with side plate pockets which the standard version does not includeThese were only made and offered under government contract to JSOC and were never offered commercially. Most publicly available photographs show this particular variant being used by CAG (1st SOFD-D) and the 75th Ranger Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment. The user also has the option to remove the cummerbunds and side plate pockets and instead use one single strap attached to the rear plate bag on each side that buckles into a female buckle sewn on the front plate bag.

The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action. The P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use. Reliability Mean Rounds Between Failure MRBF requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142 For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Orignal Owner, must be 21 and have Nv Id CCw a plus.
