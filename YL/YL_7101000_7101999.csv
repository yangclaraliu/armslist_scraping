Might do a sale outright at that price, but I am also interested in what trades might be out there. I like shotguns, 1911s, and most everything else, but no 870s or Taurus firearms please. Could do cash in either direction. Not hurting for cash, bargain hunters look elsewhere. If it's worth $450 on GunBroker, why would I sell it to you for less?!

Same type of gun Alvin York was given in basic training. At the moment it's working parts all have a nice layer of grease on them so everything is well preserved. Barrel, Reciever and bolt all stamped Winchester. It has the original cleaning kit in the stock! Serial number is stamped U.S. W 1005. Only the first few thousand made were stamped this way. These early Winchesters were not interchangable with remington and eddington parts which is probably why it matches up. I asked a Military Antiques Specialist to tell me what he could about it. He gave me some great information after sending him a bunch of pictures. He offered to buy the rifle, but I thought I would try to sell it here for what he said it was worth first and try to avoid having to ship it. This is what I got from him. Start Email Historical Information from 1st email with John: Adam-  Thanks for contacting Antique and Collectable Firearms and Militaria Headquarters. Congratulations on owning a very interesting rifle. Winchester records from the ""polishing shop"" survive at Cody for most of their models, with each having their own separate notebook of handwritten notes on what serial numbers were applied on a certain day or sometimes week.  The notebook for the G 17 R rifle (U.S. Model 1917 we would call it) lists the start of production with 63 receivers numbered or actually lettered, A through Z on May 12, 1917, with 26 more numbered 2A-2Z on May 12-15th, and 26 more numbered 3A-3Z on May 15-16.  Presumably these were to be used for various test fixtures or tooling or test purposes and may not have ever been assembled into complete firearms, and were never delivered to the U.S. Army. Production began with receiver serial number 1 being marked on May 21, 1917 using the U.S./MODEL OF 1917/W/[serial number] format. This continued through number 4663.  Beginning with serial number 4664 the ""W"" was changed to the full WINCHESTER name on the receiver and this took place around July 23, 1917.  (There were no daily entries made July 13-August 22, 1917.)  The factory was working six days a week. Note that the receiver stamping was done before final polishing and finishing (blue), and return to assemble the remaining parts, proof test and inspection and acceptance by the Army, so the lag between the date numbered and delivery date may be several days or weeks or even occasional delays of months for parts delayed for one reason or another.   The records show that serial number 991-1125 were applied on June 4, 1917.  Of course barrel production would have been going on simultaneously, and your rifle probably has a barrel dated 6-17 or 7-17. The first 10,000 Winchester made M1917 rifles were made prior to standardization between Remington Eddystone and Winchester on final dimensions and were deemed ""non-interchangeable"" and were not supposed to be sent overseas.  However, many were later arsenal overhauled and any problems seem to have been resolved by replacing faulty parts. I would appreciate getting a lot of good photos of your rifle showing as many details as possible.  Hope that helps. John Spangler- Serving Collectors and Students of Firearms and Military History. Antique and Collectable Firearms and Militaria Headquarters Historical Part of 2nd Email: Adam- The additional info and photos help a lot. Your rifle was numbered in June 1917 and probably assembled in July and delivered immediately to the Army for use during WW1. As previously noted, they were supposed to NOT send any of the first 10,000 Winchester made rifles overseas due to parts interchangeability issues, but this may or may not have been strictly followed. After WW1 the Army decided to continue with the M1903 Springfield as the standard issue rifle, even though there were some features of the M1917 which were better. All rifles on hand were placed in storage, after overhaul if necessary, during which rifles were more or less disassembled and various parts checked and eventually complete rifles reassembled from large piles of serviceable parts. No attention was paid to if the parts had been made by Winchester, Remington or Eddystone as they were made to be interchangeable. Your rifle currently has a stock assembly which was made by Eddystone, not Winchester, as indicated by the faint ""E"" on the tip of the stock, on the butt swivel and door of the buttplate. The bolt sleeve and probably the firing pin and extractor were also made by Eddystone, even though the bolt body was made by Winchester. During very simple overhauls the front sight would remain in place, and that keeps the upper band and the handguard ring on the barrel since the sight has to be removed to change those, and all those are W marked on your rifle. It is likely that the handguards and possibly the trigger guard, floorplate and magazine box are Eddystone or Remington, although they might be Winchester, just whatever was on the top of the pile when overhauled. During WW2 the U.S. sent huge numbers of M1917 rifles to our allies, with about a half million to China, and hundreds of thousands to British Commonwealth countries, and smaller numbers to a dozen or more other countries. In some of those countries it was customary to mark stock and bolts with the serial number of the rifle (and sometimes the rear sights as well) and your rifle had those marks added, but we cannot pin it down to a specific country. The 1005 on the buttstock was stamped after the stock was heavily scraped to remove old cosmoline grease for storage, so we know the rifle was overhauled before the foreign numbers were added. Eventually these rifles were sold off on the international surplus markets and returned to the U.S. The bottom of your barrel has the ""import marking"" required by federal law on guns imported into the U.S.: ""P1917 30.06cal CDI SWAN VT."" This is the mark used by Classic Distributing, Inc. of Swanton, Vermont. They were in operation circa 1989-2002. The guy who ran this company had been previously connected with Century Arms International in St. Albans, VT, about seven miles away and one of the really big players in the military surplus market. Therefore, your rifle must have returned to the U.S circa 1989-2002, a time when many foreign nations were cleaning out their inventory of obsolete arms, but I cannot tell you exactly which countries. Either during its foreign exile, or perhaps at the hands of a civilian owner, the rear of the follower was ground at an angle so it would not block the bolt from closing when the magazine was empty. Some of the early Winchester Model 1917 rifles used left over parts which had been partially completed when Winchester was making Pattern 1914 rifle in .303 caliber for the British 1914-1917. These were identical with the U.S. Model 1917 except for difference in the barrel to take .30-06 cartridges, and minor changes in the magazine, bolt, extractor and sights to accommodate the differences between the two cartridges. The receiver on your rifle has an inspector marking A over 26 on the left rail. This is a British inspector stamping, so apparently some receivers which had been partially completed and inspected by the British at an early step in the process ended up being finished and marked and inspected by U.S. inspectors and assembled into Model 1917 rifles.

This is a Glock 30S, which means the larger G30 mag capacity, an SF frame, and the slim G36 slide. We're talking 10+1 rounds of 45 ACP out of a package slightly smaller than a Glock 19! Gun is in excellent condition (that's dust from the picnic table in the 2d photo, not scuff marks.  I have more images if you want to see them.)  Trigger pull with the Ghost Ultimate is the best Glock trigger I've ever felt (and I've owned 9 Glocks over the years with different aftermarket triggers) and the 30S slide release is way above that on other Glocks.This particular 30S has a ton of top-tier upgrades (documentation available):- Robar NP3 finish to all metal parts ($210)- Robar forward cocking serrations ($150)- KKM Precision match barrel ($165)- TruGlo TFO Night/Day Tritium-Fiber Optic combo sights ($100)- Ghost Ultimate 3.5 trigger connector ($30)- Full-size factory Glock 21 mag, with 15-round capacity from Pearce Grip +2 baseplate and X-grip adapter ($45 total)- 2 extra (4 total) 10-round factory Glock mags ($30 each)- Crossbreed ""Ohai"" modular holster ($48) and mag carrier ($33)This is $1,400.00 worth of gun, custom work, upgrades, and accessories!The 30S was created at the special request of LAPD SIS (Special Investigation Section). Read more about the history of this awesome pistol in the article by American Handgunner (google to find), and about some of these custom Robar Glock 30S features in the Guns Magazine article (google to find).  There is no ""Gen4"" 30S--this is the same one Glock sells today.I will sell locally in Kitsap County or the Tacoma/JBLM area. Cash or USPS Money Orders are the only forms of payment accepted. Gun is sold as-is, with no warranty, and the sale is final. Buyer is responsible for all fees associated with transfer. We can meet at the FFL of your choice to handle the transfer IAW WA law."
