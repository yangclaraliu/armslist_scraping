For those that don't know, The .223 Wylde has the same chamber angling as the standard 5.56 chamber, so there’s no problem with pressures, and it also has a .2240 freebore diameter. The result? You have a chamber that is sufficient to handle the hotter 5.56 load without concerns about pressure and you get the gilt-edge accuracy that’s common in many quality .223 rifles. Is there a compelling reason to switch to a Wylde chamber? Well, the most obvious reason is that you can fire .223 ammo without giving up accuracy and 5.56 ammo without worrying about excess pressure. Sure, you can fire .223 ammo all day from a 5.56 without worrying about pressure problems thanks to generous chamber size, but if you really want to tighten those groups that .2240 freebore diameter helps. In fact, .223 Wylde chambers are known for extreme accuracy, which is better on the whole than what you can expect from a standard 5.56×45 chamber.There are so many parts from so many manufactures where it's hard to say it's this or that, but the lower was originally a stripped Del-ton lower, and the upper is a Aero percision upper. Everything has been replaced including the skeletonized 3.5 lb trigger, nickel boron BCG, fluded 18"" .223 Wylde barrel, dust cover, take down pins, forward assist, bolt catch, MIGI muzzle break, charging handle, mag release, skeletonized grip, trigger guard, safety, hand guard, buffer tube, there's a lot that went into this rifle."

Check YouTube for some reviews on this pistol. Most rave about the trigger. It is such a sweet shooter, that if I wasn't busy drinking Gaston's kool aid,  I would keep it. The pistol has less than 300 rounds through it and is in excellent condition. The package includes the pistol, case, extra back straps and cleaning rod, four 15rd mags, three 17rd mags (15rd + 2rd extensions), and a custom IWB holster from Two Fools Leather Goods. If you haven't dealt with TFLG, you're missing out. I'm asking $600 for the package. I'm firm on the price. Thanks. I will consider trades. I would prefer trades of equal value, but cash going either way is not a deal breaker. My interests include gen4 Glocks in 9mm, bolt guns in .223, .243, .308, and 7.62x39. Threaded barrels preferred. Feel free to contact me with any other trade offer. There's no telling what will pique my interest. Emails asking if I still have it get deleted with no response. If you're offering a trade, please include a picture, if possible. It saves time. I'm willing to meet buyers/traders halfway, but would like to keep my drive time to under an hour.

This rifle has the current production Arsenal 2 stage trigger which is slightly better then the old triggers with fake 2 stage notches that everyone liked to grind off. Also included are the original front and rear sights, standard sling, oil bottle, cleaning kit and manual. The rifle does not come with a muzzle device but I will throw in a Khyber Kystoms Cheese Grater to make it even. No one likes the stock muzzle brakes anyways. Fired maybe 600 rounds with zero issues, had my 3x Goat Fucker combo on it and the rifle does great at ringing steel at my local 200 yard range. Overall cosmetic condition is great, the sights are actually on straight, no paint bubbling or large scratches, some finish wear on the carrier and bolt but thats to be expected from use.

Gun and scope overall look better in person than it does in the pictures. Scope has factory screw on lens covers. The scope goes up to 20x. So I guess the magnification is 20x? There are minor spots of rust on the gun and scope. I'd say overall the gun and scope are in VG+ condition. The leather strap is still soft and usable as it is.

The gun is in ""like new"" condition except for one scratch in the end of the stock that, ironically, I made while shooting the photos for this ad. It has well under 500 rounds through it and has been extremely well taken care of. It comes in the original hard plastic Beretta case, the original three extended choke tubes, two flush Beretta choke tubes that I added (SK and LM), and a near full bottle of Beretta oil."

Its action has been worked a little giving it a smoother, more crisp break. Gun has only had five .410 cartridges and two.45 long colt shells through it, to get an idea of what .410 load was best for me. Personally, the concept is amazing, a compact snake gun capable of firing a cartridge powerful enough to drop ANYTHING that breathes. As much as I like it, it gets no use, so it’s time to go.  Complete with box, packing materials, and action key which locks the hammer (built-in safety feature). The gun is pristine (NEAR MINT COND.). Only evidence of use or handling is a faint ring on the cylinder that occurred during test and snap-cap fire. Warranty card is blank.
 
I don’t need to sell, just looking to change up my collection a bit. **PLEASE also see my other listings for: HK, Sig Sauer, Walther, Ruger, Benelli, Remington, and Maverick (an affordable sister co. of Mossberg), and maybe another brand or two.**  I am open to trades of many quality guns. In addition to guns, I will consider other quality trade items such as solid silver and gold jewelry and coins; high-end wristwatches like Rolex, Jaeger LeCoultre, IWC, Vacheron Constantin and watches of similar quality.
I’m not a pawn shop and have more stuff than I need. So, I'm a bit choosy and can’t accept all trades. Cash and coin are king despite my willingness to trade.  I prefer face to face cash transactions, in order to do this you must be a Missouri resident with a valid ID, and be willing to sign a bill of sale that states you’re   of legal age and lawfully able to acquire, and possess a firearm. CCW holders preferred but not required. NOTE: I am not an FFL dealer, authorized transfer agent, nor law enforcement. Buyers who are not Missouri residents MUST use an ""Authorized FFL Transfer Agent."" ALL out of state transactions must be completed and done by an authorized FFL transfer agent. If you don’t know or have one, call and ask for a referral from your state’s highway patrol office or ask a reputable gun dealer in your area, they generally are able to serve as a transfer agent on your behalf. Note: the costs associated with this service and the shipping are yours."
