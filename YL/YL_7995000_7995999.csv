Also will come with the factory boot grips along with the box and manual and all that. It currently has the crimson trace laser grips installed on it which I still have the box for as well, makes a huge difference in shoot ability with the little j frame. Also has the factory revolver master action job done to it as well ($150), vastly improving the trigger feel and trigger pull compared to the crappy factory trigger pull on these air weights. Also it will come with a 5 star firearms speedloader (high quality aluminum cnc machined), excellent speedloader leaps and bounds ahead of the typical hks ones. Not looking for trades unless you have an lcr in 9mm. All laws will be followed no exceptions, and if buyer wants to do transfer at ffl shop it will have to be near me and you will be responsible for paying the transfer fee. Thanks!"
