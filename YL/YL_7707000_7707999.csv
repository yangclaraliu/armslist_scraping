Per the Colt archive letter it was shipped December 10, 1919 to B. H. Dyas Company in Los Angeles, California. This has been in my consignees collection for approximately 50 years. The factory letter with his name on it is dated June 17, 1974. It is interesting to note a couple of things on this SAA. It is a first-stage transition serial number relocation. The first-stage transition relocation moved the number on the trigger gaurd to the left side of the grip frame. Between 1300 to 1400 were produced between November 1919 and March 1920. Also it has a rare barrel marking that has both COLT FRONTIER SIX SHOOTER AND.44-40. This near 100 year old SAA remains in very high condition for it's age. All numbers match including the last two being marked on the back of the cylinder and the grips being scratch numbered. The color casing still retains almost all of it's original brilliance. The cylinder has light rotation lines. All of the cylinder flutes are sharp. The leading edge of the cylinder is also sharp with just a trace of and almost unnoticeabe silvering. There are some light scattered freckles. The barrel is exceptional with just a fraction of a millimeter of silvering at the very tip and a few light freckles. The ejector rod housing remains in the same condition as the barrel. The trigger gaurd is excellent with just a few fine pinprick freckles. The front strap of the grip frame does have significant freckling over most of it. The freckling on the bottom of the grip frame is not as prevalent as the front strap but is still present. The back strap has some light thinning and freckling as well. Overall the finish rates a solid 96%. The bore is bright and shiny. All 4 clicks are crisp. The lock up is like a bank vault. The grips remain in very high condition. This is an example that will compliment even the most advanced pre-war SAA collection"
