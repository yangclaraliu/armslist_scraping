This rifle was built on a Springfield Armory Receiver with a serial number that places it at October of 1943 production and barreled with a brand new Criterion barrel. With the new Criterion barrel, this rifle will be superbly accurate for thousands of rounds. No need to worry about accuracy issues due to muzzle and throat erosion. All parts are refinished by CMP using a period correct parkerizing method.As such, this is about as close as you can get to buying a Garand in brand new condition without spending $3000+ in todays market.All parts are Springfield marked, rifle is dressed in a gorgeous Birch stock with a natural tiger stripe pattern.Considering the WW2 serial, the all SA parts, gorgeous Birch stock and all CMP paperwork I'll be asking $1200 for this rifle. Rifle comes with all the CMP paperwork, hard case, sling, and I'll throw in a couple En block clips loaded with new production PPU Garand specific 30-06 so you can get right to plinking on the range. I have obscured the serial number for this listing, the 2002xxx SN is enough to place it as an October 1943 production. Contact me for any additional pictures of parts draw numbers you may be interested in. I also have a milled SA marked trigger guard I can include. Both stamped and milled trigger guards were being used in 1943, some prefer the aesthetics of the milled trigger guards over the stamped. The latter is what is currently installed on the rifle.I'm not interested in trades and I am firm on the price. I personally hand selected this particular rifle from the CMP racks and sourced the Birch stock. Its been cleaned up, greased, but is unfired. These rifles are only gaining value and I will not let it go for less than the asking price. I will consider shipping out of state.Additional photos here: https://imgur.com/a/JNZs4"

Finally took it to the range last week and after two shots and a face full of powder, realized it wasn't going to fix the problem or work for me as the port is too far back for a left-handed shooter, thus the face of powder. For a righty there is no concern. Absolutely love the platform, but don't like a face full of powder! As such this rifle has had two rounds through it.
