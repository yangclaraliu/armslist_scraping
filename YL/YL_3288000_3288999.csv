Walther completely took care of that all (unlike S&W who told me they couldn't help and to contact Walther). Does have some holster wear on the slide from previous owner and picture tries to reflect that as best as possible.

This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. Features:  Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil.  Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel.  Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish.  Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing.  Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver.  Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights.  Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. Crimson Trace® Lasergrip® offers the advantages of a laser sighting system. This firearm is available for us to order (takes 3-4 days to receive it from our suppliers). Full Payment must be made prior to us submitting the order.  Personal checks, money orders or certified checks accepted. Checks must clear bank before shipping. There will be a $25.00 shipping fee added for out of state buyers. Visa, Mastercard and Discover accepted. No credit card fees. Must ship to an FFL dealer. May also sell in store."

The 6"" barrel and adjustable rear makes this a very accurate pistol easily capable of 100yrd plus shots. As with all Rugers, the Security Six revolvers were robustly designed with, heavy-duty parts for durability and to allow for the investment casting, Early models like this one (mfg.1979) were issued by US government agencies and were standard issue service weapons of a large number of police departments, Discontinued in 1988, they remain well-liked and respected, as well as highly sought after and are becoming harder and harder to find, especially in this condition.

Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged.

Let me know, and I will sell them together for $360.  This gun is essentially new and I am selling it with 500 rounds of quality ammo for less than you can get the 1911 by itself.  Also, they have 45 ACP conversion kits for $180 that come with a slide, barrel and magazine, so you can practice for cheap and have a great self defense round all in one gun.

ATI German Sport Group Compact tactical 1911 .22LR pistol with shortened beaver tail and grip safety, black plastic grips, picatinny rail, threaded barrel, skeleton trigger, 3.4"" barrel, 7"" overall length, and near mint with only 50 rounds fired.  
New these are usually $359.99 plus shipping or tax.  I am selling this awesome 1911 with 500 rounds of CCI 22 long rifle mini-mags, which on-line are as much as $19 per 100, for only $360 firm for everything (includes original case, faux noise suppressor, tools, etc.).  You'd pay over $360 for just the gun, so essentially you are getting all of the ammo for FREE.  This firearm is made by the same manufacturer who make the SIG 22 1911, only this one looks better and has more features.  CCI mini-mags are the most sought after 22 ammo due to feeding well and being clean, which is why they are so hard to find.  This ammo feeds very well and the gun is extremely reliable.  I've also heard that Federal feeds well (FYI).  

Photos are stock but represent the exact model.  The long suppressor is included, but the pic with the short version is an example of what it looks like should you go that route.  

I don't agree with the gun laws, but all federal and state laws apply to this sale and the transaction will take place at an FFL.  Snoopy's Gun Shop is by my home in Frederick, and I would prefer to go there out of convenience. They charge $30 for the transfer. I may be able to meet you at an FFL near downtown Denver where I work if you are closer to that area."

Originally designed for the American market the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever a combination safety and decocking lever is frame mounted and quickly accessible unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes."

The SIG SAUER® P232® is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Stainless is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today.

M9A1: The Evolution of a Classic Tactical Pistol

The Beretta M9A1 tactical pistol evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the US Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces. Thanks to its accuracy, durability and versatility, it also makes a superb choice for personal or home-defense as well as concealed carry.


Extra-Durable Pistol and Magazines

Just as the US Marines are rightly famous for their reliability and endurance, the M9A1 is built to be ultra-tough and always dependable. Besides the superior steels of which it is constructed, it also features a unique sand-resistant magazine that was developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan and comes standard only on the M9A1. The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of grit accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 even in the most extreme conditions.


Packed with Features

As you take the M9A1 out of the box, it won’t fail to impress you for the abundance of tactical features it offers. Firstly, there is an integral Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail situated under the barrel, for easy attachment of accessories such as tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The 3-dot sight system on this pistol is optimized for quick acquisition of the target, while the front and backstrap of the frame are checkered to ensure a positive purchase no matter the weather conditions. Also, the magazine well has an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat as well as competition situations.



Soft-Shooting, Accurate and Easy to Maintain

At the range, the M9A1 will impress you for its low recoil, as well as its accuracy. As one of the ultimate evolutions of a best-in-class military and law-enforcement pistol, it will reliably feed commercial ammo, even with more open hollow-point designs. Maintenance is easy: this pistol requires no tools for disassembly, while the reverse is even faster and easier, with the disassembly lever returning into the locked position automatically. Thanks to all these features, the M9A1 is an ideal tactical pistol that will meet the requirements of the most demanding users."

Used by Germany in WWI, many German Officers carried these guns, private purchase, during WWII, and lots of them came back to the USA with returning GI’s. This example is pretty well-used. It has the Imperial German “Crown N” proofs and Dryese factory markings, there are no importers markings anywhere on the gun. The magazine looks chrome-plated, and it may be a replacement. The pistol has lost almost all of the original blue finish, it has lots of patina and freckling. The original checkered black hard rubber grips are pretty worn, the bore is still somewhat crisp, and overall condition is about 75%.
