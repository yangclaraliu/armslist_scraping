The size and weight are similar to a real pistol and it can be fitted into a real firearms hostler. The material that is used in its lower frame has the same material of a real firearms used. The handling and recoil is superb which provide realism to user. ACP is powered by 12g Co2 canister which is easy to find and purchase at local sporting goods stores. One Co2 canister allows you to fire up to 70 rounds. There is no denying that Co2 works better than Top Gas (Green Gas) in cold weather. Action Combat has charged and operated the ACP in 5 C / 41 F and the test result is positive. Their ACP works better than any other gas guns in extreme weather. To conclude, a fair quality pistol can be easily found in the market. But a good quality pistol is hard to get. The best quality pistol even never exists until Action Combat is born. With patented design and its high compatibility, they believe Action Combat is the best pistol among its competitor.Specifications: Manufacturer: APS Model: ACP Muzzle Velocity: 360-370 FPS Magazine Capacity: 25rds Color: Multicam Package Includes: Gun, Magazine 4 additional magazines with purchase. Magazine need new o-rings (routine maintenance). I bought and used this pistol for a day at indoor matches while at Fort Hood.

The MechTech is installed with a basic telescoping 3 posistion stock and rubber butt pad. They can be made to accept AR-15 style stocks with a part you can order. Both have served me faithfully at the range and hunting since purchasing however due to wanting to consolidate my collection and need for finances they have to go. The total round count between both is proably 5,000 to 6,000 in total. Each has had 2,000 rounds of 10mm through them and another 500 to 1,000 each of .40 S&W as well. While the Glock may not be advised for using .40 S&W as the chamber is not fully supported the MechTech is and is perfectly safe to do so. I have the original case for the Glock, all the paper work for both the Glock and MechTech including the original invoice for the MechTech. I will sell both seperate if desired but I will charge you their full values as well as whatever accessories I have for them because selling one without the other would be a headache on my end and I'd rather not go through that. I'm only seeking $1,000 for the lot, and everything included has a value around $1,200 to $1,300 in total but I'm pricing it to move as I know it's a bit of a niche system. Included with both are 201 rounds of 180gr FMJ 10mm from Georgia Arms(1,190 fps and 610 ft lbs from stock G20SF barrel, 1,540 fps and 940 from MechTech ), 15 rounds of Underwood 180gr Speer Unicore Gold Dots(1,275 fps and 720 ft lbs from stock G20SF barrel, 1,690 fps and 1,213 ft lbs from MechTech), a 24lb recoil spring and all steel guide rod for Glock(currently installed to handle hot loads and still have original in box), everything that came with Glock in the box(Gen 4 package: 3 mags, mag loader, removeable backstraps), an Alien Gear 3.0 Cloak Tuck IWB holster for the G20SF, a SeeAll Open Sight as well as the original box and manual for it(currently installed on the MechTech), as well as the ammo can that the 10mm ammo from Georgia Arms came in. I am not interested in any trades unless you have a Taurus Ragining Judge Magnum in .454 Casull/.45 Colt/.410 Shot, an AMT Automag 3, or a Winchester 1907 Self Loader in good condition. Otherwise I am not interested in anything else and wont entertain the offer. Call or text Chris at REDACTED, this is the fastest method to get ahold of me, I will check emails but do not do so as often. If you call and I dont asnwer, leave a voice mail and I will respond ASAP as well as if I dont  asnwer your text right away. That usually means I'm at work or sleeping. If you need additional pictures or have any questions about the Glock or MechTech I will try to answer and accomodate as best I can on the subject matter."
