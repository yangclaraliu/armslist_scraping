So this beautiful GEN 3 Glock 26 has Trijicon HD night sights, in my opinion BEST iron sights on the market! Great sights, I could not say one bad thing about them. Next I have a STAINLESS STEEL GUIDE ROD, which helps reduce recoil. It is 3x the weight of the cheap factory plastic GUIDE ROD. Great addition! Lastly I added the GHOST EXTENDED MAG RELEASE & EXTENDED SLIDE RELEASE. Both add a day and night difference to releasing a MAG & releasing the slide. I HAVE ALL THE STOCK PARTS AS WELL THAT I WILL GIVE YOU. I want to stress that this is a brand new gun that has never been used!! You will be paying the same price as a normal Glock 26 with a value of $770 with the gun and all the extra parts!! This my loss your gain!! Deals like this are hard to find!! I will only sell to a buyer near by, or if your willing to come to my general area of SACRAMENTO so we can do the transfer at a local shop!!

This seems to be one that maybe had been carried but fired very little. Everything is in surprisingly good condition and the walnut stock is beautiful. The short length makes it really quick to point and I'm sure it will make a great open-sight brush gun for hogs, deer, and predators at the distances 90% of successful hunts are made at.

Includes everything it came with new - two magazines and 3 different size backstraps. It also comes with a .357 SIG barrel that drops in to change the caliber with no modification (magazines work with both calibers), as well as an X-grip full size magazine spacer, which fits over a full size magazine to give you a full size grip. The trigger is improved over stock with Apex Tactical parts - I believe they are the sear and striker block, which work together to smooth and lighten the trigger and gives a more tactile reset. The pistol probably has around 200-300 rounds through each barrel and shoots very well."

Has proof stamps and all numbers match. This pistol has no import marks and has some lack of bluing from heavy use. Has the dark brown bakelite grips. Has only one magazine.I am selling this pistol so cheap because there are two problems with it I must disclaim. I have shot this pistol extensively. The two problems are whenever you load a full magazine into the pistol. You cannot let it slam close to chamber a round. The pistol will fire. You have to ease the slide down and the round will be properly seated. The second one is the decocker. With a round in the tube dont use the decocker to drop the hammer. The pistol will fire. Those are the only two problems with the pistol. Other than that it is very accurate and a lot of fun to shoot. Bore looks dull but not terrible. Im asking $400 since this pistol has these problems. Maybe somebody that buys it can replace the parts and really bring it back to life. Thank you for looking.Please text with any questions as I do not check my e-mail. My cell number is REDACTED.
