Used by mostly Finnish and Swedish armies, it was also widely exported into Baltic countries, some European and South American countries. Although manufacturing of the Suomi in Finland ceased in 1944, it was widely used throughout the world well into the 1990’s. This Suomi M31 has been converted by TNW Firearms to Semi-Automatic and fires standard 9mm Luger / Parabellum rounds from a 36 round stick magazine or a 71 round drum. This carbine is discontinued and no more will be made, so it may go up in value. Accessories and magazines are plentiful. The barrel is removable. To convert to SA legal, TNW extended the barrel and converted it from open bolt to closed bolt with a redesigned bolt assembly. This is the redesigned hammer-fired model that corrects some of the problems with the earlier striker-fired models. Also includes 1- 30 round magazine and 1 -50 round drum magazineContact REDACTED"

This shotgun gun was purchased less than 3 months ago. I had to special order from KSG to ensure I received a 3rd generation model. I visited every gun shop within 60 miles of DFW and 4 had KSG’s and all were new/old stock. Meaning they were Gen 1/2. The Gen 3 model worked out all kinks. I have my receipt to prove date of purchase as well as a & $970 price tag- just for the KSG. I sighted the red dot in with 6 slugs and was able to ping a 12” Steel plate from 200 yards. This thing is ridiculously compact and will hold 15 rounds. Hunting, home defense, offensive & defensive weapon. One of the best bugout weapons available. CQB, urban warfare, hunting, plinking or clays. If you want an $700 KSG, their are plenty on here. This one includes several goodies & I researched the generations before buying. You are purchasing the fine tuned model. Not in in a hurry- please don’t lowball. Include pictures and details.

The Bushnell is in good working condition but has some areas of surface wear from use (like the windage turret cap).  It held zero well and has finger-adjustable turrets.  The reticle is a medium duplex style.  It's a basic workhorse scope with a matte finish.
The Tasco is an older fixed 6x40 with a duplex reticle.  It's in very good condition and has coin/screwdriver adjustable turrets.  I used to live near a range that held rimfire benchrest competitions, and this fixed 6X allowed me to compete try out ""hunter"" class for far less money than a Weaver T6 or similar.  It held zero well and I never really had parallax issues from 50m on out.  However, there aren't any benchrest competitions in the Triad, and I prefer hunting with a 4X.  This is a simple scope that gives you just a bit more magnification than a 4X, and it has a gloss finish. 
I'm asking $20/ea or $35 for both.  Face-to-face sales in Winston-Salem only, please.
Armslist only lets me upload one photo, so email me and I can send pictures of the individual scopes, their turrets, lenses, and POV views of the reticles."

The all-steel deeply blued receiver and barrels, the single selective trigger and hammer ejectors with the famous and easily navigated top-tang barrel selector/safety. These time-proven features may not be readily understood by many shooters, but will play a key role in how the gun works in their hands, and how easily it is operated and shouldered. A recoil pad is fit to the 12 gauge models. This is a very fine choice for the dad who is looking for a more lighter, smaller over/under and certainly ideal for youth and ladies.

The length of pull, which is the distance from the center of the trigger to the center of the buttpad is only 13"". This makes the gun easier to shoulder, quicker to point, lighter and easier to carry - something that is very appealing to younger people and experienced shooters and hunters alike. It carries all the fine features that have made the Browning Citori the number one selling over and under shotgun in the world. The all-steel deeply blued receiver and barrels, the single selective trigger and hammer ejectors with the famous and easily navigated top-tang barrel selector/safety. These time-proven features may not be readily understood by many shooters, but will play a key role in how the gun works in their hands, and how easily it is operated and shouldered. A recoil pad is fit to the 12 gauge models. This is a very fine choice for the dad who is looking for a more lighter, smaller over/under and certainly ideal for youth and ladies. And, the Browning name fits right in with the family. It has for generations.Specifications and Features:12 gauge 26"" vent rib barrel 3"" chamber Top tange barrel selector/safety Single-selective trigger Hammer ejectors Satin finished American walnut stock Matte blued barrel and receiver Vector Pro lengthened forcing cone Includes 2 Invector-Plus choke tubes: Modified and Improved cylinder Ivory front bead sight Recoil pad Precision cut checkering 41-3/4"" overall length 13"" length of pull 1-5/8"" drop at comb 2-1/2"" drop at heel 5/16"" rib width Weighs 6 pounds 11 ounces*** This shotgun is in good condition with some marks on the finish as shown.

Looking to sell or trade my WWII USGI IBM M1 Carbine. Almost every single part of this rifle is manufactured by IBM, down to the tiniest components, with the exception of the stock and bolt, which is manufactured by Inland. The barrel and receiver match, dating this rifle to October of 1943. 
The sights, barrel band, bolt, and safety selector are all the original early style, showing this rifle was likely not rearsenaled for use in Korea or Vietnam. 
The stock and handguard match, with early style ""high wood"" and 2-hole handguard configuration. There is evidence of very very minor pitting on the outside of the barrel forward of the handguard, but the problem has been resolved by an excellent reparkerization of the receiver and barrel. Thanks in advance for your interest! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions."

It s built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a Navy-style pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity.

The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. It comes with a 10-round version magazine. It is the same size as the 25-round magazine but will only accept 10 rounds. The magazine is proportionate in size to the centerfire version's mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5's magazine.

It carries all the fine features that have made the Browning Citori the number one selling over and under shotgun in the world. The all-steel deeply blued receiver and barrels, the single selective trigger and hammer ejectors with the famous and easily navigated top-tang barrel selector/safety. These time-proven features may not be readily understood by many shooters, but will play a key role in how the gun works in their hands, and how easily it is operated and shouldered. A recoil pad is fit to the 12 gauge models. This is a very fine choice for the dad who is looking for a more lighter, smaller over/under and certainly ideal for youth and ladies.

The length of pull, which is the distance from the center of the trigger to the center of the buttpad is only 13"". This makes the gun easier to shoulder, quicker to point, lighter and easier to carry - something that is very appealing to younger people and experienced shooters and hunters alike. It carries all the fine features that have made the Browning Citori the number one selling over and under shotgun in the world. The all-steel deeply blued receiver and barrels, the single selective trigger and hammer ejectors with the famous and easily navigated top-tang barrel selector/safety. These time-proven features may not be readily understood by many shooters, but will play a key role in how the gun works in their hands, and how easily it is operated and shouldered. A recoil pad is fit to the 12 gauge models. This is a very fine choice for the dad who is looking for a more lighter, smaller over/under and certainly ideal for youth and ladies. And, the Browning name fits right in with the family. It has for generations.Specifications and Features:12 gauge 26"" vent rib barrel 3"" chamber Top tange barrel selector/safety Single-selective trigger Hammer ejectors Satin finished American walnut stock Matte blued barrel and receiver Vector Pro lengthened forcing cone Includes 2 Invector-Plus choke tubes: Modified and Improved cylinder Ivory front bead sight Recoil pad Precision cut checkering 41-3/4"" overall length 13"" length of pull 1-5/8"" drop at comb 2-1/2"" drop at heel 5/16"" rib width Weighs 6 pounds 11 ounces*** This shotgun is in good condition with some marks on the finish as shown.
