So I would rather sell or trade it to someone who could use this nice carbine."

Full Size, 5"" barrel, tactical model RIA 1911. 45ACP w/ the skeletonize trigger, commander-style hammer, Novak cut sights, and I THINK it has 30 lpi front strap. I covered that up, but if that is a deal make/breaker for you, I'll pull finger groove grips off. 

SO - I have two full size 1911s. The other is about 4x as expensive and has my birth date for a serial number. That one stays, this one doesn't have to. The cheapest I've seen these for is $429 plus shipping plus transfer. Bud's has them for $450 shipped, plus transfer. $400 or comparable trade is what I'm thinking is pretty fair.

It comes with the box, 1x8rd Armscorp magazine (made by ATI... same as who makes S&W's), and I'll throw in another one or two 7rd mags. I have a lot of 1911 mags, so we can work around that in the final parts of the deal.

I shot it at the range on time - no malfunctions, no slow downs, responded well to doing single, double, and fail drill type shooting. Chambers smoothly, trigger is a little splash compared to something 4x more expensive, but could EASILY be resolved with an upgraded mainspring/housing. That's a $30 fix if you want to start playing with this gun. 

I shot a box of 100 rounds through it, and it is very competent for range or personal protection. Not even a hiccup."

It's chambered in .50 AE and has the brushed chrome finish. I traded for it last week, and decided I want to go in a different direction (I already have a S&W 500 so I've got the hand cannon category covered). It looks to have been shot very little, I would guess the round count is under 100. It will come with 3 magazines; 2 of them are brand new, one of them used. Also included will be 60 rounds of ammo, a soft case, and a shoulder holster. 

I'm wanting to trade it for a pair of Smith and Wesson revolvers, mainly a model 29 or 629, and something in .357 magnum. Finish color is not important, as long as it is in good shape. If the trade value isn't around $1500, the difference will need to be made up in cash or ammo. 

Other trade offers will likely be declined. I know the requested trade is fairly specific, but I'm not in a hurry to get rid of the Desert Eagle. 

Cash price is $1500 for everything. Only looking to deal locally, if you want to drive that's fine, but I'm not going to meet outside of Wichita. If you're interested you can text me at REDACTED, or email me through the armslist link. Thanks for looking."

Yes, mostly polymer. The Buffer tube threads are marine brass, the pistol grip threads are brass, and the serial number seems to be a chunk of aluminum. Marked as ""Multicaliber"" - Looking to TRADE mostly... a black one.

I haven't used the other two yet, but I have completed most of the builds using just random mil-spec parts. They fit an LMT trigger and pins just fine as well as a PSA LPK. My pistol buffer tube screwed and locked into the threads just fine. So - I don't really see any issue. They carry a lifetime warranty and you can reach the owner Dave by phone any day.

Seems like a good company, I like their style. I would like to recoup my cost on one of the lowers. It's black. Very light weight and looked to hold all my AR uppers just fine. I test fitted an Adams Arms, an LMT, and a PSA without issues. 

Must be legally able own a firearm. I will ask for a bill of sale with TX DL. If you have a CHL, a healthcare license (EMT, Paramedic, RN, MD, NP, PA, etc), or military ID, I don't need any of that."

M952V
The M952V Millennium® Universal WeaponLight attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever™ rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. It utilizes one sealed LED unit to produce both brilliant white light and invisible infrared radiation for use with night vision devices. The white beam is configured for close- to medium-range applications. Changing back and forth from white output to infrared output is accomplished by a push/twist action on the M952V head, which self-locks into the selected output mode. The tailcap switch assembly features a momentary/constant-on pushbutton switch and a momentary-on tape switch (7-inch cable) that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Available in Black (BK) or Desert Tan (TN) body color.

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

I've had this shotgun for around a year and never had to urge to shoot it.  Has had around 50 shells put through it from when I first bough the shotgun.  It comes with a breaching muzzle break and retractable stock!  The stock has a 5 shell holder, and it has the 18"" shell tube. I have a couple of slugs and federal buckshot that will be included.  This is a great home defense shotgun & it needs a better home.

One piece construction eliminating the castle nut and ensuring that when installed, the buffer tube cannot become loose.
Attachment system automatically indexes the buffer tube perfectly straight.
The bottom of the interior buffer tube extends a lip into the receiver, supporting the bottom rear of the bolt carrier, reducing the carrier tilt present in some piston systems.
A dead blow buffer is securely installed in the rear of the buffer tube to reduce carrier speed by an average of 10%, and dramatically reduce felt recoil.
Two QD sling swivel attachments are machined into the front of the buffer tube allowing ambidextrous connection of your QD slings.
The buffer tube is fluted to allow debris to be pushed out of the way, and a drain hole has been placed in the bottom of the tube, allowing for draining of water when the rifle is parallel to the ground.

Used, but in good condition USP .40S&W Compact.  This gun served as a duty firearm in a previous life and has since been retired to nightstand duty.  Roughly 600 rounds down the pipe.  Gun has some mild holster wear, which may not appeal to some, but it truly adds character to this gun.

I have for sale my LNIB Springfield XDm 3.8 in 45 ACP. This has *exactly* 50 rounds down the pipe and then was put away in the safe. I purchased two extra extended magazines with this when I picked it up 2 months ago that will come with the gun. 

As standard with XDm products, the gun will come with all the XDM trimmings- holster, mag carrier, loader assist, and lock. It will also come with all the original documents it came with. 

This is a great gun, but I've got some projects I would like to pick up some funds for, so price is $525.  I will entertain serious offers, but I think the price is pretty fair considering a new gun is $580-$600, plus taxes, and sans the extra mags. 

For trades- I'd love to get my hands on a M&P Shield in 9mm or a quality red dot, but if you have something else interesting, let me know. 

I'm willing to meet with a buyer within a reasonable distance of Mt. Vernon and I'll need a peek at the good guy cards. If you do not possess a CPL/WAC card, a badge and creds, or an active military I.D.; a WADL *AND* Bill of Sale are a must. Thanks!"

I bought this thing a about 4 years ago and have used it on 2 hunting trips and maybe have 8 hours on it. It is in perfect condition! Just to be 100% honest I lucked out and bought it at a gun show for a really fair price and passing the savings on to you. Just to be 100% safe I turn in the information on the unit to local police department 4 years ago and I would say 4 years is enough time if there was a issue they would of contacted me by now. I thought about posting this item on ebay as I found a listing with less extras then mine that ended with over 30 bids right at 10,000.00 (Auction number to search on ebay.... REDACTED58) I also found 2 other old listings from a google search from last year where they sold on ebay for 14,000.00 and 11,500...... but the fee to sell on there was crazy plus found out would have to wait 21 days for my money! And if they buy a lot of people don't pay. No thank you! I am more of a want it or not type of guy! This thing comes with everything it would from insight and is in brand new condition. I am a long time user of a PayPal and that's the only way I will take payment on this item not in less you want to western union it to me or fed ex me cash which in todays world you cant trust no body. On a item with this high of value I will NOT meet to do sale. So PayPal is bout it! See you tube for great videos on this item and see pictures below! Or if you want a brand new one they are around 24,995.00 from insight or there's a guy on eBay that as them for 21,995.00 and as sold 1 out of 3 he had for that price! No joke check it out! I paid 9000.00 for this and I am asking 8800.00 OBRO...

The cylinder will not turn, you can get the cylinder to turn and lock up (Would probably shoot but I wouldn't try). When you bring the hammer back its like a hair trigger in double action. In single action the trigger pulls smooth and the hammer goes back and forward as it should, trigger pull is over 5lbs at least.
I just dont know what the problem is, probably simple, maybe not. Other than that the gun is in overall decent condition, blueing on edges worn from time, but I just dont want to try and take it apart.

This was Ben's Personal Gun (Owner of Boresight Solutions) and there has never been a more comprehensive package offered by him for sale. I purchased the gun a little less than a week ago and LOVE it but think I am going to get the same package done in a 17/22 Frame. I will be out of town for 10 days but posting this up to start the advertising and try to answer any questions a perspective buyer may have. I am not looking for ANY TRADES, AT ALL. Thank You...

I will ship, provided you pay actual shipping charges, somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 and will take discreet paypal or USPS Money Order. If paying by paypal, must be gift and buyer picks up the 3%.


Below is what Ben had to say about this gun...

Up for sale is one of my (Ben) personal gen 3 GLOCK 19 carry pistols. This is the nicest, most comprehensive package I've ever put up for sale like this. 

Details: Level 1.5 Grip Pkg w/finger grooves removed & trigger guard flat textured; glove bevel; mag release scallop; reverse mag release scallop; stock mag release corners beveled & polished; light rail modified to Picatinny spec; Glockmeister grip plug; Vickers slide stop; Ghost Rocket 3.5# trigger pkg, with smooth trigger assy swap; milled slide cocking serrations; Boresight logo recessed engraved on top of slide; slide Cerakoted graphite black & sniper grey; Barrel coated in NIC Industries Microslick; Trijicon HD night sights circa 2013.

Gun is in excellent condition, with approx 800 rounds fired. Newly Cerakoted slide, hasn't been holstered or carried since. Comes with original box and 2x used 15 round factory mags. If purchased by a buyer in a state with mag capacity limits, the mags will be removed from the package and price lowered by $20. I will not substitute low-capacity mags. Price reflects exactly what it would cost to buy a new Glock 19 from us and replicate this package (minus a small amount of depreciation due to it being used).. and without the wait."

Great rail Make a offer cash or trade.

The KAC M4 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military’s M4 Carbine, and with over 1 million rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M4 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle’s barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories. Includes three KAC 11 Rib Rail Panels.

Specifications:

    Length: 6.25”
    Weight: 8.9 oz
    Free Float: No
    Material: Aluminum
    Finish: Black Anodizing


Rifle Requirements: The M4 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, M4-type handguards. The rifle must have a carbine length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and round handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (M4 or Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail. For AR-15/SR-15 based platforms only; not compatible with SR-25 variants. Installation instructions are included."

It's a 740i.  There's two known issues. Just wanna be straight forward so no ones time is wasted. 1 I believe the battery is bad. It's throwing up fail safe code. It is due to low voltage.  The plus is the battery. Is still in warrenty till 11/15. Second is I have been customizing this thing was re moveing rear bumper bc planed on getting the euro one in doing so but a crack. So needs a new skin since haven't ordered aftermarket one  98 140k
Higher end of book is $5,150. I have added an additional $3,500 in custom aftermarket ad ons. Including 22"" chrome rims with new z rated tires  There's no rips tears paints good no issues.
