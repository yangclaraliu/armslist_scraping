This is a M/L size vest and will fit up to a 44 inch chest. The vest has mesh pockets on the inside, cross-draw holster with mag pouch, 3 pistol mag pouches on left chest, 3 rifle mag pouches (holds 1 rifle mag each), utility pouch on right chest, 2 pistol mag pouches on belt. I have added a hydration pouch on the back with a new hydration bladder (the bite valve is still sealed), 2 long pouches on the back that I had a large folding knife in (A Cold Steel Rajah II) and a Gerber Folding Saw in on the back in the upside down position for easy removal. I also added a water bottle pouch w/gear pouch to the belt on the right side. There are also 4 attached EMT/Gear pouches attached to the vest. 2 attached on the back of the belt in side-ways position and 2 attached on either side of the vest below the arms. Everything is set-up so any gear can be reached without having to remove the vest, except of course to fill the hydration pouch. Also included are 6 Mod Straps for attaching additional gear or to more securely attach any of the EMT pouches. All this gear is in new condition. Has been loaded out but never used. All of this added together costs more than my asking price so this is a bargain for someone looking for this type of set-up in ACU. So for $100 you get more than $200 of gear. Bottom photo is a composite of all items included except colors are incorrect. All items are ACU. If you need more detailed photos or have any questions feel free to contact me. I will respond to all inquiries."

You can not get more bang for your buck than this Voodoo ""Tactical MOLLE Chest Rig""

The Tactical Chest rig is a well-thought out, functional design that takes advantage of every inch of real estate on your chest. Designed with enough open-top rifle magazine pouches to hold seven M4/M16 30-round magazines.

The rig also features four closed-top pistol magazine pouches.

A pouch for your individual first aid kit (or IFAK).

A rear document pouch, and multiple zippered accessory pouches.
And if that is not enough, the MOLLE compatible webbing allows you to add additional pouches wherever you need them

Of special importance to those who go into harm's way is the pocket deigned to hold a 10"" x 12"" plate. Of course, the chest rig can be worn with or without the plate, and can be used over body armor.

When fully loaded, this chest rig can weigh quite a bit, so you will appreciate the wide, padded straps on the shoulder harness. They are fully adjustable to fit up to at least a size 2XL.

 If you're looking for non-magnetic 7.62x39 range ammo, then Sellier & Bellot's 7.62x39 ammo is an excellent choice. This high quality brass cased ammo does not contain steel in the projectile making it acceptable to shoot at ranges that have a non-magnetic ammo only policy. Brass casings also offer the added benefit of being more corrosion resistant making them more suitable for long-term storage as well as being reloadable."

This is an original remington 700 police model that has been well taken care of. I have the original box for the rifle and neoprene cover for the scope. The 700PSS's are equipped with HS precision aluminum bedded DuPont Kevlar stock, 40x trigger, heavy contour barrel and all is parkerized not Matte Blue. It does have a flat black appearance due to the parkerizing but it looks great and is not some BS rattle can paint job. This rifle consistently shoots 1/2"" groups with cheap rem corelokt 150's. I have never touched the trigger. It breaks clean and crisp but can be adjusted to anyone's liking. The scope is a leupold vari-x III 3.5-10x50. Glass is great. It could use a higher power scope to reach full potential but the vx3 served me well as I just hunt the rifle. I'm not sure why there is such a craze on the .308 version of this rifle. I am able to shoot the 7mag as affordable as .308. The recoil is similar and 7 ballistics are better.
Very clean rifle.... See ballistics on the 7mm vs. .308 
7mm is identical to .300 win but much more manageable recoil.
I do not like a lot of BS if you want to trade let me know what you have looking for a nice light caliber."

No Tauruses please. Let me know what you have, but I'm only looking for a 9mm semi auto or .38 special/.357 revolver, and I'm not interested in rifles or shotguns.

After taxes and BS just over $ 2000
This is an original remington 700 police model that has been well taken care of. I have the original box for the rifle and neoprene cover for the scope. The 700PSS's are equipped with HS precision aluminum bedded DuPont Kevlar stock, 40x trigger, heavy contour barrel and all is parkerized not Matte Blue. It does have a flat black appearance due to the parkerizing but it looks great and is not some BS rattle can paint job. This rifle consistently shoots 1/2"" groups with cheap rem corelokt 150's. I have never touched the trigger. It breaks clean and crisp but can be adjusted to anyone's liking. The scope is a leupold vari-x III 3.5-10x50. Glass is great. It could use a higher power scope to reach full potential but the vx3 served me well as I just hunt the rifle. I'm not sure why there is such a craze on the .308 version of this rifle. I am able to shoot the 7mag as affordable as .308. The recoil is similar and 7 ballistics are better.
Very clean rifle.... See ballistics on the 7mm vs. .308 
7mm is identical to .300 win but much more manageable recoil.
I do not like a lot of BS if you want to trade let me know what you have looking for a nice light caliber."

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.

Bottom Rifle: This rifle is a great optics ready carbine. The upper is a Bushmaster factory upper with 16"" chrome lined barrel and lightweight profile.

Brass is prepared using the following process: 1) Wet tumbled using steel pin media 2) De-primed and resized using Dillon Precision dies and a Dillon XL650 progressive press. 3) Wet tumbled once again to achieve that ""new brass"" finish inside and out and also have crystal clean primer pockets. Note: I no longer trim rifle brass, except where noted, having buyers indicate they prefer to trim to their own specifications. All efforts are made to eliminate any pieces of brass with case mouth damage, cracks and split cases, but you should always perform your own inspection. I would not sell them to you if I would not use them for my own personal reloading. What you will receive will be the outer cases with the super clean interiors unlike what many others will provide (the inner group of darker cases). Why buy half clean cases?"
