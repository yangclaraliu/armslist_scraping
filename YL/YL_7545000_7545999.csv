Still in great condition for a rifle this old.Shoots very straight, very tight and looks great.Cal is 38/40.125 years and still going strong.2017 marks the 125th year of the Model 1892. Of all the rifles produced in an era often called 'the Winning of the West' the John Browning-designed Winchester Model 1892 stands out as an engineering masterpiece. Light, fast, ultra quick to the point, natural . . . . essentially perfect. Of all the pistol caliber rifles of the day, none have become more viable in modern Cowboy Action shooting than the '92. It's a good year to get your hands on some history. The favorite of the Duke and just about all the cowboy actors. 'Fill your hands you . . . ' The Model 92 was elevated to the status of movie star for three quarters of a Century by many of the most famous on-screen cowboys. When you saw a movie with John Wayne, or watched The Rifleman with Chuck Connors you knew that the rifle they used was more than a screen prop. Going back in time, Annie Oakley performed across the world with Buffalo Bill shooting her special smoothbore 1892. $2,900.00  Firm PriceOnly serious contacts....  PLease."

The M145 Telescope is a fixed 3.4 power, 28mm optical sight that has been designed to engage targets accurately out to 1200m range. The optical sight weighs 24 oz. (681 gr) and is extremely rugged for rough field conditions. The sight has an 8.2mm diameter exit pupil, which provides excellent vision in low light levels, i.e. dawn and dusk, and also for rapid target acquisition. The zeroing adjustment increments in both windage and elevation are 2.5 mm at 10 meters range for each detent (click of movement) and 5 inches at 500 meter range. The mount is designed to fit to the Picatinny rail MIL.Std. 1913. The optical sight has an eye relief of approximately 3 inches (70mm). Eye relief is the distance between the eye and the sight’s rear eyepiece lens. The reticle pattern has built-in trajectory compensation from 300m to 1200m range. The reticle is illuminated, by a battery. It has been used in conflicts around the world and is rated for the heaviest of machineguns, such as the M249, 240G, and MINIMI and of course M16 type rifles.
