Comes with a Weaver B6 scope that’s bright and clear(the rear sight is missing). Mechanical Condition is excellent with an excellent bore. We test fired here on our range and the gun shot great. The action is exactly what one would expect from an older Marlin which is to say smooth and sure. It just feels good to work that lever. Cosmetic Condition is great. Metal surfaces retain at least 95% original blue finish. The American black walnut stock and for end are really pretty with a lot of grain and figure. There is a small dent in the stock on the right side just above the lever. I showed this in at least two photos and angled my shots to really bring out the dent. In reality it measures 5/16”x1/4” and is very shallow. On the other side of the stock where it meets the receiver is a tiny shallow crack. My guess is it has been there a long time and will probably not get any larger (please see photos). Oh and the little black and white bullseye Marlin puts in the bottom of the stocks fell out and is missing. I received my first Marlin 39A when I was 9 years old and it remains my favorite rim fire rifle. I ran many bricks of 22 ammo through that old gun and it never let me down. The model 39 is a break down design that comes apart just by unscrewing the thumb screw on the right side of the receiver. This makes it handy to store as well as clean. This rifle has been around in one form or another since 1922 and remains one of the all-time greatest American designed firearms of all time in my opinion. Good luck.If you have questions please feel free to write or call REDACTED. Please be sure this gun is legal in your area before contacting me."
