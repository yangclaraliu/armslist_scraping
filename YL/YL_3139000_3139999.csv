150 rounds Speer 165 gr. FMJ
150 rounds Remington 180 gr. FMJ (50 are soft-nose...don't know what that's about, but

250 rounds Monarch (brass case, not steel) 180 gr. JHP
200 rounds Winchester SilverTip 180 gr. JHP
96 rounds Federal HydraShok 180 gr. JHP
20 rounds Remington Ultimate Defense 180 gr. JHP
13 rounds Hornady Critical Defense JHP (can't remember if it's 165 gr. or 175 gr.)

I also have 1000 rounds (+ a couple) of ONCE FIRED mixed head-stamp .40 brass I'll sell for $35. Picked it up from a law enforcement buddy of mine who caught his own brass on the department range. They weren't allowed to fire hand loads, so he'd shoot his factory loads at the department range and then take his brass for reloading and firing at the local public gun range. He helped me out with getting these, but I never got around to loading them. Mostly Federal and Federal Champion head-stamp, but there's a few Winchester, Remington, and PPU in there that I saw. Not Glock fired.

Will sell as a lot for $450 or split it up if you want something specific. Call Brandon @ REDACTED for details.

Pros:Starts, drives, stops, clean title, comfortable, doesn't leak, all the glass is good, heater is good has a nice locking toolbox. lights all work, brakes in great shape (the previous owner had them completely redone at Les Schwab. I've got the receipt). 

Cons: Door locks have no key (hence the need for a locking tool box.) No headliner, not gonna win any beauty contests, the jump seats in the extended cab got gutted by the previous owner. 

Its got it where it counts. If ya need a first car, or a good dump runner or hunting rig, cant beat it. Gets 22mpg average.

These are retailing for about $625 new these days. Here's a link to one on Davidson's.
http://tinyurl.com/jvjyhrx
The mag catch, installation and other gunsmith work were about $100. 
The holster is awesome and retails for around $65.
The mags total about $90.
The wood grips are $45.
The Hogues are around $20.

But it's now brand new. This has been my daily carry gun for a couple of years, so it has some minor holster wear.  I really love this 1911, but I'm tiring of carrying a steel-framed, 40 oz pistol everywhere.  The included holster makes that much easier, but a belt and pants with belt loops are still a must, if one is to carry this this thing for self-defense. 
Still, this is a great opportunity to own a super-reliable, will-eat-anything-you-feed-it, $800 1911 for well under six-hundred bucks.

The gun is at my home in Sterling, CO at present, but I will be traveling to Denver and the Springs on 6-8 June, so can arrange for a viewing/delivery.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

These pistols use a relatively rare rotating barrel locking system, in which the barrel rotates on recoil to unlock itself from the slide. The rotating motion of the barrel is controlled by the stud on its bottom, which follows the cam track in the steel frame insert.

The frame is made from lightweight aluminum alloy. The basic version of the Cougar pistol is the F model, with double action trigger with exposed hammer, and ambidextrous safety/decocker levers, located on the slide. Alternative is D version, which is double action only, and thus have spurless hammer and no safety/decocker levers. Cougar pistols use double-stack magazines in 9 mm, .357 SIG and .40 caliber models, and single stack magazines in .45 caliber models."

Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.

The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.

The appearance of the Model 110 BA from Savage is as radical as the extreme accuracy it delivers. The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more. The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made. The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum. Standard features in this series include an oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots. Our crisp, clean AccuTrigger ™ allows the user to easily adjust trigger pull weight from approximately 1.5 – 6 pounds.

In refurbishing this stock, I degreased and stripped years worth of gunk, steamed the minor dents, filled the major dents, sanded, stained and hit it with six coats of pure tung oil. There is a faint DAS cartouche, as well as the Circle P in the pistol grip (I didn't sand these and that's how they came to me). I can not see any cracks. Also, I believe this stock was rearsenaled in the 90s as it has a rather new looking liner with fiberglass tabs. Lock up is nice and tight."

Metal parts on each gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature. The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition. Customize your grip with two interchangeable backstraps. Includes rugged carry case, paddle holster, double magazine pouch, two interchangeable backstraps, two magazines, cable lock, bore brush and safety manual.

Has a great barrel ramp that really works for all ammo types.  The pics show the shine of the inside and barrel.  Has a bobbed hammer with a safety lowering switch so its safe to load and then lower the hammer, or leave the safety on and rack it and it will auto lower the hammer.  I installed a Hogue rubber grip which really works nice.  Text with ???  918-695-5NINE FOUR FOUR"

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a single brand new, factory fresh and VERY hard to find Kel-Tec PMR-30 in black! These pistols are incredibly hard to find and tend to sell very quick, so get it while you can! With a huge 30-round mag full of .22 Magnum, these are extremely fun little toys.

 I only have ONE in stock, and have it priced to sell QUICKLY for just $525.00 (cash price).

Kel-Tec PMR-30 .22 Mag Semi-Auto Pistol, 4.25″ Barrel, 30-Round, Zytel Grips, Fiber-Optic Sight

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol.

The trigger is a crisp single action with an over travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. The barrel is fluted for light weight and effective heat dissipation. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

The Chiappa Model 911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semiautomaticpistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun."

Car runs damn good, and when it drives it drives good, does need shocks and struts, has new front Rotors, and Pads, new Headlight Bulbs, lights converted over to 9007 from 9004. Driverside front window fell off track and busted, Glassworks in Tulsa quotes $180 to come out and install the window.

Has Cruise, Heat, A/C needs charged, power windows, locks, mirrors, heated mirrors and rear window defrost, real top of the line for 1990, and the Acclaim beat out Toyota and Honda as the midsize car of the year for that year.

Clean title, tag expires January 2015.

I've decided my AR-10 is sufficient. Only shot 3 times to zero the sights which were fine from the factory. The butt pad on it really absorbs the recoil, actually kicks less than my AR-10! Comes with a black leather Bianchi ching sling. There is a small pea-sized dent on the port side of the forestock as depicted in the photo.
Note: if you live in Arizona, it is legal to ship this directly to your door through USPS. Outside of Arizona, it must go through an FFL. Will ship in a consolidated, discreet package with the buttstock removed
