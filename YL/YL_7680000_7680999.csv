If it is a good reason, I'll take it into consideration.
PLEASE come up with something better than ""I can get that online for $399.99"". Then why the hell are you talking to me?
Thanks for looking and don't hesitate to ask about anything you're not sure of. I'm not an ass, just realistic. Had my first M-16 issued 45 years ago which was manufactured for Colt by Singer. (Yes Singer Sewing Machine Company)

The Co-Ax ® Reloading Press keeps it simple while still delivering famous Forster precision.
The Forster Co-Ax ® Reloading Press comes with several unique features that help make it truly one of a kind, including:
Snap-in and snap-out die changing. You can actually change from sizer die to seater die in two seconds!A positive spent primer catcher system which passes all spent primers and dirty carbon through a tube and into a container. That helps keep all working parts free of dirt and abrasives.Dual floating guide rods to help ensure perfect alignment.Because there is absolutely no torque on the head of the Co-Ax ® Reloading Press, long life is the rule rather than the exception. Due to the design of the linkage and pivots, all forces are in equilibrium whether the press is at maximum work load or at rest.Our Co-Ax ® Reloading Press has three times the mechanical advantage of an ordinary ""C"" press. It's so effortless, full length sizing can actually be accomplished by operating the handle of the press with the little finger! There's no pain but plenty of gain.The Co-Ax ® Reloading Press delivers perfect alignment of the die and the case because the shell holder jaws are designed to float with the die, thereby permitting the case to center precisely in the die.With no frame supports or swinging primer arms to interfere or cause an obstruction, the Co-Ax ® Reloading Press provides plenty of elbow room for both right handed or left handed operators.The Co-Ax ® Reloading Press accepts any standard 7/8"" X 14 reloading die, some with existing locking rings. We recommend Forster Cross Bolt Die Lock Rings.The unique top priming device seats primers to factory specifications. The seater is always at right angles to the case head. Primers will not flip or tip. They will be seated straight, level and at a uniform distance below the case head. Primers cannot be crushed, nor will they protrude from the case head and cause premature firing.The top of the stroke provides a rock solid stop for consistency.Includes “S” jaws to fit most calibers. “LS” jaws are available separately.

Hornady began with a bullet legendary in its accuracy - the Hornady XTP - and redesigned it as the perfect competition projectile. While the XTP uses folds and a cannelure to aid in expansion and increase terminal performance, expansion is meaningless in competition. So, the folds and cannelure are gone from the HAP (Hornady Action Pistol) bullet. Because jamming can cost a competitive shooter the match, Hornady placed the HAP's pure lead core inside a copper jacket that protects the nose, ensuring smooth feeding. And like the XTP, the core of the HAP bullet is cold swaged from pure lead to give it amazing consistence, balance and stability in flight. This is not loaded ammunition.QTY 500 = $85.00QTY 1,000 = $160.00"

Product Description The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).Sorry, no trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax."
