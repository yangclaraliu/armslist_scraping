Has factory night sights, 30 lpi on the front strap, ambi safety, etc. Great little 1911 type. Also have 3 Wilson Combat mags to go with it (about $35/mag retail). This weapon came to me in a trade. Original owner shot it 50 times, wanted an AR, and I had it less than a week out of the box. He experienced some feed issues which I talked to Kimber about. Proper RemOil lube and another 200 rounds to work out the kinks, the gun is just through Kimber's break in period. No skips, dips, FTF or FTE in the last 100 rounds once I did a thorough clean and lube. Will make a nice carry piece for someone who wants that .45, but doesn't want 5"" of barrel down their pants.

Comes with box, manuals, papers, strip tool (I'll be happy to demo if you aren't familiar), 1 factory mag, 3 WC mags, and the pistol. I can't find a deal on them online. Gander Mtn and Bass pro are like $1500 and $1350 respectively - one mag only. They are clearly overpriced. My trade partner was into this for just over $1400 with the extra mags. I'll show you the receipt, but to respect privacy, I will shred it after a deal is made. 

It's a nice gun, it will take good care of you, and it was just meticulously cleaned and reassembled for trade/sale. If you haven't had a 1911 before, I don't necessarily think this is the first one to own, but I will show you how to break it down, the recommended contact points for lube, and reassembly."

Original PK-01 V Military Red Dot Rifle Weapon Scope w/ Brightness Adjustment, Detachable AK Side Mount and Standard 30 mm Tube.

It has a standard 30 mm tube so it can be attached to virtually any weapon. It has a traditional bright red dot with a minimum MOA of 1.5. The PK-01VA has a special 8 setting, discreet built-in variable brightness control allowing you to regulate the brightness of the dot manually. It is overbuilt to handle the strongest of recoils and can be attached to any weapon regardless of caliber. The sight is waterproof and dry nitrogen purged to prevent fogging. It works well with night vision optics. The open windage and elevation knobs are easily accessible for adjustment and have clear, pronounced 2/3 MOA clicks. Russian sights are particularly popular for having open uncovered knobs that are finger adjustable.

This rifle features the optics ready flat-top upper with 16"" carbine barrel. My intention with this rifle was to deck it all out in ""tacticool"" furniture and accessories, but I only got as far as installing a BLACKHAWK tactical beavertail Ergo grip and then lost interest. Liquid looking splotches on rifle are just spots of CLP that did not quite get wiped off after I oiled the rifle. Also included with the sale of this rifle will be one D&H aluminum mag (not pictured).

Also have a new in box EoTech 512. This optic was purchased by me at Dunham's Sporting Goods in Defiance and cost $459.99 plus tax. I only took it out while still in Dunhams to check and make sure the sight worked properly. Its condition is 100% factory condition and has never been mounted. Everything that comes with these from the factory is included.

I would like to get $750 cash for the AR-15 and $380 cash for the new EoTech. I would sell both as a package deal for $1080 cash. Will only sell to individuals who are of proper legal standing to own. I am located in Henry County and can meet face to face within reasonable distance. In addition to email I can also be called/texted at REDACTED. If no answer, please leave a message and I will get back with you ASAP.

Black polymer frame. Auto firing pin block safety, manual safety. Fixed sights. Double action. 

The SAR ARMS SR B6P Semi Auto Pistol is a modern reproduction with improvements on the world famous CZ75* design. First we took the frame and made it polymer and improved the ergonomics, next we used state of the art manufacturing technology to improve the quality, then we added state of the art material and material processing to give you the SAR B6P that has the competition wondering. 

150 rounds of ammo included. 4 extra 17 rd. magazines. Brand new tactical holster.

Just got this pistol and am very happy with it. It is in my book, as good if not better then some of the bigger gun companies out there. It is easy to carry open or CCW. It is also very accurate. Looking at some other guns and want to let this go while it is still pretty new. $450 or best offer. 

Awesome gun and value. Great price and a great gun! Love it! I shot the dots on my target right out of the box. It has a great feel and shoots well from various distance. Recommend highly don't let the price fool you it is a great investment.

Nice smooth recoil ,light. Worth twice what I paid. Well made, a solid value for an open carry weapon.

Starting with the CZ-75 famous design is always a smart move. The B6P does a good job following that tradition. Tight, very dependable, and actually shoots where I aim right out of the box. I can recommend this firearm with no reservations for the right use. Awesome quality pistol!

 I bought this gun because of the price. After taking it to the range I was blown away (no pun) by the performance. At 25 yards I was getting some really tight groups. I fired a bunch of mags and not a single malfunction. I like the mag capacity. Also found some 19 round mags on line to increase fire power. I have a lot of confidence in this pistol. For the money you will find no finer firearm.
I have put 150 rounds through it with not one problem. Cleaning and lubricating it is easy. For the price of this gun you get all the quality you would expect from something costing twice as much. By far the best gun for the money. Flawless performance, and a great feel, and tight groups."

Up for sale is a brand new unfired LMT MWS 308.  This rifle has been chose by the British SAS as their DMR (Designated Marksman Rifle).   It beat out HK’s HK417 and FN’s SCAR 17 in final testing!  MSRP on the gun is over $3,000. This is new in the box/packaging along with all accessories from the factory that are also new in package. These items have been stored in my gun safe upstairs in a temperature controlled dry environment.  I have extra Magpul 20LR Pmags available if interested, $15 each w/ purchase of this rifle.

I DO NOT/WILL NOT trade anything for this (please don’t ask), I am looking to get the money I paid back, that’s it.  Only serious inquiries and please don’t ask/haggle about price, I purchased this at a discount and simply want what I paid back. If you can find it elsewhere in stock cheaper, congratulations and best of luck. If you have any questions, need more pictures, or are interested in buying this package, contact Jason REDACTED or email me REDACTED. I work evenings so I likely won’t respond until after noon. Text or calling will provide the quickest response. I will only ship/sell this package where legal and it must go through an FFL where required. Thanks for your interest & God Bless!

It has an extremely low round count and fully adjustable rear sights.
The revolver is a 6 shot and comes with the original pachmayr grips.
Its like new with no nicks, dings, or scratches, ( IT IS A BEAUTIFUL GUN).
The gun has smooth double\single action and locks up tight, it also has no kick and is EXTREMELY accurate.
I'm asking 675$ OBO, if you check on Armslist or any other gun sights you can not find this gun listed for less then 650$.
I am also accepting trades for a handgun of equal value or I can add cash for a more expensive gun or take a cheaper gun + cash.
I'm looking for a nice semi auto, preferably a 40 cal or 45 ACP that has a high capacity magazine such as a Glock, Springfield XDM, Smith & Wesson, Sig Sauer, or various 1911s, but I will look at all trades the worst I can say is no.
I do not want any shotguns, rifles, bows\crossbows, calibers smaller than a .380acp, or non gun related items (except I do take men's gold jewelry).
You can contact me anytime day or night at 574-904-6678.

I would proudly put it up against ANY 5 year old boat. It was kept inside a marina until I got it 3 years ago. Why am I selling it..........last year my mother in law with Ahlziemers came to live with us and we only got out on it 3 times. It’s too big for me to launch and retrieve by myself, so it’s for sale or trade. I don’t need $$$ so I would be happier trading it for a smaller center console or bass boat, or maybe a Harley.

I will trade for a smaller boat, a GUN COLLECTION, a Harley or $12,500.00 FIRM !!!

Bravo One outdrive
141 hours, that’s right 141 hours !!!!!!! Will go up, I still use it.
Marina kept inside ‘till I acquired it 3 year’s ago.
This boat is WAY above average in condition and way low hours, way low. 
I traded a $14,000.00 Harley for this boat and right away put about $3,000.00 in it to make it as near perfect as it can be. It runs PERFECT, has never had a hiccup, the trailer is in perfect running order. The cuddy has a sink, single burner stove and porta potty. All cuddy cushions are as new ! Not a tear or anything anywhere.

Impeller replaced when I got the boat. 
I bought all new trailer tires when I got it.
Chain, anchor, and rode all new.
AM/FM CD new.
VHF ship to shore new.
Shakespeare 5225XT new.
Dual batteries, I bought 1 new and the other was 2 years old The list goes on.
I had the camper top windows replaced. Previous owner was quoted $1,500.00 alone for that but my guy cut me a little break on the price since he’s done work for me on my father in laws bass boat.

The first time out this year, a hub broke. Instead of just replacing it, I went ahead and had all 4 hubs replaced, all new COMPLETE brake assemblies replaced, everything, new hydraulic brake line from the front coupler clear back to the new assemblies. I don't play around. Also a solenoid went bad on my trim, so instead of replacing it, I had BOTH replaced and I even bought an extra to keep on the boat, just in case.

Almost a $1,000.00 in these repairs this week!!!

My new registration came in the mail yesterday, paid ‘till 2017.

When I see someone broke down on the water or the road, I always vow to myself that I will NOT be that guy. 
Rigged to fish off the swim platform, I didn’t allow fishing from inside the boat, I didn’t want it to smell or get bait dried up laying around, or hook rips in my interior. The interior doesn’t have a rip or anything wrong with it.
This 22’ Stingray is small enough to tow to any lake, anywhere, yet big enough to take offshore, the best of both worlds. With the 300 hp Mercruiser it will hit 60+ mph in near perfect conditions with 2 people and half tank of fuel, slight chop. That was GPS verified, NOT the in dash speedo!


How much am I asking.....$250,000.00, because I know you’ll want to talk me down on price, so let’s start there. I plan to end up with $12,500.00 in my pocket, a gun collection or a Harley.
 If your gun collection and/or Harley isn’t worth $12,500.00, you’ll need to add cash, to make up the difference. 


You will not find a nicer, cleaner low hour boat than this for the year. The boat looks near new, no rips, no tears, 141 hours, 350 magnum, Bravo 1 drive, new $400.00 cover,  no oil leaks.
I am anal with keeping this boat clean, perfect and maintained.

This boat is in tip top running condition at all times. The last thing I want is stranded on a broke down vessel !!!

Will also trade for Leer Jet, will need flying lessons.

The only thing this boat needs is the carpet cleaned and if I can get to it, I will have it done next week if it isn’t sold/traded before then.

THE PRICE IS FIRM. I WILL NOT TAKE A PENNY LESS !!!"

Purchased brand new last August, 8 rounds through it total.

It's detachable box magazine fed, 3+1 capacity, barrel is 22 7/16"" long, cold hammer forged with an 11"" rate of twist. The trigger is adjustable between 2 and 4 pounds. 

The scope is a Nikon Prostaff 4-12x40mm with the BDC reticle. It is mounted on Talley  One-piece (Low) rings/bases. These are very solid mounts and in my opinion give the rifle a lot cleaner look than regular rings/mounts. Both the scope and rings were purchased for this rifle so they're both new too.

Rifle MRSP is give or take $680, the scope is $220, and the rings were $50. All together that's $950.

for  7.5 cents per round.  And you can only get 100 rounds.  And you pay shipping on top of that.
If the MAJOR retailers are selling crap ammo for that price, can you really keep complaining about 10 cents a round here on arms list, with out a 100 round limit?

I have seen these same crap bullets in a 1400 round bucket sell for $200+.  So if a guy wants $45 for his brick of Thunderbolt, can ya blame him?
The days of cheap 22 shooting are pretty much done, I am afraid.  if you don't like the price, don't buy.  But it is not likely that you will be able to add to the 50,000 rounds already in your closet at $1.99 a box any more.

-NDZ performance pinky mag extension with the US flag and ""VETERAN"" on the bottom. Retail price: ~19.99
-I painted the front sight indentation with Testor's fluorescent orange paint, then added two layers of clearcoat.
-Box and all stock parts

This is an Italian made Beretta, so I think it puts it somewhere around 1984 before the big clampdown on mag capacity.  It's a double stack so the mag holds 13 rounds and the grip feels nice and positive in your hand and as a result, it points very naturally without having to move it around in your hand like must be done a lot with a weapon that has a tiny grip.  I've lowered the price on this because I really want to sell it to fund something else, but at this price, it's firm.  It comes with 1 mag, though several ads on here have them for $25-30, and a non-original hard plastic case.  It has, as you can see, some pitting on the hard edge of the slide, but it's nothing egregious that will hinder anything and if you use this for carry, it will likely get some sweat and moisture on it anyway.  Hit me up, let's talk about this!  It's a very nice piece and priced very right!"

This pistol comes with everything is sold with new; the original tool kit, paperwork, matching serial number box, extra magazine and wax paper.  There is not much to say about this pistol except it is nearly perfect.  The checking on the wood grips is still very crisp and sharp.  All of the nickel parts are free from scratches and there are no areas where the nickel is thin or coming off.  The bore of the barrel is like new as well.  I have fired this pistol and I always clean it once I'm finished.  I have put under 50 rounds through it and I don't think this pistol has seen 50 rounds through it.  The serial number puts it in the mid to late 70's for production.  I have had this pistol for several years and it sets in the safe next to my older blued one.  I don't need two of them so I'm selling the nicest one.  I will include a set of vintage Pachmayr grips as well.  I am asking $725 Cash $850 trade value for this pistol.  If you would like me to ship it all expenses will be on you.  This is a wonderful pistol and you just don't see them often as complete as this one with the correct matching silver box and all the goodies they came with new.  Please email me with your contact information (name and phone number) and I will get back with you.  I will only consider trades of quality handguns and might even add some cash for the right trade.

There is not much to say about this Revolver except it is really nice!  This revolver was manufactured in 1963 and has original Smith & Wesson Target Grip and I have a set of Pachmayr grips for it as well..  The blue finish is exceptionally deep and in near perfect condition.  The bore of the barrel is like new as well.  I have fired this revolver a few times and I always cleaned it once I'm finished.  I have put under 30 rounds through it and I don't think this revolver has seen 100 rounds through during its 50+ year life.  The serial number puts it in 1963 for production.  I have had this I for several years and it sets in the safe.  I will include everything listed at my $1000 asking price.  If you are not interested in the wood display case I will sell the S&W 27-2 for $850 with the original box and paperwork but you get no case and no tools.  If you would like me to ship it all expenses will be on you.  This is a wonderful revolver and you just don't see them completely as this with the correct matching box and all the goodies they came with new from Smith & Wesson.  Please email me with your contact information (name and phone number) and I will get back with you.  I will only consider trades of quality handguns and might even add some cash for the right Trade.

Sig Sauer P938 Pistol
PX38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser
One 6-Round Flush Fit Magazine

Sig Sauer gave the discreet, all-metal P238 platform some 9mm muscle, and the result is the P938: the first 1911-inspired 9mm microcompact by SIG SAUER®. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever all in familiar places.

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 can pack six or seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame, depending on the magazine (this version includes both).
NBS13 Package Overview

Sig Sauer has included both a 6-round (flush fit) and 7-round (extended) magazine with a finger-grip extension. In addition, this P938 also comes equipped with a SIG laser.
X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser
Sig-Sauer-P938-938-X38-TGL-Laser

The SIG X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser for the P938™ Pistol is a compact, lightweight, red pointing laser used for aiming. The X38-TGL combines pinpoint accuracy and rapid target acquisition with intuitive operation, in a form fitting package weighing only 1.0 oz.

Ambidextrous On/Off switches
