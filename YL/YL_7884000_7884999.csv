This is a single action only (SAO) revolver that Beretta commisioned from Uberti in italy. The stainless model is more rare and the stainless Deluxe model is the only model in the entire line that is chambered in .357 Magnum. Even more rare is the 7.5"" barrel model such as this one. This is a very hard to find special run from Beretta. The gun is in great overall condition with all original parts and the grips are excellent! Comes with a hand made leather holster which attaches to a bandolier style gun belt which is not pictured. Gun belt size 34 (which I was never even close to fitting in and is why the holster is not on the belt right now). I bought this last year in the hopes of getting into cowboy action shooting and it has yet to happen. I never even ended up carrying it at all. It has been to the range a handful of times and is a sweet shooter but I have no use for it and would prefer to have something else. I am asking $650 for the revolver and gun belt/holster together. I am flexible on the price for the right deal.If you are interested, please save us both a lot of time and review the below information. Thanks!Please, be able to have an intelligent conversation about pricing, values, basic guns and ammo information and item descriptions. I try to list everything of importance in my ads and do not want to have a week long back and forth discussion because you cannot articulate an acceptable explanation of your items or questions about my items. If you refer to magazines as clips, cartridges as boolets or send photos of your guns with your finger on the trigger, I will assume we are off to a less than desirable start. Sorry if I sound rude, but I have bought and sold a fair amount from Armslist and the sheer amount of people that cannot seem to follow the golden four rules of firearms safety or use correct terminology is an ongoing issue.If you decide to purchase a handgun from me, I will take down your ID and CPL/PP info, I will fill out the pistol transfer forms as is required by law and I will write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. If you decide to buy a long gun from me, I will check your ID and write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. The bill of sale will include identifying information for both parties and there will be a copy for me and a copy for you. This is only done as a measure of protection for both parties. This is something you should welcome in an honest transaction. The registration paperwork and bill of sale on handguns is not negotiable. I don't like the laws any more than the rest of you but I intend to follow them. If you read this and are still interested and have any questions, please let me know.If you want to test fire a gun that I am selling, that is perfectly acceptable in most cases. I am happy to meet with you at Family Shooters Corral on a weekend with you as my guest or at a range of your choosing at your own expense.Thank you for looking!

Six-shot 44 Magnum/44 Special Caliber. N-frame. Serial # CFU22XX.  Classy 4” ribbed tapered barrel - the vintage style “pencil barrel” like the Model 24 and 27, Outdoorsman, & Registered Magnum.   This is also a rare 4-Screw gun (note top sideplate screw).  Beautiful polished blue finish, 99.9% condition, with light drag line on the cylinder that was there when it was bought new (I am original owner).  I had a hard time wiping all of the oil off of the gun, so please forgive the photos.  Hard to upgrade over this one.  Bought new in 2003, and is a babied “safe queen”.  Round butt grip frame. A .400” semi-target hammer with .312” smooth target trigger. Pinned black factory Baughman ramp front sight with micrometer click rear sight. A mint, beautiful set of Ahrends fancy Goncalo Alves finger groove grips, plus a Hogue rubber Monogrip (gun originally came factory with both). This was a “Stocking dealer special” with very limited availability. Retains its original black S&W logo plastic case. Code 161236FC. Manufactured in January 2003. This is NOT the later, more common 29MG version with stippled wood grips and no Hogue rubber grips included.   Excellent trigger pull in either single or double action.  Only two hundred .44 Special rounds through it total. Classic square thumbpiece on bolt release.  Original angled modern version thumbpiece included in case.  The Mountain Revolver series is very sought-after for both collectors as well as field users.  These make “perfect packing pistols”. Excellent for S&W, Colt, and Ruger collectors.  These big N-frame Smith and Wessons and their K-frame Model 19 cousins competed with the Colt Python, Diamondback, 1911, Trooper, .357 Magnum, Dan Wesson, Redhawk, Blackhawk and GP-100 revolvers.   Includes original black plastic S&W logo case serial numbered to revolver, owners manual, stocking dealer flyer on Mdl 29 Mtn Gun, fired case, keys, warrantee card, cable lock, anti-corrosion paper, Hogue rubber Monogrip with stirrup, and Ahrends fancy Goncalo Alves finger groove square butt conversion grips.  I hate to let this one go, but we are planning a family vacation.  No low-ballers please. 
No trades. All applicable State and Federal laws will be complied with. Valid NC Concealed carry permit or valid NC Pistol permit from the sheriff’s office required, plus valid NC Driver’s License.  No exceptions, and don’t even think of asking me to violate gun laws."

Welcome to a reality rant. Remember when shopping on arms list that you will be dealing with the gun guys that have the only gold filled used weapon in existance. It has never been fired, but shoots great and is very reliable! You will be expected to pay or trade for full New value plus extras, bacause your trade is also used and can be found on buds for the price of two well fed chickens. I have two pieces of advise for sellers. 1. Your gun is not as valuable as you think, that is why it continues to sit for months on end. 2. If you are offered trades and your value is inflated, you should expect the same inflation on the offer. Trust me you are not the only informed Gun Guy around."

It is small and light enough to be easily concealed and comfortably carried, yet has twice the capacity of slimmer 9mm Luger pistols.   At the range, both new and advanced shooters will appreciate the easy-to-rack slide; short, crisp trigger pull; eye-catching sights; and ergonomic, textured grip frame. The American-made Security-9 is constructed around a rigid, one-piece, precision-machined, aluminum chassis with full-length guide rails; a blued, through-hardened alloy steel slide and barrel; and a high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame with an integral accessory rail.   The Secure Action used in the Security-9 is the same as the LCP® II and is derived from the reliable and proven hammer-fired LCP fire control system, combining the smooth trigger pull of the LCP with the short, crisp feel and positive reset of a single action. Safety features include a bladed trigger safety, external manual safety, neutrally balanced sear with significant engagement and strong spring tension, and a hammer catch to help prevent the hammer from contacting the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled.   Firearm Features    Compact for easy concealment, the mid-sized Security-9 is designed to fit a variety of available holsters and concealed carry options.

Dovetailed, high-visibility sight system with drift adjustable rear sight and fixed front sight. Sights can be easily changed out for different color options (available separately). Internal, Secure Action hammer provides strong ignition force yet allows for easier slide racking when compared with many striker-fired pistols. Front cocking serrations enable positive slide manipulation. Safety features include bladed trigger safety; manual safety; neutrally balanced sear with significant engagement and strong spring tension; and hammer catch to help prevent the hammer from contacting the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled.

I’m only selling it to help fund another rifle.  I've had a few questions about it already; Yes, it's a real Sig . Yes, the first photo is the actual gun, it is not a stock photo. I got lucky on that one lol. Yes, it has a standard rail, it is not the old Sig proprietary one. Thanks for your interest everyone :)   It comes with two original SIG 12 round magazines, 12 Hornady Critical Defense HP rounds, and the box and manual.

This is an incredible pistol. Great shooting accurate firearm with extremely comfortable grip design.  The sights are amazing.  Glow in the dark and fiber optic in the day.  I paid $2095 for this firearm new.  I've put 350 rounds through it in the 4 months that I've had it.  I have all the original packaging, literature and assecories that came from the factory and the extra magazine.  If not for the facts of owning two Bruins and needing the money I would not be selling it. It has a disassembly scratch under the slide release and some minor marking on the main spring plug.  I'm asking $1250.  I'm firm on that price.
If your interested in purchasing this pistol or have questions, please text me at (541)771-one433I will return emails and phone messages but texting is the fastest.Purchaser must be 21 years of age and be able to pay for and pass a background check at a local FFL dealer per Oregon Law.
