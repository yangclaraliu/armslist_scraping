It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels. It also has molded finger grooves for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model comes with 3-Dot sights, and includes two (2), 15-round magazines.

This bike currently will not start. The back story: I went to Michigan this past summer with some old friends for a guys riding weekend and brought my old 450. In the first hour of riding the engine blew and I was out of a bike so I went on craigslist and bought the cheapest old beater bike i could find locally just so I had something to ride for the weekend. I paid $1100. It ran like a raped ape the entire weekend and never had any issues. I brought it back to AL with me and it has been in my garage since. It ran when I parked it but now it will not start. Not sure if it is because of the cold weather or if the carb needs to be cleaned, or if the gas in it has ruined but it has plenty of compression and it turns over fine so there is no huge reason why it won't run. Like I said, it did when i parked it. The carb just probably needs to be cleaned or its too cold and needs different jets in the carb. Not really sure and I dont plan on taking any time to figure it out. I just need this thing out of my garage so the first $500 that comes along can have it. The rear tire has since went flat as well. Not sure why but it did have air in it at one time and it may take air again, not sure about that either. The sprockets have wear on them, the chain is stretched out a good bit and it is definitely no show piece but it did run and will run again with very little work im sure.Now for the good. It has new plastics less the front number plate, new grips, new air filter, newer plug, Renthal bars and a Pro Circuit silencer. It will also come with a new set of aluminum radiators that came with it. I just never put them on.Interested buyer only. Must be willing to meet me at the Tractor Supply in Moody. SOLD AS IS, WITH BILL OF SALEFirst come first serve, $500 cash firm or trade for an AR-15 or a Glock 19 gen 4 or 5. Call or text me anytime. 205-nine o three-404five.

The full-size frame and the compact slide have joined forces to produce the ideal pistol for all conditions and all situations. “The G19X was developed for the military and is a practical everyday pistol that will do what you need it to do, when you need it to; every time, in every condition,” says GLOCK VP Josh Dorsey. “The pistol was developed for the military using GLOCK’s combat proven experience with consideration to efficiency, dependability and durability. Through rigorous testing, the G19X stands out above the competition and has the ability to function in all situations with ultimate reliability and accuracy. Our goal was to meet the demanding needs of the military while maintaining our standard of perfection. With proven results, the G19X delivers maximum efficiency and trustworthiness.” Confidence now comes in the coyote color with the first-ever factory colored slide. The nPVD slide coating of the GLOCK 19X prevents corrosion, resists chemicals, and stands up against the elements. Additional design features of the G19X include the GLOCK Marksman Barrel (GMB) with enhanced polygonal rifling and an improved barrel crown for increased accuracy, ambidextrous slide stop levers and no finger grooves for better versatility, and a lanyard loop for retention. The pistol includes a standard 17-round magazine and two 17+2-round extended magazines along with a coyote-colored pistol case. The aggregate effect of all the G19X design enhancements gives any user the assurance to succeed and survive in all situations. A perfect “Crossover to Confidence”."

The bolt and bolt carrier assembly have received a nickel-boron finish for increased durability and lubricity. The lower receiver is configured in typical AR-15 fashion with the magazine release on the right side and the bolt catch and safety selector located on the left. The receivers show the most obvious limited edition markings to be found on the rifle (in white). These include Limited Edition 2015 printed on the left side of the upper receiver just under the sight rail, NRA 1871 inside the dust cover, the limited edition unit number (XXXX/1000) on the right side of the lower receiver just above the trigger housing and the full NRA logo on the right side of the magazine well.Inside the lower receiver is a Black Rain BRO-DIT single-stage trigger group which features a blue anodized housing and custom steel bow trigger. Secured firmly in place with a set of KNS Precision anti-rotation pins, this trigger is listed as shipping with a 3-lbs. 7-oz. trigger pull. However, the unit provided with this rifle exhibited a crisp, clean, well-tuned performance of just 2 lbs. 7 oz. according to a Lyman's digital trigger gauge. This made it a real pleasure to work with at the shooting range. Each and every component has been crafted carefully with an eye toward producing a unique rifle any NRA, 2nd Amendment or AR-15 enthusiast would be proud to own. The buffer assembly is housed in a UTG buffer tube paired with a six-postion rubber padded MOE shoulder stock from Magpul. Where the tube joins the receiver a Magpul ASAP single-point sling mount has been installed. The comfortable textured pistol grip with storage compartment is also a Magpul MOE product. The custom 16"" threaded barrel is constructed of 416r stainless steel with a Wylde chamber and modified throat for improved accuracy when using both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. cartridges. Six 6"" flutes are added near the muzzle after the barrel has been treated with a matte black salt bath nitride to give the barrel a two-tone finish. The round stainless steel BRO Competition Compensator features two large side-facing ports with four more small ports along the top to reduce felt recoil.The rifle arrives with an American-made NRA logo padded soft case with magazine pouches attached along the outside, a quick detach single-point sling fitted with a wide elastic strap, and a single Magpul 30-round polymer PMAG magazine. No sights are provided.For more info call 1-877-466-4326Need Ammo?  Check out our website -- >> Mid America Munitions"

It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels. It also has molded finger grooves for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model has an OD Green frame, black slide with 3-dot sights, and includes two (2), 15-round magazines."

It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the pistol's grip position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model has a Flat Dark Earth frame, black slide with 3-dot sights, and includes two (2), 15-round magazines."

Built in 1979 (I think) and was originally owned by the Cincinnati Police Department according to the guy I purchased this from many years ago. Based on the N frame, this smoothbore is chambered for 37mm ammunition. Unlike a lot of the modern launchers, this one is all ordnance steel with a beech (?) buttstock. Bore is in amazing shape considering the ammo used black powder for the lift charges-someone at the CPD cared enough to clean this one religiously after use! Might consider a trade depending on what you have. These are fairly rare guns and I’m guessing they will only go up in value over time. Reloading is easy and does not require a loading press. Will fire LTL rounds too but ANY anti-personnel round makes this gun a destructive device. Register it as a DD and you can shoot a lot of interesting projectiles including fleshette/buckshot/beanbag/etc.."

It’s 1.75 inches diameter inside. It would be perfect for a  PCC or pistol/SBR build of some kind. It has 1 or 2 little knicks on the barrel nut that could be covered by a black sharpie but it’s JP so it is a very rigid rail. Great quality and the way this thing mounts is bomb proof.
