The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle."

Barely used; Like New!... 

Eotech 553.A65BLK Holographic Sight with Box and Instructions

The EoTech 553.A65 from Morovision is a holographic daytime weapon sight that is night vision compatible. Fast and surgically precise sight acquisition is possible, without compromising your 'heads-up' peripheral vision.

The versatility of this sight is remarkable, as it can be used in conjunction with a night vision monocular. This combo effectively produces an accurate and versatile night vision rifle scope. A special night vision setting allows the operator to immediately drop the brightness intensity of the holographic reticle to eliminate any 'halo' effect and saturation of the night vision device. When the appropriate rail extension and quick release mechanisms are employed, this combination allows your weapon to go from broad daylight to no-light environments quickly, easily, and without losing zero.

This is an extremely durable and reliable weapon sight. It is waterproof (submersible to over 30') and fogproof, with a repeatable 1 MOA after remounting. The window material is a 3/16' thick shatterproof laminate with anti-glare and scratch resistant coatings, and the housing features a non-reflective black hard coat finish.

Engineered for small to medium caliber weapon platforms, the 553 is an excellent choice for use in CQB or urban battle environments. Because it is also accurate for longer range sighting, it should be noted that the holographic technology leaves no muzzle-side optical signature. Whatever your tactical needs are, you can rely on the EoTech 553.

Reticle: 65 MOA ring w/1 MOA dot
Environment: Waterproof and submersible to 66' (20 m)
Mounting: Mil-Std 1913 (Picatinny) rail compatible

This rifle was part of the great Parts Peddle Scheme developed in 1916. SSA made less than 250K rifles total from 1916- June 1 1918 when NRF took over production. With an estimated 6 Million plus Enfields made, and SSA accounting for less than a 24th of the grand total, that, in my opinion puts this SSA stamped model in the pretty damned uncommon club. Some would even use the word rare, me I like PDU..lol.

In addition to it's stamped provenance, notice the Osterr Gendarmerie stamp forward of the receiver on top of the barrel. This rifle was sent to Austria post WWII for police service. After Germany confiscated the Austrians weapons, they had none for security and were lent several types of small arms to aid in their recovery. Later returned and re-barreled in 1956 at the Enfield arsenal. 

This rifle is an amazing survivor even in it's sporterized condition. Complete with the original wind-age adjustment sights. Take a look at all of the stamps and do your own research if you like. Google 'Markings, All About Enfields' and you'll be on a great site for researching this veteran.

An interesting note. The unit badge in the stock is not a unit badge. It is in fact a US silver quarter. I popped it out and one side is ground smooth, the other has the 'tails' side with a spread wing eagle. I've read of a few other rifles found like this, interestingly enough, they are also sporterized Osterr Gendarmerie models. I think this tentatively shows that there was an arsenal/company that effected the sporterization of the rifle. Because, again in my opinion, that is too unique an object to swap in place of the unit badge, to happen randomly. 

I have 20 plus detailed pics, email to see all of them.

FWIW, in the original military dress these rifles run in the $800+ range. An original stock and the various 'extra bits' needed to complete this will run 200-250 or so keeping you under the 'retail' value and have a collector grade rifle to enjoy."

Some time back I purchased a Stag Arms 3G-L The 3G was Stag's top-of-the-line AR focused on 3-gun shooting. Great trigger, barrel, rail and muzzle device. Trouble is, I bought it as a range shooter and hunting and HD gun and it just didn't work for me. Heavy, too long and front-heavy balance. Being a left-hander I tried to re-imagine and build a gun in a style and configuration that would suit me. That is, keep with the good parts of the 3GL but solve the issues of balance, muzzle behavior, an even-better parts list and then, as Colin Chapman said, 'add lightness'. No vendor was building such a gun, particularly not a left handed model.
I built two of them. One in .223 and the other in .300 BLK. However my CFO/wife has informed me that one has to go, so I present to you a re-imagined Stag Arms Left-Hand 300 BLK rifle that Stag Arms really ought to build. It may be a bit too 'top shelf' for their market, but it's a beautiful thing.

Contents:

Stag Arms - lower
Stag Arms - left handed upper
Stag Arms - left handed bolt/BCG
Geissele - SSA-E Trigger (the best trigger I've ever shot to date and preferable (to me) to Geisele's hybrid 3-gun trigger)
ACE - Skeleton buttstock 9.9"" (strong, lightweight, has adjustable shims to adjust the LoP)
Alpha Micro - 16"" medium weight barrel (1:8) 
Samson - .750 low profile gas block
BCM - Floating Keymod forearm ( incredibly light and well designed forearm - one of the first quality keymod stocks that help grip, pointing and handling)
Troy Industries - Claymore muzzle brake
Ranier Arms - Ambi charging handle

This is a high-quality build both uncommon in the fledgling 300 BLK community and impossible to find for us left-handers
The gun was built, then reviewed by my FFL before firing and then function tested (10 rounds)"

I am left handed and the Beretta is a true left handed gun. This gun has a neutral cast but an adjustable comb that is almost as good. It will work for a right or left hander equally well. So I only shot a few rounds of sporting clays and am selling it. 

2009 manufacture date. I bought it online so I don’t know how many rounds it has through it but the lever is still to the right and it is still tight. 12 gauge, 32 inch barrel. Factory adjustable comb that I like. Very simple to change. Current LOP is 14.5 inches but can be changed using one of three different Browning butt pads and spacers. However only the pad and spacer you see comes with the gun. Trigger can also be moved to one of three positions to adjust hand position. Comes with 5 Diana grade choke, Sk, Sk, IC, Mod and IM. Didn’t come with a LM. Includes a total of 3 trigger shoes, different colored Hi-Viz light pipes, Allen wrenches for the trigger and comb, a manual and a choke wrench. No case but does include a non-original Browning box.

It has been shot, but it is in good shape. Has some marks including a scratch in front of the receiver on the left hand side and a partially filled small gouge on the bottom of the stock near the butt pad. More information on the gun can be seen at the Browning  link below. Current retail for this gun is $4,499.00.

I can provide more photos on request.

Proprietary EXO-treated Nickel Boron finish produces an exceptionally hard surface that’s 40% more wear resistant than chrome plating, with an ultra-low friction coefficient. Surface is actually harder than the substrate underneath and will not peel, flake, gall, or rub off. EXO-treated Nickel Boron finish bolt/carrier groups have been tested to function reliably without additional lubrication up to 50,000 rounds. Reduced friction also means less heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer. Easy to clean, too—fouling brushes right off. Before treatment, parts are shot peened for surface uniformity and magnetic particle inspected to make sure there are no hidden flaws. Gas key is hardened to USGI specs, chrome lined to resist erosion, and comes already staked to the carrier.

"" When the Line Must Be Crossed..."" First Responders are the ones who must cross the line into danger. Their respiratory equipment must be ready and reliable to protect them against potentially lethal airborne threats.

On March 12, 2004, MSA's NEW Millennium CBRN Gas Mask was the FIRST NIOSH-certified CBRN full-facepiece air-purifying respirator (APR). There are currently only two, the Millennium and the 3M Fr-M40b. The Millennium gas mask provides first responders with effective respiratory protection against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agents that might be used in a terrorist attack. (NIOSH Approval number TC-14G-0270)

MSA has manufactured gas masks for almost 90 years and understands how critical CBRN protection is to first responders. MSA is proud to be the first to have met the challenge of meeting the new NIOSH CBRN standards and to provide the equipment to protect first responders in the battle against terrorism.

With nearly a century of history and success behind it, MSA stands ready to protect Americans -- this time against all potential airborne contaminants that could be unleashed by terrorists across our homeland. The Millennium CBRN gas mask is the most up-to-date example of MSA's commitment and unwavering dedication to protect today's and tomorrow's First Responder.
MSA Millennium CBRN gas mask meets or exceeds all performance requirements of the new NIOSH CBRN Standard (read below) by effectively removing harmful gases, vapors and particulates so that the user can confidently breathe safely. The Millennium CBRN canister contains chemical sorbents and a P100 filter to attract, retain, and neutralize contaminants. The Millennium CBRN design is based on a highly successful military gas mask. The wearer enjoys a wide field of view and great flexibility,making it possible to safely perform any tasks required, including firing weapons if needed. The wearer can communicate easily while wearing the Millennium CBRN Gas Mask, too. The mask is lightweight and provides a tight seal on the face. A nose cup is also incorporated for reduced fogging of the facepiece. The material is impermeable to chemical agents such as mustard (HD), providing maximum assurance to the wearer. A butyl coated nylon hood also is available for total head protection. Regarding interoperability, the Millennium CBRN Gas Mask is designed as a system and while the thread and gasket are designed to meet the requirements of the standard, only the manufacturer's assemblies are tested and certified. The mask also permits hydration once the wearer has moved to an uncontaminated area.The CBRN version is the same as a regular Millennium mask (pictured) but with a specific CBRN certified gas filter cartridge.

Information about the new CBRN Approval standard and the MSA Millennium Gas Mask
Government and industry representatives had been working on defining standards for protective equipment to safeguard individuals against airborne terrorist attacks prior to the events of September 11, 2001. Following that day's attacks, efforts were accelerated with establishment of the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory in Pittsburgh, which took on the role of certifying new standards for CBRN respiratory protection and clothing. The new National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) CBRN standard for full-facepiece gas masks was issued on March 7, 2003. In conjunction with U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center it tests and approves devices as ""CBRN compliant"" and establishes very stringent testing and certification protocols for:

• Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear agents.
• Mask penetration and permeation.
• Carry and transportation.
• Use performance.
• Quality assurance.
The new NIOSH standards also establish:
• Performance requirements for protection against high concentrations of agents (the shortest period being 15 minutes).
• Parameters on environments and applications where masks are to be used, including warm zone environments (locations away from the highest concentrations) and crisis provisions (should terrorists deploy a secondary device as responders arrive at the scene).
• Representative degrees of agents,working on the idea that preparing for the worst potential in a family of chemicals would enable protection against the entire family of agents.
• Rules for testing service life, particulate efficiency, permeation and penetration, fit factors, field of view and interoperability.
• MSA has been an active participant and contributor to the process of determining these new standards and is considered to be a leading expert.

Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear hazards which could be used in a terrorist attack
Chemical agents include cyanide, mustard gas, ricin, sarin and VX, each of which represents multiple sources of physical distress, some leading even to death. Certain chemical agents attack the central nervous system, disabling the body's ability to control its functions and permitting muscles and organs to work themselves to death. Others attack the skin and mucous membranes on contact, causing severe blistering.

Radiological and Nuclear threats include ""dirty bombs,"" or radiological dispersal devices combining conventional explosives like dynamite with radioactive materials in the form of powder or pellets. Classic nuclear hazards are those associated with the aftermath of detonation of a nuclear device. Radiation cannot be seen, smelled, felt or tasted by humans.

Biological agents include anthrax, botulism and smallpox. These agents are bacteria or viruses endangering the life and health of organisms, specifically human beings. Some multiply within the body to release toxins into the blood, others paralyze muscles, still others are severe and contagious viral infections.

This is a perfect system for security, police,corrections, preppers, survivalists, teotwawki, military, surplus, tactical gear, Etc."

CCI Speer .40 S&W 180 Grain Gold Dot Hollow Point - 50 Rounds per Box. 

Speer's Gold Dot Hollow Point is one of the best self-defense rounds available today. A top choice of law enforcement agencies across the country, the Gold Dot uses a patented process that forms the hollow point cavity in two stages. The core is pre-fluted to define the ""fault"" lines of expansion, controlling final diameter and retained weight. The second process finishes the cavity and controls the rate of expansion. Select, clean burning propellants deliver optimum velocity while ensuring consistent chamber pressures. Non-corrosive CCI primers are used for highly sensitive and reliable performance, as well as nickel plated brass cases for smooth feeding and durability. These technical features allow Speer's engineers to fine tune each specific caliber and bullet weight for maximum field performance.

Another accessory is a BMT Moon Clip Reloader. This is a must have tool for reloading moon clips. You just drop in the rounds and give it a twist. Oh, and speaking of moon clips, I have 8 TK Custom stainless steel 6 round clips. Slide your 6 Brownells moon clip holders onto your 5:11 tactical 42in belt and go shooting. Oh, and it all comes in a Competitive Edge Dynamics Professional range bag which has a pistol sleeve and a brass bag included in it. That was a lot to list, but I want you the prospective buyer to fully understand what it is that you are bidding on, and what to expect. I built this kit up over the past 3 years, and I used the gun to shoot IDPA, USPSA, Steel League, and Bullseye. I have shot 3 IDPA matches in which I was down ZERO total points. The gun is very accurate and a pleasure to shoot. I hope that it will go to a good home. Thanks for looking! If you want any more pictures, please let me know."

For sale is a nice Mossberg 20 gauge pump with an engraved receiver, walnut stock and checkering.  It also has a vent rib and adjustable choke.  I myself like adjustable chokes at the end of the barrel for quick adjustment from fields to swamp and also acts like a pointing device for instinctive shooting.

This gun is not like the cheaper Mossbergs you find today.  VERY solid and precision action.  I am assuming this one was from the 1970's or 1980's.

The gun is used, but in nice shape.  

Also includes 2 identical barrels that have the same choke system.  The barrels do not have a vent rib.  They do have some slight speckling here and there, but nothing major.  These barrels also go for $50-100 each on Ebay so you can sell or trade and recoup your costs on the Mossberg.  Or cut one off and make a slug barrel.

Comes with a soft case also.

Face to face in Allendale as I do not want to pay for gas in case of a no show.

Cash only and you must be legal to purchase this gun.  

Thanks."

Gun is extremely accurate and includes a Sightmark 8.5-25x50 scope, unknown but nice front bipod and rubber padded sling. I personally put 16 rounds through it to test functionality. At 100 yards, it was at less than .5 MOA groups. And I'm not a marksman. Took this in a trade and don't really have a use for it. Asking $700 firm. Great rifle and a decent scope to go with it. Scope is missing the battery cover for the illuminated reticles. Will be calling sightmark tomorrow to see about a replacement. Please feel free to call me at 803-521-642five. Please no calls after 10:00pm. Thank you."

My name is Mike. I am the President of Prairie State Armory LLC located in Salisbury, IL. I started Prairie State Armory in May of this year because I wanted to offer AR-15 armorer services, FFL Transfers, and special order firearms at the best prices in the Springfield area. 

Firearms are a passion of mine, and my hope is that I will be able to share that passion with new firearm owners, as well as help others who already share my passion continue to acquire the ammo, firearms, and parts they need. I'm not a high volume dealer, so others might possibly have lower prices, but I can promise you the service you receive at Prairie State Armory will be second to none.

I've built dozens of ARs, in many different configurations and I enjoy doing so. If you have any interest in aftermarket parts, installation of those parts, or even building your own custom rifle, give me a call.

Also, if you live on the west end of Springfield, or in the Salisbury/Plains/Petersburg area, I offer competitive transfer fees of $20. However, I recommend you give me a call before you order online because the majority of the time, I can save you money if you order through me. Give me a call ahead of time, and I will send any online retailer you choose to purchase from a copy of my FFL to facilitate a quick shipment.

Anyway, I wanted to introduce myself to the Springfield, IL firearms community. If you ever need anything, do not hesitate to call. I will always give you my full attention, and I'm not afraid to tell you that I don't know everything, and if I don't have the answer to a question I will find it.

Again, don't hesitate. Call if you need anything firearms related.

Thanks,

Mike

Comes with (4) 20rd Mags, (1) 30rd Mag, Fobus Holster and 450rds of Ammo. It was new in the box when i got it but I can't let anything out of my safe without taking it to the range first (shot 100rds).   Without a doubt it's the nicest firing handgun I've had the pleasure to put thru the paces. I simply don't have a need for her so here she is for you to enjoy. For all practical purposes it is a Brand New gun...  Original Box, Papers and Test Casing included. 

I'm in KS and would be happy to sell FTF to KS residents or thru your FFL if out of state. If you legally cannot purchase or own a firearm don't bother calling me. 

Thanks for your interest,

Upgrades on the pistol: S&A flat checkered mainspring housing, new Nighthawk Custom tool steel commander hammer, new Ed Brown Hardcore slide stop, new Wilson Tactical Extended Tactical mag release, new slotted grip screws, three-hole aluminum adjustable match trigger, Meprolight Night Sights, and a Wilson beaver tail.

I don't even want to think about what I've got into this along with the refinish, but due to the fact that it is still in need of some polishing to be 100% I'm going to price it at $700. Since the refinish the mag release and slide stop are a bit stiff but otherwise it's ready to go. Shouldn't take long to polish it up and get it nice and smooth."
