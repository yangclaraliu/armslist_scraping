The storage-capable version of the flagship Magpul MOE SL™ carbine stock, the MOE SL-S (Storage) Stock is a direct replacement buttstock for AR15/M4 carbines.
The sleek profile, dual-side release latches, and waterproof battery tubes make it the slimmest storage tube stock available. The SL-S provides an enhanced cheek weld and true, O-ring sealed, 10m waterproof storage area desired by many, but fits it into the narrowest package possible to allow a more upright head position and minimize bulk. A rolled toe and angled rubber butt-pad are optimized for use with body armor, and an ambidextrous QD sling swivel socket is included. A unique leaf-spring tension system provides a solid fit on mil-spec receiver extensions, with slightly less friction than the original SL. The MOE SL-S is the most intuitive, comfortable, and efficient storage stock available.

I believe the .22 is a Harrington and Richardson and the others are Iver Johnson or Forehand & Wadsworth (most of these brands are clones of eachother and some parts are probably interchangeable). A variety of spare and extra parts are also included. None of these are fully functional right now. Both the .32s are missing 99% of their finish (originally nickel plated). The .22 has most of the finish on the barrel and cylinder but patchy finish on the rest of it. Various wear to various parts.  One of the .32s does lock up and appears to function in double-action if you push the trigger forward, but the hammer doesn't cock in single action. At a minimum it seems like the trigger return spring is bad, maybe the hammer spring or internals are out of alignment preventing the hammer from cocking into single-action. The other .32 has more issues including a missing extractor. Not sure what else it needs, but the internals are also having issues. I don't remember what the .22 revolver needs, but it should be repairable. I will throw in an assortment of small parts that might fit these or similar guns, including some extra grips, hammers, triggers, springs, and ""stuff"". I haven't checked to see what parts go with what. Since these are probably over 100 years old, I'm selling them ""as is"" with no guarantees. If you're not a trained gunsmith I would suggest having them inspected by a gunsmith before shooting them. They would also be cool display pieces if you decided not to shoot them and just clean them up.Will need to see PTP / PTC"

The Kel-Tec RFB has absolutely the best trigger pull that I have ever felt on a bullpup rifle. The release is crisp, and while measuring right at six pounds on my trigger pull gauge, it felt lighter and was easy to use, making target work very enjoyable.The Kel-Tec RFB is a handy, reliable, and accurate bullpup rifle that packs the full power of the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge. It can fire any 7.62x51 or .308 Winchester ammunition reliably. The design is innovative, yet simple enough to work dependably. As of this writing, the retail price is $1500 US, and they are bringing that much, as demand is still outrunning the supply. However, it is a fine carbine, and there is nothing else like it on the market. It is a quality design, built with quality materials, and built in the USA. I like it."

I will trade it for ONLY a newer Smith and Wesson M&P 10 that is in perfect/near perfect condition and has had less than 200 rounds fired through it. Only reason why the M&P 10 is because it will be lighter for me to take hunting climbing huge hills and what not. As far as selling goes... I bought it in December of 2016 and have only put 6 boxes (120 rounds) through it. It’s in SUPERB condition. I’m selling it because I would like a lighter rifle to hunt with. This gun weighs around 9.5 lbs without the scope and mount, and 12 lbs with it. The scope is a Hawke Endurance SF (.308 Specific) 6-18x50 and has a really nice illuminated BDC reticle. The sunshade and front and back flip covers are from Hawke as well. It’s a REALLY nice scope. You’ll see for yourself how clear it is on all magnifications. The scope mount is a Burris PEPR mount. It has a VG6 Precision Gamma muzzle brake on it and it’s awesome! Completely kills most of the recoil. Also comes with a black Mission First Tactical buttstock, and the regular black base buttstock it came with. Comes with everything in the picture except for the ammo. I would like $1,400 for all of it and I’ll take $1,000 for just the gun, gun case, and buttstocks. My number is REDACTED. Thanks for looking."

I took it out of the box, oiled it, worked the action a few times and decided I just can't make a right hand gun work for me, which is a shame because it's a nice rifle. Super slick 60 degree throw, nice trigger, stock is far stiffer than the Ruger Americans I have used. I am also including winchester mounts and medium height rings. I went ahead and filed the rebate. So I'll sell it for $340, and you get the mounts for free, don't have to fool with a rebate, or shipping, or ffl transfer. That's $30 less than what I have in the gun after rebate, and I feel it is very fair. Please don't try and beat me down on price or offer a trade. I can do a face to face trade in Tyler."
