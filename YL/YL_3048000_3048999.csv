I am selling my Springfied A1 Series 1911. It's a 5"" barrel, double stack .45 ACP (holds 14+1), and comes with three mags (2 X's 10 rd Mecgar Mags,1 14 rd Mecgar mag). Any para ordnance p14 mag will work like a dream in this doublestack system. This is definitely the best affordable option for a doublestack 1911 aside from Para themselves."

This is a Great old piece that has the old west look to it. Its got some interesting features that i really haven't found this combination any where else. Its a carbine with a 5 shot load tube. It doesn't have a saddle ring and no spot to hold one. It also is a .25-20 caliber which is not the best size but does make it more rare. It was my Great aunt's hunting rifle and has been in the family the whole time as far as i know. I am the only one who had shot it in the last 50 years so i had it cleaned and checked out its in good shape i put a few round through it my self today (5-10-14). Its really hard to judge the value on this they go any where from a grand to 3600 for near the same year on line.
I figure i will start at 800 and at the price iw ill throw in a near full box of Western ammo and a full box of Remington as well

The gun is brand new, unfired and I am the one and only original owner.  As you would expect from a brand new firearm, it is in perfect shape with no marks, scratches or wear of any kind.  The decocker lever has never been used so there are no marks on the frame.  There are some scrapes on the barrel hood from the slide being racked several times, but that kind of wear is obviously unavoidable.  Other than that, there are no blemishes whatsoever anywhere on this pistol.  You are truly buying a brand new Sig so there really isn't much else to say about the gun, but if you have any other questions feel free to ask.

Everything the gun came with when I brought it home from my LGS is included in the sale.  The Sig P220 itself, two 8-round Sig mags, plastic carrying case, owner's manual, gun lock, tiny allen wrenches for adjusting the rear sight, small tube of unopened factory Sig lube, and even the plastic bag and paper tags that were on the gun from the factory.  Like I said before, this is a factory new handgun.

Price is $1,100 cash and I am not interested in any trades.  Buyer must be 21 years old, have a valid Ohio driver's license and be able to legally own a handgun in the state of Ohio.  CHL holders are preferred but not required.  I am in Canal Fulton 44614.  I have additional pictures of the gun uploaded to Photobucket, just ask for the link in your email.

I also have a brand new Sig P220 Extreme (essentially an Elite Dark with fixed night sights , standard (unthreaded) barrel and gray G10 grips) and a brand new Glock 21 Gen 4 listed here on Armslist as well.  I would be willing to negotiate a little bit on a package deal if someone wanted to buy two or all three guns at the same time.  Check my other listings for the details on those.

""The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 AUTO offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands."""

The Extreme is essentially an Elite Dark model with fixed night sights and gray Hogue G10 grips. The gun is brand new, unfired and I am the one and only original owner. As you would expect from a brand new firearm, it is in perfect shape with no marks, scratches or wear of any kind. The decocker lever has never been used so there are no marks on the frame. There are some very light scrapes on the barrel hood from the slide being racked several times, but that kind of wear is obviously unavoidable. Other than that, there are no blemishes whatsoever anywhere on this pistol. You are truly buying a brand new Sig.

Everything the gun came with when I brought it home from my LGS is included in the sale. The Sig P220 Extreme itself, two 8-round Sig mags, plastic carrying case, owner's manual, gun lock, small tube of unopened factory Sig lube, and even the plastic bag and paper tags that were on the gun from the factory. Like I said before, this is a factory new handgun.  There really isn't much else to say about the Sig, but if you have any other questions feel free to ask.

Price is $1,000 cash and I am not interested in any trades. Buyer must be 21 years old, have a valid Ohio driver's license and be able to legally own a handgun in the state of Ohio.

Size matters in a concealed carry pistol. Reduced dimensions and light weight are as important as magazine capacity and power. Kimber Ultra Carry pistols have it all, and put it together in a 1911 package that simply outperforms any other type of semi-automatic. A hallmark of Kimber quality, the Ultra Carry combines the tremendous advantages of the 1911 platform with the power of the .45 ACP cartridge.
Machined bevels at both front and rear of the Ultra Carry ejection port ensure ejecting brass reliably clears, avoiding the jams common to other brands."

Both fantastic weapons in terms of accuracy and comfort to shoot, I can't think of a .380 option I'd prefer to the Sig Sauer P238, but we're getting out of that caliber entirely, so here's the package:

P238 Rosewood, Ambi-Safety with 6 round flush fit magazine, bright night sights, sig holster, cable lock, lockable hard case, manual, etc. Between 200-250 rounds through this gun (MSRP $752)
P238 Equinox, Left-Side Safety Only, with 6 round flush fit magazine, bright night sights (front TFO sight), sig holster, cable lock, lockable hard case, manual, etc. Between 200-250 rounds through this gun (MSRP $752)
Currently installed Hogue Rubber Grips ($24.99) with original wood grips included in the box.

Also included with the two weapons are the following:
329 FMJ (200 WWB, 100 American Eagle, 29 Federal) (Approx $115)
57 Hornady Critical Defense (Approx $40)
25 Hornady Hollow Point (Approx $18)

BlackHawk Pocket Holster ($14.95)
Hard formed leather IWB holster (forget the maker, sorry)
5 7 Round Extended Magazines ($46 x 5 = $230)

Total purchase price on everything was around $2k, looking for $1400 OBRO for everything to get you set up to both shoot and carry these weapons. Both were carefully cleaned and oiled after each range trip (by me, still can't get the wife to help with that part), if desired I can switch the grips on the Equinox to the stock wood grips for you, but I really liked the finger groove it provided me.

Face to face only, bill of sale required, can meet most places in the Hampton Roads area and will drive some for the right deal. Require two forms of ID one of which must be Virginia resident ID or Military ID with orders to establish Virginia residency.

Willing to split this into two individual sales of the pistols if I get an offer on one or the other that I consider reasonable (along with whatever part the remaining package is desired).

Only trade I'm really looking for would be a Sig 938 preferably with at least one 7 round magazine with it."

Features a 5 ½” barrel with brass blade front sight, blackened back strap and unfinished brass trigger guard, and an uncut-for-shoulder stock steel frame. Frame is stamped CD, indicating 2009 year of manufacture. This gun was only shot a few times and was well cared for – not a mark on the barrel wedge, good action and timing, good barrel/cylinder gap, and the nipples remove easily from the cylinder. A real nice gun for the woods given its short barrel length, or for making smoke at the local range. I’ve got more pieces now than I can shoot during the year and this one doesn’t fit into the collection so it’s up for grabs. Price is $200 shipped to your location. No trades, and please don’t ask me if I’ll take one hundred dollars for it. While this type of arm can be sent to almost Anywhere USA, there are a few urban locations that are prohibited so if Cabela’s or any other major chain can’t ship you a black powder arm, neither can I.

I purchased a third 7 round flush mag (comes with 2 from factory) and a new Comp-Tac Flatline IWB/OWB holster (currently configured as OWB). I've also got a Comp-Tac MTAC shell for it if you've got the MTAC holster body. 

It carries great, shoots great, is accurate when I do my part, and has been 100% reliable in the 300 or so rounds I've put through it. It's been great for me, but I've got my eyes on filling a different role.

Comes with all factory packaging and accessories - holster, mag carrier, case, etc. - plus the aforementioned extra 7 round mag (total of 3) and Comp-Tac holster. Cleaned and ready for its new owner. Ammo (FMJ and defensive) available to swap for ammo if changing calibers. 

Cash price $550 for package. The holster is $75 new, mags run about $30, so the value is strong.

Trade interests are pretty varied. Similar condition XD-S 45 (though I'd keep the holster stuff to use with the new gun!), M&P 9 or 40 models without internal locks, mag disconnects, or thumb safeties, Sig P250 compacts or subcompacts (think there's a second generation?), Springfield XD or XD(M) compact or subcompact models, CZ P07 (decocker model), Sig SP2022, Glock 17,19,22,23,26,27 Gen 4, FNH FNS 9 or 40 without thumb safety... These are the models I'd be interested in off the top of my head, may be more, just ask - WITH THE EXCEPTIONS of Taurus, Bersa, Jennings, Hi-Point, etc. NOT in any way interested in a manual safety gun. Any trades need to be similarly set up as my XD-S: all factory packaging and accessories, excellent condition, etc. Not interested in any internally modified guns AT ALL. If trading for different caliber ammo on your end for ammo from mine would be good for both of us.

BECAUSE BEAUTY AND FUNCTIONALITY AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
SIG SAUER® pistols have long provided their owners with peace of mind. Now the SIG Sauer Custom Shop Equinox series adds pride of ownership to that feeling. The distinctive polished slide flats and nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When combined with its practical features, the Equinox series is pretty to look at and beautiful to shoot.

The P238 Equinox®, it’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight.

The model 22 is a very versatile platform as it can be easily converted to a .22 or a 9mm in seconds with aftermarket barrels.   Conversely, a .22 or 9mm cannot be converted to a .40 cal.  So IMHO, this is the way to go if you like the Glock platform.

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. The unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

It has a high impact polymer receiver held up, the Carbon 15 which outclasses its new no-frills competitors who do not have a Forward Bolt Assist, the C-15 is equipped with one. This M-4 type carbine also has a 16 inch standard barrel and it comes in traditional matte military finish. This variant has a full length picatinny  forward  hand guardrail . The 16 inch barrel, and all the steel components, are manganese phosphate coated for complete protection against exterior corrosion or rust. The receivers, upper and lower, are precision molded polymer for maximum lightness and strength. The upper receiver includes an integral cartridge case deflector and a last round bolt hold open feature to alert the shooter of an empty magazine. Forward bolt assist enables the operator to continue firing under the most hostile and dirty conditions; and here the Carbon 15 stands out from its similarly priced competitors. The ribbed front handguard offers increased control and heat dissipation and is molded of mil. spec. polymer thermoset composite. Buttstock is 6 position retractable C-AR / M4 type that extends the overall length from 32 1/4 inches to 36 inches. All of these features on this variant of Bushmaster’s C15M4 series makes this not only the lightest AR-15 type rifle on the market, but the best value on the market for features offered. It comes with a  two 30 shot steel magazine. Replacement price on similarly equipped rifles, if a person can even find one, is upwards of $1000.00 apiece. I am asking $750.00 for the Carbon 15 in the photos , but will accept any reasonable offer.  $40.00 for shipping.  Must be shipped to an FFL unless purchased in Arizona face-to-face.

To sweeten the offering the Bushnell mounted on the rifle comes at no extra charge.

I am sorry but this rifle is not transferable to civilians in Aurora IL, California, Chicago / Cook County IL, Connecticut, D.C., Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction that restricts AR15 Rifles or 30 shot magazines."
