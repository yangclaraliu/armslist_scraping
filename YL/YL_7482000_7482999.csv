This drop in system allows for quick installation of a barreled action without the bedding required by normal rifle stocks. The model I am selling last had a Remington 700 in 300WM. I am including links to a separate review of this model and also to the Mcree website so you can review it yourself (Mcree no longer sells the G5, they have moved on to the G7 and G10 but the system is almost exactly the same with a few cosmetic differences).

I have all the necessary screws for mounting and guarantee that since I was the one who removed it from the action it had originally mounted. The cerakote is worn in a few places (under the hand guard where the bi pod was mounted and around the mag well from inserting and removing magazines, but other than that, the chassis is in great condition.
 
Everything worked fine with the chassis, I just received it as part of an estate and the owner wanted to put the action back into a hunting rifle configuration. The chassis sold new from the shop for about $650 and I am asking $200 less. I am willing to drop the chassis off anywhere in the Denver Metro area and I will ship it anywhere in the country.

I'm not selling to anyone I don't talk live with from the start and develop a comfort level with. Don't ask me for personal contact info. You send an email with your phone number and I will call you and we can discuss and once I figure out value we can talk again and maybe make a deal. I'm in no rush and not desperate to sell as a group for an unrealistic price so please don't ask. If they don't sell here I'll bring them to the next Greenville gun show in December.
