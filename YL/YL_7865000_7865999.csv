It has no import marks, just the usual Waffenfabrik Walther Zella Mehlis (Thür) Walther's Patent Cal 7,65 m/m Mod. PPk. Serial# is 248409K, indicating it was made at the end of 1939, right before they started being Nazi stamped. It is in great condition. Mechanically perfect, and shoots great (I put approx 100 rounds through it). Finish is at least 95%, with just some carry wear on the left side that is shown in the pictures. This was most likely carried by a German soldier/Police officer before it was brought back to the US. Has a hairline crack around the grip screw (99% of Bakelite grip equipped PPK's do).It comes with two original 7.65 Walther marked magazines, one shows wear and has clearly been used a bit, the other one is in fantastic shape and doesn't look like it's been used at all. Also comes with a wartime leather DRGM Akah stamped that was (so I've been told) brought back with the gun by the same soldier. This holster has clearly been well used, and was actually on fire at some point in Germany (Flap missing, rear of the holster shows burn marks). I'm asking $1000 for everything These usually go for well over that (Cheapest one on Gunbroker right now is $1200+, cheapest on Armslist is $700 for one with about 10% finish left and $800 for one with about 60% finish left) and that's just with one mag, and no holster (or 70% holster? lol) so I believe $1000 is MORE than fair for this gorgeous old gun, two mags, and the holster.Willing to consider all FAIR trade offers for firearms. Just please no .40's, shotguns, black powder, or bolt actions. Let me know what you have. The worst I can do is say no eh?Located in Northville, willing to drive a bit but nothing crazy.

This is the last chance to voice your opinion to them.

I have a Remington 870 Tactical 20 gauge shotgun and a VZ-2008 (VZ-58) rifle package (rifle, mags and accessories). The 870 is in excellent condition and functions great.  The VZ-2008 will need some trigger/sear repair work which will likely cost between $20 and $150 depending on who does the work. I am not interested in trading for junk AK's (rifles with canted sights, botched magwells, etc.). I am also not interested in most American made AK's. I would prefer a nice Hungarian, Romanian or Serbian AK in decent condition. Contact Rick through Armslist or at steelrider58 at bikerider dot com.  Both of my guns are separately listed on Armslist.  You can see my other shotgun and rifle listings by entering ""steelrider58"" into the search box.
