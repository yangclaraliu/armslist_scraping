Kahr is a USA based manufacturer that builds high quality weapons. This gun has had very few rounds ran through it and is in exceptional condition. It comes with 1 six round magazine and 2 seven round magazines. It makes a very good conceal carry gun. It its in a size 1 pocket holster. I carry it everywhere with nobody noticing it's presence. Here is a write up from the Kahr website explaining the gun in detail: 
The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.
The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.
Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.The MSRP price of this gun is $419.00 which includes 1 six round magazine. I am selling this gun for $325.00 which includes 3 magazines. Call or text 2one7-2four8-six2zero5."

The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.UPC:     REDACTED85Description:      WAI CCP 9MM PST 8RD B/GREY TLBrand:      Walther Arms IncModel:     CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) TALO EditionType:     Pistol: Semi-AutoCaliber:     9MMFinish:     Black Cerakote Slide, Tungsten Grey FrameAction:     Single ActionStock:     Tungsten Grey Polymer, Non-Slip Hi-Grip TextureSight:     FT: Interchangeable RR: AdjustableBarrel Length:     3.54 Overall Length:     6.5Weight:     22.33 ozCapacity:     8+1# of Mags:     2Safety:     Manual Thumb, Passive Firing Pin BlockReceiver:     Tungsten Grey Polymer, Equiptment RailFeatures:     SoftCoil Delayed Gas Blowback System;Loaded Chamber Indicator, Reversible Mag Release"

The Sparrow™ 22 was designed with simplicity, durability, and user serviceability as its core objectives. It is the shortest rimfire silencer on the market, has the quietest 10-round average of any silencer in its class, and can go 2,000 rounds between cleanings. Patented Multi-Part Containment (MPC™) technology facilitates ease of disassembly and reassembly – an essential function of .22LR suppressors. The internal MPC™ construction uses two half tubes that pull away from a monolithic core, which ensures that the Sparrow 22 will remain easy to clean after extended periods of use with notoriously dirty rimfire ammunition. The Sparrow 22 is compatible with multiple calibers up to 5.7mm and is full-auto rated for .22 long rifle.I also have Ruger Mark III & IV pistols (NIB) and can set up a package for you.  The pistol is available at point of sale, the suppressor requires the NFA waiting period.

Traditional western-style, hand-filling grip has long been acknowledged as one of the most comfortable and natural pointing of any grip style.

Patented transfer bar mechanism and loading gate interlock provide an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge.
