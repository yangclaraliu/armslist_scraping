Very nice, very accurate. Vintage. Also have some stripper clips I'll throw in for free. Also has a lot more valuable bladed folding bayonet. Hit me up.Interested in some trades.. Mostly threaded barreled pistols or other older rifles/pistols - would really love to trade for a new Beretta 21a Inox, and just about anything really. Don't want any newer bolt action hunting rifles or sporterized rifles or shotguns. This was actually a PLA army rifle at some point, it doesn't seem too used, but it's broken in. It even has the cleaning kit in the butt, but it's missing the cap. A really nice rifle some neat history, the type-56 Chinese markings on the side also put the value up a bit more.Don't trust SKS's with non-factory mags! The wooden stock has to be physically carved away to install one and it can actually cause the rifle to become much less reliable.. They are also a pain in the butt to change.. Only SKS's I've seen with reliable 30 rounders were the SKS-D that is factory-made to take AK-47 mags. And those are more rare.. The way to identify them is by the serial number. I see a lot of the modified one's on here and they're cheaper for a reason.. This is really a historical weapon, but it's also very accurate and great for a target/hunting rifle in original configuration.. I'm sure there's some type of stock you can buy to make the mods go easier without having to physically modify the wood in any way if that's the buyers intention :).."

While many sellers just tack that on to any engraved gun between 1850 and 1900, I can show quite a bit of research as proof. I viewed dozens of known Nimschke works, and certain patterns begin to emerge. His use of the 8 pointed star is prevalent, and it appears many times on this gun. The borders with punched circles fit his work, and 2 lines crossing to form geometric shapes also fits. The most telling, to me, is the flower found on the right side of the Marlin. It contains the same heavy ""doughnut"" where the stem meets the flower as in the bear engraved gun. No other engraver I have seen uses a flower in the scroll, much less with the same detail. The ""Nimschke"" signed work is also included as a photo for your inspection. The tapered extension heading toward the trigger also is one of his trademark distinctions. The Ulrich brothers came along later, and used a different style. That said, this is both one of the most engraved and best preserved Marlin revolvers I have ever seen. It is very clean everywhere, with good rifling, crisp action, and a tight hinge. The cylinder stop completely retracts when in the safety position, and it locks up nicely at full cock. The cylinder is designed for easy removal to extract empties. This 5 shooter is chambered in the .38 S&W cartridge. Every major component bears the early 3297 serial number. The JMM grips are nigh flawless. This prize cost a lot and received good care. Shipping available"

You will probably not see any of these at your local gun store or at your local gun range. As you can see in the pics this is the two tone olive green with threaded barrel, with the protector nut screwed on. Comes complete with back straps, two mags and factory case, cleaning kit and loader. The SPHINX SDP Compact Alpha is a duty-sized pistol that can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the de-cocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box. This is the closest you can get to a CUSTOM manufactured gun without the CUSTOM manufactured price. My price on this beautiful NIB gun is $950. If you are looking for a premium 9mm without breaking the bank with a custom made pistol, then you need to carefully look at this gun. I have other gun's that are either NIB or LNIB in .45 acp. 40 S&W and 9 mm for sale as well, let me know what you are looking for? I am a private gun owner, and just selling off a few, but don't have to sell any of them. “I'll run out of time before I run out of money,” so please no low ball offers, it's just a waste of time and effort. Better make your BUYS now, before congress shuts down private transfers of guns, through web sites like this."

Many considered the CZ 75 at the time of its introduction to be the greatest double-column-magazine 9mm pistol in the world. With the slide riding inside the frame, there is a very tight fit between the two, which contributes to its impressive accuracy. The high-quality carbon-steel slide has been trimmed down on the sides to give the pistol the more angular look of the original Desert Eagle. This also has the added benefit of reducing the pistol’s weight and creating a thinner profile. The effect is significantly more pronounced on the polymerframed version, which has itself been given a matching angular design. From the front, the look is almost triangular. The slide also features a matte black oxide finish, Novak-style three-dot sights and an ambidextrous decocker/ safety lever with a teardrop shape for ease of use. This allows the operator to safely lower the Commander-style hammer from the single-action to the double-action position while also engaging the hammer-block safety mechanism. The pistol also features an internal firing pin safety mechanism. The trigger itself has also been redesigned for a smoother and more comfortable pull, which has been set at 12 pounds for double action and a crisp 4 pounds in single action. If you are looking to ad a .45 acp to your gun collection and like having DA/SA with a de-cocker and a 10+1 ammo capacity, then this is the one for you. Only $525 NIB. Built like an Israeli tank with deadly accuracy. I have other gun's that are either NIB or LNIB in .45 acp. 40 S&W and 9 mm for sale as well, let me know what you are looking for?

Finally took it to the range last week and after two shots and a face full of powder, realized it wasn't going to work for me as the port is too far back for a left handed shooter, thus the face of powder. For a righty there's no concern. Absolutely love the platform, but don't like face burn! As such this rifle has had two rounds through it.
