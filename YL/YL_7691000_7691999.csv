It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/11/17 to 12/15/17 in the store and what pistols we bring with us at the C&E Gun show this weekend 12/16/17 and 12/17/18. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we canâ€™t replace or canâ€™t replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesnâ€™t have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and donâ€™t forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior. God Bless.

It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/11/17 to 12/15/17 in the store and what pistols we bring with us at the C&E Gun show this weekend 12/16/17 and 12/17/18. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we canâ€™t replace or canâ€™t replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesnâ€™t have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and donâ€™t forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior.

It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/11/17 to 12/15/17 in the store and what pistols we bring with us at the C&E Gun show this weekend 12/16/17 and 12/17/18. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we can't replace or can't replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesn't have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and don't forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior.

Do you want to shoot at them from half a mile away but can't seem to knock them down with your current rifle? Try an upgrade!This is a bit of a strange gun to track down info on.  Apparently, when Kimber was sold, they bought a bunch of Mauser actions, slapped on some barrels they produced in some synthetic stocks and started off selling these to pay the bills and get on their feet.  I've also seen information on CZ doing them as well, or helping, or something.  I haven't tried TOO hard to track down the origins but it's a slick rifle and shoots well, I just don't hunt and really only shoot for fun at 100 yards max and I can't hit a thing anyways.  I can tell you it's a Swedish Mauser action with a Kimber barrel in a black synthetic stock.  It has a basic sling and comes in a plain old black zipper padded bag for carrying or storing, and has a scope that's probably a bit too small for real long range shooting.  I do have some ammo with it, but probably not tons.  I'd guesstimate I have about 20 or so North GA Reloading M1 Garand load cartridges, 30 or so Remington Core Lokt basic cartridges, and 20 or so Winchester Silver Tip cartridges.  These are approximate counts as I have all the ammo at my parent's house in Harrison and am going on memory.  I am mostly looking for trades as I don't need a big bolt gun but will listen to cash offers.  I do have a few more pics than Armslist will let me upload, so email away."

Glock acknowledged that sentiment with the development of the Glock 21. Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the Glock 21 Gen4 delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 Auto round with 10 or 13 round magazine capacity. The modular backstrap design lets the user adapt the grip to hand size, and the frame surface exhibits the scientifically-designed Gen4 rough textured technology. This model features a dual-recoil spring assembly that substantially increases the life of the system, and the enlarged reversible magazine catch easily accommodates left- or right-handed operators. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment. The Gen4 system is the perfect complement to this iconic .45 caliber cartridge.Email:famibizz3@gmail.com TEXT: 903 354 4681"

Bush acquired a set.  One set is reportedly in a museum .  The set you see here is the fourth we are aware of.  There have been sales of the items individually since 1980 but only a few.  You can search the web for these items and the sales will appear.  The few sales were handled by major western art houses.  We have documentation from both the Colt Firearms Co. and the Buffalo Bill Historical Center.  Copies of the documentation and additional photos are available.   Please, serious inquiries only."
