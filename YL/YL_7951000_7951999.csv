The pistol is exceptionally clean and in almost new condition with no problems, but it does have two minor visual blemishes— one slight marring of the finish only which is near the front sight, and a surface scuff on top of the finish located on the side right side of the slide. Both are from the gunsmith when the sights were installed and otherwise this has been my hardly used target and nightstand gun. I've put exactly 100 rounds through this gun so far, zero problems whatsoever.Lawful VA residents buying in person or in person FFL transfers only.

Originally designed for the Swiss Army who wanted a new pistol that provided excellent reliability with a low manufacturing cost, it proved to be one of the most successful SIG pistols ever designed. The SIG Sauer P6 is a specialized variant of the P225 that was produced specifically to conform to the mid-1970s West German police requirements for their new standard pistol.
The German police began to offer surplus sales of the P6 in the early 2000s. These early purchasers of surplus P6 pistols quickly saw why the P6 was so popular, with the reliability and accuracy of the P6 rivaling any modern pistol.
This pistol features the extremely rare ""Made in W. Germany"" marked slide, indicating that it was produced before reunification of East and West Germany was complete.  The pistol has all of the expected P6 markings to include ""P6"" on the slide, the month and year of manufacture, and the proof markings from the German authorities. Included are 4 original SIG Sauer P6 marked 8-round magazines.  The pistol is also equipped with Siglite Night Sights."
