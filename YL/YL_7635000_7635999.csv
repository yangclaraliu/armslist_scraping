I think there has been less than 500 rounds of .40 shot through the 23 barrel, and about 1500 rounds of 9mm shot through the conversion barrel. The conversion fires great, I leave the 19 recoil spring in to shoot .40 and 9mm and just swap barrels as needed. Great condition, i'm just looking for a straight 9mm as I don't fire .40 for anything other than pleasure so it is not very functional for my shooting lifestyle."

The other is listed here also. This carbine is  Mosin M38. This is the first style carbine the Russians made, like most of the Carbines the Russians made during WWII they cut down a 91/30s because they had lots of them and wanted a smaller rifle. M38 didn't have bayonets like the later M44 so these are a little harder to find. This rifle doesn't have import markins so it made it to the USA between 1940s-1960s I like to think it was a soldier bring back but I can't be sure. The rifle shoots great and has spent most of the time I have had it in the safe. The only thing I know wrong is the cleaning rod is missing but I never use the rods that come with the rifles so it wasn't a issue for me. They can be bought online pretty cheap is someone wanted to replace it. I always cleaned it my Mosins 3 times(over 3 days) after shooting just in case of poor ammo. My price is based on the condition of the rilfe,the rareity of the M38 compared to the other carbines and no import markings. This isn't one of the cheap Type 53 chineese rifles that are beat up."

I have the other carbine listed in another post.This Mosin Carbine is a M44. The first M44 carbines made, like most of the Carbines the Russians made during WWII they cut down a 91/30s because they had lots of them and wanted a smaller rifle. After the war they allowed some soviet contries to make new M44 based on the same rifle. The M44 has a swing out bayonet to help keep it from getting lost. This rifle has a Simons Shotgun long eye relief scope(3x9 I think), sling (not in photo), Matching serial number on Bolt, Mag plate, Reciever and Butt Plate, and Stock is a WWII stock because it doesn't have the metal inserts on the rear sling holes and small ones on the front. My price is based on the condition of the rilfe, and the rareity of the M44 compared to the other carbines. This isn't one of the cheap Type 53 chineese rifles that are beat up. It isn't often to find Russian rifles with matching Serial numbers. Rifle shoots great and holds groups very well. I always cleaned it my Mosins 3 times(over 3 days) after shooting just in case of poor ammo. The price is based on the condition of the rifle, scope, and rarity."

Its an Anderson lower listed as ""multi-cal"" (standard ar-15 mags, .223, 5.56). The upper is a rock river with a S&W barrel (I wanted S&W's m4 feed ramps) and a Midwest industries M-Lock free-float tube with a midwest low profile gas block. I put this on myself (tourqued to 38 lbs in an ar-vice from midwest). I know having this done at home rather than a gun-smith bothers some so full disclosure upfront. If the after market gas-block bothers you I can throw in an A2 front sight/gas assembly for free. Troy Medieval front muzzel brake (recently put on and not tourqued as I wasnt sure how I liked it, I can throw in the A2 bird cage if you really want it for no charge). Also comes with mag-pul flip up sights, a magpul forgrip, and a Nikon Buckmaster 3X9 in a weaver single piece. The gun cycles without issue ( I have run low gas pmc up to the hotter m855 and Xm193 factory stuff) and I would guess arround 100 rounds so far. Its been a decent gun but I just don't shoot it anymore. I'm not really looking to trade, but if you have a sig p320 in 9mm, an ar-10 lower reciever from a good manufaturer, or a semi-auto shotgun by mossberge I would certanly entertain an offer.I also might consider a revolver if its not a taurus. Thank for the interest.

Perfect for a myriad of different uses from hunting, to personal defense, to competition or just plain fun, the 300 Blackout offers shooters 30 caliber firepower in a standard AR-sized envelope. The M4 LE features a Forged 7075-T6 Aluminum A3 Flat-Top Receiver that is ideal for adding an optic and/or rear iron sight, and comes equipped with a 16"" Medium Contour Barrel with a 1 in 7"" twist for easy stabilization of heavy match projectiles. The upper comes complete with an A2 front sight gas block, A2 flash hider, bolt carrier group, charging handle and M4-style polymer handguards. Magazine not included. The Chrome Moly Steel Barrel is finished inside and out with CMMG's durable salt bath nitride finish. This process surface-hardens the metal, extending barrel service life by reducing friction in the bore and lessening bore surface wear. This treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, making for easier cleaning and maintenance. Nitriding converts the steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. This 16"" 300 AAC Blackout Upper utilizes the versatile Carbine Length Gas System, a good choice for this cartridge if various weights and types of ammunition are to be used. Most Subsonic and Supersonic loads, fired from either a Suppressed or Unsuppressed gun, are compatible with this configuration. However, some subsonic ammunition may not always cycle reliably under adverse conditions or in a severely fouled firearm without a sound suppressor attached to provide extra backpressure. Technical Information · Upper Receiver: A3 Flat-Top· Barrel Length: 16""· Barrel Contour: Medium· Barrel Material: 4140 Chrome Moly Steel· Muzzle Thread Pattern: 5/8""-24· Chrome Lined: No· Barrel Finish: Salt Bath Nitride· Twist Rate: 1 in 7""· Chamber: 300 AAC Blackout· M4 Feed Ramps: Yes· Muzzle Device: A2 Flash Hider· Gas System Length: Carbine· Gas Block Diameter: 0.750""· Handguard: Polymer M4-Style· Sights: A2 front sight, no rear sight· Bolt Carrier Assembly Included: Yes· Bolt Carrier Type: Mil-Spec· Suitable for use with Subsonic or Supersonic loads, either Suppressed or Unsuppressed· Compatible with all standard AR-15 magazines (including Pmags), No Magazine IncludedNOTE: All CMMG uppers are test fired at their facility before shipment to the end user. Magpul MOE SL Handguard:The MOE SL Hand Guard for AR15/M4 firearms with carbine-length gas system and A2 font sight* provides modular flexibility with M-LOK® accessory slots in a lightweight, sleek, cost effective design.Designed with versatility in mind, M-LOK slots at the two, six, and ten o'clock positions allow the attachment of optional Picatinny rail sections and other direct-attach M-LOK accessories for the mounting of tactical lights, slings, grips, etc. Reinforced, heat-resistant polymer construction provides operational durability without the weight and expense of an aluminum rail hand guard.

800,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7635800,For Sale:  Blackbird SK-5 with Hedgehog Leatherworks Sheath,"Pratt, Wichita, Kansas",$ 200,"Listed On: Monday, January 8, 2018",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a ""used"" Blackbird SK-5, but the blade was warranty replaced by Ontario Knife Company last year. It has the original Micarta handle scales that you can't get anymore, Ontario switched to G10 Scales on this knife a couple years ago. The Micarta scales show a little scuffing/darkening from the sheath and light use, but are in perfect condition otherwise. The blade is unused/untouched since the warranty replacement and still has the factory edge. Also included is the original box, original tan sheath, and the warranty repair paperwork. Below are the knife specs. The Hedgehog Leatherworks sheath is the original version of the basic model. It has a little scuffing on the leather from use, but that's very minor. It also has some minor scuffing on the snaps. The sheath functions perfectly and I have had no issues with it. Hedgehog Leatherworks is owned and operated by Paul Sheiter, he designed the Blackbird SK-5 and makes the best sheath available for this knife, in my opinion. Below are the sheath specs. Ontario Blackbird SK-5:The award winning Black Bird series was designed by custom designer and sheath-maker Paul Sheiter for maximum performance with an elegant simplicity and the signature elements of a center point blade, straight back profile and a flat heel for maximum utility. Featuring high quality 154 CM stainless steel and tan Micarta handle, the Black Bird variants come in either a silver finish or with a special operations capable (SOC) powder coating for added durability. All Black Bird models include a MOLLE compatible sheath.

Just let us know what happened and we will make it right. The only way to void your warranty is to intentionally abuse the product or modify it. Otherwise, we stand behind it no matter what. We are known for our obsessive commitment to quality... so if we are fortunate enough to earn your business, you can bet we will work to keep it. Handed Crafted in the USAWe are a small team of craftsmen who feel a true sense of purpose in keeping ""USA Handmade"" alive. We never rush a product and we obsess about the smallest details. If we mess up along the way, we start over and keep working until it is perfect. Sometimes that can be painful, but we believe that ""good enough is never good enough"" and that's why we only ship our best work. Premium American LeatherOur leather is USA vegetable tanned steer hide that is simply the best money can buy. We have a face-to-face relationship with our supplier, Hermann Oak Leather, who is based right here in our home town of St. Louis, Missouri. All the major parts of our sheaths are built with 11 ounce thick leather, which is difficult to work with in parts of the crafting process, but we love its iron-like durability. By the time we dye, tool, burnish and condition our leather it looks like a tank and will last like one too. Rugged Surface TextureOur leather is tooled with a rugged texture that is helpful for reducing glare and blending with a natural environment. If you need even more concealment, just rub on some dirt or charcoal before your mission. Wear your sheath with confidence and don't be afraid to scratch it up. The more adventures it has, the better it looks... and the more stories it will tell. Water Repellent FinishBefore leaving our workshop, every sheath is treated with our ""Hedgehog Sheath Conditioner"". This bees wax based, water repellent coating ensures your leather is ready for the elements the moment you take it out of the box. Superb FitWhen we build your sheath, we cut and form the parts around one of the actual knives we have in our workshop. That means it fits perfectly and will not be rattling around each time you take a step. If anything, we make them just a little tight because they all have a slight break-in period, just like a pair of hiking boots. Hedgehog sheaths are not generic, meaning that they are intended only for the knife we advertise them to be compatible with. For example, our sheath for the TOPS Fieldcraft Knife will not fit an Ontario Blackbird Knife and vice versa... even though different sheath models can look very similar in pictures. Double Row StitchingEvery Hedgehog sheath has a double row of high-strength stitching that pierces the three layers of leather that surround the knife. We use a double row for redundancy and because it creates a very rigid and secured welt in the area where the sharpened edge of the knife rests. This is essential in forming the sheath perfectly and eliminating movement when the knife is secured inside. Traditional Belt CarryOne way to wear this sheath is in a traditional vertical configuration hanging from the belt. Tie-Down HolesThis sheath also features four tie-down holes that are reinforced with metal grommets... that way you can improvise attachment positions for your specific needs. Our favorite way to carry this sheath is over the shoulder with a length of parachute cord strung through the lashing holes. This method excels in cold weather as it can be worn on top of a heavy coat. That means your knife is in easy reach and you keep your warmth inside the coat where it belongs, because you aren't lifting it to gain access to the sheath on your belt. AmbidextrousThis design is ambidextrous, meaning that it works equally well if you are right handed or left handed."
