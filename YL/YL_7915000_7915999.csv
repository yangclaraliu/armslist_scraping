KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstandingreturn-to-zero when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15 rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 LW is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16 Lightweight profile barrel, making it almost 5 ounces lighter than the standard V11. This rifle also includes the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION  LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

It's designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications. The long, 15 DDM4 quad rail over a 16 cold hammer forged Light Weight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.

The DDM4v9 S2W is equipped with a heavy 18 S2W profile Cold Hammer Forged barrel, covered by the DDM4 Rail 15.0, gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing overtravel when swinging between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION  LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

Born of necessity, raised in the Army's Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available.The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible. This, along with being salt bath nitride finished, equates to unprecedented accuracy and durability. The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM. The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated. The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation. The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0 quad rail for allowing your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor.The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements. We equipped it with the Geissele SSA 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target. We also furnished the MK12 with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION  LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

The long, 15 DDM4 quad rail over a 16 cold hammer forged Lightweight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The V9 Lightweight is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip and is finished with Daniel Defense Tornado Cerakote.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION   LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

I have not tried any other weights of ammo in these rifles. Both rifles are in decent shape and have webbing painted stocks. The 30-06 is a little more used than the 338. Probbaly 200 rounds through the 30-06 and maybe 80 down the 338 win. They are sighted in ready to hunt. I'd like to sell them together but will entertain seperating them. If you don't want the scopes/rings that is fine we can drop the price a little and I will keep them. No ammo or anything included. What you see pictured is what you get. The darker stock rifle is the 30-06. Not really looking to trade but if you have a stainless 300wsm or 30-06 I would be interested. $700 for both.
