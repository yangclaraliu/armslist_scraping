I do not have a jig, never needed one just cut off at shoulder. A bunch of 300 blk brass, id say around 150. Upper has a thread protector, no muzzle device. Barrel twist is 1-8. I am asking 450 firm for this whole setup, you are getting a deal for sure, as ammo isnt cheap unless you reload, and theres alot that goes along with it. Dies are 50 bucks, cut off saw was 30 trimmer was 40 all together, brass is 20 per 100, afg is 30 bucks,  and ill throw in the ammo can you see in the pic. For a upper like this your lookin at at least 350 new, so i figure 300 used is fair, and 150 for all the other stuff included is more then fair. Im located in goshen. I do not have a lower to go with this as the lower has been used on another upper."

This kit will set the trigger break point farther forward than the factory trigger assembly as well as, significantly reduce the uptake and over travel. It produces a trigger pull very similar to that of a 1911 but in a polymer frame striker-fired pistol. The Polymer Forward Set Sear & Trigger Kit boasts a smooth trigger pull throughout the break.

The kit comes with two (2) trigger return springs; one designed to produce approximately a 4.0 lbs trigger pull (silver spring), and one to produce a 5.0 lbs trigger pull (green spring). These two options give the end user the ability to customize their trigger pull for their specific needs. Expected Results – Reduced trigger pre-travel and over travel to produce a feel similar to a single action fire control system – Overall reduction in trigger travel is approximately 50% – A smooth trigger pull all the way through to the break – Reduced reset – Center mounted pivoting safety maintains factory safety values – 4.0 lbs (silver spring) or 5.0 lbs (green spring) trigger pull weight, depending on which trigger return spring is installed Applicable To What Gun(s) Works with all Smith & Wesson M&P Pistols (excluding M&P M2.0) in all centerfire calibers and configurations.

Very fun gun to shoot, and works flawlessly. The gun itself does have some slight wear on the slide as well as some marks on the lower. But all in all is in very good shape. These guns sell for around 700$ at stores when they pop up, I’m just interested in seeing what people have to offer for it. It is a unique peice of history, and if you’re into Cold War era guns this is definitely a conversation starter. Since I’ve owned it I’ve put around 200 rounds through it. Looking for trades mostly, only handguns. Just send me offers I like glocks, sigs, 1911s and I like 10mm, .357 sig, and .40 but don’t mind .45 or 9mm, either way the worse I can say is no. Thank you for your interest."

First, I have many hi-res photos in bright light so they accentuate any tiny mark. A darker photo would look unbelievable but this is the best way as you will be happier in person. These first few photos are just a start as I have 25 more to send from every angle and side. As you can see, this is a beauty.  The classic takedown rifle that is sleek and slim and lightweight. My 30 Rem which sold was used to take 1 deer almost every year from the early Depression years until WW2. This one was used much less by the same owner as he had less access to ammo for this one. You may see a fine and small crack on the left side of the buttstock right where it meets the receiver. That has been there unchanged since the 50s at least according to the owner and possibly longer, but thats when it was noticed. Has not changed in all those years. It is hard to see but the last photo is a clear center shot. The bluing is deep and dark all along the barrel and the receiver. The receiver has just the lightest scratches around the takedown screw. If you look at the internal parts and the magazine tube, there is little bluing wear so this rifle may be almost 95 years old but it was not carried or used much. The bore was just cleaned with a patch and looks awesome with sharp rifling. I imagine that a proper cleaning would reveal a near mint bore. The forearm pump has no cracks or wear and it has one screw though it is press fit tight and has the other screw. Original screws are $14 a pair on Ebay right now. The rifle was disassembled, including the magazine spring and it was thoroughly cleaned and properly lubed so it is ready to go. The inside of the tube gleams and most have a century of crud. Nice trigger too. Barrel date code of OR means July of 1924. The bottom of the buttstock has a small hole where there was a decorative plug that fell out. Not sure why but its a shallow 1/8"" hole and I have the white and black plug. SHIPPING-- Rifle will ship in its 2 parts for a shorter box and is $32 to the 48 states. Paypal is fine but must use the method that has no fees. Any type of money order is fine.  Ask and I will send the full set of photos and you will see that this is one of the finest original Model 14s anywhere. IT IS 32REM BUT THEY DO NOT LIST THAT SO IT SAYS 32 WIN SPL WHICH USES THE SAME LOAD DATA"

One family owned since new,Built in 1943  this rifle has been pampered and it shows. 95 percent Original lustrous Blued finish intact. Beautiful Wood on this rifle with original finish with one small hairline crack by Tang but not threatening structural integrity. Introduced in 1933, the Model 63 was the first semiauto rifle offered by Winchester chambered for the standard .22 Long Rifle cartridge. It had the square receiver that was a trademark of all early Winchester semiautomatic rifles.
A 10-round, tubular magazine located in the buttstock was loaded by rotating the magazine end cap–located in a cutout in the buttplate–and withdrawing the inner magazine tube until it stopped. Rounds were then inserted nose-first into the magazine through a teardrop-shaped opening in the right side of the buttstock. Pushing the inner tube back into the buttstock compressed a spring-loaded follower, applied pressure to the cartridges, and fed them into the receiver where the bolt picked them up. Another feature common to the earlier Winchester semiauto rifles was that to chamber a round, one pressed on the knurled end of a rod–called the operating sleeve–that extended from the front of the forearm; this retracted the bolt to charge the rifle or extract an unfired cartridge. Pressing in the operating sleeve and rotating it 90 degrees locked the bolt in the open position, Unscrewing a knurled bolt at the rear of the receiver allowed the butt/trigger unit assembly to be separated from the barrel/forearm assembly. This made it easier to clean and allowed the rifle to be taken down into a shorter package for ease of storage.MN Buyer must Have MN state ID and complete form 4473.Out of MN buyer pays $40 shipping to local FFL."
