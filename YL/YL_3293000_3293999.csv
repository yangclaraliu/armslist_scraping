The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system. It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator."

 competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count. Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 available in a nickel finish. This model has the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and is chambered in 9mm. DA/SA triggers, Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in most subcompacts.
 New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
 The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns.
 The Nickel model sports a black hard coat anodize frame as a contrast to the nickel slide and controls. Custom Hogue® G-10 grips and SIGLITE Night Sights round out this package. !!!

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Here's a very nice pistol for the person who likes a little bit of ""bling"". This is a Taurus PT92 AFS 9mm semi-automatic that features a polished stainless steel slide & polished alloy frame that are accented by gold plated small parts (trigger, hammer, safety/decocker, grip screws, etc). The glitzy look is finished off with a set of imitation pearl grips. 

Condition of the gun is excellent, like new. This version has the Ambidextrous Safety/decocker, the Accessory Rail and the Security key-lock system.  I’ve shot approximately 50 rounds through this gun, and cleaned it after, so you would be hard pressed to tell the difference between my gun and a brand new one.  Now that is a discontinued model I have it displayed in a custom made glass case.  Asking $800obo.  This is for the gun, 2 clips, the Taurus manual, the key that locks/unlocks the security feature and a hard case with foam inside.  If you want the display case, it is a custom made job and high quality, but since it was made for this gun I do not have any use for it and would be willing to sell it cheap.  

The sale can be in person or I can ship it to another state, but only to an authorized dealer with an FFL license as the law dictates.  Contact me regarding what it would cost to ship."

SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable
operation and function.

Only had 60 rounds through it, It has a milled receiver The Arsenal SAM7 utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, the underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it."

It has never been fired and it is still in the box that it came in when I purchased it. I simply have no use for it at this point and need the cash. 

The Remington 870 Express 12 gauge shotgun fires both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells interchangeably and it has a capacity of five rounds.

Also included are a modified choke (in the barrel) and a choke key as well as a trigger lock for storage.   It also comes with a shot restricter which I am told is necessary for bird hunting (you can't have more than 3 shells in the gun when hunting birds).

This shotgun, brand new, costs $374 (including tax) at Boise Gun Company.  Will sell for $300 - CASH ONLY please. Please call my Boise home phone number of 384-0306."

 Harmonic barrel tuner that allows you to ""tune"" the barrel to your selected ammo. Check out vids on youtube.com and see just how accurate these guns are when dialed in. Its fun and easy. Once tuned, this gun is very accurate.  I'm barely an average shooter and I once dialed it in and got three in a row that could be covered easily with one of those target stickers about the size of a nickel. A good shooter would be incredible with this gun. Especially if you had a really nice scope to put on it. 

 Has LOP adjustable buttplates and Bushness XLT Trophy 3x9-40 scope. Does the job. Isn't a Leupold, but was $149.99.

 Have boxes and everything for the rifle and the scope including Ruger stainless rings. This gun has been fired right around 140 times if memory serves correct. 1/8 twist chrome-lined barrel. The gun as stated in the instructions and on the gun only shoots .223 ammo. I've read about people using NATO, but Ruger doesn't recommend it. This is a very nice gun and gets compliments from everyone who has seen it.

 Text is best at (515) 6six4-59seven8. Thanks.

I'd consider taking a revolver as trade if trading down or a couple handguns as trade."
