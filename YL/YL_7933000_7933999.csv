There is one model of Universal M1 Carbines which MUST use this particular stock style because of a wider/rectangular base surrounding the trigger group/lower receiver.  Because of that gap, this stock set will fit a USGI M1 Carbine, but a USGI M1 Carbine stock will not fit that certain model of Universal M1 Carbine.  I posted a picture of the two different style stocks. (Note: The stock in the last picture is not the one listed.) Overall, it is in great condition.  It includes the butt plate, receiver hold down, front barrel band spring, and heat shield as well.  If you have any questions, need clarification, or wants more pics, contact me through email.

Gun is in excellent condition, i cant see anything wrong on it at all.

Also to come with it is a brand new eagle grips custom grip that i bought for it, have a set of pachmeyer grips for it as well. Has a burris 2x scope with bases and rings and a wolf spring kit, i never installed the spring kit. I have some ammo but its reloads so if the buyer wants it thats up to them. Also have a shoulder holster for it as well Really wanted to get into deer hunting with it but duck hunting has gotten me. Im located in thorndale and would like to meet someplace local if at all possible, i will split the transfer fee with the buyer. $650 is what id like to get out of it. Not really open to trades unless itd be a waterfowl semi. Heres some pictures if you want more specific pictures let me know thanks"

Both tires hold air and have plenty of tread. One tire has some cracking in the side wall and there is some light surface rust, mainly around the fenders. Just used this to haul a boat 2hrs down the interstate, great trailer. Will consider trades for a pistol, AR-15, and man tools like a mig welder. I can add cash for an even trade.

M9A3: Evolution of the Tactical-Pistol Concept With the M9A3 semiauto pistol, Beretta has created a coming-together of all the tactical and functional features that today’s combat professionals may require. From Vertec-style thin grip to universal slide design convertible from safety-decocker to decocker-only, from a beveled magazine well to oversize mag-release button, from a 3-slot built-in Picatinny rail to high-capacity capability for maximum firepower, the M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law-enforcement and VIP-protection professionals demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition.  Vertec-Style Thin Grip for Instinctive Pointability The Vertec-style vertical grip of the M9A3 offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent.  Versatility and easy Accessorization One of the most salient benefits of the M9A3 is its universal slide, which is easily convertible from FS to G mode. This means that the M9A3s safety lever can be used in a safety-decocker mode or it can be converted to perform a decocker-only function for those who prefer this configuration. More versatility is also offered in the form of a removable front sight, for tactical shooters who have a distinct preference in terms of sight picture, material or construction. In addition, a variety of accessorization options is possible thanks to the built-in 3-slot Picatinny rail located in front of the trigger guard, which enables the easy attachment of a variety of tactical lights, laser devices and more.  Easy to Use and Maintain The M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds (10-round standard), and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over."

The VP Series is Heckler & Koch's first striker-fired HK since the P7 series pistols introduced in the 1980s. It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels. It also has molded finger grooves for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model comes with 3-Dot sights, and includes two (2), 15-round magazines.
