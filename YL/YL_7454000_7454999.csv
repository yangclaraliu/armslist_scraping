The L2/6 backer plate allows the shooter to adjust the angle and orientation of the three L2s to his or her liking.

I'm not sure if any of you remember the issues that Inforce had with its first two generations of pistol light...but they fixed the crap out of it with the gen 3 version! This particular light is one month old and is in like new condition, but does have a slight screw driver mark on the screw, but is NOT stripped.Here's what this light has to offer...- Metal rail mounting system (used to be cheap plastic)- A screw to tighten the light to the rail (used to be a throw lever that would open up with recoil and cause the light to fall off...but not with the screw system)- Super high-end plastic (Inforce now uses the same plastic as Glock with this gen 3 light, unlike the two previous generations)- The part the lens screws on to is now metal re-inforced with this gen 3 model (used to be plastic on plastic and would crack)- The lumens on this gen 3 are 400 lumens vs the 200 on the original- How does Inforce compare to Surefire and Stream Light? Surefire is obviously the best quality, but the gen 3 is superior to Stream Light in construction, weight and ergonomics.So, if this pistol light is so good, why am I selling it? Plain and simple, I have two of these gen 3 lights; one for use on a G20 and another for use on a 1911 that I recently sold. Basically, I have the light I'm selling sitting here with no home.Thanks for checking out my ad and send me a note if you have any questions!"

It is custom built with an Anderson upper and 16"" barrel. It has been upgraded with aftermarket keymod rails and a Odin Works Nitrox bolt. A stock gas block and an Armalite tube are part of the original build. When I sighted it in for him I was shooting 1/2 MOA ag 100yards. I built this upper for a friend for deer hunting. He wanted a lightweight rifle capable of bringing a deer down at 400 yards. He used it for like a week. The barrel has less than 50 rounds through it. I'm selling it because I already have a 6.5 Grendel and I don't want to keep this one around. Alexander arms sells their stock uppers for over $800. I'm really trying to just get my money back for this thing. NOTE: there is one spot on the barrel where my friend used sandpaper to change out the gas block because the one he put on was sub-mil spec. I took it off but there is about and inch spot of unpainted metal on the barrel. I have taken this into account with how low the price is. This is really a great caliber for hunting and the upper is lightweight. There is almost no recoil and it is great for recoil-sensitive people. The ballistics on this round actually exceed the .308 at some ranges. Overall I'm just trying to get this gone and not lose much money.Will accept trades depeding on what they are. Im not looking for any handguns. Only rifles. Let me know what you got and Ill reply."
