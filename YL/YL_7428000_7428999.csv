My mistake is your gain.These list for $188.00 and they are on sale for $129.99 plus tax or shipping at Bass Pro and Walmart.I'm just trying to get some of my money back out by asking $110 or best offer.Here is a little about these rifles. They're pretty sweet shooters:The Gamo® Outback Maxxim™ Air Rifle uses an IGT (Inert Gas Technology) gas piston to launch pellets with a pneumatic cylinder instead of a spring powerplant. Gas piston pellet guns are smooth cocking, function in cold weather, and provide more consistent velocities with less vibration than metal spring powered guns. The Outback utilizes the extremely efficient and lightweight Whisper™ Maxxim noise reduction system that consists of a rifled steel barrel with an integrated sound moderator located inside the muzzle that effectively suppresses sound and reduces noise expansion. This air rifle comes with a 4x32mm scope, mounted to a RRR (Recoil Reducing Rail) specifically designed for high-powered air rifles to reduce recoil stress on the scope. The rail is constructed with 2 pieces of aluminum separated by dual polymer struts that absorb shockwaves, maintaining precise zero and prolonging the life of the scope. A premium synthetic all-weather stock with rubber inserts holds up to hard use, and provides a non-slip grip in increment weather. Gamo's The SWA™ (Shock Wave Absorber) recoil pad provides shooting comfort and helps reduce overall shock to the gun and sight. The Gamo Outback Maxxim propels a PBA pellet up to 1300 fps, making it a serious air rifle for hunting small game, pest control, and recreational shooting.*Break Barrel Air Rifle Whisper Maxxim noise-dampening technology *IGT (Inert Gas Technology) gas piston *Whisper Maxxim noise reduction*1300 fps using PBA Platinum *Premium all-weather stock with rubber inserts *Gamo 4x32 scope with Recoil Reducing Rail (RRR) *Smooth Action Trigger (SAT) **SWA Shock Wave Absorber recoil pad"

NO TRADES, CASH ONLY 
Gen 5 Upgrades:
New Finish: Feature the proprietary GLOCK nDLC finish. The ion-bonded finish reduces corrosion and scratching and improves performance in adverse or de-greased conditions.
New Barrel: Feature the GLOCK Marksman Barrel. The barrel’s new rifling and crown deliver improved accuracy for both the beginner and the seasoned gun owner.
No Finger Grooves: Gen5 have no finger grooves on the grip. Removing the finger grooves improves the ergonomics of the grip, delivering consistent comfort and improved control to a wider range of consumers, regardless of hand size.
Ambidextrous Slide Stop Lever: Ambidextrous slide stop levers. Now it is easier than ever for both left-handed and right-handed gun owners to quickly, comfortably, and safely manipulate the slide.
Flared Magwell: Feature a flared mag-well. The larger opening found in the mag-well of GLOCK Gen5 pistols makes quicker and easier magazine changes possible, particularly in high-stress situations where fractions of a second matter"

It comes complete like I bought it with the case, owner's manual, two magazines (16 round), lock etc. I have 4 extra magazines available for $25 each, if you guy the gun and 4 extra magazines (total 6 magazines) I'll take $25 off and you can have it all for $375.

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to Slide Fire more safely - offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere!
Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire - this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them.  Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly hold the firearm.  In addition, as a result of the shooter having to push forward to discharge each round, they are able to correct their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward in an unsafe direction.
In principal the SSAR-15 functions very similar to the Gatlin or crank style firearms.  When operating a firearm that uses a crank - the operator's arm moves in continous motion.  The operator moves the crank clockwise and a round is fired.   The operator continues to move the crank forward to discharge another round, and so on....  With the SSAR-15; the operator moves the upper assembly forward to discharge a round.  To discharge the next round the operator must again move the upper assembly forward.  Just like when using the Gatlin systems; a semi-auto firearm equipped with the SSAR-15 will never fire automatically.
Secondary to design, the SSAR-15 has opened other avenues for physically challenged sportsmen to operate their firearms without the need for bulky prohibitive equipment. Individuals that suffer from severe arthritis, partial paralysis, or other conditions that affect their ability to traditionally operate a firearm can now utilize the SSAR-15 and the muscular strength in their entire arm to active the firing mechanism.

These were used by the Austrians, Hungarians, and also by Nazi Germany. Primarily used during WW1, but also in a few different wars. This one is in veryd good condition, I would give the finish on the outside an 7/10, as it is a little worn. However, the bore is almost perfect, and there is NOT any rust anywhere on this rifle. This is a straight pull bolt action, designed by Mannlicher. These rifles/carbines were loved by everyone that used them, as they were much faster to operate than a traditional bolt action, they're light, and they're accurate. One original (Nazi marked) En-Bloc clip will come with it. I also have a few 10 round boxes on the En-Bloc clips that are Nazi Marked, and I would sell one if someone wanted it. Suprisingly enough, the original ammo manufactured in the 40s will still work. I also have an original bayonet manufactured in Vienna, Austria, if you are interested they are fairly rare in good condition, just ask for pics, I would do $125.00 OBO on the bayonet. These are amazing pieces of firearms history. I will require a bill of sale, and cash. CASH REQUIRED. I will NOT ship it, so please do not ask. I have plenty more pics of it if you want any more, just ask if you need more pics of it."
