1,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3291001,For Sale:  SWSA Glock dry fire trigger kit,"Hoover, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 50,"Listed On: Friday, July 18, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I would like to offer for sale a Southwest Shooting Authority Glock dry fire trigger kit. This is a very nice kit that duplicates the Glock trigger press, weight, and reset by using real Glock parts (trigger and trigger bar, trigger mechanism housing, and connector) that have been modified to support repeated dry fire without having to rack the slide. This particular kit is matched to the stock 5.5# trigger pull.

Kit is low round count (this was my backup kit) and in excellent condition. Comes with original box and installation instructions. Installation is straightforward and can be accomplished within a few minutes, in brief, just punch out the pins and replace the entire trigger group with the dry fire trigger group.

Fits all Glock gen3 or gen4 frames except 45ACP and 10mm.

Asking $50 cash FTF.

Perfect for those Glock shooters looking for a dry fire solution that will allow them to practice multiple trigger pulls with reset. Especially helpful when ammo supply is limited or when you can't find the time to go to the range! Don't miss the opportunity to pick this kit up, supply has been limited since SWSA has become the pro shop for SHOT Ranch, and price supposedly is going up by $10 whenever they become available again."

This brake keeps muzzle rise at an absolute minimum, and eliminates substantial muzzle blast associated with other brakes.

The .308 SJC Titan was designed and developed with USPSA Grand Master Eric Lund to provide a competitive advantage in 3-gun competition. It is legal for Limited, Tactical and Open Division rifles. 

This compensator will reduce your muzzle rise, giving you better control of your rifle. Gas vectoring technology maximizes recoil reduction and minimizes torque and shot to shot recovery time. The design traps expanding gasses in the baffles and increases dwell time for maximum efficiency possible, allowing faster follow up shots and transitions between targets.

Can be used on any .308, 5/8 x 24 threaded barrel. 
Comes with instructions and crush washer

Purchased new a few days ago. To loud for me. They are $100 + shipping new but I will take $75.

IT IS NEW IN THE ORIGINAL BOX WITH MATCHING #`S ON THE BOX and rifle.I had this in my collection and have reduced the price.This rifle was never shot. My collectibles I never put rounds thru . It has a milled receiver The Arsenal SAM7 utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, the underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it."

I bought it from a guy who had done some very light shaping on the underside of the trigger guard where it meets the grip-I guess because he had a large middle finger. He didn't tell me this before I bought it and it took me quite awhile to even notice. He did a good job and it's hardly noticeable, but I wanted to disclose it so it's not a surprise for anyone. I compared it to my g23 that has the exact same frame as the g19, and the change he made is very minor. You can't feel it when holding the gun either, and I seriously doubt whomever buys it would notice were I not to tell them, but I prefer being very straight forward. I'm just selling it because I didn't like shooting my g23 (FDE) so I thought I'd try the 9mm and now I've given up on both and am selling both to fund a 5.7

This thing is just too tacticool for me. I'm a humble man, I like humble things. AK's for example. A fine Jewish space gun like this jut isn't on my level. It's high speed/low drag, I'm low speed/high drag.
That being said, it's fun to shoot, but the layout takes a little getting used to if you aren't familiar with bullpups. Handles extremely well though. Sort of like having and SBR without the paperwork.
This is the ""IDF"" model, which means it came with a better set of BUIS's. The front one has a tritium insert. Also comes with a Mepro 21 mounted, like the IDF intended. Oh, and did I mention the Mepro also has a cozy little sock you can put on it when you aren't shooting turrists? WELL IT FREAKING DOES. FOR NO EXTRA CHARGE.
Couple mags, cleaning kit/tool pouch, box, papers, etc. Personally put about 200 rounds down the pipe. Don't know how many pieces of paper the former owner blasted, but it doesn't look like it's been rode hard. Looks pretty new, really.
I'd like to get $1900 cash or trade. Partial trades are fine."

It was more of an impulse buy 4 months ago, and I am now looking to recoup some cash for something higher capacity

I have a Taurus PT 1911 blued. This gun is 8+1 capacity and includes One magazine, box, all paperwork (Including reciept showing the day it was picked up if neccessary), and keys for the security system. Besides the after market recoil buffer I describe below, I am also including over 50 rounds of self defense hollow points (hornady and winchester, as well as one glaser round and 3 shotshells). For those of you who are familliar with this pistol, you know how good it is. If youre not, you can expect the very best level of construction and features that will surprise anyone who has ever thought of taurus as a second rate brand. Here's a small list of SOME of the features included:

Full length guide rod & reverse plug

Serrated slide rear and front

Checkered guard

lpi mainspring housing

lpi frontstrap

Ambidextrous safety

Beavertail grip safety with memory pad

Skeletonized target grade hammer

Skeleton serrated trigger

Trigger job

Custom fit barrel (air-gauged bushing)

Custom slide to frame fit

Polished feedramp and barrel throat

Lowered and flared ejection port

Custom internal extractor

Extended mag release button

Beveled mag well

Genuine Novak adjustable 3-dot sights

AFTERMARKET ADDITION:

Efk fire Dragon dual action frame saver recoil buffer.

The Frame-Saver Dual Action Recoil Springs offer these advantages:

Impact: The elimination of the slide impacting the frame at high speed preserves the structure of the firearm

Muzzle Control: By changing the final backward movement of the slide from a sudden stop to a progressive stop, muzzle jump is greatly decreased by 40% giving you more control.

Function: No interference of ejection port or any feeding problems.

Progressive: This is a system designed to reduced the backward motion of the slide in progressive stages after the gun is shot. The effect of this system is that the recoil is reduced by 40% making your follow up shots much easier to shoot. This is a VERY effective system.

Stability: Better stability for your barrel. Stainless steel guide rod replaces plastic or inferior metal guide rods for superior barrel support and function.

Better Accuracy: Progressively slows down your slide from heavy impact against the frame. Works just like a car shock absorber, reducing the slide impact. Lower impact means less recoil, accurate recovery of the weapon for on-target accuracy is better achieved, shot after shot.

Lower Frame Shock: The slide is one of the heaviest components in a semi-automatic pistol. Upon firing, the slide slams back with great energy against the frame. Frame Saver Dual Actions springs can lower this slide impact dramatically, preventing excessive wear, cracked slides and damaged frames.

My asking price is $565 firm. Thats over 80 dollars under my cost for a package that has only 75ish rounds through it, so I wont take any less. It is a fair price. Thanks for looking! Pickup in north lakeland only"

This standard model allows for fast, easy conversion and works with most railed pistols, equipped with a QD sling mount.

Fabricated from solid aircraft-grade aluminum, the ACP sports M1913 rails at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock
positions with a full-length top rail at the 12 o’clock position. Compatible accessories such as lights, red
dot sights and lasers can be mounted for additional functionality.

The ACP brings Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) features to almost any handgun.

Some might mistake it for an EAA Wittness, Springfield P9, or even think it's a CZ75, and for good reason. Read Why,
------------------------------
About the Handgun:
In the 1990's the CZ75 was rapidly being undestood as one of the best combat handguns of the 20th century. Since they were made in Czech ""Behind the Iron Curtain"" Springfield came up with an idea to get them into the US Market. Since Italy's Tangfolio made a nearly ""Perfect"" Clone, Springfield started to import them under thier own label from Italy around 1990 as the P9. The Springfield P9's were rapidly turned into IPSC ""Raceguns"" gaining in popularity and value. Once EAA became fully vested in the US Markets with the ""Witness"" also made by Tangfolio, Springfield decided to pull the plug on this fine pistol in 1993.

Armscor signed a manufacturing agreement with Tanfoglio Arms of Italy to exclusively sell this pistol using the Armscor brand to its worldwide sales network.
A result of this agreement is the MAP1 pistol Assempled by Amscor in the Philippines and marketed in the US through Rock Island Armory. These Pistols use the, Reliably Proven, Browning Short Recoil Action.
-------------------------------
Now that you know a little about the history, my MAP1-FS, features a 4.45"" Barrel Length, Stainless Steel - Chrome Lined Barrel, Snag Free Combat Style white-3 dot sights, Nickel Steel Alloy Frame, Black Rubber Grips, 2-16 Round Magazines, Hammer Fired - DA / SA with a Frame Mouted Abidexreus Safety, Dual Slide Cocking Serrations, Front and Rear Grip Serrations, and Durable Parkerized Finish. This is not a light weight handgun so, if you like the feel of a 1911, you will like this gun. It is an all steel gun and shoots well with little felt recoil. 
--------------------------
I value this gun at $550.00 - this is not the ""New Style"" Polymer Frame version but All Steel Quality.

Ended up on the back burner so i figure id see what i can get for it instead of it sitting for another year. 

Has around 30k on the motor and is still together. Has the stock carb. Frame is clean and straight but could use a new paint job. All the tins are painted w/ house of color rootbeer brown. It has a mustang seat on it and some aftermarket handlebars/ controls and low profile blinkers. Also has forward controls.

It needs a new chain, brake shoes for the rear drum, wiring and new points (optional). 

Everything ran well on this bike before I took the motor out. Realistically if you have a good idea of what youre doing it should be a 2 weekend job. I just dont have time for it at the moment. I dont mind sitting on it until I find time though so no lowball offers. Lookin to trade for a couple guns. Semiautos mainly. ARs (308or556) AKs, M1A, Glocks, M&P, HK, Sigs, etc. Ive got 4k into this bike but i understand its apart so i dont expect 4k worth of firearms. i do expect realistic offers however. call anytime REDACTED."

Overall the boat is in good condition. Last year I completely gutted the entire interior and re-did everything. New decking, carpet, storage and livewells. It has got a fish finder mounted up front as well and a Minnekota trolling motor. Everything works besides the engine not running right now (it was running perfectly until the first trip out this spring and when I opened it up it just bogged down. Took it in and they said the impeller needed replace so I had them replace that I was then told the motor was starting/cranking slowly which meant sopmething wron with the cylinder.. I did not want to invest anymore money into it so I left it at that. Could be something you fix easily or migt need the motor replaced. The motor is a 1992 150HP Force. It still has a lot fo good parts including the entire lower unit.) Anyways if this is something you may be interested in please let me know and I can either get more details/pictures or answer any questions you have! I am interested in trading for firearms or selling. Will take partial trades as well. If I were to put $500 into getting anoher used motor this thing would be worth $3000 or so. It is an awesome boat to fish from."

A nice Gen 2 gun. These are getting harder to find. 
Some holster wear, see pics. It is not brand new, but is a solid piece. It IS a Glock.
Make me an offer. Looking to see what is out there. Would like to trade for a 1911. Interested in most autoloader pistols. Particularly in .40 S&W.  Maybe a wheelgun. Canoe? Kayak? Depending on trade, boot could go either way. 
I also have AR15 parts to sweeten the right deal. I have a 16"" upper in .223 Wylde I could throw in for the right deal. It needs a gas block and tube. Has Complete upper receiver, Barrel, BCG, and carbine free float. More pics on request.
Make me an offer. Could go two pistol trade for the Glock and upper even if not a 1911. I'm easy like Sunday morning. Just make an offer. I will respond yes or no. Easy peasy.

Emails are fine, or Text 859-327O6O6 if you would rather.

The smaller magazine has a pinky-finger extension on it, and I still have the original/flush base.  They're easy to swap out.

Will include a Streamlight TLR-4 rail-mount laser/light.  It's easy to use.  Sighting in the laser and changing the battery are easy - I'll show you how if you remind me.

Will come with a leather Blackhawk belt holster (right-handed).  It has a few scuffs on it, but is still in good shape.

Will throw in a box of practice ammo and the Hornady Critical Defense that's already in the magazines.

Equipped with the larger magazine and the laser, this is a good home defense/bedside gun.  Using the shorter magazine and removing the laser, it's a good carry piece.

I'm looking for a gun that'll be easier to carry in my pocket.  Specifically interested in a Ruger LCR .357 with Crimson Trace grips.

Overview  Tech Specs  Ratings & Reviews
All The Features That Hunters Expect

The new PROSTAFF 5 3.5-14x40 features the lines mid-level magnification and several technology upgrades that will satisfy even the most demanding hunters.   A bright new optical system, remarkable hand-turn reticle adjustments with Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset turrets, and a convenient quick-focus eyepiece with a 4x zoom ratio, making adjustments while in a shooting position a breeze. The PROSTAFF 5 3.5-14x40 outfitted with the BDC reticle is an ideal fit for a variety of hunting situations and can be used with Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology to take the guesswork out of compensating for bullet drop.  With enough power for the longest-range shots and a wide field of view to keep you on target even when shooting through thick brush and timber, this is one scope you can truly count on in any situation.  In addition all PROSTAFF 5 riflescopes are built with fully multicoated optics for maximum light transmission, even in extreme low light environments.
      Patented BDC Reticle
The BDC's unique see-through ballistic circles offer an incredible advantage for long range shooting, yet allow a normal sight picture for shorter-range shots where the crosshair itself is the aiming point.  The various aiming points built into the BDC reticle allows hunters to hold 'dead-on' at ranges exceeding those previously thought possible and can be utilized with Nikon’s Spot On Ballistic Match Technology to give you exact aiming points at various yardages.  Finally, you can take the guesswork out of figuring elevation and bullet drop compensation.
         Fully Multicoated Optical System
Multiple layers of anti-reflective compounds on every glass surface provide bright and vivid sight pictures and optimum light transmission and maximum brightness from dawn to dusk.
         Hand-turn 1/4 MOA Adjustments
Reticle adjustments are made in 1/4 MOA click-stop moves you can both feel and hear, and with no backlash to make your shot creep off target. Positive click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting—even with repeated recoil and under rugged conditions.
           Spring-Loaded Instant Zero-Reset Turrets
To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated this feature into all new PROSTAFF 5 riflescopes. Just sight-in as usual, then lift the spring-loaded adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and reengage. Field adjustments are now as simple as dialing-in your subsequent ranges.
        Spot On Ballistic Match Technology
Custom precision at your fingertips

The PROSTAFF 5 series, like all of Nikon’s riflescopes, are optimized for use with Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology. Spot On allows you to discover all of the exact aiming points on your scope’s reticle at various yardages for your specific ammunition and load."

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?

The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.

The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

Here is a Romanian contract Model 1934 Beretta military pistol assembled in 1941, as indicated by the markings on the left side of the slide, and with two original WWII Beretta magazines. The back of the right side of the frame displays Romanian armory mark, ""CM"". 
NO import markings!
CONDITION: Excellent, with 97-98% of original blue still on the metal. All matching serial numbers (frame, slide, barrel). Fine bore with strong and shiny rifling. Very smooth action. Difficult to find pistol without the import marks! Caliber: 9 mm Short (.380 ACP, marked on barrel). Two WWII Beretta magazines with thin metal floor plates and no other markings, both in like new condition (as is the pistol!).

This Beretta model 1934 pistol offered here was manufactured for the Romanian military in 1941. In August of 1940, the Romanian military placed a contract with Beretta for 61,000 model 1934 pistols. This contract specified that the pistols were to be delivered within seven months. The first of these pistols was not delivered until February of 1941 due to the shortage of steel and Romania's failure to send Beretta the entire fund amount for the pistols. Beginning in February of 1941, Beretta delivered 10,000 pistols with the promise of 5,000 more per month until the total contract was filled. By August of 1941, Beretta had sent a total of 40,000 pistols, but the remaining 21,000 were never delivered. This means that there are less then 40,000 of these pistols in existence today. The first of these Romanian contract pistols can be identified with a 0(zero) at the beginning of the 5 digit serial number. The Romanian contract pistols are identical to the Italian model 1934 versions except that the slide is marked 9 SCURT instead of 9mm Corto as seen in the pictures below. These Romanian model 1934 pistols were normally issued to the Romanian officers 
during WW2.

READ ON PLEASE!!!,"Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado","$ 1,000,000","Listed On: Friday, July 18, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"I got scammed by a guy who said his name was Mark Lerner.  He said his address was in Round Lake IL which checked out.  I had a WTB ad which is still up and he responded with what I needed.  He said he had what I wanted and proceeded to give me a good deal.  He said to Moneygram the money to his address in IL.  I told him from the beginning that I was weary and didn't wanna get burnt.  He re assured me and sounded like he'd sold stuff this way before.  I ended up trusting him and sent him the money.  Two days later he said he was shipping what I had purchased.  He emailed me a Fedex shipping order that looked real and had departure and arrival of package times on it.  It did not have a tracking order however.  I called Fedex and they had no history of a package being shipped from his address or one on route to mine.  I called contacted him and he said he'd call Fedex.  He re contacted me and explained that the ""ATF had my package"" and that ""my package was almost there"".  He then told me that before my package would arrive I had to pay the ATF ""safe shipping fees"" and to send him another Moneygram of $150.00.  Ummm... Fuck... You?  So he was persistent in trying to convince me and he played the ""honesty"" card well but in the end I obviously didn't send him any more money.  I'm just lucky it wasn't a $1800.00 rifle set up!!

Gun also has a rubber recoil pad to help tame the recoil a bit. This gun has been professionally converted and shoots everything from slugs to cheapo bulk pack without a hiccup. The muzzle device is a Winchoke adapter so you can add different chokes depending on what you are shooting. Gun comes with the following mags: 1 original izzy 5 rounder, 3 keep shooting 5 rounders, 1 10 round SGM stick, 1 12 round stick, 1 10 round pro mag drum and 1 MD Arms 20 round drum with both a clear back and black back cover. What I want in trade is an M1A Socom, a Tavor or maybe even a high end 308 bolt gun like a 16.5 or 20 inch Remington 700 that is all decked out with a quality optic and Timney trigger. Yes, I do know these have been banned as of Wednesday from further importation thanks to the sanctions placed against Kalashnikov Concerns. I don't really wish to sell outright as most here will definitely not like the price, but if you have a ridiculous cash offer, I will listen. Thanks."

Paid $230 for it about 8 months ago and they are still that price from Kidd ($180 for barrel + $50 for threading and cap). I have shot about 300 rounds through this thing - AMAZING accuracy...! If you have never experienced anything from Tony Kidd (www.coolguyguns.com) the quality will blow you away. The accuracy is just flat out incredible, and the quality of the machining and tolerances are incredible - for example you can't see where the threaded barrel cap mates up to the barrel... and this thing fits your receiver like a glove... See pictures... I will pay for shipping once your cashier's check clears my bank. Email me for any questions....! I will likely be slow to reply except M-F... Thanks...!"
