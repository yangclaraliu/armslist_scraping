Has the gen3 trigger pack these are not the gen 4 triggers with after market parts to make a gen 3 as seen online this is the real deal all genuine fn parts.

I’m not interested in trades unless you’ve got a very nice S&W 686 Plus with 6 inch barrel or a nice Ruger American Rimfire Compact rifle. 
I can provide more pictures on request.  Feel free to ask questions.I WILL NOT ship this.  I can meet within reasonable distance (Topeka, Ottawa) as my schedule is pretty tight."

Bought this for my wife, but after shooting several rounds through it it became clear that she needed a smaller caliber, at least for now. So we got her a .380. This gun has only had probably 25 rounds put through it, so it's pretty much brand new!Will transfer ownership through a FFL with a background check. The transfer fee ($35) will just come out of the price you pay for the gun, so it won't cost you extra.Text Jordan at 618 - 26Seven - Nine19Zero for more information."

Comes with the Ruger factory gray colored case in as new condition with the manual, the lock, warranty card and other accessories. This big bore wheel gun has a nice deep dark blued finish that is nearly flawless with only a very slight turn line. Features a 4 3/4 inch Barrel and has the OEM Grips/Stocks. It's a good ""do everything"" gun (Camping, Hunting, Target Shooting and even self defense ). I'm Located in Newland ( Avery County ) but I travel the general area for business (Boone, Banner Elk, Spruce Pine, Morganton etc.. even down towards Hickory and out toward Asheville at times) and I am willing to meet in a mutually convenient location. NC residents need Purchase or Carry Permit and for those out of state,  I would be more than happy to ship to your FFL for the price in addition to the actual Shipping costs. It really is a good wheelgun, I hope it finds a good home! At only $500 for a near new American made big bore revolver this would be a sweet deal for anyone. Shoot me a message, your phone number gets mine in return, I'd be glad to speak with you.

I was told this was issued to a Police Department, specifically for the Department of Defraudations and Counterfeits (DDF), and likely in Brazil or the Phillipines somewehre, but could have been issued anywhere in South America, and this was done in mid 1950's.  The Serial number is 275, stamped into the frame in 2 locations and under each grip panel, so these are the original grips and match the gun serial number!This handgun was modeled after the S&W Military and Police model 10 and feels great.

The lightest AR-10 you've likely ever seen. 8.8 pounds with 25 round LOADED PMAG. 

I'm interested in selling this and not Trading it.. 


Sorry this is so long, just a huge parts list.

The upper was built by Christensen Arms - not a garage build. Headspaced by them and shooting 1/2 MOA. 

- Christensen Arms CA-10 Carbon Fiber 20"" barrel - weighs only 2.5 pounds. Retails $600
- Aero Precision M5 Upper receiver with Strike Industries lightweight port door $175
- Aero Precision M5 Handguard $255 (no longer sold separately) 
- POF Ultimate 308 BCG (one piece carrier instead of staked with screws) $325
- Syrac .936 Adjustable gas block and rifle length gas tube $100
- no flash hider, I was using a suppressor on this build, but it's gas adjusted now for no suppressor. 

That's $1,435 JUST in the upper. 

The lower is a lightweight TAC polymer lower (see their torture tests, oven baked, frozen, driven over in a truck, no warping, no cracking, functions perfectly) $100 

DPMS AR-10 LPK with proper extended Bolt Hold Open and mag release for this size lower $75, contoured pistol grip for precision shooting $25, an ALG ACT Nickel Boron trigger (about the best single stage out there again for precision shooting with a clean break and light pull) $70, and a Mission First Tactical adjustable lightweight Carbine stock with proper AR-10 carbine spring and buffer $100, plus one 25 round windowed 308 PMAG $30. 

That's $400 in the lower not including TICS and ALL prices above don't include shipping (probably another $100 all said and done). 

Christensen Arms sells their CA-10 20"" DMR (Designated Marksman Rifles) for $3,800 PLUS shipping, and they're out of stock. You get the same rifle on a lightweight lower and at less than HALF the price, asking the $1,635 I have in it and I will include shipping on my dime to your FFL or local pickup."

Sorry this is so long, just a huge parts list.The upper was built by Christensen Arms - not a garage build. Headspaced by them and shooting 1/2 MOA. - Christensen Arms CA-10 Carbon Fiber 20"" barrel - weighs only 2.5 pounds. Retails $600- Aero Precision M5 Upper receiver with Strike Industries lightweight port door $175- Aero Precision M5 Handguard $255 (no longer sold separately) - POF Ultimate 308 BCG (one piece carrier instead of staked with screws) $325- Syrac .936 Adjustable gas block and rifle length gas tube $100- no flash hider, I was using a suppressor on this build, but it's gas adjusted now for no suppressor. That's $1,435 JUST in the upper. The lower is a lightweight TAC polymer lower (see their torture tests, oven baked, frozen, driven over in a truck, no warping, no cracking, functions perfectly) $100 DPMS AR-10 LPK with proper extended Bolt Hold Open and mag release for this size lower $75, contoured pistol grip for precision shooting $25, an ALG ACT Nickel Boron trigger (about the best single stage out there again for precision shooting with a clean break and light pull) $70, and a Mission First Tactical adjustable lightweight Carbine stock with proper AR-10 carbine spring and buffer $100, plus one 25 round windowed 308 PMAG $30. That's $400 in the lower not including TICS and ALL prices above don't include shipping (probably another $100 all said and done). Christensen Arms sells their CA-10 20"" DMR (Designated Marksman Rifles) for $3,800 PLUS shipping, and they're out of stock. You get the same rifle on a lightweight lower and at less than HALF the price, asking the $1,635 I have in it and I will include shipping on my dime to your FFL or local pickup."
