538,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7803538,For Sale:  Complete Custom Gen 3 Glock 17 frame,"Downtown/Homewood/Trussville, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 200,"Listed On: Monday, January 8, 2018",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a highly customized Gen 3 Glock 17 frame. It is ready to go, just needs a top end and a magazine! 
Here are a breakdown of the customizations1.) Glock ""hump"" reduction
This process removes the extreme ""hump"" that is most often the point of complaint with Glock handguns. If you prefer the point-ability of a 1911 grip angle but the mechanical platform of a Glock, you will LOVE this frame. Many users find that Glocks tend to point up on a draw because of the angle created by the hump. That issue has been solved on this frame.
2.) Recessed Borders Stipple job
This is the newest evolution in grip modification. It is a time consuming and delicate process, but the results are far more impressive than the standard ""melted dot"" stipple job most are used to seeing. This particular stipple job uses a combination of two stipple-specific tip patterns (OTD X-tip and Wagon Wheel) that creates a uniform-but-random pattern while maintaining a clean, sharp edge around the borders. This texture is aggressive enough to prevent slippage when hands are sweaty or in raining conditions without being at all uncomfortable in the hand. It feels great, and looks great, too.
3.) Finger Groove Removal
This is another major complaint with Gen 3 Glocks as many people find the finger grooves do not line up with their fingers in a tight grip. I have taken off the bottom two grooves to allow the end user to place their fingers wherever they naturally fall, utilizing the superior texture for grip rather than the shape of the frame. I have left the top-half of the 1st finger groove in place (explained below)
4.) Polished half finger groove
As mentioned above, I left the top-half of the 1st finger groove in place but I have polished it to a smooth finish. Coupled with the double undercut (explained below) this allows for a high, comfortable and locked-in grip, helping to prevent muzzle rise and grip slip when firing.
5.) Double undercut
The double undercut removes material from underneath the trigger guard in the two places where your firing-hand middle finger and your off-hand pointer finger make contact with the frame. This allows the user to get a higher grip on the frame in relation to the bore axis, helping to control muzzle rise/recoil when firing. The entire section has been polished smooth for comfort. If you've never held a Glock with a double undercut incorporating the polished half-finger groove, you need to. It changes everything!
6.) Trigger guard de-horn
This customization is primarily aesthetic, tying in the lines created with the undercut and half-finger groove with the rest of the frame. It does have some practical application as it makes the gun less likely to snag on clothing or gear upon reholstering.
7.) Accelerator cuts
This customization removes material forward of the take-down lever, moving upward at a 45-degree angle. This accomplishes three distinctly different improvements. Firstly, it makes getting a grip on the take-down lever easier, aiding in the breakdown of the weapon for maintenance. Secondly, it creates a ledge where the shooter's off-hand thumb can create downward leverage with a ""thumbs forward"" grip, reducing muzzle flip. On the shooting-hand side, it provides a tactile ledge for the shooter's trigger finger to rest while not firing in the ""straight-and-off-the-trigger"" position.
8.) Eliminated Lanyard Hole
Another complaint about Gen 3 Glocks is the lanyard hole that no one uses. I have filled this in on the frame to clean up the look.
9.) Polished slide lock/release
 This customization is also aesthetic, tying the color of the lock/release with the LoneWolf Ultimate Adjustable Trigger kit (explained below).
10.) LoneWolf Distributing Ultimate Adjustable Trigger Kit
 This fully adjustable trigger features a 6061 Billet Aluminum shoe, smooth, symmetrical shape with large radiused edges, in-gun adjustability (no need to remove to adjust pre and over travel), 2 piece design allow easy trigger bar swap, finer adjustments compared to other adjustable trigger kits, over-sized safety spring allows more comfort to the shooters finger, safety lever is flush to the shoe for more comfort, no press out pins like the competition, one screw assembly, and tighter tolerances to lessen wobble between shoe and trigger bar. It is a great trigger and has been pre-adjusted for the best balance between pretravel and overtravel.
 
This frame would be perfect to start a custom build using a built/purchased slide assembly or to take your current Gen 3 G17 to the next level!

I don't mind shipping to your FFL if you cover fees/shipping chargesI have included two pictures of the frame with a slide installed so you can see what a completed project might look like with a stock slide assembly and a fully custom job. (Only the completed frame is for sale)"

Note the picture where the cross-bolt safety has been trimmed to not protrude when disengaged.  This was to assure it didn't accidentally get set while shooting.  Still works fine.

This is a first generation Remington R-25.  Very similar to the AR-10 and uses the same mags.  This rifle has maybe had one magazine fired through it.  Comes with the manual, a Leupold VX-1 4-12X40 scope that is also nearly new and includes the manual for that as well, a Harris bipod, the factory 10-round magazine and three Magpul Promag 20-round magazines (two still in the plastic), a laser bore site tool, empty chamber flag, and a Plano Protector rifle case.
Mossy Oak is the standard for these.  20” fluted barrel standard.
$800 or offer.  Buyer pays transfer in Renton or Hobart.  FACE TO FACE ONLY!! I am getting a LOT of ""offers"" to buy involving over-amount checks and shipments out of state.  Really?  Do you guys not realize how fraudulent you come off?  By the way, when you present someone's FFL without their knowledge or approval, you are going to draw attention from ATF.

Also included is the AK47 MF Mount, Aimpoint Micro T1/H1, MKII. Both items retail for $215 plus shipping. Selling for $140 This information is from the DI site:
AK-47 Modular Forearm Assembly MkIII:
Note: Only fits standard length AK-47 & AK-74 operating systems with stamped or milled receivers. This model does not fit Yugoslavian or Draco model AK's and does not support .308 or shotgun caliber (variants coming soon). There have been reports of this not fitting the Century C39 - customers have informed us that its gas tube does not conform to a standard length. We have also received reports that this isn't fitting the M&M M10. We do NOT recommend modifying our forearm assembly in any way.
AK handguard retaining plates vary greatly in size and shape. Please ensure that it does not impede seating the gas tube rail during installation.
Easy installation! Simply replaces standard handguard & gas tube. Instructions & hardware included.
This new and Innovative proprietary design does not mount to the barrel and provides a solid mounting platform for optics and accessories as rugged as the AK-47 itself. Features a beveled front gas tube, new relief cut design, and all mounting hardware use the same diameter hex wrench.
Made in USA using advanced precision manufacturing with Mil-A-8625 Hardcoat Anodized protective finish. Constructed of high-strength aluminum with aerospace alloy gas block insert and heavy duty M4 metric thread fasteners.
Adds only 4-6 ounces to weapon depending on type of forearm & gas tube replaced. Optional accessories excluded from weight. Swivel available separately.
Includes:
2 detachable side-mounting Mil-Std 1913 Rails (1 non-QD & 1 QD) which can be mounted in various positions on either side of the forearm.
Mounting hardware. (Don't panic. We drop stuff, too. We include extra fasteners.)
Loc-tite.
AK47 MF Mount, Aimpoint Micro T1/H1, MKII:
Co-witness your AK-47 with an Aimpoint Micro T-1 using our AK-47 Modular Forearm Assembly.
Precision machined from 6061 T6 Aluminum alloy with Mil-A-8625 Type III Class 2 Hardcoat Anodized finish.
Available for our MkII & MkIII AK-47 Modular Forearm Assemblies. View the photo gallery if you are unsure of which version you have - the Mk II has angular relief cuts along the lower handguard, Mk III has oval relief cuts along the lower handguard.
