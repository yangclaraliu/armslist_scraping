This rifle is chambered for the .22lr and is a clone of the famous STG-44 (Sturmgewehr 44) made by Germany during WWII. This rifle features a 16.5 inch barrel with a hooded front sight post, as well as a windage and elevation adjustable rear sight. The rifle is recoil operated and has the same ergonomics and controls as its 8mm counterpart. The wood buttstock and grip, along with the metal construction give this rifle the look, feel, and weight of the original. The safety operates as it should and the action is smooth and crisp. This rifle is fed by a detachable magazine with a 25 round capacity. Once the last round is fired, the bolt will stay open and the charging handle operates similar to that of an HK MP5 or G3 rifle. Rifle comes shipped in a wooden crate (Pine), to finish off it's classic look and feel. Rifle comes new with crate, operator's manual, cable lock, and one(1) 25-round magazine. If you are looking for an STG-44 to finish off your WWII collection, but cannot find a real one, or are looking for a .22 target rifle that sets itself apart from the others at the range, then this is the deal for you! Retails for $599 am selling for $150 less.  Face to face sale only, will not ship."

My new department supplied me with one, so I don't need one just collecting dust. 

I have a like new Second Chance Soft Body Armor. Comes with a carrier and everything needed to strap it on. These are good for five years (per warranty). That's if you wear them daily. You can research this more, but body sweat will eventually break down the material. I used this for on duty for six months, and that's it. The armor is rated Level 2. Was bought NEW from Lawmens in Raleigh NC one year ago in June. 

Size would be about an x-large. I am now a large, but the vest still fit comfortably, it just overlapped on the sides a little more. Also, I'm about 5'9"" and it covers everything down to my belly button. Any longer than that and it starts choking you when you sit down.

This rifle is an all blued gun.  I have a bi pod on it attached to the front sling stud.  This bi pod allows for sling attachment to the bi pod itself.  
This rifle also came with a very low end Bushnell scope.  I took that off and put on a Bushnell elite series scope which is a huge jump up in quality.  The scope is a 3-9x40 and has the factory  lense covers.
This rifle is fed with a detachable  box magazine that fits flush with the black synthetic stock.  

The one time I took the rifle to the range to sight it in I was achieving 1.5 moa accuracy.  Obviously the rifle isn't even fully broken in yet. 

This rifle shows absolutely zero signs of wear as it has been well taken care of.  It has been oiled regularly.  It has sat in my safe in a gun sock.  I am just tired of not having to me to shoot this gun.

Destined to become the standard that all 1911 pistols are compared against, the Taurus 1911 offers you the most accurate and feature-laden model on the market today. Starting with our own hammer-forged -not cast- ordnance grade steel frames, slides and barrels, we machine each and every part to tolerance levels that surpass even today's industry standards. Our skilled pistol smiths hand-fit and tune each gun with the 19 standard features seen below, using quality parts that are built 100% in our state-of-the-art factory. Then they mark the slide, barrel and frame with matching serial numbers. Available in the powerful .45 ACP, this aggressive, rock-solid firearm is ready to go right out of the box. The Taurus 1911 is an unbeatable gun that is also an unbeatable value.

Taurus Security System (TSS)s Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" model.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.

Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.

With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).

The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.

A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.

Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines.

A limited edition P2000 German Police Model features a ""closed"" accessory mounting rail system and a tapered trigger guard.

The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" model.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.

Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.

With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).

The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.

A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.

Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines.

A limited edition P2000 German Police Model features a ""closed"" accessory mounting rail system and a tapered trigger guard.

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice. 
Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

I understand we don't want to lose money when we sell or trade but sometimes when you have something you don't need any more you might have to take a loss. its hard but like I said...lets be realistic. no one is going to pay $1000 for an ar15 when you can buy a new one at dicks for $800. or a glock for $600 when a brand new one is less than $500. I just priced a brand new sig sauer p229 at haw river outdoor for I think $779. so no one is going to pay $800 for one. and 22 ammo....damn....some of the people on here are just down right ridiculous in what they are selling it for. im sorry but $75 for a brick of 525 count is too much. now if were trying to trade that kindof opens a different door altogether. but if your selling, please be realistic...thanks for reading and im certainly not trying to piss anyone off but just making a valid point. protect yourself and your family and abide by the laws. second amendment is so important to us all. God bless everyone"

I have one Tactical Tailor Multicam Vest the entire set up including plates would be $300 otherwise if you want just the vest it is $100
I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00
