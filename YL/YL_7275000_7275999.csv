If you are an older shooter, you may recognize the PPK as the gun made famous by James Bond in books and movies. This pistol, made in the mid-90's, is the much more desireable and collectible version imported for decades by Interarms, not the current production made by Smith and Wesson. This is also the scarce PPK model, NOT the PPK/S which is much more common and is a larger pistol. The PPK design dates from about 1929, with the PPK being placed in service in 1935. It was the first commercially successful double action autopistol, and is a ""must have"" for any pistol collector. It also makes a fine concealed carry firearm as well.
This pistol can be seen and purchased by appointment at my office just outside of Homestead. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I will entertain best offers, or full/partial trades for other firearms of equivalent quality. All laws will be complied with in this sale. Thanks for looking at my listing.Note - Due to the collectible nature of this firearm, I will consider shipping it to your FFL. However, since the vast majority of people who request shipping on Armslist are scammers, expect me to be suspicious until I know exactly who you are. If you are not willing to give me full information including a phone number so that we can talk, and provide me with an FFL I can contact who knows who you are, please don't waste my time asking me to ship this gun to you."

This pistol left the factory in February of 2017, and has had less than 50 rounds fired through it for test fire purposes. This pistol is equally at home on the range as a fun gun or competition tool, or as a high capacity home defense weapon. Its light weight would also allow it to be carried concealed, but it is a full-sized handgun. The XDM 5.25 features a 5.25 inch barrel (hence the name), a factory lightened slide for faster cycling, a  fiber optic front sight with adjustable rear sight, a match grade barrel and trigger, and a 19+1 round capacity. That's right, fully loaded this pistol holds 20 rounds of 9mm! The pistol features a 1913 Picatinny rail for mounting of lights, lasers, or other accessories. It also features interchangeable backstraps so that you can precisely fit the pistol to your hand.This pistol comes with the box, papers, all backstraps, sight adjustment tools, replacement colored fiber optic inserts (red and green), and best of all, a total of SEVEN 19 round stainless steel factory magazines (they cost $25 each). They are shown in the picture (one is in the gun). NOT shown in the pictures, but included in the deal is a professional grade right hand Kydex belt holster that was made specially to carry this gun with or without a TLR-1 light on it(not included).This package is everything you need to go to the range, except ammo, and if you buy the gun from me, I'll even give you a box of range ammo to get you started.
I will listen to best offers (cash always speaks loudest) or ideas for full or partial trades on equivalent quality firearms. At the moment, I'm mostly looking for good 1911s and classic revolvers, or top quality defense pistols, so if you have something to trade, let me hear about it. You can see this package by appointment only at my office just outside of Homestead. NOTE: I am disabled and have difficulty taveling, so if you want to look at or buy the gun, it has to be done here. Please don't ask me to meet you in a parking lot somewhere. If Homestead is too far for you to come, give this listing a pass. Thanks for your understanding. If you prefer, Iwill ship the gun to your FFL once I have verified they know you and are expecting the gun. The cost for this service is $35.00. All laws complied with in this sale. Thanks for looking at my listing."

This is definitely the most powerful 1911 out there. The fact that there are so few makes it almost certain to be a collectors piece. Thanks for looking!colt, sig, kimber, 45, 10mm, 9mm, glock"
