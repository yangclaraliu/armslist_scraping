I typically prefer face to face transfers only, but given the special nature of this rifle I am willing to ship the rifle to an out of state ffl.  I do not have an ffl, but will provide copy of my DL/CWP to a dealer accepting the shipment.  Shipping cost will be on the buyer, and I will need either postal money order or electronic payment before sending.  I am open to trades/offers.  Call or text 4O6 781 63OO"

The frame and slide both have the commercial S stamp. The barrel is a generic replacement that in near new. It has had 250 rounds fired since new. Cleaned and put away. The grips are excellent reproduction from the Vintage 1911 site. The pistol has been reblued but the edges are fine and the markings are very clear and readable. The front grip has been stippled which gives the gun a very positive hold. It shoots nice and is as accurate as any old .45. There are some nice old parts on this pistol. The magazine is from a 1951 Colt government Model. Full Disclosure: The dust cover on the frame end has been repaired by welding or brazing. I'm not sure why this was done. It was done a LONG time ago in Arizona. Anyway, as the pictures show, I put black magic marker on the bare metal to reduce the glare. It worked but the bare metal can be blued. Also, they left the matal humped up and I believe it can be filed down to match the correct look. The welds are very solid and won't break under normal loads (230 grain ball ammo). I've had this gun for years because I was always going to have it restored, but I'm ready to move it on to someone else. $600.00 SHIPPED USPS to an 01 FFL or better. THIS IS C&R ELIGIBLE.

The UHP15PDW Lower receiver features the Integration of a Patent Pending Monolithic adjustable PDW type stock system. The UHP15PDW lower also includes the Ambi Bolt release & Ambi Mag Release Lever similiar to the UHP15A lower receiver. The Ambi Mag release Lever is designed to work in conjunction with the Standard Mil-Spec Mag catch arm without the requirement of proprietary components for proper function. This mag release lever design provides the user field repair options of the mag catch typically not found with most ambi mag release systems that utilize proprietary mag catch arms. The Ambi Mag Release features a raised fence on 3 sides to protect the mag release from accidental actuation during weapon use. The Bolt release Lever & Mag Release Lever feature aggressive Texturing to ensure proper finger placement & grip during actuation. The ambi bolt release, ambi mag release & buttstock adjustment rods are Black Nitrided for corrosion protection. The Integration of the stock rod system with the lower receiver creates a stonger continuous PDW platform & also allows for the addition of a cheek weld that extends with the buttstock not currently found with bolt on PDW stocks due to the bolt on housing design that extends rearward over the buffertube.
